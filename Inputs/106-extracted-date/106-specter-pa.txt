    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to summarize for my colleagues, and for the public, the activities and accomplishments of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs during the 106th Congress. I am pleased to report, as chairman of the committee, that this Congress has been one of significant accomplishment. 
   When this Congress convened, it was determined that three veterans' priorities needed to be met. We had to increase the availability of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-provided health care services, particularly long-term care services, to World War II veterans. We had to improve educational assistance benefits--so-called Montgomery GI bill or MGIB benefits--made available by VA to veterans, principally young veterans, newly released from service. And we had to address and rectify vestigial elements of discrimination against women contained in veterans' statutes. With the assistance of the committee's ranking minority member, Senator John D. (``Jay'') Rockefeller IV, and in bipartisan partnership with all of the committee's members, we have achieved all three of these goals--and more. 
   First, with the enactment of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999, Public Law 106-117 (Millennium Act), the Congress provided for the first time that the most deserving of veterans--those with severe service-connected disabilities--will be assured of receiving nursing home care should they need it--and so long as they need it. Under the terms of the Millennium Act, any veteran who needs nursing home care to treat a service-connected disability will get it. Similarly, any veteran who is rated as 70 percent disabled or higher by VA due to a service-connected cause will be provided with needed nursing home care--even if the condition which causes the need for such care is not itself service-connected. Further, all veterans who are enrolled for VA care--even those who do not have service-connected disabilities--will, under the terms of the Millennium Act, receive any and all non-institutional alternatives to inpatient long-term care--services such as home health aide services, adult day health care services, and the like--as they might need to forestall the day on which they will have to resort to inpatient long-term care. Finally, the Millennium Act mandates that VA maintain the nursing home capacity that it now has, and that it initiate pilot programs to determine, first, the most cost-effective ways of providing more nursing home care to more veterans and, second, the feasibility of providing to veterans, and their spouses, assisted living services. 
   With enactment last month of the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000, Public Law 106-419, the other two priorities which had been identified at the outset of the 106th Congress were also met. Under that statute, a veteran who has served a three-year enlistment and who returns to school after service will be eligible to receive as much as $800 per month in assistance payments while he or she is in school. In January 1997, when I assumed the chairmanship of the committee, veteran-students could receive no more than $427 per month in Montgomery GI bill assistance; thus, in four years, assistance to full time veteran students has been increased by 87 percent. 
   The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act also addressed two issues of importance to women veterans: It provided that special compensation benefits--those provided to male veterans when they lose, due to a service-connected cause, a so-called creative organ--will also be afforded to women veterans who sustain the service-connected loss of a breast. And it provided--based on sound scientific evidence--that children with birth defects of women Vietnam veterans will be provided compensation, health care, and job training benefits. 
   These three measures--addressing the disparate needs of older, younger, and women veterans--are not the only veterans-related legislative accomplishments of the 106th Congress. To the contrary, the list of other legislative achievements is long. In addition to providing the long-term care benefits I have already outlined, the Millennium Act also specifies that VA will itself provide, or reimburse the uninsured costs of, emergency care needed by any veteran enrolled for VA care. It mandates, further, that VA enhance the services it provides to homeless veterans, and to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorders, drug abuse disorders, and injuries from sexual trauma. It provides, in addition, that higher priority access to VA care will be provided to veterans who were wounded in combat and are, as a consequence, recipients of the Purple Heart. And, finally, it authorizes VA to provide enhanced care, as space is available, to active duty service personnel and military retirees (who normally receive care from their respective military services), and reauthorizes the provision of health care evaluations to the spouses and children of Persian Gulf war veterans. 
   Further in the area of health care benefits, the Millennium Act and the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act jointly enhance services provided to veterans by improving VA assistance to State-run veterans' nursing home facilities; by authorizing 13 major hospital construction projects; by improving provisions of law relating to nurse, dentist, and pharmacist pay and the recruitment of  physician assistants, social workers, and medical support staff; by increasing VA incentives to collect reimbursements from non-service-disabled veterans' health insurance carriers--funds that are not remitted to the Treasury but are funneled back into VA hospitals; and by encouraging increased VA and Department of Defense cooperation in the procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. And last, but surely not least in the area of health care, VA's health care system received the two greatest increases ever in funding for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, increases of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion respectively. The ranking member and I very much appreciate that the chairman and ranking member of the VA, HUD 
   and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, heard our call for such funding increases. 
   In the area of veterans' readjustment benefits and other non-healthcare-related benefits provided by VA, I have already outlined the significant increases in monthly Montgomery GI bill benefits that have been gained since 1997, and the improvements in women veterans' benefits. Beyond these accomplishments, there is a lengthy and strong record of accomplishment. In addition to increasing veterans' educational assistance allowances, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act also increased education assistance benefits provided to the widows and surviving children of persons who were killed in service or who died after service from service-connected causes. And these survivors' educational assistance benefits were, for the first time, ``indexed'' by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act so that they will keep pace with inflation. The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act and the Millennium Act also improved VA educational assistance programs by allowing benefits to be paid to students taking test preparation courses and certification or licensing examinations, and by paying benefits to students during term breaks and, retroactively, to students who are veterans' survivors and who are deemed eligible for such benefits only after their educations have begun. In addition, those statutes also expanded eligibility standards applicable to post-Vietnam era veterans by allowing those who had participated in the less generous Veterans Educational Assistance Program or VEAP program of the late 1970's and early 1980's to convert to Montgomery GI bill eligibility. Finally, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act liberalized MGIB participation rules so that officer candidates and veterans serving second enlistments would not, due to technicalities in the law, be denied Montgomery GI bill eligibility. 
   Benefits other than educational assistance benefits were also improved by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act, the Millennium Act, and other committee-approved legislation. Compensation benefits provided to radiation-exposed veterans were modified by the addition, under the Millennium Act, of bronchiolo-alveolar cancer to the listing of diseases that are presumed to be service-connected if they are contracted by radiation-exposed veterans. The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act specifies that compensation will be provided, for the first time, to reservists who suffer heart attacks or strokes while on active duty and to veterans who are injured while participating in VA-sponsored compensated work therapy programs. In addition, that statute provides for a long-overdue increase in the net worth threshold at which compensation payments are suspended in certain cases involving veterans who are hospitalized on a long term basis, though I hasten to add that a repeal of this limitation--which, under current law, applies to mentally incompetent hospitalized veterans but not to other hospitalized veterans--will remain a top priority of mine. And benefits provided to veterans' widows were improved by liberalizing eligibility for survivors of former prisoners of war and widows who have remarried. In addition, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Public Law 106-475, reinstated and improved court-struck provisions of law requiring that VA assist veterans and other claimants--principally, widows and surviving children--in the preparation of their claims to VA for benefits. And Public Laws 106-118 and 106-413 increased VA compensation, survivors' benefits, and other cash-transfer benefits by 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, thereby assuring that VA benefits keep pace with inflation. 
   In the area of insurance benefits, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act increased the amount of life insurance available to service members from $200,000 to $250,000, and authorized insurance program participation by members of the Reserves. That statute also freezes premiums paid by certain insured veterans who have reached the age of 70. And, in the area of housing benefits, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act improved remodeling grant programs to assist disabled veterans in making their homes accessible, and the Millennium Act extended mortgage loan guarantee benefits to members of the Reserves. 
   In order to assist veterans in gaining meaningful post-service employment, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act extends eligibility for Federal contractor outreach programs to recently-separated veterans. In addition, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, Public Law 106-50, provides technical, financial, and procurement assistance to veteran-owned small businesses. 
   Finally, in the area of memorial affairs, the Millennium Act mandates that VA establish six new national cemeteries in areas which VA had identified as being underserved. In addition, the Millennium Act facilitated last month's dedication of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall by authorizing the American Battle Monuments Commission to borrow funds needed to proceed now while World War II veterans remain alive to see the memorial they earned. Finally, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act extended eligibility for burial, and funeral expense and plot allowances, to certain U.S.-citizen Filipino veterans, improved VA assistance to States in establishing State cemeteries, and extended job-protection benefits to Reserve and Guard members who take leave from their civilian jobs to honor veterans by serving in burial details. 
   Mr. President, I commend and thank the ranking minority member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and all of the committee's members, for their extraordinary diligence and cooperation in assisting me in pressing forward the numerous improvements to veterans programs that I have outlined in this statement. The Veterans' Affairs Committee operates in an unusually bipartisan way--a way that might be a model for constructive activity in the 107th Congress. We will continue to so act, and we anticipate that the 107th Congress will show a record of accomplishment similar to that which characterizes the 106th.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from Virginia for those fine remarks about Senator ROBB. I associate myself with Senator WARNER on his best wishes to Senator ROBB, acknowledging his very distinguished service in the Senate for 12 years. I might add, his distinguished wife, Lynda Johnson Robb, was a regular at the Old Testament Bible class conducted in my office over the past decade, presided over by a very distinguished Biblical scholar, Naomi Rosenblatt. But CHUCK and Lynda Robb will still be around and we will have the benefit of their company, although his Senate career, at least, is over at the moment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment about the pending appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which comes from the appropriations subcommittee which I chair. There has been an extraordinarily rocky road for this bill this year. I think it is very regrettable that on December 15 we are still debating that bill and the entire package is as yet unsettled, although hopefully it will be resolved before the end of the day. But there have been many days when we have been hopeful about resolving matters before the end of the day and that has not occurred. 
   Without going into the background on prior years, it has been a very difficult matter to get the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education to the President for signature and to resolve the controversies. This year, my ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator TOM HARKIN, and I have worked as partners on this matter. When he chaired the subcommittee, I was ranking, or when I have chaired the subcommittee, he has been ranking. Both of us understand--and have for a long time--that if you want to get something done in Washington, you have to cross party lines. That is more true today than ever. It will be even more true in the 107th Congress when we have a 50-50 split. 
   But we brought that bill to conclusion on the Senate vote on June 30 of this year, which tied the record going back to 1976. We completed a conference report on July 27, the last Thursday before we adjourned for the Republican convention and the August recess. We did that with a lot of extra effort, hard work by our staffs led by Bettilou Taylor on my staff, so we could get the bill to the President right after Labor Day. There is no use sending it in August, but we were prepared to submit it to the President the day after Labor Day. 
   We had met the President's figure of $106 billion, which was a $10 billion increase over the program authority from last year. We did that because the experience in the past had been that when we quarreled with the President about the total figure, invariably there were add-ons at the end when the issue  went beyond September 30 into October or November. 
   Candidly, it was difficult to get the Republican caucus to agree to $106 billion in the Senate and in the House, but we did that. But in presenting the bill, the conference report, we had some priorities which were somewhat different from those of the President. We had, for example, added $2.7 billion for the National Institutes of Health because we thought that was a very high priority item. We had also made some changes on the $2.7 billion which the President had requested for school construction and additional teachers, giving him that money but adding a provision that if the local boards of education wanted to use the money for something else after fulfilling very stringent requirements, that they could use it for local control. 
   When we sat down to negotiate with the White House, the President and the Democrats in the House upped the ante and asked 
   for an additional $6 billion. From my way of thinking, that was totally unacceptable because we had provided the $106 billion which the President had initially requested. After all, it is the congressional prerogative to set the priorities on appropriations. That is spelled out in the Constitution. The President has to sign the bill but we have the lion's share of responsibility, in my view, to establish the priorities. 
   Those negotiations degenerated--at least in my opinion--until there was an inclination by some in the conference to pay $114 billion. I refused to be a party to that amount of money because I had fought hard to raise the figure to $106 billion and I felt there would be no credibility in what I would present as chairman of the subcommittee if I would be a will-o'-the-wisp and raise it to any figure to satisfy the demands of the White House and the House Democrats. There was a tentative agreement of $114 billion and I declined to sign any conference report which reflected that figure. 
   Ultimately that arrangement broke down. Now we have come to the point where the negotiations have produced a figure of $108.9 billion, which is still more than the $106 billion we had originally projected, but in the spirit of accommodation, trying to finish the business of the Congress, I am prepared to go along with that figure although very reluctantly. 
   There have been changes in the bill which I find totally unacceptable. The National Institutes of Health has had an increase of $2.7 billion over fiscal year 2000, which had been in all along, now cut by $200 million to $2.5 billion. I believe that the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. It may be the only jewel of the Federal Government. We have added almost $9 billion to the funding on NIH in the last five cycles. The Senate, in one of the first years under my chairmanship, came in at the figure of a $950 million increase. The House would not go along. We compromised out at $907 million. The next year we added $1 billion; the year after, $2 billion; the year after that, $2.3 billion, which was cut a little on an across-the-board cut. This year we put in $2.7 billion, now reduced to $2.5 billion. But we have a total of almost $9 billion added in these last five cycles and they have made tremendous strides on the most dreaded diseases--Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and cancer and heart ailments and the whole range. 
   It is my hope in the future that whoever chairs the subcommittee will have better cooperation on all sides to present the bill to the President before the fiscal year ends. I think, had that been done, we could have mustered a very strong position that our priorities were superior to what the President had in mind, and that if he were going to veto the bill, we ought not to be fearful of his veto but we ought to accept it as his view and then take the case to the American public. I think, had the bill been submitted to the President on September 5, we would have won that fight. Or if we had not won it outright, we would have compromised in terms so we wouldn't be here on December 15, still arguing about this Labor-HHS-Education bill as the principal source of contention.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again thank my distinguished ranking member, Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER, who works collaboratively on veterans affairs matters and all members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is a committee which has worked in a bipartisan way. It has a very excellent staff, with staff director Bill Tuerk. I thank the staff for their assistance and commend to the public and the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the legislation which has been passed during the 106th Congress. 
   I know my time has expired, and I note the presence on the floor of a distinguished Senator, Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor. I was about to say ``another distinguished Senator,'' but I modified that to ``a distinguished Senator.''

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey for yielding to me. I compliment him for his leadership on Amtrak generally and especially on this current plan for financing. 
   I support Amtrak and believe the proposal to provide this additional funding is very much in the national interest. I think it is a very salutary thing, as some have already commented, that we have people extending their hands across the aisle on a matter of great national importance. 
   The Senator from Delaware, I think, characterized the situation very aptly when he talked about federalism; and that is, one region helping another region. 
   There is no doubt that those of us who live in the eastern corridor--and I am a beneficiary of Amtrak. It is 1 hour and 37 civilized minutes from Washington, DC, to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. But it is more than my convenience; it is the infrastructure of the country. 
   I think this is very good for the country that we are going to be moving ahead with this legislation next year, and a very good sign for the 107th Congress that hands are being extended across the aisle to show bipartisanship. If this carries forward in the next year generally, it will be very good for the American people. 
   I, again, thank my colleague from New Jersey.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation at this time which will put on the record factors which have been enormously harmful in the current violence which now occurs in Israel. This bill would prohibit assistance to the Palestinian Authority or Palestinian projects, unless and until certain conditions are met. The Oslo Interim Agreement of 1995 provided that the Palestinian Authority would:  
   ..... ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region, and will refrain from the introduction of any motifs that could adversely affect the process of reconciliation.  
   Notwithstanding that commitment, the Palestinian Authority has filled  the textbooks with the most vitriolic condemnation of Israel and the Jews. For example, the ninth graders are taught:  
   One must beware of the Jews, for they are treacherous and disloyal.  
   The ninth graders are further instructed:  
   One must beware of civil war, which the Jews try to incite, and of scheming against the Muslims.  
   There are some extraordinarily vitriolic comments which are inciting the young people, the Arabs, to turn to violence in the name of Allah, with the instruction directing them that they will be doing Allah's work, and if they are killed, they will go to heaven as Allah's messengers, as Allah's assistants. 
   There are reports of 12-year-old boys who leave their homes telling their parents they are off to throw stones and otherwise incite violence. The parents permit this under a fatalistic attitude of ``what will be will be,'' and that it is something to be desired--incite to violence and be killed in doing Allah's work. 
   The difficulties in the peace process are enormous. They are generational. There is absolutely no likelihood of success if the schoolchildren in the Palestinian Authority schools are going to be taught hatred and violence and the most extraordinary forms of misleading comment--about how to please Allah and how to go to heaven by getting themselves killed in the process of killing others and destroying the peace process. 
   The United States and our allies have contributed very substantially to projects in the West Bank and Gaza. While the United States has not given aid directly to the Palestinian Authority since 1995, in fiscal year 2000, the United States allocated $485 million in development assistance to non-governmental organizations working in the West Bank and Gaza. Between 1995 and 1998, international aid provided by 21 countries and 4 international organizations amounted to almost $227 million. Between 1993 and 1999, the international community pledged a total of $5.7 billion for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, and over $2.7 billion was disbursed by the end of 1999, according to the World Bank. I will go into the funding which the United States has provided and which our allies have provided in greater detail. 
   This legislation would condition any assistance by the United States to the Palestinian Authority on changing those textbooks in accordance with their commitments under the Oslo agreement, ceasing to publish maps which omit Israel but instead refer only to Palestine, and changing the vitriol which appears on the state-sponsored television. These are absolutely minimal steps which have to be taken if there is to be any opportunity for success in the Mideast peace process. 
   In 1995, Senator SHELBY and I introduced legislation which was enacted which conditioned U.S. aid on the Palestinian Authority changing its charter which called for the destruction of Israel. That, in fact, did happen and perhaps our legislation was somewhat helpful in getting that done. The legislation also conditioned aid on maximum efforts of the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat to restrain terrorists. For a time, I think there was a real effort by Chairman Arafat and many in the Palestinian Authority to do that, but that has totally broken down. 
   Notwithstanding those grave difficulties, efforts must continue on the peace process to try to terminate the violence there. I note in this morning's press there are reports of additional meetings. I have both privately and publicly commended President Clinton for his efforts in trying to mediate the difficulties between the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
   This business about teaching sixth graders, seventh graders, eighth graders, and ninth graders to hate and to incite violence is just absolutely intolerable if there is to be any chance at all for the peace process to succeed, and even in the next generation to find a way for people to live in peace with the Jewish State of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the Arabs, who are citizens of Israel, for that matter. 
   I am introducing this bill on what is probably going to be the last day of our session so that these educational tools may become better known. People will understand them and will join the fight to insist that they be terminated. 
   Mr. President, to reinterate, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation to condition aid to the Palestinian Authority upon the removal of all anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content from their school textbooks, and radio and television broadcasts at publically funded facilities. The Palestinian Authority deliberately and consciously disseminates messages filled with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hatred with the clear aim of promoting violence against Israel and the Jewish people. This is a clear violation of the spirit of the peace process. 
   A study by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace, a Jerusalem-based non-governmental organization, found that there is not one example in the entire Palestinian school system of a positive reference to a Jew, Judaism, or to peace with Israel. I urge the passage of this legislation to send a clear signal to the Palestinian people that the international community will not accept the fostering of hatred in textbooks and broadcast media in the West Bank and Gaza. The United States provides assistance to the region in support of the peace process, and we must condition this assistance upon each party's fulfillment of the commitments made to bring peace to the region. Furthermore, we must vigorously press for our allies to do the same. 
   In years past, Palestinian schools in the West Bank used Jordanian textbooks and the schools in Gaza used Egyptian textbooks. While the areas were under the control of the Israeli government, these books continued to be used but anti-Semitic and anti-Israel material was removed. As a result of the 1993 Oslo Accords, the responsibility for education in the West Bank and Gaza was transferred from the Israeli government to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. While beginning to develop their own curriculum, the Palestinian Ministry of Education continued to use Egyptian and Jordanian books, but failed to remove the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic material. Currently, the Palestinian Ministry of Education is directly supervising the production of new textbooks which are the first Palestinian-produced textbooks. 
   As part of a pilot program, the first new textbooks were introduced in the first and sixth grades in September 2000, as part of the new curriculum which the Palestinian Authority plans to expand to cover the grades first through twelfth over the next fours years. Many Israelis and others hoped these books would promote the peace process and teach cooperation and tolerance among the Israelis and the Palestinians. Instead, the new Palestinian textbooks continue to contain anti-Israel material, such as a map denying the existence of Israel. The continued promotion of hatred by the Palestinian Authority is unacceptable, as it not only violates the spirit of the peace process but also the letter of the Oslo Accords. The United States and the rest of the international community must send a message to the Palestinian Authority that this will not be tolerated. 
   By means of both the new and old textbooks in their schools, the Palestinian Authority is raising an entire generation of Palestinian children to despise Jews and Israel. These teachings foster an environment of hatred and violence, not peace and conciliation. Palestinian school children are actively taught that the Jewish people and Israel are the enemy in a broad range of contexts, and that Jews are not to be trusted. For example, on page 79 of the textbook entitled the Islamic Education for Ninth Grade, the book outlines lessons to be learned by the students. Specifically, it says ``One must beware of the Jews, for they are treacherous and disloyal.'' The book goes on to say on page 94, ``one must beware of civil war, which the Jews try to incite, and of scheming against the Muslims.'' Reinforcing this message, students read on page 182, ``The Jews ..... have killed and evicted Muslim and Christian inhabitants of Palestine, whose inhabitants are still suffering oppression and persecution under racist Jewish Administration.'' 
   Another textbook, the Islamic Religious Education for Fourth Grade, on page 44, states ``..... the Jews--as is their way--do not want people to live in peace.....'' In the Reader and Literary Texts for Eighth Grade, on pages  96 through 99, students are taught ``The Jews have clear greedy designs on Jerusalem.'' Students are then asked to think about the following question: ``What can we do to rescue Jerusalem and to liberate it from the thieving enemy.....?'' The authors of these textbooks clearly intended not to foster an environment of trust between the Palestinian people and their Jewish neighbors. Without a foundation of trust in the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people, the peace process is doomed to failure. 
   The school books also include lessons equating Zionism with Nazism, Fascism, and racism. For example, the textbook entitled The Contemporary History of the Arabs and the World, on page 123, states ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.'' Lessons such as this one are clearly not intended to support peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
   More alarmingly, in addition to anti-Semitic material, these textbooks also teach children to pursue violence and the destruction of Israel. The calls to fight and eliminate Israel through Jihad, holy war, and martyrdom for Allah, appear frequently in the school textbooks. The need 
   to fight Israel is portrayed as a religious imperative in the books. 
   For example, a fifth grade textbook, Our Arabic Language for Fifth Grade on page 69 and 70, teaches children that ``there will be a Jihad and our country shall be freed. This is our story with the thieving conquerors. You must know, my boy, that Palestine is your grave responsibility.'' The book also teaches children to ``remember: The Arabs and the Muslims are fighting the Jews who fought against them and oppressed them and drove them from their homes unjustly. The final and inevitable result will be the victory of the Muslims over the Jews.'' 
   The violent message continues in the seventh grade textbook, Islamic Education for Seventh Grade, on page 108, which states ``if the enemy has conquered part of its land and those fighting for it are unable to repel the enemy, then Jihad becomes the individual religious duty of every Muslim man and woman, until the attack is successfully repulsed and the land liberated from conquest and to defend Muslim honor.....''. 
   In addition to lessons on Jihad, students are instructed to adopt hostile attitudes on a particularly divisive topic--their responsibility regarding holy sites. The seventh grade textbook, Islamic Education for Seventh Grade, on page 184, states ``Muslims must protect all mosques..... They must devote all their efforts and resources to repairing them and to protecting them and must wage a Jihad both of life and property to liberate al-Aqsa Mosque from the Zionist conquest.'' The inflammatory language is also included on page 50, ``The Muslim connects the holiness of al-Aqsa Mosque, and its precincts, with the holiness of the `Sacred Mosque' and Mecca. Therefore, any aggression against one is an aggression against the other and to defend them is to defend Islam. Disregard of the duty in respect of them is a crime for which Allah will punish every believer in Allah and His Prophet.'' The aggressive message clearly encourages the violence which is currently taking place in the Middle East. 
   The same seventh grade book also teaches children to fight and conquer Israel's capital, Jerusalem. For example, the book contains a composition question which asks: ``How are we going to liberate our stolen land? Make use of the following ideas: Arab unity, genuine faith in Allah, most modern weapons and ammunition, using oil and other precious natural resources as weapons in the battle for liberation.'' It is this type of violent message which leads young children to take to the streets and engage in stone-throwing and other violence. 
   However, this message is not limited to schoolbooks. The same hateful portrayal of Jews and Israel found in the school books is promoted regularly on Palestinian Television, which is also under direct control of the Palestinian Authority. For example, on May 14, 1998, Palestinian television broadcast statements such as ``The Jewish gangs waged racial cleansing wars against innocent Palestinians.......large scale appalling massacres saving no women or children.'' On May 14, 1998, Zionism was presented as ``a cancer in the body of the nation.'' 
   Palestinian television broadcasts a continuous flow of violent images with messages glorifying the children in the streets as martyrs participating in Jihad. For example, television stations around the world broadcast the image of Muhammad al-Durrah, the twelve year old boy who was killed while his father tried to shield him from the crossfire on September 30, 2000. However, the image of the young man, who had no intention when he left his house that day to become a martyr, was instantly the symbol used by Palestinian television of the continued victimization of the Palestinian people at the hands of the so-called Israeli ``occupiers.'' 
   By continually referring to the occupation of their land, Palestinian television refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of Israel. On May 19, 1998, Palestinian television reported `` ..... the war of 1948 brought about the establishment of the Zionist entity on Palestinian land.'' The television broadcasts also declared in May 1998: ``This is our Palestine. We defend it with blood.'' 
   The hate-filled broadcasts further reinforce the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages found in the school textbooks and explicitly aim to incite violence. We cannot tolerate this behavior by a society that claims to be committed to pursuing the peace process. These teachings send a direct message to young children to pursue violence and the destruction of Israel, and the message appears to be reaching the children. 
   On October 6, 2000, the New York Times reported on Muhammad Ibrahim, a Palestinian teenager engaged in the current violence in the streets. Muhammad joins his young friends on the streets and throws stones at Israeli soldiers, even though his father asked him ``not to go down that road'' and telling him ``we do not need another generation of victims.'' When asked why he engaged in the stone throwing, Muhammad plainly stated, ``You want to express your anger. You know your stone might not hit an Israeli soldier or might not even hurt him. But you want to feel you've done something for the homeland.'' Muhammad made clear where he learned these lessons when he said, ``I was raised with stories of how they kicked us off our land.'' The young 
   people out on the streets today throwing stones have been raised on anti-Israel and anti-Semitic stories, which is formally reinforced in the textbooks used in the schools in the West Bank and Gaza and the television and radio broadcasts. If there is any hope for lasting peace in the region, the next generation of leaders must not be raised on lessons of hatred and violence. 
   In signing the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza, the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority agreed to use their respective educational systems to support the peace process. Specifically, Article XXII of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995 declares that Israel and the Palestinian Authority will ``ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region, and will refrain from the introduction of any motifs that could adversely affect the process of reconciliation.'' The Palestinian Authority should be held to the commitments made in the peace process, not the least of which is to educate the young people of the West Bank and Gaza with a curriculum that will contribute to peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. 
   The United States provides assistance to the region in support of the peace process, and it is imperative to condition this assistance upon the fulfillment of the commitments made to bring peace to the region. While the United States has not given aid directly to the Palestinian Authority since 1995, in fiscal year 2000 the United States allocated $485 million in development assistance to non-governmental organizations working in the West Bank and Gaza, including funds for educational programs. It is of the utmost importance that the United States conditions any aid to the Palestinian Authority on their commitment  to the peace process, which must be demonstrated by the removal of the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel material from their textbooks and radio and television broadcasts. 
   It is also imperative that the United States urge our allies to condition their aid to the Palestinian Authority on this issue. Between 1995 and 1998 international aid provided by twenty-one countries and four international organizations provided $226.9 million to educational projects in the Palestinian Territories. Between 1993 and 1999, the international community pledged a total of $5.7 billion in assistance for the West Bank and Gaza, and over $2.7 billion was disbursed by the end of 1999 according to the World Bank. From 1994 to 1999, the European Community committed over $600 million. Recently, on December 6, 2000, the World Bank also agreed to a grant to the Palestinian Authority in the amount of $12 million. 
   The assistance to the Palestinian Authority, whether through international institutions or our allies, must include conditions which will compel the Palestinian Authority to remove this unacceptable material from the textbooks and the broadcast media. The assistance is given to the Palestinian Authority with the intent to support peace in the region, and therefore, the aid should be conditioned on the removal of material which undermines the peace process from the Palestinian educational system and broadcast media. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation which sends a clear signal to the Palestinian Authority that the use of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel material in their schools and television and radio broadcasts will not be tolerated. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation which would seek to modernize voting procedures throughout the United States in Federal elections. I do not intend to become involved in the current controversies but instead have been considering where we go from here in order to try to prevent the kind of concerns and problems which we have at the present time. 
   In Pennsylvania, I have had considerable comment from my constituents about the issue as to, in the electronic age, with computers available and with electronic devices available why do we have some sections of the country voting by paper ballot and why do we have a great variety of election procedures in voting, so that there is not uniformity and there is not a prompt count. 
   Looking at that issue, it seems to me that we can do much better on how we vote in Federal elections. The thought on my mind is Congress should address this issue at least as to Federal elections, leaving the matters of State and local elections to State officials under our Federalist concepts. 
   It is not really practical for someone to lay out an entire bill with the procedures to implement these objectives, but it seems to me--and I have been talking to some of my colleagues about it, and there are a number of Senators who are thinking in the same direction--that it will be useful to establish a commission which would take up the question of how we have election procedures which take advantage of computers and electronics so that votes may be tabulated accurately and promptly, and not have the kinds of issues which arose in our election on November 7. 
   I do, therefore, submit, Mr. President, the structure of a bill to establish a commission for the comprehensive study of voting procedures for Federal elections, to take a look at not only Federal elections but State and local elections as well, but with the purpose of finding a way to have accurate reporting, electronic reporting, and speedy reporting. 
   This bill is not in concrete. I am now soliciting cosponsors. I think we will have other cosponsors shortly. Since we have an abbreviated session today, with only a limited amount of time, I am introducing the bill at this time. 
   Mr. President, I will make just a comment or two about the electoral college. 
   As we have moved ahead with the concerns under the current contest between Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, I have found many of my constituents--and have noted comments in the media across the country--who are surprised about the way the electoral college works. 
   Illustratively, in my State of Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, and Vice President GORE having received 51 percent of the vote and Governor Bush having received 47 percent, that Vice President GORE got all 23 of Pennsylvania's electoral votes. 
   In discussions I have found--candidly, a surprise to me--a fair amount of concern among my constituents about changing the electoral college. There is some confusion that any change in the electoral college may have some impact on the current contest between Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, which, of course, is not the case. This current election is going to be determined under the existing rules of the electoral college as it now stands. It seems to me that consideration ought to be given to a modification. 
   One approach would be to go to the popular election of a President. That appears to be unrealistic because there are so many smaller States which have only one Member of the House, two 
   Senators, so they get three electoral votes. On a proportionate basis, they would be entitled to a 1-435th proportion in relation to the House, there being 435 Members of the House, but they have a 3-535th proportion, taking the House's 435 Members and the Senate's 100 Members. Since it takes a two-thirds vote to pass a constitutional amendment in the Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the States, I think it is unrealistic to look to the popular election of a President. 
   But there is an alternative way where it might be achieved; that is, with a proportional representation. S.J. Res. 51 was introduced in the 96th Congress by Senator Cannon, cosponsored by Senators THURMOND, Goldwater, Harry Byrd and Talmadge, which provided for a constitutional amendment for proportional representation, which might be the way to go. 
   Illustratively, in a State such as Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, and a vote split of 51 percent and 47 percent, it might be divided as 12 votes for Vice President GORE and 11 votes for Governor Bush. I think this is going to require further study. 
   I do think it is plain that the purpose of having the electoral college, as reflected in the Federalist Papers, was to provide a buffer between the common voter, who was thought at that time not to be sufficiently informed to directly elect a President. That, of course, was changed when we had a constitutional amendment providing for the direct election of Senators. 
   In the original Constitution, Senators were elected by the State legislatures, so that the common man did not  vote directly for a Senator. But that has been changed as we have come to understand that in modern times every voter has a full capacity to make the direct election of an elected official with Senators, and I think on the same analogy to the President as well. But because of the extra leverage for the smaller States, which I do not contest, the direct election is not realistic. But perhaps a proportional election through the electoral college might be appropriate, with the smaller States having the additional advantage of having two electors, accounting for their two Senators. I think that is going to require further study. Again, I have been discussing that with my colleagues. 
   I do think people in this country want to know what our plans are for the future. I also think there ought to be an awareness that many of us in the Congress are considering whether the electoral college should stand as it now is or whether it should be changed. 
   An intermediate ground may be this proportional voting of the electoral college, as reflected in S.J. Res. 51 from the 96th Congress. I believe there is no doubt that we need to modernize election procedures, and that the way to go would be a five-person commission with appointments made by the President, the majority leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader of the House. These matters ought to be subject to consideration to try to eliminate some of the problems which the country now faces.

   Mr. SPECTER. The legislation provides that the commission would have 1 year to complete a study and then 6 additional months to file a report. It is structured to be bipartisan, with the leadership of the House and Senate each having one appointee and the President having a fifth appointee, so the bipartisanship would be assured. 
   If I may add, it is well known the Senator from Iowa and I worked very closely together on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We just had a brief informal discussion, so I may have picked up a cosponsor here before 12:30.

It is astounding not to have rapid, accurate results on election night, with computers being what they are and the possibilities of electronics. This may be a matter on which the Federal Government will have to do some financing. The study ought to be made. Congress ought to consider it and try to solve at least a big part of this problem.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the pending status of the work of the Congress. Yesterday, Senator STEVENS took the floor and outlined the work of the Appropriations Committee, making it plain that nothing could be done on the last bill on appropriations for Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, until Tuesday because there had to be a reading of the bill and the other procedural matters which had to be attended to, even if the conferees came to agreement on Friday. 
   Senator STEVENS suggested that there was no point in having the Senate and the House in session on Saturday and Sunday and Monday. Notwithstanding that, and notwithstanding Senator STEVENS' contacts with the President and the President's men, we are here. We are here for absolutely no reason. I chair the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over that appropriations bill and we have been in negotiations with the White House for weeks. We have not been able to come to an agreement because of the intransigence of the White House. They may say it is the intransigence of the Congress. We have a way of saying the other party is intransigent. But there is no doubt that they are at least 50 percent responsible for the fact that we have not been able to come to terms on this bill. 
   On this bill, the subcommittee that I chair met the President's figure of $106 billion. It was hard to do. My colleagues in this body and the Republicans in the House didn't like that figure; they thought it was too much money. But the chairman of the House committee and I prevailed to meet the President's figure so we can come to terms and have an accommodation and get the bill passed. We put $600 million in that bill--more for education than the President did. And the President asked for $2.7 billion for school construction and teachers. It was the view of many colleagues that that was not a Federal responsibility, but we gave this figure. We put an addendum on that if the local school boards decided they wanted it for something else, they could use it for something else, so that there would be local control, which is the essence of education in America, contrasted with the Washington, DC, bureaucratic straitjacket. 
   Notwithstanding that, the White House, his negotiators, wanted every semicolon their own way. So that bill is still languishing in negotiations. But it is certainly not the fault of the Congress. 
   We are here today and we will be here tomorrow. The Members --535 of us--had thought we would have concluded our business a long time ago. I can tell the American people--if anybody watches C-SPAN II--that the fault is not that of the Congress that we are still here. The President has decided that we will be in session on 1-day continuing resolutions, as his way of trying to make a political point. He is not making a governmental point, he is making a political point. He is making a political point to try to blame the Congress as a ``do-nothing'' Congress, when that is not the fact. He is trying to blame the Congress for a situation the White House is really responsible for--at least 50 percent responsible. 
   We have come to a situation where the quality and parity between the Congress and the executive branch has long since evaporated. When the Government was closed down at the end of 1995, that was an enormous shift of power, so that now the Congress is really over a barrel to yield to whatever the President has to say. 
   Being aware of that, we structured this final bill on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education to finish it so that it could be presented to the President in September. The Senate acted on it 
   on June 30, which established a record, going back to 1976 for the earlier set of action on this bill. Then we finished the conference report on July 27. It should have been presented to the President in September, and that projection was made so that we would be able to present it to the President and, if he vetoed it, have a national debate; and we thought we would be in a position to make our priorities stand up because the Constitution does give the Congress the responsibility and authority to establish the priorities. 
   Mr. President, the essential point that I am coming to is that if we were not over a barrel in our relations with the President, we would submit to the President a continuing resolution for 3 or 4 days. But we are not doing that because it would be unseemly. We are not doing that because we don't want to engage in what might be viewed by the American people as a childish food fight. 
   If we sent him a continuing resolution for 4 days, which would be reasonable under the circumstances, since we can't get anything done until Tuesday, and there was a stalemate and there was a closing of the Federal Government, the American people would say a plague on both of your houses. But the reality is that the Congress is being intimidated by the President and we are, in fact, being humiliated by what the President is doing. There needs to be some semblance of good will and comity between the Congress and the President. It doesn't exist and hasn't existed. 
   This Senator has gone out of his way to try to work with the White House and try to find accommodations. But when you have this intimidation and what is really humiliation, it lingers. It has to be a factor considered, as we have so many delicate relationships with the executive branch of the Government. Frankly, I would like to see us submit a continuing resolution for 4 days and lay down the gauntlet to the President, if he wants to keep us around here doing nothing. But the parity between the branches has been lost and we are here wasting the time of 535 Members of Congress. 
   We are wasting the time of the Congressmen, and we are also putting the people of America to a disadvantage because we have responsibilities to our constituents that will not be attended to today, or tomorrow, or Monday, or thereafter. I think it is high time that the Congress stood up and confronted the President because of this situation, which is simply intolerable.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the Senator from Nevada, I listened very carefully to what the Senator from Nevada said and was looking for something which the Senator from Nevada said that factually disputed my representation of what has happened here. I did not hear anything disputed about what I have said. 
   The facts are, No. 1, that there is one bill outstanding to finish the work of the Senate; that is the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
   All of the other complaints which the Senator from Nevada made--the litany that has been repeated day after day after day about what is wrong with the Republican Senate--is all prologue. 
   We are standing here today on a Saturday session--we are going to have a Sunday session and we are going to have a Monday session--and nothing is going to be done because the President wants to gain political advantage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. No. 
   He wants to gain political advantage by trying to make a representation that it is a do-nothing Congress. 
   I will tell you what he is in effect doing. He is creating a do-nothing Congress on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday because we can't do anything in Washington. 
   But there is a lot we could do in our States where we have a lot of meetings and a lot of constituent business and a lot of legislative business. 
   But it is going to be a do-nothing Congress today, tomorrow, and Monday because right now the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education has to be read, has to be printed, and has to be completed. So we are not doing anything. 
   When the Senator from Nevada says that we ought to be working every day, I replied to the Senator from Nevada that he works every day. I have seen him work. He works every day. I would say to the Senator from Nevada and the other 98 Senators that I, too, work every day. So do the other 98 Senators. 
   But we don't work at the direction of the President. We don't work for the President. 
   We work for the American people. I work for 12 million Pennsylvanians. I don't work for the President.  
   The Constitution has separation of powers. When the Founding Fathers organized the Constitution, they put Congress in article I. They didn't get around to the executive branch until article II. But today the system is inverted. 
   Since the Government was closed down in 1995 and our business has gone over into October and sometimes into November, there is no way for the Congress to do anything--at least we think so--but to yield to the President. That is why, as I have said earlier, we structured this bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education so it could be finished and be presented to the President in September. 
   The mistake we made, quite candidly, was that we were negotiating with the President. We have undertaken in recent years nonconstitutional proceedings. The Constitution says that Congress will present a bill to the President after the Congress decides what the legislation should be, and then the President either signs it or vetoes it. But that has been turned around. 
   Now we have members of the President's executive branch sitting in our legislative conferences. We ought not have that. We ought to present our bill and let the President sign it or veto it. This Senator tried mightily to get that bill presented to the President in September. Then if the President wanted to veto it, so be it, that is his constitutional prerogative. But he doesn't have a constitutional prerogative to sit in on the legislative process and the Congress accede to it. We ought to change that. 
   I think if the American people had seen this bill, they would have preferred the congressional priorities to the President's priorities. The Congress gave the President 90 percent of what he wanted--more than 90 percent. We have a bill which is $40.2 billion for education. The President's staff objected to $3.3 million, less than 10 percent of $40.2 billion. But we had some other priorities we wanted. We wanted special education. We also wanted money for the National Institutes of Health, where they have made enormous strides in conquering Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart ailments, and a whole range of medical problems. 
   We had different priorities. I think if we had presented those priorities to the American people, the American people would have sided with the Congress. So September went by the board. There were negotiations in September. And I make the representation that it was the intransigence of the White House which resulted in those negotiations not moving forward. I make that representation because our priorities were as good as theirs or better. 
   But having given the President 90 percent, he should have been willing to accommodate to the 10-percent change in our priorities without demanding to control every semicolon in the bill. I think we met him more than halfway when we gave him $2.7 billion for school construction and for teachers, but we said this ought to be local control if the local district needed something more. 
   I was interested to hear what the Senator from Nevada had to say about the Las Vegas school system, its expanded school system and its need for schools. I can understand the need in Las Vegas for schools. However, I have a hard time understanding why Las Vegas schools ought to be paid for from Washington by the American taxpayers. 
   If there is one area in the country which has a tax base to support their local needs, it is Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the gambling capital of the world, and I say that with respect. I have been there. I haven't gambled, but I have been there. They have an enormous tax base. If we are putting up $1.4 billion for school construction in the big bond issue for American cities such as Las Vegas where they can afford it themselves, I have grave questions as to whether we ought to be doing that. But we did it. 
   We presented it for the President. The President's men wouldn't come to a compromise. So what has happened is all the bills are finished except one bill. That bill can't be acted upon until Tuesday at the earliest. And the President is keeping us here to make a political point. 
   My preference would be, as Senator STEVENS said yesterday on the floor, he was considering amending the continuing resolution to provide for a 4-day continuing resolution which would carry us to Tuesday just to send to the President; then let the President sign it or veto it. 
   The difficulty with that is that the Government of the United States, the executive and legislative branches, are not exactly held in high esteem by the American people. And my instinct is that if we got into that sort of a situation, a game of chicken, a game which resembles a childish food fight, the people of America would say a plague on both of your Houses. It reminds me just a little bit of the confrontation that Piazza had with the Yankee pitcher. Piazza decided not to confront the Yankee pitcher after he threw a bat at Piazza. I think Piazza did the right thing, although people criticized him for not confronting the Yankee pitcher. 
   We are in a situation where the President is keeping us here so he can make a political point to try to have a democratically controlled Senate and a democratically controlled House and win the Presidency. We are not here doing the business of the people. We would be doing the business of the people if we attended our regular schedules and were free to do constructive work instead of sit around here on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 
   I do believe, Mr. President--speaking to the President of the Senate, Senator BENNETT, who is presiding--we have been intimidated. The President is doing this as a form of punishment, a form of humiliation. We have a lot of very delicate relationships with the executive branch. It has to linger in the background among some minds as to just what the executive branch is doing, whether they are operating in good faith. 
   I say bluntly, keeping the Congress in session without any purpose is the worst of bad faith. We will do our job notwithstanding the executive branch and the President's men and women exercising the worst of bad faith, but we won't forget about it. 
   I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Congressman JOHN EDWARD PORTER who, after two decades of service in the House of Representatives, will retire at the end of this session. 
   Since 1994, when JOHN PORTER became Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and I took over as Chairman of the Senate Labor, HHS and Education Subcommittee, we have spent untold hours working together on what is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation to be voted on by Congress each year. 
   During his tenure, JOHN PORTER has earned a reputation as a champion of education, family planning, and disease prevention and control programs. But he is perhaps most recognized as a passionate and tireless advocate for the National Institutes of Health. Anyone who has spent time with him undoubtedly knows that he considers medical research to be one of our Nation's highest priorities. He makes no secret of his commitment, calling medical research ``our greatest hope for effectively treating, curing and eventually preventing disease and thereby saving our country billions of dollars in annual health care costs.'' 
   I share JOHN's passion for the NIH. I have said many times that it is the crown jewel of the Federal government. Over the past six years, he and I, working alongside my distinguished colleague TOM HARKIN, have increased funding for biomedical research by $9.4 billion. In 1998, we made a commitment to double federal funding for the NIH over five years. And with this year's increase of $2.7 billion, we are on track to reach that goal by 2003. Even though JOHN will no longer be in the Congress, I know that he will continue to help us fulfill that promise. 
   JOHN's commitment to medical research has earned him high praise from numerous scientific, medical and research organizations. Among the many honors bestowed on him, the American Medical Association recently honored him with the Nathan Davis Award as ``Outstanding U.S. Representative.'' The American Federation of Clinical Research honored him with its ``Distinguished Friend of Medical Research,'' Public Service Award. 
   JOHN's interests reach beyond medical research. He is the co-founder of the Congressional Coalition on Population and Development, an organization that advocates and defends international and domestic voluntary family planning programs. He is also a dedicated supporter of the arts and humanities, and since 1999 has served on the Board of Directors of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
   JOHN has an impressive education background: He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received his undergraduate degree from Northwestern University. Following service in the U.S. Army, he received his law degree from the University of Michigan. He served three terms in the Illinois House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to his public service, JOHN was an attorney private practice in Evanston, Illinois. 
   Today, I want to pay a special tribute to JOHN by recommending that the neuroscience building on the campus of the National Institutes of Health be named the JOHN Edward Porter National Neuroscience Center. This building will be a fitting tribute to a man who has devoted so much towards finding ways to prevent disease and improve the quality of life of all Americans. 
   To JOHN PORTER, I say, you have carried out your responsibilities with skill  born of rich experience and insight born of deep compassion. I want to offer to you my gratitude for the character, courage and dedication with which you have served the people of the tenth district of Illinois and the country. I wish you the best as you begin the next chapter of your life.

   Mr. SPECTER. I think the arguments by the Senator from North Dakota require some response. If I could have the attention of the Senator from North Dakota? I know the number of the White House. I called it last night in an effort to try to resolve the outstanding differences on the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the subcommittee of appropriations which I chair. 
   When the Senator from North Dakota talks about insufficient money for discretionary spending, that is not necessarily true. In our subcommittee, on those three Departments we met the President's figure, $106.2 billion. We have structured our priorities somewhat differently. He wanted $2.7 billion for school construction and for more teachers. We gave that to him. But we added a very appropriate proviso, and that is, if the local boards decide they have sufficient of those items, they can use it for something else. 
   The grave difficulty here has been, since the Government was closed, there has been a radical shift in power between the Congress and the President. Now the President expects everything on the threat of a veto. If he is going to veto something, that means the Congress has to cave to him and knuckle to him. We are proceeding in a nonconstitutional way. We have the executive branch in our legislative discussions before we arrive at our bills, and then we have a situation where the President has to have his way. There is no such thing as compromise. We are discussing language----

   Mr. SPECTER. No. 
   We are discussing the issue of schoolteachers. Last year, in the middle of the night, there was a compromise which went around this Senator, the chairman of the subcommittee, and I am not prepared to take that unacceptable language. But it is a high-handed demand. We are not going to retreat from last year's language on a program the President thinks is important. 
   We need to go back on track, and that is to follow the Constitution and submit our bills to the President. The Congress has the primary authority and responsibility for assessing priorities. We have the purse strings, it says in the Constitution. But that is not the way it is functioning today. 
   When the President comes to Capitol Hill and issues a dictatorial statement that he is not going to sign continuing resolutions for longer than a day, fine, let him stay in town. It will be quite a change for the President's schedule if he stays in town to sign these continuing resolutions day in and day out.  It is time the Congress stopped being blamed for everything. 
   If the American people understood where we stand on my bill, that the President got the full sum he asked for, there is a difference in priorities--I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes, Mr. President.

   Mr. SPECTER. If the American people knew we met the President's figure of $106.2 billion but we think the National Institutes of Health ought to have a priority--we have raised them $1.7 billion more than the President, we have given more money 
   to special education--I think if the American people knew that, they would say those are more important priorities. 
   If the American people knew that we want to retain local control so school boards can spend the money the way they see fit on the local level if they do not think the President's priorities are preferable, that they prefer local control to a Washington, DC, bureaucratic straitjacket, then we could have that decision. 
   But this Senator is not at all concerned about 1-day continuing resolutions. I am prepared to stay here a lot longer than is the President. 
   I yield for a question.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the pending legislation, which will fund three major Departments in the United States: The Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. 
   I chair the subcommittee in the Senate Appropriations Committee which has the responsibility for this legislation. I am very concerned about what is happening to our constitutional process. I think it not an overstatement to say that we have a constitutional crisis in what is happening with the appropriations process in the relationship between the Congress and the President of the United States. 
   Since the Government was closed in late 1995 and early 1996, there has been created a very significant imbalance between the Congress and the President with what is realistically viewed as practically a dictatorial system of the President saying what is acceptable and the Congress being held hostage, in effect, concerned about being blamed for shutting down the Government. That is not the way the Constitution was written. 
   The Congress is supposed to present the bills to the President. If the President vetoes, then there are negotiations and discussions as to what will happen. But the status of events today is that the President calls the tune and the Congress simply complies. 
   There is also a significant deviation because, contrary to constitutional provision, the President and the President's men and women participate in the legislative process. The Constitution says that each House shall pass a bill; there will be a conference committee; they will agree; and each House will then vote on the conference report; and, if approved, the bill is submitted to the President. 
   The constitutional process does not call for the executive branch to participate in deciding what will be in the bills. But for many years now, representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, sit in on the conferences, are a party to the process, and seek to determine in advance what will be acceptable to the executive branch, contrary to the constitutional setup where Congress is supposed to pass the bills and submit them to the President. 
   We have had a very difficult time in the last 3 years with what has happened with the appropriations bill covering Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. I spoke at some length about this problem on October 14, 1998, as we worked for the appropriations bill which turned out to be an omnibus bill. I was so concerned about the process that I voted against that bill. That was a tough vote to make since there were so many items on financing education which were very important and with which I agreed, and on financing Health and Human Services, again, which were important and with which I agreed, and on financing the Department of Labor, again, which were important and with which I agreed; but I felt so strongly that I voted against the bill and spoke at some length, as the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD will reflect on page S12536, on October 14th of 1998. 
   Then on November 9, 1999, I again expressed my concerns about what the appropriations process comprehended as set forth in some detail on S14340 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   This year, again, I am very concerned about where we are headed. The President submitted requests for these Departments for $106.2 billion. The Senate bill has provided the total amount which the President requested, but we have established some different priorities. That, under the Constitution, is the congressional prerogative. The Constitution calls for the Congress to control the purse strings and to establish the priorities. Of course, the President has to approve. But here again, the Constitution does not make the President the dominant player in this process; the Congress is supposed to traditionally control the purse strings. 
   Working collaboratively with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator TOM HARKIN, we produced a bipartisan bill. I learned a long time ago that if you want to get something done in Washington, you have to be willing to cross party lines. Senator HARKIN and I have done that. When the Democrats controlled the Senate, he chaired and I was ranking member; and with Republican control, I have the privilege, honor, to chair, and he is the ranking member. We have taken a very strong stand on appropriations for the National Institutes of Health, which I believe are the crown jewel of the Federal Government, maybe the only jewel of the Federal Government. This year we have increased funding for NIH by $2.7 billion, which is $1.7 billion more than the President's priority. Last year we appropriated $2.3 billion on an increase which, with an across-the-board cut, was reduced to $2.2 billion. The year before, it was a billion, and the year before that, almost a billion. So that we have added some--it is $2.7 billion this year, 2.2 last year, 2.0 the year before, a billion the year before that, and almost a billion the year before that. So that we have added $8 billion. I think it adds up to $8 billion; when you deal with all these zeros, sometimes they are not too easy to add up in your head. 
   The Senate approved that, and the House approved that. We think with the enormous progress made on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and heart disease, and so many others, that is where the priorities should be. We also put in $1 billion more on special education than the President had in his budget, a matter of some concern to many in the Senate. With the leadership of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, who is now presiding, we put extra funding there because we think that is where the priorities ought to be. Then the President made a request for $2.7 billion for school construction and new teachers. There is a lot of controversy in the Republican-controlled Senate about whether these are appropriate Federal functions, but we ended up, in a carefully crafted bill, giving the President his priorities, with an addendum that if the local school district decided they did not need the money for construction, that the local school districts could allocate it to local needs. And if the local school districts decided they did not need the money for teachers, they would give it to local needs. 
   The President has resisted this. This is a very fundamental difference in governmental philosophy, a Washington, DC, bureaucratic straitjacket versus local control--according to the President, the first call for his own programs on construction of schools and on more teachers. 
   We worked very hard this year and the Senate returned a bill which was passed on June 30, which tied a record going back to June 30, 1976, when the fiscal year 1977 appropriations bill was passed. Then we completed the conference with the House, where we had it all set on July 27, which I think may have established a new record. I am not sure about that. And we did not add the final signature to the conference report  because we didn't want to be in a position where the bill was sent to the President in August and 
   held up there, but we finished all of our work. 
   Regrettably, this bill has not been presented to the President because of the efforts on negotiations with the White House to try to get a bill which the President could sign. I repeat, I think it is a mistake, constitutionally and procedurally, to do that. We ought to send the President the bill. 
   There have been, candidly, concerns within the Republican leadership where we have had bicameral meetings between the House and the Senate, the leadership, on precisely what should be done. It is my urging to my colleagues in the Senate and the House that we should stand by our bill of $106.2 billion, which is as much as the President asked for, and we should stand by our priorities, which give $600 million more to education. There is no higher priority in America than education. And we should stand by our priority of according $1.7 billion more to the National Institutes of Health. We should stand by our approach of giving the President what he asked for on teachers and school construction, subject to local determination if the local boards decide they do not want it for those purposes. But we ought not to buy our way out of town and to knuckle to the President and cave to the President. We ought to assert our legislative institutional standing. 
   This bill could have been presented to the White House in early September. This Senator has pressed consistently in leadership meetings to present the bill to the President. It is my hope we will do that. 
   I am not unaware of the fact that this is October 17 and that the Presidential election will be held 3 weeks from today. But I think we are dealing with values and principles here, constitutional principles which are paramount, and we ought to assert our legislative prerogatives and submit the bill to the President. There might be an opportunity for a national debate on this subject. Certainly it is worth an effort. 
   There is no doubt that the President has the so-called bully pulpit, but there is a lot of concern in America on what the funding is going to be for the Departments involved here, not only the Department of Labor but certainly the Department of Education and certainly the Department of Health and Human Services. We ought to lay down a marker. We ought to lay down the gauntlet, and we ought to ask America to join in a debate to see where America's priorities lie. 
   My own instinct is that we have the high ground here and we have the better case. So I hope the Congress will submit this bill to the President, will engage in that debate, and will assert our constitutional prerogatives to legislate. I think we have a good chance to have this bill finally enacted into law, or if it is vetoed, with some national debate, something very close to it. 
   In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
   The clerk will call the roll. 
   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to commend the distinguished Senator from Mississippi for his leadership in producing a very sound Agriculture Appropriations bill. I have served with the Senator from Mississippi on that subcommittee for almost 20 years now and have participated in the conference just concluded which has produced this bill. I can personally attest to the professionalism, courtesy, and, perhaps most of all, the patience displayed by the Senator from Mississippi in presiding over those proceedings. 
   The public has little opportunity to know what goes on in the legislative process generally, but they do hear about the introduction of bills and they do see, on C-SPAN and otherwise, the committee meetings and the questioning of witnesses, and to some extent they see on C-SPAN II, to the extent anybody watches, what happens on the Senate floor. But the conferences are largely unseen by the public. That is crunch time, when the work is concluded. Everything else which is done is really of much less significance than the conferences, where the final touches are put on legislation which constitutes the laws of the country. 
   There are very long sessions. A week ago last night was illustrative of the point. The speeches tend to go very long. The presiding chairman has to have great patience, to have the proper balance between allowing every member to speak and getting the work completed. That conference had some very difficult issues, issues which related to relieving sanctions on Cuba, to allow more importations of food, and it went into an issue which is highly sensitive, where there really ought to be an evaluation as to our relations with Cuba. We did take a step in the right direction on releasing the sanctions as to food--really, largely as an economic matter for America's farmers. 
   In the foreign operations bill there is a provision, which this Senator introduced, to try to get more cooperation on drug interdiction, which the Cuban Government is willing to do. Then we had important provisions on reimportation of drugs, on which the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. JEFFORDS, who is now presiding, was the leader. 
   It has come to pass that the appropriations bills, now, are the principal legislative vehicles, so to speak, for getting substantive legislation because it is only the appropriations bills, ultimately, which pass. So much of that is done in conference as opposed to amendments on the floor, which is the prescribed way. 
   The senior Senator from Mississippi presided at that conference, and we produced a very important bill. As I have heard him report on it today, I am struck by its promise and its importance for the American people under his leadership. 
   In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss legislation arising from the investigation by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which has been conducting oversight on the way the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have responded to allegations of espionage in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. This bipartisan proposal will improve the counterintelligence procedures used to detect and defeat efforts by foreign governments to gain unlawful access to our top national security information by improving the way that allegations of espionage are investigated and, where appropriate, prosecuted. 
   Together with Senators TORRICELLI, GRASSLEY, THURMOND, SESSIONS, SCHUMER, FEINGOLD, BIDEN, HELMS and LEAHY, I introduced the Counterintelligence Reform Act on February 24 of this year. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the bill on May 18, and it was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which also deals with espionage matters. 
   The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously reported the bill on July 20, and has included the measure as an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization bill which passed the Senate today. 
   Few tasks are more important than protecting our national security, so building and maintaining bipartisan support for this legislation to correct the problems we identified during the course of our oversight was my top priority. The reforms contained in this legislation will ensure that the problems we found are fixed, and that the national security is better protected in the future. 
   To understand why this legislation is necessary, I would like to review two of the cases that the subcommittee looked at--the Wen Ho Lee case and the Peter Lee case. Former Los Alamos scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee was arrested on December 10, 1999, and charged with 59 counts of violating the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and unlawful gathering and retention of national defense information. In a stunning reversal on September 13, the government accepted a deal in which Dr. Lee would plead guilty to one count of unlawfully retaining national defense information and would be sentenced to time served, in exchange for telling what he had done with the tapes. There remains a question as to whether Department of Justice officials tried to make up for their blunders in this case by throwing the book at Dr. Lee. The Judiciary Subcommittee on Department of Justice Oversight will continue to hold hearings on this matter, but it has been clear from the beginning that the Department of Justice bungled the investigation of Dr. Lee. 
   The critical turning point in this case came on August 12, 1997, when the Department of Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) turned down an FBI application for an electronic surveillance warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. OIPR believed that the application was deficient because it did not show sufficient probable cause, and therefore decided not to let the application go forward to the special FISA court. 
   In making this determination, the DoJ made several key errors. The Department of Justice used an unreasonably high standard for determining probable cause, a standard that is inconsistent with Supreme Court rulings on this issue. For example, one of the concerns raised by OIPR attorney 
   Allan Kornblum was that the FBI had not shown that the Lees were the ones who passed the W-88 information to the PRC, to the exclusion of all the other possible suspects identified by the DoE Administrative Inquiry. That is the standard for establishing guilt at a trial, not for establishing probable cause to issue a search warrant. 
   DoJ was also wrong when Mr. Kornblum concluded that there was not enough to show that the Lees were ``presently engaged in clandestine intelligence activities.'' The information provided by the FBI made it clear that Dr. Lee's relevant activities continued from the 1980s to 1992, 1994 and 1997, yet that was deemed to be too stale, and the DoJ refused to send the FBI's surveillance request to the FISA court. 
   When FBI Assistant Director John Lewis raised the FISA problem with the Attorney General on August 20, 1997, she delegated a review of the matter to Mr. Dan Seikaly, who had virtually no experience in FISA issues. It is not surprising then, that Mr. Seikaly again applied the wrong standard for probable cause. He used the criminal standard, which requires that the facility in question be used in the commission of an offense, and with which he was more familiar, rather than the relevant FISA standard which simply requires that the facility ``is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.'' 
   The importance of DoJ's erroneous interpretation of the law as it applied to probable cause in this case should not be underestimated. Had the warrant been issued, and had the FBI been permitted to conduct electronic surveillance on Dr. Lee, the Government would probably not be in the position--as it is now--of trying to ascertain what really happened to the information that Dr. Lee downloaded. There should be no doubt that transferring classified information to an unclassified computer system and making unauthorized tape copies of that information--seven of which contain highly classified information and remain unaccounted for--created a substantial opportunity for foreign intelligence services to access our most important nuclear secrets. 
   The FISA warrant could have and should have been issued at several points, some before and some after it was rejected in 1997. Each key event where the FISA warrant was not requested and issued represents another lost opportunity to protect the national security. For example, Dr. Lee was identified by the Department of Energy's Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Recording system (NADIR) in 1993 for having downloaded a huge volume of files. 
   As the name of the system implies, it is designed to detect unusual computer activity and look out for possible intruders into the computer. Individuals who monitored the lab's computers knew that Dr. Lee's activities had generated a report from the NADIR system, but didn't do anything about it. They didn't even talk to him. An opportunity to correct a problem, to protect national security, just slipped away. 
   In 1994, Lee's massive downloading would have again showed up on NADIR, but DoE security people never took action. Now, we're told, they can't even find records of what happened. Yet another missed opportunity to protect the national security by looking into what was going on. 
   When Wen Ho Lee took a polygraph in December 1998, DoE misrepresented the results of this test to the FBI. DoE told the FBI that Dr. Lee passed this polygraph when, in fact, he had failed. This error sent the FBI off 
   the trail for two months. 
   When Wen Ho Lee failed a polygraph on February 10, 1999, the FISA warrant should have been immediately requested and granted. It wasn't. 
   The need for legislation to address these problems is obvious. The unclassified information on this case shows clearly that it was mishandled. The classified files make that point even more clear. Last year the Attorney General asked an Assistant U.S. Attorney with substantial experience in prosecuting espionage cases to review the Wen Ho Lee matter. That prosecutor, Mr. Randy Bellows, conducted a thorough review of the case and confirmed all of our major findings: the case was badly mishandled, the FISA request should have gone forward to the court. The list goes on. Our counter-intelligence system failed in this case, and the information at risk  is too important to let this dismal state of affairs continue. 
   The Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 will help to ensure that future investigations are conducted in a more thorough and effective manner. Among the key provisions in this legislation is one that amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, by requiring that, upon the request of the Director of the FBI, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense or the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General shall personally review a FISA application. If the Attorney General decides not to forward the application to the FISA court, that decision must be communicated in writing to the requesting official, with recommendations for improving the showing of probable cause, or whatever defect OIPR is concerned with. 
   Under this legislation, when a senior official who is authorized to make FISA requests goes to the Attorney General for a personal review, that senior official must personally supervise the implementation of the recommendations. This provision will ensure that when the national security is at stake, and where there is a serious disagreement over how to proceed, the Attorney General and other senior officials are the ones who work together to resolve disputes, and that the matter is not delegated to attorneys who have never worked with FISA before. 
   The Counterintelligence Reform Act also addresses the matter of whether an individual is ``presently engaged'' in a particular activity to ensure that genuine acts of espionage which are belatedly discovered are not improperly eliminated from consideration. As FISA is currently worded, it is possible for someone like Mr. Kornblum to conclude that actions as recent as a couple of years ago or even a few months are too stale to contribute to a finding of probable cause. Although I do not agree with Mr. Kornblum's interpretation of the law, I am confident that the changes contained in the Counterintelligence Reform Act will make it clear that activities within a reasonable period of time can be considered in determining probable cause. 
   The investigation of Dr. Lee was also mishandled in the field, where the FBI and the Department of Energy often failed to communicate. For example, after OIPR rejected the FBI's 1997 FISA application, the FBI told the Department of Energy that there was no longer an investigative reason to leave Dr. Lee in place, and that the DoE should do whatever was necessary to protect the national security. Unfortunately, no action was taken by DoE until December 1998, some 14 months after the FBI had said it was no longer necessary to have him in place for investigative reasons. 
   To address this problem, and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding about when the subject of an espionage investigation should be removed from classified access, the Counterintelligence Reform Act requires that decisions of this nature be communicated in writing. The bill requires the Director of the FBI to submit to the head of the department or agency concerned a written assessment of the potential impact of the actions of the department or agency on a counterintelligence investigation. The head of the affected agency will be required to respond in writing to the recommendation of the FBI. This requirement with ensure that what happened in the Wen Ho Lee case--where the FBI said he could be removed from access but the Energy Department didn't pull his clearance for another 14 months--won't happen again. 
   To avoid the kind of problems that happened when the DoE ordered a Wackenhut polygraph in December 1998, this legislation prohibits agencies from interfering in FBI espionage investigations. 
   The provisions of this bill will make an important contribution to improving the way counter-intelligence investigations are conducted. The subcommittee's investigation of the Wen Ho Lee case has made it abundantly clear that improvements in these procedures are necessary, and the reforms outlined in this legislation are specifically tailored to provide real solutions to real problems. 
   The subcommittee also looked at the espionage case of Dr. Peter Lee, who pleaded guilty in 1997 to passing classified nuclear secrets to the Chinese in 1985. According to a 17 February 1998 ``Impact Statement'' prepared by experts from the Department of Energy,  
   The ICF data provided by Dr. [Peter] Lee was of significant material assistance to the PRC in their nuclear weapons development program. ..... For that reason, this analysis indicates that Dr. Lee's activities have directly enhanced the PRC nuclear weapons program to the detriment of U.S. national security.  
   Dr. Peter Lee also confessed to giving the Chinese classified anti-submarine warfare information on two occasions in 1997. Under the terms of the plea agreement the Department of Justice offered to Peter Lee, however, he got no jail time. He served one year in a half-way house, did 3,000 hours of community service and paid a $20,000 fine. Considering the magnitude of his offenses and his failure to comply with the terms of the plea agreement--which required his complete cooperation--the interests of the United States were not served by this outcome. 
   The subcommittee's review of the Peter Lee case led to the inevitable conclusion that better coordination between the Department of Justice, the investigating agency--which is normally the FBI--and the victim agency is necessary to ensure that the process works to protect the national security. One of the problems we saw in this case was the reluctance of the Department of the Navy to support the prosecution of Dr. Peter Lee. A Navy official, Mr. John Schuster, produced a memo that seriously undermined the Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute the case. This memorandum was based on incomplete information and did not reflect the full scope of what Dr. Peter Lee confessed to having revealed. As a consequence of the breakdown of communications between the Navy and the prosecution team, the 1997 revelations were not included as part of the plea agreement. 
   This legislation contains a provision that will ensure better coordination in espionage cases by requiring the Department of Justice to conduct briefings so that the affected agency will understand what is happening with the case, and will understand how the Classified Information 
   Procedures Act, or CIPA, can be used to protect classified information even while carrying out a prosecution. In these briefings Department of Justice lawyers will be required to explain the right of the government to make in camera presentations to the judge and to make interlocutory appeals of the judge's rulings. These procedures are unique to CIPA, and the affected agency needs to understand that taking the case to trial won't necessarily mean revealing classified information. The Navy's position, as stated in the Schuster memo, that ``bringing attention to our sensitivity concerning this subject in a public forum could cause more damage to the national security that the original disclosure,'' was simply wrong. It was based on incomplete information and a misunderstanding of how the case could have been taken to trial without endangering national security. The provisions of this legislation which require the Department of Justice to keep the victim agency fully and currently informed of the status of the prosecution, and to explain how CIPA can be used to take espionage cases to trial without damaging the national security, will ensure that the mistakes of the Peter Lee case are not repeated. 
   I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who have worked with me and the cosponsors of this bill. I am confident that the reforms we are about to pass will significantly improve the way espionage cases are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted. 
   I yield the floor.

The Times article details the specifics on the positions held by Mr. Ball in the lawyers associations, his professorial associations as a teacher, his experience as a criminal lawyer, and his experience, most pointedly, as one of the senior counsel to the Warren Commission, the President's commission which investigated the assassination of President Kennedy. It was on the Warren Commission staff that I came to know Joe Ball. 
   The original complexion of the Warren Commission on staffing was that there were six senior counsel who were appointed and six junior counsel. That distinction was replaced by putting all of the lawyers under the category of assistant counsel. But if there was a senior counsel, it was Joe Ball. 
   Then, in his early sixties, he was a tower of strength for the younger lawyers. When the commission began its work, I was 33. Most of the junior lawyers were about the same age. We looked to Joe Ball for his experience and for his guidance. He had a special relationship with Chief Justice Earl Warren, which was also helpful because Joe Ball could find out what Chief Justice Warren had in mind in his capacity as chairman and provide some valuable insights that some of the younger lawyers were unable to attain. 
   Joe Ball worked on what was called area two, along with the very distinguished younger lawyer, David Belin from Des Moines, IA. Area two was the area which was structured to identify the assassin. Although the initial reports had identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin, and on television, on November 24, America saw Jack Ruby walk into the Dallas police station, put a gun in Oswald's stomach and kill him, the Warren Commission started off its investigation without any presumptions but looking at the evidence to make that determination as to who the assassin was. 
   My area was area one, which involved the activities of the President on November 22, 1963. There was substantial interaction between the work that Joe Ball and Dave Belin did and the work which was assigned to me and Francis W.H. Adams, who was senior counsel on area one. 
   Frank Adams had been New York City police commissioner and had been asked to join the Warren Commission staff when Mayor Wagner sat next to Chief Justice Warren at the funeral of former Governor and former Senator, Herbert Lehman. Mayor Wagner told Chief Justice Warren that Frank Adams, the police commissioner, knew a lot about Presidential protection and had designed protection for motorcades in New York City, with dangers from tall buildings, which was an analogy to what happened to President Kennedy. 
   There was question as to how we would coordinate our work, and it was sort of decided that Joe Ball and Dave Belin would investigate matters when the bullet left the rifle of the assassin in flight, which was no man's land, and when it struck the President. That came into area one, which was my area: the bullet wounds on President Kennedy, the bullet wounds on Governor Connally, what happened with the doctors at Parkland Hospital, what happened with the autopsy, all matters related to what had happened with President Kennedy. 
   We had scheduled the autopsy surgeons for a Monday in early March. They were Lieutenant Commander Boswell, Lieutenant Commander Humes and Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Finck. The autopsy was done at Bethesda, where President Kennedy was taken, because of the family's preference that he go to a naval installation because he was a Navy man, so to speak, who had served in the Navy. 
   The testimony was to be taken on this Monday in March. There was quite a debate going on with the Warren Commission staff as to whether we should talk to witnesses in advance. It seemed to many of us that we should talk to witnesses in advance so we would have an idea as to what they would testify to so we could have an orderly presentation, which is the way any lawyer talks to a witness whom he is about to call. The distinguished Presiding Officer has been a trial lawyer and knows very well to what I am referring. There was a segment on the Warren Commission staff which thought we should not talk to any witnesses in advance, lest there be some overtone of influencing their testimony. Finally, this debate had to come  to a head, and it came to a head the week before the autopsy searchers were to testify. 
   And on Friday afternoon, Joe Ball and I went out to Bethesda to talk to the autopsy surgeons. It was a Friday afternoon, much like a Friday afternoon in the Senate. Nobody else was around. It was my area, but I was looking for some company, so I asked Joe Ball to accompany me--the autopsy surgeons falling in my area. We took the ride out to Bethesda and met the commanding admiral and introduced ourselves. We didn't have any credentials. The only thing we had to identify ourselves as working on the Warren Commission was a building pass for the VFW. My building pass had my name typed crooked on the line, obviously having been typed in after it was signed. They sign them all and then type them in. It didn't look very official at all. 
   So when Commander Humes and Commander Bozwell came down to be interviewed, Commander Humes was very leery about talking to anybody. He had gone through some travail with having burned his notes and having been subjected to a lot of comment and criticism about what happened at the autopsy, and there were FBI agents present when the autopsy was conducted. A report had come out that the bullet that had entered the base of the President's neck had been dislodged during the autopsy by massage. It had fallen out backward as opposed to having gone through the President's body, which was what the medical evidence had shown. 
   That FBI report that the bullet had entered partially into the President's body and then been forced out had caused a lot of controversy before the whole facts were known. Later, it was determined that the first shot which hit the President--he was hit by two bullets--well, the second shot, which hit him in the base of the skull, was fatal, entering the base of the skull and exiting at the top at 13 centimeters, 5 inches--the fatal wound. The first bullet which hit the President passed between two large strap muscles, sliced the pleural cavity, hit nothing solid and came out, and Governor Connally was seated right in front of the President and the bullet would have to have hit either Governor Connally or someone in the limousine. 
   After extensive tests were conducted, it was concluded that the bullet hit Governor Connally. There has been a lot of controversy about the single bullet theory, but time has shown that it is correct. A lot of tests were conducted on the muzzle velocity of the Oswald rifle. It was identified as having been Oswald's, purchased from a Chicago mail order store. He came into the building with a large package which could have contained the rifle. He said they were curtain rods for an apartment which already had curtains. The muzzle velocity was about 2,200 feet per second, and the velocity after traveling about 275 feet was about 1,900 feet per second. 
   At any rate, as Joe Ball and I went through it with the autopsy surgeons, we found for the first time--because we had only seen the FBI reports--that the bullet did go through President Kennedy and decreased very little in velocity. It was at that moment when we talked to Dr. Humes and Dr. Finck that we came to hypothesize that that bullet might have gone through Governor Connally. We didn't come to a conclusion on that until we had reviewed very extensive additional notes, but it was on that occasion that Joe Ball and I had interviewed the autopsy surgeons. It was a marvel to watch Joe Ball work with his extensive experience as a lawyer and as a fact finder. 
   He lived to the ripe old age of 97. The New York Times obituary had very extensive compliments about a great deal of his work and focused on his contribution to the Warren Commission, where he had written an extensive portion of the Warren Report, as he was assigned to area two which compiled a fair amount of the report. 
   America has lost a great patriot in Joe Ball, a great citizen, a great lawyer, and a great contributor. I had the pleasure of knowing him and working with him on the Warren Commission staff and have had occasion to reminisce with him about his work. I noted that on his office wall in California is his elegantly framed building pass. 
   In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was not on the floor a few moments ago when the distinguished majority leader and the assistant leader for the Democrats had a colloquy when the majority leader propounded a unanimous consent request concerning legislation on stem cells. I think it useful to make a brief comment or two and then to have, if I might, a brief discussion with the majority leader about what will happen on the future of the bill. 
   The stem cell legislation in question would eliminate the prohibition now in effect which limits the use of Federal funds, principally from the National Institutes of Health, from paying for extracting stem cells from embryos. Once the stem cells have been extracted from embryos, then Federal funds may be used on their research, and private funds--if I might have the attention of the majority leader for a moment while we discuss the stem cell issue, as to what is going to happen next. Without describing the legislation--which I can in a minute--I ask the distinguished majority leader what he anticipates in the future. 
   When this issue to eliminate the limitation on funding was stricken from the appropriations bill last year, it was done so after I consulted with the majority leader because concluding it would have resulted in a filibuster and  tied up that appropriations bill. The majority leader made a commitment, which he has fulfilled today, to bring the bill to the floor. 
   It had been my hope that we would have had the bill on the floor at an earlier time, but I fully understand the complexities of the schedule; and once we had reached September, the only way to deal with the matter was on a limited time agreement to be obtained through unanimous consent. 
   So it is my hope that the intent and the thrust of what was proposed--I think intended--was that that the bill would be on the calendar and considered when we reconvened, when it would not have to be subjected to a unanimous consent request, but it might have to pass a filibuster vote on a motion to proceed.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for his statement. I appreciate his last statement that he doesn't necessarily agree with me, which leaves some room that he doesn't necessarily disagree with me. I am not looking for a response at this time. Senator LOTT is well known to have an open mind on controversial issues and on matters not debated. I agree with him when he says it is subject to passionate feelings on both sides. 
   We had debates and witnesses. We had seven hearings on this issue. We had Senator BROWNBACK, the principal opponent of the legislation, to testify, and Congressman JAY DICKEY, the principal opponent of the legislation in the House, to testify. 
   The hearings have always been balanced, and we have had people who have opposed the legislation at every one of the hearings. 
   It is a matter which is appropriate for the Senate to consider. I appreciate what the majority leader has said about giving consideration to an early listing next year, and not making a commitment on pressing a cloture motion. I think a cloture motion could be filed by any 17 Senators. But we are not going to get involved in that at this time. 
   But I did want to say for the RECORD why I believe it is important that the matter be considered. And it is because stem cells have such a remarkable opportunity to cure many of the most difficult maladies and diseases which confront America and the world today. These stem cells have the potential to be placed in the human body to replace other cells. 
   We had testimony, for example, from Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's. We had the experts testify that these stem cells could be enormously effective in curing Parkinson's. That is an obtainable goal perhaps in as early as 5 years. 
   The stem cells may also be useful on Alzheimer's disease, on strokes, on spinal cord injuries, perhaps on cancer, and perhaps on heart ailments. 
   There is virtually no limit to what these stem cells can do. They are a veritable fountain of youth. 
   I have said publicly that I understand those on the other side of the issue. It involves taking an embryo which has been created for purposes of in vitro fertilization but not used. These embryos are discarded. There are some 100,000 embryos in existence today which will not be used. So the issue is whether you simply discard these embryos which will have no further effect, or whether you use these embryos to produce stem cells which can cure many very serious maladies. 
   There are other alternatives such as adult stem cells. But the scientific evidence has been very compelling, in my judgment, that adult stem cells cannot do the job, but stem cells can from embryos. 
   There are also stem cells from fetal tissue. Those stem cells are limited, and we really need the stem cells from these embryos to provide the research opportunities to cure so many of these ailments. 
   This is not an issue which is going to lead to the creation of embryos for the purposes of extracting stem cells. When we have the fetal tissue discussion, many people are concerned that they will produce more abortions to have fetal tissue available. In fact, that was not the case--fetal tissue was used from abortions which would have occurred in any event. 
   It is not a controversial pro-life versus pro-choice issue as 
   we have had many Senators who are strongly pro-life support stem cell research in this legislation. Senator STROM THURMOND, who is very strongly pro-life and an acknowledged very conservative Senator, testified before the subcommittee in favor of this legislation to have Federal funding for extraction of stem cells from embryos. 
   Senator CONNIE MACK of Florida has spoken about this bill, another pro-life Senator speaking in favor of it. Very strong statements have come from Senator GORDON SMITH, who is pro-life and very concerned about these underlying issues, as to why he feels the balance is in favor of this sort of legislation. 
   Since the issue was mentioned and there is not another Senator on the floor seeking recognition, I thought I would explain in abbreviated form where this legislation is pending, and why I have been pressing. It comes naturally within the subcommittee of appropriations which I chair. 
   The prohibition against use of Federal funds to extract stem cells from embryos was placed in a bill which came out of this subcommittee. When the prohibition was imposed, there was no one who really knew the miraculous potential of stem cells, it being a veritable fountain of youth. This only came into existence with the research disclosed in November of 1998. Since that time, our subcommittee has had seven hearings to explore the issue very fully. 
   It is my hope that the matter will come before the Senate early next year. I appreciate what the majority leader has had to say. We will let the Senate work its will. Let us consider it. Let us debate it. Let us analyze it and come to judgment on it, which is our role as legislators, in a way which considers all of the claims and considers all of the positions but resolves the matter so that public policy will be determined in accordance with our constitutional standards and our legislative procedures. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
   In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain briefly an action that I, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, propose to take today with respect to a House-passed bill, H.R. 4864. I take this action with the concurrence and support of the committee's ranking member, Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER and Senator PATTY MURRAY, the original sponsor of Senate legislation, S. 1810, to reinstate VA's duty to assist claimants in the preparation of their claims. 
   In 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans claims issued a ruling, Morton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 477 (1999), which had the effect of barring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from offering its assistance to  veterans and other claimants in preparing and presenting their claims to VA prior to the veteran first accumulating sufficient evidence to show that his or her claim is ``well grounded.'' This decision overturned a long history of VA practice under which VA had taken upon itself a duty to assist veterans in gathering evidence and otherwise preparing their claims for VA adjudication. That practice was grounded in a long VA tradition of non-adversarial practice in the administrative litigation of veterans' claims. 
   For over a year, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs has worked to craft, and then to develop VA and veterans service organization support for, a legislative solution that returns VA to the pre-Morton status quo ante, and reinstates VA's duty to assist veterans and other claimants in the preparation of their claims. The product of the Senate committee's work is contained in section 101 of S. 1810, a bill which was approved by the Senate on September 21, 2000. Since S. 1810 was reported, however, committee staff has worked with the staff of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee to reconcile the provisions of section 101 of S. 1810 and a similar bill, H.R. 4864, which passed the House of Representatives on July 25, 2000. 
   The Senate and House committees have now reached such an agreement, and have reconciled the differences between the Senate- and House-passed provisions. Those differences--which are, principally, matters of tone and emphasis, not substance--are contained in the proposed amendment to H.R. 4864 which I present to the Senate today and which is explained in detail in the staff-prepared joint explanatory statement which I have filed with the amendment's text. This compromise agreement has been reached after extensive consultation with VA's general counsel and the major veterans service organizations. 
   I now ask that the Senate approve this compromise agreement by approving the proposed amendments to H.R. 4864. The House will then be in a position to approve the Senate-passed amendments to the House bill and send this legislation to the President for his signature.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation on behalf of Senator BIDEN and myself, a bill which, succinctly stated, would provide the following: The Supreme Court of the United States shall permit television coverage of all open sessions of the Court unless the Court decides by a vote of the majority of Justices that allowing such coverage in a particular case will constitute a violation of the due process rights of one or more of the parties before the Court. 
   I will summarize that lengthy statement because of time limitations. The statement contains the citations of the cases referred to and the specific quotations which I shall cite. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to open to public view what the Supreme Court of the United States does in rendering important decisions. It is grounded on the proposition that since the Supreme Court of the United States has assumed the power to decide the cutting-edge questions on public policy today and has in effect become virtually a ``super legislature'' in taking on the decisions on these public policy issues, that the public has a right to know what the Supreme Court is doing, and that right would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public would be able to see and hear the kinds of issues which the Court is deciding. The public would then have an insight into those issues to be able to follow what the Court decides after the due course of the Court's deliberations. 
   In a very fundamental sense, the televising of the Supreme Court has been implicitly recognized--perhaps even sanctioned--by a 1980 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in a case captioned Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 
   where the Supreme Court noted that a public trial belongs not only to the accused, but to the public and the press as well; and that people now acquire information on court procedures chiefly through the print and electronic media. 
   That decision, in referencing the electronic media, perhaps might be said to anticipate televising court proceedings, although I do not mean to suggest that the Supreme Court is in agreement with this legislation. It might be appropriate to note at this juncture that the Court could, on its own motion, televise its proceedings but has chosen not to do so, which presents, in my view, the necessity for legislation on this subject. 
   If one goes to the chambers of the Supreme Court, which are right across the green here in the Capitol complex, one may enter and observe the Court's arguments because they are public. Newspaper reporters are permitted to be in the Court. No cameras are permitted in the Court, of even still pictures, so when television wishes to characterize an argument, they have to send in an artist to have an artist's renderings. 
   When I argued the case of the Navy Yard back in 1964, the Court proceedings were illustrated by an artist's drawings. But in the year 2000, when the public gets a substantial portion, if not most, of its information from television, the availability strictly to the print media, is insufficient to give the public a real idea as to what is going on in the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   The Supreme Court has traditionally had an agenda. It is really nothing new. The Warren Court vastly expanded criminal rights. In the year 2000, I think no one would question at least some of the Warren Court's decisions, saying that anybody who is being prosecuted in a criminal proceeding has a right to counsel. It is really surprising to note that before 1963, the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the defendant in a criminal case did not have a right to counsel except in murder cases. 
   There is no doubt that the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1930s had an agenda in striking down New Deal legislation. And then, in a historic move, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, an enormously popular President in the mid- to late 1930's, very unhappy about the Supreme Court's activism in striking down New Deal legislation by five to four decisions--President Roosevelt suggested packing the Court by adding six additional Justices. There was quite a public reaction adverse to that proposal. Perhaps the Supreme Court of the United States had more public attention at that particular time than at any other time in its history. 
   In the face of what was happening, a Supreme Court Justice, Owen J. Roberts, who happened to be from Philadelphia, my hometown, decided to change his position and to support and hold constitutional the New Deal legislation leading to the famous phrase ``a switch in time saves nine,'' from the old adage about ``a stitch in time saves nine.'' The switch by Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, it is said, saved the nine-person constituency of the Supreme Court. 
   The Rehnquist Court, I submit, is unusually activist in pursuing its agenda. The Court has stricken acts of Congress, saying:  
   No Congressman or Senator purported to present a considered judgment,  
   Or striking acts of Congress saying there was a:  
   lack of legislative attention to the statute at issue,  
   Or striking an act of Congress saying the legislation was:  
   *.*.* an unwarranted response to perhaps an inconsequential problem,  
   Or declaring an act of Congress unconstitutional saying:  
   Congress had virtually no reason to believe [that the statute was well founded.]  
   There is no effort here to challenge the authority of the 
   Supreme Court of the United States to have the final word. That has been established since Marbury v. Madison in 1803. I believe it is necessary that the Supreme Court of the United States have the final word on interpreting the Constitution and beyond that on saying what is a constitutional question. But given the breadth of the Court's authority and given the sweeping scope of what the Court is doing, the point is that there ought to be public knowledge and there ought to be a public response. Because I think it is fair to say that the Court is aware and does watch the public response, and it ought to really be a factor in whatever the Court decides to do--again, recognizing that the Court has the final say. 
   In June of 1999, the Supreme Court curtailed congressional authority in favor of the rights of States to sovereign immunity on patents and copyrights, not withstanding the express constitutional grant of authority to Congress to regulate patents and copyrights. Those cases led former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, formerly a professor and a leading constitutional scholar, to describe these cases as:  
   *.*.* one of the three or four major shifts in constitutionalism we have seen in the last three centuries.  
   Those particular cases were subject to very substantial criticism by Professor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, commenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education v College Savings Bank:  
   *.*.* the decision makes no sense,  
   Asserting that it arises from a:  
   *.*.* bizarre States' rights agenda that really has nothing to do with intellectual property.  
   The Court's decisions have moved, as I have noted, really onto the cutting edge of so many of the critical issues which are matters of great national concern. The Court has decided issues from birth to death and the vital issues in between, making the decision on the constitutional right to an abortion; making decisions on how the death penalty will be imposed; making decisions on the questions of freedom of religion, as illustrated by the case of City of Boerne v. Flores, where the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 
   Freedom of religion, of online speech, in Reno v. ACLU, the Court struck down two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1998; Prince v. United States, the Court, by a 5-to-4 decision, reversed some six decades of firmly established constitutional authority on the supremacy of Federal laws over States under the commerce clause. And, in the Lopez case in 1995, the Supreme Court of the United  States invalidated congressional authority, which had been intact for some 60 years under the commerce clause. 
   So we have seen the expansion of the authority of the Supreme Court of the United States in so many lines, really, taking on the aura and the perspective of a superlegislature. 
   Justice Felix Frankfurter perhaps anticipated the day when the Supreme Court arguments would be televised when he said that he longed for a day when:  
   The news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly as it did the World Series, since the public confidence in the judiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and that perception necessarily hinges on the media's portrayal of the legal system.  
   It is interesting to note that the columns of the Senate match up exactly with the columns of the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   In the early deliberations on the Constitution, there were proposals that Supreme Court Justices ought to be appointed by the Senate. I am not sure quite how that would have worked out given our large groupings and how we would go about making those decisions, but that was once thought about. 
   There was a constitutional amendment proposed that would have allowed Supreme Court decisions to be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, a proposal which I think would have been very unwise and did not get very far. 
   The Senate does have the constitutional authority on confirmation of Supreme Court Justices, perhaps our most important function as so many major decisions have been decided by a single vote on 5-4 decisions: 79 such decisions in the past 5 years; 20 such decisions in the last term of the Court. 
   The Court has been a strong point in our historical development, but as the Court has expanded into areas traditionally reserved for Congress, functioning virtually as a superlegislature, without in any way challenging the independence of the Court, the independence of the Federal judiciary, I do believe it is appropriate for the Congress to speak on the operation of the Court. 
   The Congress has the authority to establish the number of Justices so that if the Congress chose, we could expand the number beyond nine or curtail it. The Congress has established the number six as a quorum for the Court. The Congress has the authority to establish the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States and, in the landmark case of Ex parte McCardle, decided that the jurisdiction of the Court could be curtailed even on constitutional grounds. Frankly, I do not think that 1868 decision would stand today as to the authority of the Congress to curtail the jurisdiction of the Court on constitutional grounds, but during confirmation proceedings when those questions are asked, the nominees choose to leave that as an open question. It does remain an open question. 
   Televising, of course, is vastly different and a far range from the issue of jurisdiction. The Congress of the United States has established the time limits for Federal trials under the speedy trial limit and has established time limits for consideration of habeas corpus cases. So there is ample authority for the Congress to call for the opening of the Supreme Court for television. 
   Obviously, there are issues of separation of power which I think this legislation respects. Obviously, the final decision will be for the Court. I do not expect a rush to judgment on this very complex proposition, but I do believe the day will come when the Supreme Court of the United States will be televised. That day will come, and it will be decisively in the public interest so the public will know the magnitude of what the Court is deciding and its role in our democratic process. 
   The public's interest would be significantly promoted by televising the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States. Given the enormous importance of the decisions made by the Court, and the fact that so many of these decisions are really public policy choices rather than strictly legal decisions, the public deserves as much access as possible to the Court's proceedings. 
   This proposed legislation to televise sessions of the Supreme Court fully respects the authority of the Supreme Court to make the ultimate decision on Constitutional questions. It seeks to impose greater accountability upon a body which decides so many matters of the greatest importance to our country, often by a single vote. 
   In the normal course of events, the Supreme Court often renders opinions which, at their core, decide cutting-edge issues which are really within the legislative domain under the Constitutional doctrine of Separation of Powers. In recent years the Supreme Court has exaggerated this policy role by explicitly substituting its judgment for that of Congress and striking down legislation which it has found is not based upon a ``considered judgment.'' 
   In our Constitutional scheme, who are the justices of the Supreme Court to substitute their judgment for that of Congress on these issues of public policy? By what right do the Justices decide that Congress has not exercised a ``considered judgment''? When it rules on this basis, the Court goes far beyond its role as final Constitutional arbiter and becomes a super legislature. 
   Senator BIDEN cogently addressed this issue in a July 26, 2000 floor statement. After discussing a number of recent Supreme Court opinions in which the Court exceeded its authority to strike down laws passed by Congress, Senator BIDEN noted that:  
   It is crucial ..... that the American people understand the larger pattern of the Supreme Court's recent decisions and ..... the disturbing direction in which the Supreme Court is moving because the consequences of these may well impact upon the ability of American citizens to ask their elected representatives in Congress to help them solve national problems that have national impact....... 
   Make no mistake, what is at issue here is the question of power ..... basically whether power will be exercised by an insulated judiciary or by the elected representatives of the people.  
   The public has a right to know how, why and what the Court is doing. In particular, the deliberations of the Court should be open to the sunshine of public scrutiny. Television coverage would be a significant step to provide a meaningful opportunity for public to observe and understand what the Court is doing. 
   Beyond educating the public, enhanced public scrutiny may very well have the effect of discouraging judicial activism and overreaching. The example of Justice Owen Roberts is instructive. In the mid-1930's, the Supreme Court struck down many significant pieces of New Deal legislation by votes of 5 to 4. President Roosevelt went to great lengths to publicize this episode of judicial activism, culminating in his infamous proposal to pack the Supreme Court by adding six new members. Notwithstanding FDR's enormous popularity, that proposal raised a storm of protest and failed. In the midst of that controversy, a swing justice, Owen J. Roberts, shifted his position to support the New Deal programs. Accordingly, a majority of the Court then supported and upheld New Deal legislation. Justice Robert's change in position led to the famous phrase, ``a switch in time saves nine.'' 
   The current Court broke with sixty years of tradition in curtailing Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause in Lopez, which invalidated Federal legislation creating gun-free school zones. In June 1999 in three far-reaching decisions, the Supreme Court curtailed Congressional authority in favor of the right of states to sovereign immunity on patent, copyright and other intellectual property infringement matters. These cases are: College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S. 666, Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627, and Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706. 
   The June 1999 patent and copyright infringement cases have been roundly criticized by the academicians. Stanford University historian Jack Rakove, author of ``Original Meanings'', a Pulitzer Prize winning account of the drafting of the Constitution, characterizes Justice Kennedy's historical argument in Alden v. Maine as ``strained, even silly''. 
   Professor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, in commenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board vs. College Savings Bank, said:  
   ``The decision makes no sense'', asserting that it arises from ``a bizarre states' rights agenda that really has nothing to do with intellectual property.  
   Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe commented:   
   ``In the absence of even a textual hint in the Constitution, the Court discerned from the constitutional `ether' that states are immune from individual lawsuits.'' (These decisions are) ``scary''. ``They treat states' rights in a truly exaggerated way, harking back to what the country looked like before the civil war and, in many ways, even before the adoption of the Constitution.''  
   College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4375, Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4376 and Alden v. Maine, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4374. 
   In addition to treating the Congress with disdain, the five person majority in all three cases demonstrated judicial activism and exhibited what can only be viewed as a political agenda in drastically departing from long-standing law. Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger described these cases as:  
   ``one of the three or four major shifts in constitutionalism we've seen in two centuries.'' 
   A commentary in the Economist on July 3, 1999 emphasized the 
   Court's radical departure from existing law stating:  
   ``The Court's majority has embarked on a venture as detached from any constitutional moorings as was the liberal Warren Court of the 1960's in its most activist mood.''  
   In its two opinions in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid and Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, the Court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents states from being sued in Federal court for infringing intellectual property rights. These decisions leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs. Through their state-owned universities and hospitals, states participate in the intellectual property marketplace as equals with private companies. The University of Florida, for example, owns more than 200 patents. Furthermore, state entities such as universities are major consumers of intellectual property and often violate intellectual property laws when, for example, they copy textbooks without proper authorization. 
   But now, Florida and all other states will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors--they will be immune from being sued for intellectual property infringement. Since patent and copyright infringement are exclusively Federal causes of action, and trademark infringement is largely Federal, the inability to sue in Federal court is, practically speaking, a bar to any redress at all. 
   The right of states to sovereign immunity from most Federal lawsuits is guaranteed in the Eleventh Amendment to the constitution, which provides that:  
   The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign state.  
   It has long been recognized, however, that this immunity from suit is not absolute. As the Supreme Court noted in one of the Florida Prepaid opinions, the Court has recognized two circumstances in which an individual may sue a state:  
   First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment--an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. Secondly, a state may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit. College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid at 7.  
   Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment is contained in Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' One of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section One, provides that no State shall, ``deprive any person of ..... property ..... without due process of law.'' Accordingly, Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the rights of citizens not to be deprived of their property--including their intellectual property--without due process of law. 
   Employing this power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress passed the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act in 1992. As its preamble states, Congress passed the Patent Remedy Act to ``clarify that States ..... are subject to suit in Federal court by any person for infringement of patents and plant variety protections.'' Congress passed the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act to subject the States to suits brought under Sec. 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 for false and misleading advertising. 
   In Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, the Court held in a 5 to 4 opinion that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity from patent infringement suits when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court reasoned that in order to determine whether a Congressional enactment validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunity, two questions must be answered, ``first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity ..... and second whether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.'' 
   The Court acknowledged that in enacting the Patent Remedy Act, Congress made its intention to abrogate the States' immunity unmistakably clear in the language of the statute. The Court then held, however, that Congress had not acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. The Court wrote that Congress' enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment is ``remedial'' in nature. Therefore, ``for Congress to invoke Section 5 it must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedy or preventing such conduct.'' Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank at 20. 
   The Court found that Congress failed to identify a pattern of patent infringement by the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional violations. The Court specifically noted that a deprivation of property without due process could occur only where the State provides inadequate remedies to injured patent owners. The Court then observed that:  
   Congress, however, barely considered the availability of state remedies for patent infringement and hence whether the States' conduct might have amounted to a constitutional violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. ..... Congress itself said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state remedies in the statute or in the Senate Report, and made only a few fleeting references to state remedies in the House Report, essentially repeating the testimony of the witnesses. Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank at 27-28.  
   Accordingly, the Court concluded that:  
   The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy Act does not respond to a history of widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic Section 5 legislation. Instead, Congress appears to have enacted this legislation in response to a handful of instances of state patent infringement that do not necessarily violate the Constitution. Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank at 31-32.  
   Not only is the result of this opinion troubling--that 
   states will enjoy immunity from suit--but also by the reasoning which supports this result. Here we have a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court choosing to ignore an act of Congress because he has concluded that Congress passed the legislation with insufficient justification. In essence, the Chief Justice is telling us we did a poor job developing our record before passing the Patent Remedy Act. As we all know, however, many of us support legislation for reasons that don't make it into the written record. The record is an important, but imperfect, summary of our views. This is why past Courts have been reluctant to discuss Congressional motives in this fashion. 
   In College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, the Supreme Court decided in a 5 to 4 opinion that Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (the ``TRCA'') was not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, noted that Congress passed the TRCA to remedy and prevent state deprivations of two types of property rights: (1) a right to be free from a business competitor's false advertising about its own product, and (2) a more generalized right to be secure in one's business interests. The Court contrasted these rights with the hallmarks of a protected property interest, namely the right to exclude others. 
   Justice Scalia reached the surprising conclusion that protection against false advertising secured by Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not implicate property rights protected by the due process clause so that Congress could not rely on its remedies under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity. If  conducting a legitimate business operation with protection from false advertising is not a ``property right'', it is hard to conceive of what is business property. That Scalia rationale shows the extent to which the Court has gone to invalidate Congressional enactments. 
   The Court then discussed whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though not abrogated, was voluntarily waived. Here, the Court expressly overruled its prior decision in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. 377 U.S. 184 (1964) and held that there was no voluntary waiver. In Parden, the Court had created the doctrine of constructive waiver, which held that a state could be found to have waived its immunity to suit by engaging in certain activities, such as voluntary participation in the conduct Congress has sought to regulate. Since Congress has sought to regulate interstate commerce, then a state which participated in interstate commerce by registering and licensing patents would be held to have voluntarily waived its immunity to a patent infringement suit. By overruling Parden, however, the Court held that a voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity must be express. Florida made no such express waiver of its sovereign immunity. 
   In other relatively recent cases, the Court has gone out of its way, almost on a personal basis, to chastise and undercut Congress. The case of Sable v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989) provides a striking example of this trend. In Sable, the Court struck down a ban on ``indecent'' interstate telephone communications passed by Congress in 1988. In rejecting this provision, the Court focused on whether there were constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means, short of a total ban, to achieve its goal of protecting minors. The Court then declared, in unusually dismissive and critical language, that Congress has not sufficiently considered this issue:  
   aside from conclusory statements during the debates by proponents of the bill ..... that under the FCC regulations minors could still have access to dial-a-porn messages, the congressional record presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most recent regulations were or might prove to be.
   The bill that was enacted ..... was introduced on the floor....... No Congressman or Senator purported to present a considered judgement with respect to how often or to what extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and have access to dial-a-porn messages. (Emphasis Added)  
   If a member of the Congress made a judgment, by what authority does the Supreme Court superimpose its view that it wasn't a ``considered judgment''? A fair reading of the statements from the floor debate on this issue undercuts the Court's disparaging characterization of this debate. For example, Representative TOM BLILEY of Virginia gave a rather detailed and persuasive discussion of how he concluded that a legislative ban was necessary. Mr. BLILEY noted that in 1983, Congress first passed legislation which required the FCC to report regulations describing methods by which dial-a-porn providers could screen out underage callers. Mr. BLILEY then walks us through the repeated failure of the FCC to pass regulations which could withstand judicial scrutiny. Finally Mr. BLILEY notes that:  
   it has become clear that there was not a technological solution that would adequately and effectively protect our children from the effect of this material. We looked for effective alternatives to a ban--there were none. 
   The Court repeats its critique of Congressional action in the case of Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Here, the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act, which prohibited transmission to minors of ``indecent'' or ``patently offensive'' communications. In this opinion, the Court again discusses whether less restrictive means were available and again concludes that Congress had not sufficiently addressed the issue. The opinion notes that:  
   The Communications Decency Act contains provisions that were either added in executive committee after the hearings [on the Telecom Act] were concluded or as amendments offered during floor debate on the legislation....... No hearings were held on the provisions that became the law.  
   The Court in Reno later notes that, ``The lack of legislative attention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel with this case.'' (Emphasis Added) 
   Once again, if Congress passes a law, by what authority does the Supreme Court conclude that we did not devote sufficient legislative attention to the law? In the Reno opinion itself the Court noted that some Members of the House of Representatives opposed the Communications Decency Act because they thought that less restrictive screening devices would work. These members offered an amendment intended as a substitute for the Communications Decency Act, but instead saw their provision accepted as an additional section of the Act. In light of this record, how can the Court say that Congress did not consider less restrictive means? 
   Most recently, in its January, 2000, opinion in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, the Supreme court once again took aim at Congress' judgment. In Kimel, the Court held that a 1974 amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (the ``ADEA'') to extend its application to discrimination by state and local governments was not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Court rejected Congress' action in truly dismissive tones:  
   Our examination of the ADEA's legislative record confirms that Congress' 1974 extension of the Act to the States was an unwarranted response to a perhaps inconsequential problem. Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the States, much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation. *.*.* (Emphasis Added) 
   A review of the ADEA's legislative record as a whole *.*.* reveals that Congress had virtually no reason to believe that state and local governments were unconstitutionally discriminating against their employees on the basis of age. Congress' failure to uncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination here confirms that Congress had no reason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary in this field. Kimel at (Emphasis Added)  
   Almost every member of Congress had had close working relationships with employees of the state and local governments back home, and all members of Congress meet state and local government employees when they are back in their states or districts. In fact, many members of Congress were once themselves state employees. Congress is therefore in a very good position to know that age discrimination by the states is not an ``inconsequential'' problem. In fact, the absence of an in-depth debate on this topic likely reflects the fact that this proposition that state and local governments discriminate on the basis of age was non-controversial. The Supreme Courts failure to defer to Congress' experience on this issue and its jaundiced reading of the record are troubling. 
   While numerous other instances of judicial activism may be cited, the decisions during Chief Justice Warren's tenure from 1953 through 1969 are illustrative. While few, if any at this late date, would disagree with the Warren Court's decision holding segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, it was a clear-cut case of judicial activism overturning Pleassey v. Ferguson since neither the legislative nor executive branches of the federal or state governments would correct those rank injustices. 
   The Warren Court significantly expanded the interpretation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to add Constitutional rights to criminal defendants in state court cases. In Mapp v. Ohio, the Court rule that unconstitutionally seized evidence could not be introduced in a state criminal proceeding. In Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court required that the State provide a defendant a lawyer when ``hailed'' into criminal court. Miranda v. Arizona, perhaps the Court's most famous opinion, rule out a defendant's confession or statement unless five specific warnings were given by police and waivers obtained from the defendant before incriminating statements could be introduced against him/her in state court proceedings. 
   Another era of judicial activism occurred in the mid-1930's. During this period, the Supreme Court embarked on a very different activist agenda by striking down many of the core laws passed as part of President Roosevelt's New Deal. In the 1935 case of A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. Also in 1935, in Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R.R., the Supreme  Court struck down the Railroad Retirement Act on the same Commerce Clause grounds. In the 1936 case of United States v. Butler, the Supreme Court struck down the agricultural Adjustment Act on the grounds that it sought to regulate a subject--the production of daily products--prohibited to Federal government under the 10th Amendment. Also in 1936, in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., the Court struck down the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act on the same 10th Amendment grounds. 
   These decisions, led to the infamous proposal to pack the Supreme Court by adding six new members. Notwithstanding FDR's enormous popularity, that proposal raised a storm of protest and failed. 
   Televised court proceedings better enable the public to understand the role of the Supreme Court and its impact on the key decisions of the day. Not only has the Supreme Court invalidated Congressional decisions where there is, in the views of many, simply a difference of opinion to what is preferable public policy, but the Court determines avant-garde issues such as whether aids is a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, whether Congress can ban obscenity from the Internet, and whether states can impose term limits upon members of Congress. Just this past term, the Court addressed whether the FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products as a drug and whether states can ban partial birth abortion. 
   The current Court, like its predecessors, hands down decisions which vitally affect the lives of all Americans. Since the Court's 1803 historic decision in Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court has the final authority on issues of enormous importance from birth to death. In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court affirmed a Constitutional right to abortion in this country and struck down state statutes banning or severely restricting abortion during the first two trimesters on the grounds that they violated a right to privacy inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), the court refused to create a similar right to assisted suicide. Here the Court held that the Due Process Clause does not recognize a liberty interest that includes a right to commit suicide with another's assistance. 
   In the Seventies, the Court first struck down then upheld state statutes imposing the death penalty for certain crimes. In Furman v. Georgia (1972), the Court struck down Georgia's death penalty statute under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment and stated that no death penalty law could pass constitutional muster unless it took aggravating and mitigating circumstances into account. This decision lead Georgia and many states to amend their death penalty statutes and, four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), the Supreme Court upheld Georgia's amended death penalty statute. 
   Over the years, the Court has also played a major role in issues of war and peace. In its opinion in Scott v. Sanford (1857)--better known as the Dredd Scott decision--the Supreme Court held that Dredd Scott, a slave who had been taken into ``free'' territory by his owner, was nevertheless still a slave. The Court further held that Congress lacked the power to abolish slavery in certain territories, thereby invalidating the careful balance that had been worked out between the North and the South on the issue. Historians have noted that this opinion fanned the flames that led to the Civil War. 
   More recently, the Supreme Court played an important role during the Vietnam War. Prominent opponents of the war repeatedly petitioned the Court to declare the Presidential action unconstitutional on the grounds that Congress had never given the President a declaration of war. The Court decided to leave this conflict in the political arena and repeatedly refused to grant writs of certiorari to hear these cases. This prompted Justices Douglas, sometimes accompanied by Justices Stewart and Harlan, to take the unusual step of writing lengthy dissents to the denials of cert. 
   In New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)--the so called ``Pentagon Papers'' case--the Court refused to grant the government prior restraint to prevent the New York Times from publishing leaked Defense Department documents which revealed damaging information about the Johnson Administration and the war effort. The publication of these documents by the New York Times is believed to have helped move public opinion against the war. 
   In its landmark civil rights opinions, the Supreme Court took the lead in effecting needed social change, helping us to address fundamental questions about our society in the courts rather than in the streets. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court struck down the principle of ``separate but equal'' education for blacks and whites and integrated public education in this country. This case was followed by a series of civil rights cases which enforced the concept of integration and full equality for all citizens of this country, including Garner v. Louisiana (1961), Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority (1961), and Peterson v. City of Greenville (1963). 
   When deciding issues of such great national import, the Supreme Court is rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of seminal Supreme Court decisions have been made by a vote of 5-4. Such a close margin reveals that these decisions are far from foregone conclusions distilled from the clear meaning of the Constitution and legal precedents. On the contrary, these major Supreme Court opinions are really policy decisions reached on the basis of the preferences and views of each individual justice. In a case that is decided by a vote of 5-4, individual justices have the power by his or her vote to change the law of the land. 
   Given the enormous significance of each vote cast by each justice on the Supreme Court, it is important that each justice know that they will be held accountable for their vote. Televising the proceedings of the Supreme Court will allow the sunlight to shine brightly on these proceedings and ensure greater accountability. 
   The following are just a handful of examples of major 5-4 decisions handed down by the Supreme Court this century: 
   Lochner v. New York (1905). The Court struck down an early attempt at labor regulation by holding that a law limiting bakers to a sixty-hour work week violated the liberty of contract secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
   Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918). The Court again struck down a labor law, this time the Keating-Own Federal Child Labor Act, on the grounds that Commerce Clause did not give Congress the power to completely forbid certain categories of commerce. 
   Furman v. Georgia (1972). The Court struck down the death penalty under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment. 
   Plyer v. Doe (1982). The Court invoked the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down a Texas statute which denied state funding for the education of 
   illegal immigrant children. 
   Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989). In this case, which has been widely viewed as a retreat from Roe v. Wade, the Court upheld various restrictions on the availability of abortion including a ban on the use of public funds and facilities for abortions. 
   United States v. Eichman (1990). The Court invalidated state and Federal laws prohibiting flag desecration on the grounds that they violated the First Amendment. 
   Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena (1995). The Court held that Federal racial classifications, like those of a state, must be reviewed under a strict scrutiny standard. 
   U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995). The Court struck down a state law imposing term limits upon Members of Congress on the grounds that states have no authority to change, add to, or diminish the age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service enumerated in the Qualifications Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
   During the past five years alone, there have been eighty 5 to 4 Supreme Court decisions. Out of the 79 cases decided in the Court's most recent term, 20 were decided by a single justice on a 5 to 4 vote. The following are some of the important decisions handed down by the Court in its last few sessions that were decided by a 5 to 4 vote: 
   Tobacco regulation. In FDA v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the Court ruled that the FDA lacks authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to regulate tobacco products.  
   Abortion. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Court ruled that Nebraska's statute criminalizing the performance of ``partial birth abortions'' is unconstitutional under principles set forth in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). 
   Violence Against Women Act. In United States v. Morrison, the Court struck down a key provision of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that allowed victims of gender-motivated violence to bring private civil lawsuits against the perpetrators in federal court. The Supreme Court said that Congress, in enacting the VAWA provision, overstepped its authority to regulate interstate commerce and enforce the Constitution's equal-protection guarantee. 
   HIV infection. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Court ruled that HIV infection is a ``disability'' as defined by the American with Disabilities Act, even if the person who has tested positive for HIV is asymptomatic. 
   Fourth Amendment. In Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott, the Court limited the exclusionary rule by holding that it does not apply in parole revocation hearings. 
   Freedom of Religion. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (``RFRA'') on the grounds that it exceeded Congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. RFRA had provided that governments can infringe upon religious practices only if they have health, safety or other ``compelling interest'' in doing so. 
   Freedom of Speech Online. In Reno v. ACLU, the Court struck down two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 prohibiting transmission of obscene and indecent messages to minors on the grounds that they violated the First Amendment. 
   In Printz v. United States, the Court voted 5 to 4 to reverse six decades of firmly established constitutional authority on the supremacy of federal laws over states rights under the Commerce Clause. Specifically, the Court held unconstitutional the provisions of the Brady Bill that require state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers. 
   In Agostini v. Felton, the Court voted to lower the barrier between church and state by holding that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not bar use of public school teachers to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children in parochial schools. 
   In Raines v. Byrd, the Court ruled that our colleagues, Senators BYRD, LEVIN, MOYNIHAN, and HATFIELD, lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act since they failed to establish a particularized personal injury. The Court's rejection of an ``institutional injury'' to Congress as a basis for standing significantly limits the ability of legislators to raise constitutional challenges to legislation in the courts. 
   Cameras Should be allowed in the Supreme Court on Basic Public Policy and Constitutional Grounds. 
   Given the awesome national significance of the decisions made by the Supreme Court, the right of the public to view the process by which these decisions are made is self evident. In a democracy, the workings of the government at all levels should be open to public view. The more openness, and the more real the opportunity for public observation, the greater the understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court noted in the 1986 case of Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, ``People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.'' 
   It was in this spirit that the House of Representatives opened its deliberations to meaningful public observation by 
   allowing C-Span to begin televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate followed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow television coverage of the Senate floor. 
   Beyond this general policy preference for openness, however, there is a strong argument that the Constitution requires that television cameras be permitted in the Supreme Court. 
   It is well established that the Constitution guarantees access to judicial proceedings to the press and the public. In 1980, the Supreme Court relied on this tradition when it held in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia that the right of a public trial belongs not just to the accused, but to the public and the press as well. The Court noted that such openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable attribute of an Anglo-American trial.'' 
   Recognizing that in modern society most people cannot physically attend trials, the Court specifically addressed the need for access by members of the media:  
   Instead of acquiring information about trials by first hand observation or by word of mouth from those who attended, people now acquire it chiefly through the print and electronic media. [emphasis added] In a sense, this validates the media claim of acting as surrogates for the public. [Media presence] contributes to public understanding of the rule of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire criminal justice system.  
   Today, television is the means by which most Americans get their information. To exclude television cameras from the court is to effectively prevent large segments of American society from ever witnessing what transpires therein. Furthermore, television provides a level of access to courtroom proceedings far closer to the ideal of actual attendance in the court than either newspapers or photographs can provide. 
   In addition, a strong argument can be made that forbidding television cameras in the court, while permitting access to print and other media, constitutes an impermissible discrimination against one type of media in contravention of the First Amendment. In recent years, the Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly held that differential treatment of different media is impermissible under the First Amendment absent an overriding governmental interest. For example, in 1983 the Court invalidated discriminatory tax schemes imposed only upon certain types of media in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota commissioner of Revenue. In the 1977 case of ABC v. Cuomo, the Second Circuit rejected the contention by the two candidates for mayor of New York that they could exclude some members of the media from their campaign headquarters by providing access through invitation only. The Court wrote that:  
   Once there is a public function, public comment, and participation by some of the media, the First Amendment requires equal access to all of the media or the rights of the First Amendment would no longer be tenable.  
   In the 1965 case of Estes v. Texas, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the denial of television coverage of trials violates the equal protection clause. In the same opinion, the Court held that the presence of television cameras in the Court had violated a Texas defendant's right to due process. Subsequent opinions have cast serious doubt upon the continuing relevance of both prongs of the Estes opinion. 
   In its 1981 opinion in Chandler v. Florida, discussed above, the court recognized that Estes must be read narrowly in light of the state of television technology at that time. The television coverage of Estes' 1962 trial required cumbersome equipment, numerous additional microphones, yards of new cables, distracting lighting, and numerous technicians present in the courtroom. In contrast, the court noted, television coverage in 1980 can be achieved through the presence of one or two discreetly placed cameras without making any perceptible change in the atmosphere of the courtroom. Accordingly, the Court held that, despite Estes, the presence of television cameras in a Florida trial was not a violation of the rights of the defendants in that case. By the same logic, the holding in Estes that exclusion of television cameras from the courts did not violate the equal protection clause must be revisited in light of the dramatically different nature of television coverage today. 
   Given the strength of these arguments, it is not surprising that over the last two decades there has been a rapidly growing acceptance of cameras in American courtrooms which has reached almost every court except for the Supreme Court itself. Ironically, it was a Supreme Court decision which helped spur the spread of television cameras in the courts. In 1981, in the case of Chandler v. Florida, the Supreme Court decided that televising  criminal proceedings did not inherently interfere with a criminal defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, and that there was no empirical evidence to support a claim that it did. Shortly after the Chandler decision, the American Bar Association revised its canons to permit judges to authorize televising civil and criminal proceedings in their courts. 
   Following the green lights provided by the Supreme Court and the ABA, forty-seven states have decided to permit electronic coverage of at least some portion of their judicial proceedings. In 1990, the federal Judicial Conference authorized a three-year pilot program allowing television coverage of civil proceedings in six federal district courts and two federal circuit courts. The program began in July, 1991 and ran through December 31, 1994. The Federal Judicial Center monitored the program and issued a positive final evaluation. In particular, the Judicial Center concluded that:  
   Overall, attitudes of judges toward electronic media coverage of civil proceedings were initially neutral and became more favorable after experience under the pilot program.  
   The Judicial Center also concluded that:  
   Judges and attorneys who had experience with electronic media coverage under the program generally reported observing small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of justice.  
   Despite this positive evaluation, the Judicial Conference voted in September, 1994, to end the experiment and not to extend the camera coverage to all courts. This decision was made in the aftermath of the initial burst of television coverage of O.J. Simpson's pretrial hearing. Some have argued that the decision was unduly influenced by this outside event. 
   In March, 1996, the Judicial Conference revisited the issue of television cameras in the federal courts and voted to permit each federal court of appeals to ``decide for itself whether to permit the taking of photographs and radio and television coverage of appellate arguments.'' Since that time, two circuit courts have enacted rules permitting television coverage of their arguments. It is significant to note that these two circuits were the two circuits which participated in the federal experiment with television cameras a few years earlier. It seems that once judges have an experience with cameras in their courtroom, they no longer oppose the idea. 
   On September 6, 2000, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing on ``Allowing Cameras and Electronic Media in the Courtroom.'' The primary focus of the hearing was Senate bill 721, legislation introduced by Senators GRASSLEY and SCHUMER that would give federal judges the discretion to allow television coverage of court proceedings. One of the witnesses at the hearing, Judge Edward Becker, Chief Judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, spoke in opposition to the legislation and the presence of television cameras in the courtroom. The remaining five witnesses, however, including a federal judge, a state judge, a law professor and other legal experts, all testified in favor of the legislation. They argued that cameras in the courts would not disrupt proceedings but would provide the kind of accountability and access that is fundamental to our system of government. 
   In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the President, or overriding his veto, has the authority to require the Supreme Court to televise its proceedings. Such a conclusion is not free from doubt and is highly likely to be tested with the Supreme Court, as usual, having the final word. As I see it, there is no constitutional prohibition against such legislation. 
   Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested ``in one Supreme Court and such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' While the Constitution specifically creates the Supreme Court, however, it left it to Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For example, it was congress that fixed the number of justices on the Supreme Court at nine. Likewise, it was Congress that decided that any six of these justices are sufficient to constitute a quorum of the Court. It was Congress that decided that the term of the Court shall commence on the first Monday in October of each year, and it was Congress that determined the procedures to be followed whenever the Chief Justice is unable to perform the duties of his office. 
   Beyond such basic structural and operational matters, Congress also controls more substantive aspects of the Supreme Court. Most importantly, it is Congress that in effect determines the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the Constitution itself sets out the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that such jurisdiction exists ``with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.'' In the early days of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in Durousseau v. United States, recognized that the power to make exceptions to the Court's jurisdiction is the equivalent of the power to grant jurisdiction, since exceptions can be ``implied from the intent manifested by the affirmative description [of jurisdiction].'' 
   the Supreme Court recognized the power of Congress to 
   control its appellate jurisdiction in a dramatic way in the famous 1868 case of Ex Parte McCardle. In this case, McCardle, a newspaper editor, was being held in custody by the military for trial on charges stemming from the publication of articles alleged to be libelous and incendiary. McCardle petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court heard his case but, before it rendered its opinion, Congress repealed the statute that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction to hear the habeas appeal. In light of this Congressional action, the Supreme Court felt compelled to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. 
   Congress also exercises broad and significant control over the timing within which federal courts must act. For example, Congress passed the Speedy Trial Act to quantify an individual's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Specifically, the Act requires that an individual arrested for a criminal offense be indicted within thirty days of arrest and be brought to trial within seventy days of an indictment. 
   Likewise, the habeas corpus reform I authored, which became law as part of the comprehensive anti-terrorism act of 1996, imposes strict timetables upon the filing and review of habeas corpus petitions and appeals. For example, in the case of both death row inmates and other prisoners, the Act establishes a one-year deadline within which state and federal prisoners must file their federal habeas petitions. In capital cases, the Act requires a district court to render a final determination of a habeas petition not later than 180 days after the date on which it is filed, and it requires a court of appeals to hear and render a final determination of any appeal of an order granting or denying such petition within 120 days after the date on which the reply brief is filed. 
   Some objections have been raised to televised proceedings of the Supreme Court on the ground that it would subject justices to undue security risks. My own view is such concerns are vastly overstated. Well-known members of Congress, including such high profile personalities as Senator TED KENNEDY, walk on a regular basis in public view in the Capitol complex. Other very well-known personalities, presidents, vice presidents, cabinet officers, all are on public view with even incumbent presidents exposed to risks as they mingle with the public. Such risks are minimal and, in my view, are worth the relatively minor exposure that Supreme Court justices would undertake through television appearances. 
   The Supreme Court could, of course, permit television through its own rule but has decided not to do so. Congress should be circumspect and even hesitant to impose a rule mandating the televising of Supreme Court proceedings and should do so only in the face of compelling public policy reasons. The Supreme Court has such a dominant role in key decision-making functions that their proceedings ought to be better known to the public; and, in the absence of Court rule, public policy would be best served by enactment of legislation requiring the televising of Supreme Court proceedings.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a number of matters. First, the situation with Dr. Wen Ho Lee has drawn national--really, international--attention, especially in light of President Clinton's statement yesterday that he was deeply troubled by the actions of the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy. 
   The President put his finger on the critical question; that is, how could it be that on one day Dr. Wen Ho Lee was a major threat to national security, and on the next day the Government agreed to a plea bargain on one count, without jail time or without probation, allowing him to walk out free? 
   The President was sharply critical, especially of the actions of the Attorney General, who had a rather extraordinary interview with the media yesterday. She was asked about the Wen Ho Lee case and she said that, had Dr. Lee cooperated with the Government, a result could have been achieved a long time before on the disclosure of what had happened with the tapes. But the problem with that answer is that the defense had offered the Government precisely what the Government finally got; that is, Dr. Lee's cooperation on what had happened to those downloaded materials. That offer had been made months ago, but the Government had never replied to that offer. So it is hardly an excuse for Attorney General Reno to say had Dr. Lee cooperated, the matter would have been resolved a long time ago. 
   Then she was asked a question relating to any mistakes or anything that was done wrong in the handling of Dr. Wen Ho Lee's case. She said she was going to have to review the record to answer that question--which is really extraordinary, since she is the Attorney General and this matter was under her direct, personal supervision. That is a fact we know because in August of 1997, FBI Director Louis Freeh sent one of his top deputies, Assistant Director John Lewis, to Attorney General Reno personally to ask for authorization to submit to the court an application for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At that time, the FBI had provided a statement of probable cause which was more than sufficient to have the warrant issued. 
   Attorney General Reno then referred that request to a man named Daniel Seikaly in the Department of Justice, a man who had no prior experience with warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The wrong standard was applied. 
   This has all been documented in a report submitted by the Judiciary subcommittee, which I chair, on oversight of the Department of Justice. And ultimately notwithstanding the request from the Director of the FBI through a top deputy to the Attorney General personally, that request for a FISA warrant was refused. Attorney General Reno doesn't have to study the matter further to acknowledge that mistake. 
   Then the FBI let the case languish until December of 1998 without any active investigation. It was only when the Cox committee was about to publish its report, as rumored in late December, 1998, and as it came to pass in early January, sharply critical of the way the Wen Ho Lee case was handled, that a polygraph was ordered by the Department of Energy. The polygraph was not taken by the FBI, but taken by an outside contractor, Wackenhut. That was done on December 23, 1997. And the initial report was that Dr. Lee had passed the polygraph, had not been deceptive--grounds for discontinuing the investigation. 
   It was only several weeks later when the FBI got the tapes and reviewed them and found that the Wackenhut conclusion was not accurate; that there was not exoneration of Dr. Lee. 
   Then it appears that, finally, when the Department of Justice was thoroughly embarrassed, they really threw the book at Dr. Lee by holding him in detention in really extraordinary circumstances, in leg irons. I have seen prisoners held in leg irons. I witnessed that in Pennsylvania's correctional institution when I was district attorney. Do you know the reason you hold somebody in leg irons? Because they are so violent they threaten risk of bodily injury or worse to the guards who have to deal with them. What possible justification was there for treating Dr. Lee in that manner? And the restrictions which the Government imposed on Dr. Lee? There has been comment, unattributed sources, to law enforcement officials, that what was really in mind here was to coerce a guilty plea from Dr. Lee. The Government apparently thought he was guilty and they were thoroughly embarrassed with the way they had botched the case. What other explanation is there for the way Dr. Lee was treated? 
   These are fundamental questions which our subcommittee will look into, on oversight of this matter. 
   There are two aspects of this matter, really. One aspect is what, if anything, did Dr. Lee do to endanger national security? In the application for a search warrant, the Government laid out a long list of reasons stating probable cause for the issuance of that search warrant. Matters that had gone back as early as 1982 involving a great many suspicious activities, so that when the warrant was not issued, notwithstanding the request directly to Attorney General Reno, and when the investigation was, in effect, dropped--really languishing, but in effect dropped for some 15 months--we do not know, on this state of the record, what the quality of the evidence was which led to the indictments. 
   It is not a sufficient answer, any of them which have been given, because the issue of national security is of the utmost importance. 
   The subcommittee has in final stages a report on Dr. Peter Lee, who confessed to giving the People's Republic of China key information on nuclear secrets and also on detecting our submarines. That case was another comedy of errors, except it wasn't so funny--``comedy of errors'' I think is the wrong words--horrendous errors, where there was miscommunication between the Justice Department in Washington and the assistant district attorney who was trying the case. Dr. Peter Lee finally walked out with probation, notwithstanding the very serious charges brought against him. 
   Beyond the issue of national security, there is the question as to the treatment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, his constitutional rights, and whether he was fairly treated. There have been calls for Attorney General Reno's resignation, and the resignation of Secretary of Energy Richardson. I was asked about that earlier today on television and I declined to call for those resignations. I think it is too often that Members go to the klieg lights and make those demands. 
   I was then asked what would be effective, what could be done. And I was asked whether the President ought to fire the Attorney General. 
   Based on what the President has said, and the very troubled record which Attorney General Reno has had with Waco and with her decisions on independent counsels, that is something which would be meaningful, if the President really is concerned.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on another subject, I wish to comment briefly on legislation which will be introduced today in response to the tremendous problems posed by the Firestone tires and the Ford vehicles which turned over, and some 88 deaths. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, on which I sit, had a hearing on this subject on September 6, 2000. At that time, we heard comments, explanations, excuses which strained credulity. I then introduced legislation which would make it a criminal offense for someone to knowingly put on interstate commerce a deadly product which was likely to result in death. This is based on the experience I had as district attorney of Philadelphia, where reckless disregard for human life, which results in death, constitutes the requisite malice for a charge of murder in the second degree. 
   I have discussed this provision with the distinguished Senator from Arizona who held a hearing on the matter this week, and the administration has submitted legislation which I am told will be introduced later today. I wanted to make a comment briefly at this time since I know we will be going out early. 
   I compliment Senator MCCAIN for this legislation which will require motor vehicle manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to obtain information and obtain records about potential safety defects in their foreign  products that may affect the safety of vehicles and equipment in the United States. 
   The legislation will increase the civil penalties for notification of reporting violations; will establish greater cooperation with foreign transportation safety agencies with the exchange of safety-related information and the recall of defective products; and requires additional testing to determine that a vehicle or equipment meets safety requirements. 
   I am advised that there is coordination with the House and an excellent opportunity that this legislation will be completed before we finish our term, which would be exemplary and which would really show the American people that when we have a very dangerous situation brought to our attention, we will take action. 
   I am very pleased to see this legislation will include the proposals I have for criminal penalties. In a floor statement made on September 7, 2000, I documented 10 illustrative cases where deadly products had been put on the market knowing them to be deadly and knowing that they contained the risk of death or serious bodily injury. That constitutes the requisite malice for a prosecution. That will be an effective way of dealing with this issue. 
   The remedy of punitive damages has been illusory. Take the celebrated Pinto case where a calculation was made by Ford that it was cheaper to pay the damages resulting from injuries and deaths than it was to relocate the gas tank. A jury came in with an award of $125 million, later reduced it $3.5 million, which is the customary response where these punitive damage awards have been entered.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Olympic Games, set to begin today in Sydney, Australia, will feature rowing, which brings to mind the great rowing tradition which has been a part of Philadelphia for generations. It also brings to mind John B. Kelly, Jr., a Philadelphia native who not only made great strides in the sport of rowing, but who personified the ideal of an Olympic athlete. 
   John B. Kelly, Jr., better known as ``Jack'' or ``Kel,'' came from a distinguished family, on and off the water. His father won three gold medals in sculling in the 1920 and 1924 Olympics. His sister Grace was the late Princess of Monaco. 
   After graduating from the William Penn Charter School, Jack enlisted in the United States Navy. After a short term of service, he attended the University of Pennsylvania where we were college friends in the late 1940's and early 1950's. He was a member of the Kappa Sigma social fraternity and was honored with a membership in the Sphinx Senior Society for his extracurricular accomplishments. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as an ensign, combining duty on a destroyer with his preparation for the 1952 Olympic games in Helsinki. 
   By the time he hung up his oars, he had advanced the cause and the international name of American rowing and American sports. Jack was an eight-time national single sculls champion, four-time Olympian and bronze medallist in single sculls in 1956, and winner of two gold medals in the Pan American Games in 1955 and 1959. He was also the winner of the Diamond Sculls in the Henley Regatta in 1947 and 1949, a race from which the British had banned his father, purportedly because he worked with his hands and was not considered to be a gentleman. 
   The winner of the 1947 James E. Sullivan award as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete, Jack was a leading advocate for amateur sports for more than 30 years. Following the 1960 Olympic games, Jack became active in the local swimming program in the Middle Atlantic Association of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1970 he was elected President of the National Amateur Athletic Union, the youngest person to hold that office in more than 80 years. In 1985 he assumed the presidency of the United States Olympic Committee, and served in that capacity for three weeks until his untimely death on March 2. 
   Philadelphia honored its native son by erecting a statue of Jack rowing, along the Schuylkill River, and also by renaming the drive along the boathouses on the Schuylkill River in honor of the Kelly family. I believe it would be appropriate for the United States to honor Jack through the creation of a commemorative postage stamp, which would pay tribute to his accomplishments as a world class athlete and to his contributions to our nation and to international athletics and goodwill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in calling upon the Postmaster General to issue this stamp in a timely manner. 
   The Olympics started today. Jack Kelly, Jr., has a monument on East River Drive which was renamed ``Kelly Drive'' in honor of the Kelly family, a very distinguished Philadelphia family. Father John B. Kelly, Sr., an Olympic gold medalist, was once denied entry into the Henley Regatta because he was someone who worked with his hands, a bricklayer; therefore, not considered a gentleman and, therefore, not entitled to enter into the competition. 
   His son John B. Kelly, Jr., made up for all of it. I knew young Jack Kelly as a student at the University of Pennsylvania where we attended together. The family achieved perhaps its greatest notoriety from Princess Grace of Monaco being Jack Jr.'s sister. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the extraordinary case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee who was released from custody yesterday by the Federal judge saying that Dr. Lee was owed an apology because of major mistakes made by ranking officials at the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy. This matter has been the subject of oversight inquiry by the Judiciary subcommittee, which I chair. Our inquiry began last October and ended in early December at the request of the Director of the FBI so that it would not interfere with the pending prosecution of Dr. Lee. 
   There are many questions which arise from what has happened since--especially the dramatic comments of Judge Parker yesterday that Wen Ho Lee was owed an apology, and that blame lay at the doorsteps of the top officials in Justice and Energy. 
   The questions which need to be explored are: 
   What evidence or what factors were there which led to Dr. Lee's detention and solitary confinement for some 9 months? 
   What did the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy do by way of their investigation? 
   What were the specifics where the key FBI witness changed his testimony from an earlier hearing where he said Dr. Lee was deceptive, to a later hearing where he omitted that very important fact which led to Wen Ho Lee's detention? 
   Was there any racial profiling in this case? 
   How did the Department of Justice focus on Dr. Lee? 
   Those are among the many questions to be answered in an oversight hearing which our subcommittee is attempting to schedule now for the week of September 25. 
   The inquiries which we have already made have suggested that there was significant reason for the FBI to conduct the investigation. Dr. Wen Ho Lee is entitled to the presumption of innocence like every American. And on this date of the report, he is presumed innocent, and he is, in fact, innocent. But on this date of the record, the Department of Justice has convicted itself of absolute incompetence. Let me be very specific about why. 
   Director Louis Freeh sent his top deputy, John Lewis, to talk to Attorney General Janet Reno in August of 1997 to request a warrant for Dr. Lee under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There was a statement of probable cause which was very substantial which justified the issuance of that warrant to gather further evidence. Attorney General Reno referred that matter to a man named Daniel Seikaly in her department, a person who had never handled a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The wrong standard was applied, and the FBI was turned down notwithstanding the top deputy, John Lewis, having been sent there by Director Freeh. Then, inexplicably, for the next 16 months, the FBI did not conduct any investigations. Some memoranda were transmitted between Washington, DC, and Albuquerque, NM, but the case lay dormant. 
   It is really hard to understand why the case would lie dormant when the FBI had been so arduous in asking for the warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But then, in late December of 1998, it was known that the Cox committee was about to publish its report and was said to be highly critical of the way the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy handled the Wen Ho Lee case. 
   Then the Department of Energy initiated a polygraph of Dr. Lee on December 23, 1998, conducted by an outside agency--not by the FBI but by Wackenhut. The Wackenhut contractors told the FBI that Dr. Lee passed the polygraph but did not give the FBI agents the polygraph charts or the videotape of the interview. 
   On January 17 of 1999, the FBI conducted an interview with Dr. Lee to close out the case. But then, on January 22, 5 days later, the FBI finally received the complete record of the December 23 polygraph and began to question the Wackenhut interpretation of the results. 
   Without going into more of the details in the limited time I have at the moment--there will be more time to amplify this statement later in the subcommittee hearings--Dr. Lee was not terminated until March 8. The search warrant was not issued until April 9 in the context of substantial evidence of deletions and downloading. 
   There are very significant questions for the Department of Justice to answer as to why the warrant was not issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, why the investigation was not made by the FBI from August of 1997 to December of 1998, why Dr. Lee was kept on the job in the face of downloading very substantial classified matters. 
   The issues about his retention require very serious oversight. There are all the appearances that the FBI's failure to handle the matter properly, the Department of Justice's failure to handle the matter properly, through the disclosure by the Cox committee in January of 1999, and the ultimate firing, the ultimate search warrant, suggest that the Department of Justice really threw the book at Dr. Lee to make up for their own failings. But there needs to be a determination on oversight as to the justification for keeping Dr. Lee in solitary confinement. When the judge finally suggested that he was going to release Dr. Lee to house arrest, the Federal Government put out an objection to his having any contact with his wife, which was really extraordinary. 
   Then suddenly, on a plea agreement, on one of 59 counts under the indictment, according to the Department of Justice, it is OK to release Dr. Lee on the plea bargain. There was no fine, no jail time on the conviction, only a debriefing. There is a real question as to how meaningful that is since those materials are customarily offered on a tender by Dr. Lee's counsel before the plea bargain is entered into. 
   These are some of the issues which our Judiciary subcommittee will be looking into on oversight, both as to the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy. When a Federal judge says that America owes Dr. Lee an apology, the details have to be determined. When the FBI makes representations that Dr. Lee poses a threat to the security of the United States, and that the information he has downloaded could lead to the defeat of our military forces worldwide, those assertions need to be investigated as a matter of oversight. How did the Department of Justice move from those very serious allegations to a statement, in effect, that let the matter go, without a fine, without a jail sentence, with only probation on a single one of 59 counts. 
   The handling of these espionage matters is of great import. The subcommittee is nearing completion of a report on Dr. Peter Lee, who confessed to providing information to the People's Republic of China on nuclear secrets and submarine detection. These are matters which require congressional oversight. Our Judiciary subcommittee will undertake just that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for offering this amendment. I do support it. I think it is a significant step forward. As I listened to the Senator from Tennessee speak, I was persuaded, however, that the consequence or the conclusion of his eloquence was that the entire bill for permanent normal trade relations with China should be defeated. 
   I thought the Senator from Tennessee made a very strong case that it is necessary for the United States to be wary of where the People's Republic of China is heading. It is my hope--and I know it is the hope of the Senator from Tennessee--that we will have good relations with China and that we will have a peaceful world. 
   As the Senator from Tennessee enumerated the problems with nuclear proliferation and the potential difficulties from the People's Republic of China, it underscored in my own mind the grave concerns about making a concession at this stage to permanent normal trade relations with China instead of advancing that economic benefit to China on a year-by-year basis so that the United States would retain some leverage as to the conduct of China. It is important to have the kind of an annual report about which the Senator from Tennessee talks. I think it is a good idea to have it as to Russia and North Korea as well as to China. 
   The reality is, as documented substantially by the Senator from Tennessee, there are real potential problems on the horizon. 
   At the outset, I wish to make it clear that I support the concept of free trade. I believe history is on the side of free trade. I voted in favor of the North America Free Trade Agreement, in the face of considerable opposition from my constituency in Pennsylvania. Similarly, I voted for the African Growth and Opportunity/United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. Although not without some qualms, I have supported most-favored-nation status for China. That was a hot concern on this floor and in the House of Representatives for some time because of China's violations of human rights. It was my judgment that we should have given China most-favored-nation status to try to build their country in the hope that it would move toward democracy and that it would move toward a greater recognition of human rights. In one fell swoop, to grant permanent normal trade relations with China seems to me to be a mistake. 
   I spoke on this subject at some length back on May 17 of this year. I know there are others who wish to speak. I will not repeat what I said at that time but would incorporate my comments at that time by reference. 
   On the issue of proliferation, there is very substantial evidence that the People's Republic of China is harming the  interests of world peace. When they sold the M-11 missiles to Pakistan, they put Pakistan in a position to move forward on a potential nuclear confrontation with India, putting that area of the world at risk. When the People's Republic of China has assisted North Korea's missile program in providing special accelerometers, again, there is a country, a rogue country where the People's Republic of China threatens the interests of world peace. And when they have provided assistance to Libya's long-range missile program by assisting in the building of a hypersonic wind tunnel, there again, they assist a rogue nation which really has the potential of threatening world peace. 
   There has been a very elaborate chart prepared by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. HELMS, which is on every desk in the room. I know Senator HELMS came to the floor a few moments ago and will doubtless speak about it. It particularizes the problem we face on nuclear proliferation by the Chinese, which raises the question: Why give away our bargaining power? The People's Republic of China is vitally interested in normal trade relations with the United States. Why not grant it to them this year but reserve judgment next year as to what happens? 
   The record of the People's Republic of China on human rights is dreadful. The massacres at Tiananmen Square constitute only one issue in a long line of flagrant violations of human rights. These are detailed in a statement which is a part of the RECORD of my speech from May 17. I shall not detail them again, except to refer to the case of the Dickinson College librarian, Mr. Yongyi Song, a constituent of mine from Pennsylvania. 
   Mr. Song went to China in August of 1999 to study the Cultural Revolution. While in China, he was unceremoniously arrested without cause, without any justification, and kept in jail for months. When I found out about the case and consulted with Mr. Song's family and with Dickinson College, I sponsored a resolution, cosponsored by many of my colleagues, and I spoke on the floor of the Senate. I said if the People's Republic of China wanted to be accorded a seat with the nations of the world on matters such as trade, or on matters generally, they would have to have a decent legal system and they would have to not arrest people without any cause. Shortly thereafter, I sought a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States. The morning of our meeting, I heard a rumor that Yongyi Song was going to be released, and in late January, he was in fact released. 
   I had a very interesting discussion with the PRC Ambassador to the United States. He admonished me about meddling in internal PRC affairs. I had a few responses about the PRC record on human rights, especially as they related to the detention of my constituent for many months without any justification. Then I said that I personally was concerned about having good relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China, a nation of 1.2 billion people. The PRC Ambassador quickly corrected me, saying it is not 1.2 billion people, it is 1.250 billion people. 
   There is no doubt about the PRC's recognition of the PRC's power. They are emerging as the second major superpower in the world. That is fine so long as they comply with the norms of a civilized world. That requires nonproliferation, and that requires respect for human rights. 
   We have two other matters that have come to the fore recently--both issues where the Senator from Tennessee and I have been involved collaboratively. One is on the issue of the efforts by the People's Republic of China to influence U.S. elections, and the second is the effort of the People's Republic of China on espionage. China has portrayed a very aggressive posture, in my judgment. China has moved ahead with many people who have made contributions in the political arena in flat violation of U.S. law, and there are cases--now documented--of the aggressive efforts of the People's Republic of China on espionage. 
   The Judiciary subcommittee that I chair on the Department of Justice oversight has prepared a very lengthy report on Dr. Peter Hoong-Yee Lee. Dr. Peter Lee on October 7 and 8, 1997, confessed to the FBI that he had provided classified nuclear weapons design and testing information to scientists of the People's Republic of China on two occasions in 1985 and had given classified anti-submarine-warfare information to the Chinese in May of 1997. 
   Now it is true that espionage is not limited to the People's Republic of China. But when they recruit a scientist in the United States and acquire information about our classified nuclear weapons design and information on our anti-submarine-warfare procedures, that is a matter of considerable importance. 
   There is another major case which is very much in the forefront today and has been for some considerable period of time, and that is the case involving Dr. Wen Ho Lee, where this morning's media accounts disclose that later today, within a few hours, the Department of Justice has agreed to a plea negotiation for 1 count of a 59-count indictment concerning taking classified material and not maintaining the appropriate classification. This is a case that was under investigation by the Department of Justice Oversight Subcommittee, which I chair, and we had looked into it from October of last year until December 14 when the FBI asked that we cease our oversight inquiries because Dr. Wen Ho Lee was being indicted. We complied with that request so there would be no question at all about any interference in the prosecution of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. Now that the matter is finished, we will move ahead very promptly on that oversight investigation. 
   But the case against Dr. Wen Ho Lee is an extraordinary one 
   which raised very serious questions about whether Dr. Wen Ho Lee provided the People's Republic of China highly classified information. 
   The investigation as to Dr. Lee proceeded from 1982, was accelerated in 1993 and 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997. Then there was a request by the FBI, which was a personal request from FBI Director Louis Freeh, transmitted by Assistant Director John Lewis, who went personally to Attorney General Reno. Attorney General Reno assigned the matter to a man named Daniel Seikaly who had never had any experience with an application for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In a context that was reasonably clear that the warrant should have been granted, Attorney General Reno rejected that application. 
   Then, inexplicably, from August of 1998 until December of 1999, the FBI did not act to further investigate Dr. Wen Ho Lee. Then, when the Cox Commission was about to publish a report in January of 1999, suddenly the Department of Justice and the FBI sprang into action, but did not take any steps to terminate Dr. Lee until March, and no steps to get a search warrant until April. 
   Now there is no doubt that Dr. Wen Ho Lee is entitled to the presumption of innocence as to passing any matters to the People's Republic of China, which was the essence of the FBI investigation. Equally, there is no doubt that the Department of Justice has been convicted of extraordinary incompetence in the way this case has been handled, and the questions as to whether the People's Republic of China gathered key information remain unanswered and perhaps will be illuminated by oversight by our Judiciary Subcommittee. But it is hard to understand how the Department of Justice could maintain last week that Dr. Wen Ho Lee had information at his disposal that would ``change the global strategic balance'' or could ``result in the military defeat of America's conventional forces,'' posing the ``gravest possible security risk to the supreme national interests'' of the United States. 
   So when the matter is concluded--as we have every reason to suspect it will be--with the plea bargain, the Department of Justice is going to have a great many questions to answer in terms of why they permitted Dr. Wen Ho Lee to have access to classified information for such a protracted period of time when they had very substantial probable cause, as shown in the application for the warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that there were connections with the People's Republic of China, which might have access to very important nuclear secrets. 
   I mention that case because here is another illustration like the Dr. Peter  Lee case where there were questions in the Dr. Peter Lee case, and he confessed and was convicted of passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. But in the long investigation on Dr. Wen Ho Lee, the Department of Justice is going to have some very important questions to answer about why Dr. Wen Ho Lee was enabled to have access to this classified information for such a long period of time, and why they kept him in detention with arguments which they have made. They argued even that on his release he should not have contact with his wife on their assertion that she might pass this highly classified information on, and fought it even to the Court of Appeals. Now, suddenly, in a day of reversal of position, which by the accounts will result in Dr. Wen Ho Lee's release later today, is really very extraordinary. 
   The incompetence of the Department of Justice is obvious. The Department of Justice owes an explanation perhaps to Dr. Wen Ho Lee and to the people of the United States for their bungling of that case. But the point of the matter is, and it is sufficient really for Dr. Peter Lee's case, that you have an aggressive People's Republic of China which is after U.S. military secrets. 
   Then there is the issue of the efforts by the People's Republic of China to influence our elections. That, too, has been documented in great length. I shall not speak about it at any length this afternoon except to comment about the conviction of Maria Hsia linking the People's Republic of China and the plea bargain with John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, and many, many others where there is documentation that the People's Republic of China had transferred funds to people in the United States to make campaign contributions, which were flatly illegal under U.S. laws, in the interests of the People's Republic of China in influencing our elections. 
   While it is not unusual for one country to engage in espionage against another country, I believe it is quite unusual for a country to seek to influence U.S. elections. Those are matters which weigh in the balance. 
   In essence, what we have before us at the moment is the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who seeks to have a report from the President on the question of nuclear proliferation involving the People's Republic of China, and with all due respect, it is subject to being avoided by waivers which the President can exercise. But at least it is a step in the right direction. 
   But when we take a hard look at what China has been doing in international affairs with Taiwan, with their threats and blackmail, having missile tests off the coast of Taiwan, what they have done with human rights, what they have done with proliferation, and what they have done in so many of the activities, there is very strong reason to conclude that the United States should not grant permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China. 
   Let's trade with them on a year-by-year basis. It is an insufficient answer to say that if we don't trade with the People's Republic of China, other nations will. The United States ought to assert U.S. leadership in trying to lead our allies not to trade with China to the benefit of China, if China is to maintain its current course of proliferation, of violating human rights, of espionage activities, and trying to influence the internal elections of a country such as the United States. 
   At a minimum, in conclusion--the two most popular words of any speech--I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee. I urge my colleagues to accept the strong persuasion of the Senator from Tennessee to vote no on the entire bill. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize my Legislative Fellow, Geoff Yeowell, who will be leaving my office at the end of the month to assume the duties of supervisory special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Office in Rota, Spain. 
   Geoff has been on loan to my office from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service where he has worked since 1987. 
   Over the past 11 months, Geoff has become an indispensable part of my legislative shop. He has worked hard on a broad range of issues--each time jumping in feet first, soaking up knowledge, and moving legislation forward in this often complicated process. From his first assignment, he earned the respect of my staff, as well as mine. 
   Geoff's primary duty consisted of working as my legislative assistant for Military Construction. He quickly realized the Milcon appropriations priorities for my home state of Pennsylvania and was helpful in making sure these items were given the time and attention they deserve. 
   Geoff also provided a tremendous service to the people of Pennsylvania in working with those in need of assistance. He demonstrated a remarkable amount of patience and courtesy with each constituent requiring special assistance and worked countless hours to help them in the best way possible. 
   Finally, Geoff was instrumental in working on the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 (S. 2089) which I introduced on February 24, 2000. His skills and judgement in this arena are exceptional. My staff and I were constantly impressed with the wealth of knowledge he demonstrated. 
   His dedication to each project was remarkable, and the assistance he provided to my office will not be easily matched. However, I am informed that for Geoff this level of dedication is par for the course. In 1999 he was selected as a Naval Investigative Criminal Service agent of the year and received the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his work on a major espionage investigation. He also received the 1999 Department of Defense Counterintelligence Award for Investigations. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me today in commending Special Agent Geoff Yeowell for his service as a Legislative Fellow and for his dedication and leadership to our country.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to deal with very serious problems disclosed in hearings yesterday in the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. The hearing involved 88 deaths that have resulted from Firestone tires shredding, and a great many Ford vehicles--mostly Ford Explorers--rolling over and resulting in those 88 deaths. 
   The hearing yesterday produced substantial evidence that ranking officials at Firestone and Ford knew about this problem, but subjected the owners of Ford Explorer vehicles riding on Firestone tires to the risk of death, which did eventuate for 88 people, and to very serious bodily injury formany more. These risks were foisted upon the American traveling public at a time when both Ford and Firestone knew what the problems were, at a time when, in October of 1998, customers in Venezuela had found the problem, and Ford and Firestone were alerted to it, with officials in Venezuela now talking about criminal prosecutions. In August of 1999, the Saudis had their tires replaced, so the people in Saudi Arabia were being protected while U.S. consumers were not being protected. 
   An internal Ford memorandum on March 12, 1999, considered whether Governmental officials in the United States ought to be notified, and a decision was made not to notify Federal officials. The matter then came into sharp focus in late July of this year, with the Ford executive witness testifying that Ford did not know about the problem in its full import until July 27 when Firestone turned over the information to Federal authorities. There was a representation by the Ford witness--which candidly strains credulity--and Firestone made representations that they did not find out about this problem until they had conducted some extraordinary tests--tests which obviously should have been conducted at a much earlier stage. 
   Yesterday, I questioned the Ford and Firestone officials on their willingness to turn over all of the records to the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and they said they would; although, as I had said at the time, I thought there ought to be a subpoena issued which made it an obligation. Failure to perform would subject anybody who did not comply with the subpoena to charges of obstruction of justice. When cases of this sort have arisen in the past, there is a tremendous amount of experience that there is reluctance on the part of companies to turn over their documents, and they are found only after the most detailed and excruciating discovery in litigation. So this is a matter where the documents will be the best evidence as to who knew what, when that was known, and what action, if any, was taken. 
   The tragedy with the Firestone tires and the Ford Explorer rollovers is a matter that is going to have to be determined after very substantial investigation. The witnesses who testified yesterday were Joan Claybrook, President of the Public Citizen Organization, and R. David Pittle, Senior Vice President and Technical Director, Consumers Union. Both of them felt that criminal prosecutions were appropriate, perhaps rising to the level of second degree murder because of a willful disregard or reckless disregard of the safety of others, resulting in death, which is the legal equivalent of malice and which is the basis for a charge as serious as murder in the second degree. 
   Whether that is applicable to Firestone and Ford remains to be seen. However, we find a situation where the laws of the United States are inadequate to deal with this kind of situation. There is no legislation on the books which establishes a prosecution in these terms. 
   Back in 1966, the House of Representatives considered similar legislation. I have considered it for some time and have deferred introducing such legislation because it seemed to me that perhaps it was just a little harsh. But with the experience of Ford and Firestone, I do think it is appropriate for the Congress of the United States to consider such legislation. 
   That is why today I am introducing a bill which would establish criminal sanctions for any person who, in gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care, introduces into interstate commerce a product known by that person to be defective which causes the death or serious bodily injury of any individual, calling for penalties up to 15 years where the requisite malice is shown resulting in death, and up to 5 years where the requisite malice is shown for serious bodily injury. 
   This is a matter I have studied in considerable detail over many years, having represented defendants in personal injury cases--some plaintiffs in personal injury cases--but, more specifically, as district attorney of Philadelphia seeing the impact and the effect of criminal prosecutions and seeing to it that people pay attention. 
   When there are similar monetary awards, it costs the company and it costs the shareholders, but it doesn't do anything to the individuals who make these decisions. Before an individual could be held responsible under my proposed legislation, there would have to be a showing that the person knew there was a defect and that defect subjected a person to death or serious bodily injury. 
   That kind of knowledge and putting the instrumentality into commerce does constitute gross disregard for the safety or the life of another, which is the equivalent of malice and justifies this kind of a prosecution. 
   As I noted, this is a subject I have studied for some time. Although the Firestone-Ford issue came up only yesterday, the studies I have undertaken have shown me the desirability of this kind of legislation. 
   Last year, in Anderson v. General Motors Company, 1999 WL 1466627, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered General Motors to pay a record $4.8 billion in punitive damages when six people were trapped and burned when their Chevrolet Malibu exploded after its fuel tank was ruptured in a rear-end crash. General Motors had made a calculation that it would cost in damages $2.40 per automobile if they left the defect in existence, but to correct and redesign the fuel system to reduce the fire cost would have been $8.59 a car. So that cost analysis did constitute actual malice. 
   That kind of an analysis was very similar to the punitive damages which were awarded in the famous case involving the Ford Pinto, which goes back to a 1981 decision in Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company, 119 Cal. App. 3d 757, where an analysis was made that it would cost some $49.5 million to pay damages resulting from deaths and injuries contrasted with $137 million to pay for correcting the automobile. 
   In this particular case, the punitive damage award was $125 million, but it was subsequently reduced to $3.5 million, which frequently happens in punitive damage awards. 
   In a similar case, Ginny V. White and Jimmy D. White v. Ford Motor Company, CV-N-95-279-DWH (PHA), a 3-year-old child was crushed to death under the rear dual wheels of a Ford truck after it rolled suddenly down a grade. Here, Ford had known of the defect and knew how to correct it easily but did not do so. Punitive damages in that case were awarded at $150 million but have since been reduced to $69 million. 
   These cases are illustrative of the kind of headlines punitive 
   damage awards make in the newspapers but how they are very frequently reduced. But again, the punitive damages do not really deal with the executives who make these decisions. 
   In the case of Fair v. Ford Motor Company, Civil Action 88-CI-101, 27  people were killed when a school bus in which they were riding burned after being struck by another vehicle. Punitive damages were upheld in this case where the facts showed that the fuel tank failure was preventable and that Ford had the capacity and the opportunity to prevent it and failed to do so. 
   In another similar case, Toyota Motor Company v. Moll, 438 So. 2d 192 (Fla. App. 1983), a Toyota Corona was struck in the rear, causing its fuel system to rupture and three women were burned to death. The court found malice on the part of Toyota because Toyota knew of the defective design of the fuel system and, in wanton disregard of the safety of the purchasing public, continued to market their 1973 Toyota Corona. 
   In Ford Motor Company v. Ammerman, 705 N.E. 2d 539 (Ind. App. 1999), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of Indiana imposed punitive damages, finding malice on the part of Ford, when a Bronco slid sideways and rolled over causing very serious injuries, with the court saying: 
   ``It is apparent to this court that Ford was motivated by profits rather than safety when it put into the stream of commerce a vehicle which it knew was dangerous and defective. Ignoring its own data and advice of its engineers, Ford manufactured a vehicle prone to roll-over accidents in spite of being aware that such accidents result in more serious injuries than any other.'' 705 N.E. 2d at 562. 
   There are similar findings in the famous breast implant case, Hopkins v. Dow Corning, 33 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 1994), where they knew that long studies of implants were needed before the product could be marketed but concealed the information. 
   Similarly, in the Dalkon Shield case, Tetuan v. A.H. Robins Co., 738 P.2d 1210 (Kan. 1987), thousands of women were presented with life-threatening and even fatal illnesses with the Kansas Supreme Court noting that the company deliberately and actively concealed the potential dangers of the product, thereby violating their duty to the public. 
   In the interest of time, I will summarize very briefly Batteast v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., 526 N.E. 2d 428 (Ill. App. 1 Dist. 1988), where punitive damages were awarded where drugs were given to individuals knowing of their dangerous propensity. 
   Similarly, in the case of Proctor v. Davis, 682 N.E. 2d 1203 (Ill. App. 1997), a patient had a retina detachment and blindness following the adverse effects of a drug which were known to the manufacturer but not disclosed. 
   In the brief time available this afternoon, I have summarized a series of cases which are only representative--where products have been put in interstate commerce, where there was knowledge on the part of individuals who put those products on the market that they would subject the individuals to risk of serious bodily injury or death, and, when death resulted, they were held liable, with the courts concluding that malice was established by the reckless disregard of the life of another. 
   When we have such a long sequence of cases, when we have the occasional imposition of punitive damages which are characteristically reduced and not really determinative or therapeutic anyway because it goes only after the shareholders as opposed to the individuals who have the ability to eliminate the problem, it is time there was adequate legislation on the Federal books to deal with this sort of problem. 
   I repeat, the culpability of Firestone or Ford has not yet been established, but it strains credulity that the key officials, based on what we heard yesterday in the hearing, did not know of these defects, and with the documents already at hand failed to take action to correct them. That is a matter to be determined. 
   But this legislation, if enacted, will certainly put the officials on notice that they cannot recklessly disregard human life for profits. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment about the statements by Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat that there may be a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood on September 13. That, in my judgment, would be a grave mistake, and the United States and our allies ought to do everything in our power to prevent Chairman Arafat of the Palestinian Authority from making that unilateral declaration of statehood.  
   When the Oslo accords were signed in 1993, there was an agreement that all of the outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinian Authority would be negotiated with a solution. There have been very extensive discussions, including recent talks at Camp David, which have not produced that kind of an agreement and that has led Chairman Arafat to raise the issue--perhaps more accurately called ``threat''--to have a unilateral declaration of statehood on September 13. 
   I have cosponsored S. 3007, which was introduced today by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, which calls for action by the United States in the event that there is a unilateral declaration of statehood. The bill contains provisions which would articulate the policy of the United States not to recognize a unilaterally declared Palestinian state, to extend diplomatic efforts to deny recognition by working with the allies of the United States, the European Union, Japan, and other countries, to downgrade the status of the Palestinian office in the United States if there should be such a unilateral declaration, to prohibit U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority if there should be such a unilateral declaration, to take steps to oppose Palestinian membership in the United Nations or other international organizations, and to oppose Palestinian membership in or assistance from the international financial institutions. 
   I believe this bill is an effective shot across the bow.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of the letter which I wrote to Chairman Arafat is contained in two paragraphs where I say:  
   ..... There is a strong feeling, both in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, as well as that expressed by President Clinton, that there be no such unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   There has been tremendous support in the Senate and House, as well as from the President, for an overall peace settlement and that Congressional support has included U.S. contributions to implement such an accord. That Congressional support would certainly be eroded by a unilateral declaration of statehood.  
   I had urged Chairman Arafat in the past to avoid a unilateral declaration of statehood when the possibility was raised that such a unilateral declaration might be made back on May 4, 1999. 
   Chairman Arafat came to the United States on March 23, and I was scheduled at that time to visit him in his hotel in Virginia, but shortly before our scheduled appointment I found that Chairman Arafat was visiting on the House side in the Capitol complex, and I had an opportunity to invite Chairman Arafat to my Capitol office. 
   At that time, we had an extensive discussion where I urged him not to make the unilateral declaration of statehood. He asked me at that time, if he would refrain from that unilateral declaration of statehood, whether I would make a statement saying it was a wise course of action, giving recognition to the restraint of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority. I said I would do so and that I would make a statement on the floor of the Senate on May 5 if Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, in fact, did not make a unilateral declaration of statehood. I wrote Chairman Arafat to that effect on March 31, 1999. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Congressional RECORD at the conclusion of my statement.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I made two statements for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD--one on April 26, 1999, which I incorporate by reference, and another statement on May 4, 1999, when Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority did not make a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   The meeting I had with Chairman Arafat in my Capitol office was a very interesting one and a very constructive one. One note which I had referred to in one of my earlier statements on the floor is worth a very brief reference. I have a very large poster which has a joint picture of President Clinton with thumbs up and a picture of Chairman Arafat right next to him making the V sign, obviously not taken together but juxtaposed together on one large poster. It looks like a campaign poster, almost as if the two men were running for political office, which, of course, they were not. 
   I had accompanied President Clinton on his trip to Israel in December of 1998. I saw the poster and thought it a nice item of memorabilia and had it framed and put in my Capitol office. When Chairman Arafat saw his picture on my wall, it did a good bit more than any of my persuasive comments to establish an aura of goodwill in a complimentary sense. He very much liked seeing his picture there. In fact, he wanted to take a picture of the two of us standing in front of his picture, which now stands beside the poster in my Capitol office. 
   I mention that because of the--I am searching for the right word. ``Congenial meeting'' might not be exactly right, but it was a businesslike meeting where Chairman Arafat listened to my arguments against a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   When I recite this, I do not really mean to suggest my voice was the determinative voice. I think that comported with what the 
   Palestinian Authority had in mind in any event. I think every extra bit of pressure that can be brought ought to be brought. That is why I wrote to Chairman Arafat earlier this year, on August 18, and that is why I am supporting the bill introduced by the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, which would impose certain restraints and, in effect, certain sanctions on the Palestinian Authority if they do make a unilateral declaration of statehood. In my judgment, it would set back the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority substantially. I retain some optimism that the differences between Israel and the Palestinian Authority may yet be reconciled. 
   I compliment the President and the Secretary of State for their very extensive efforts to try to bring about that accord. I believe those efforts should be continued and intensified. I also compliment Dennis Ross of the State Department who has done so much in the negotiating process with the parties. 
   While there are meetings underway at the United Nations, there may be some occasion for the President to act further in consultation with Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to try to bring about advances on the peace process and ultimately an accord. But certainly a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinian Authority would be met with grave opposition in this Chamber--I know that for a certainty--and I believe also in the House of Representatives. 
   In conclusion, I urge Chairman Arafat and his colleagues in the Palestinian Authority not to make a unilateral declaration of statehood on September 13, or at any other time, but to continue the peace process to try to work out outstanding differences in accordance with the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority on the Oslo accord. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee a question regarding the defense appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2001. I noticed that the conference report retained a very important project to buy new bayonets for the Marine Corps. Is the funding within the Marine Corps Procurement line in fact for Bayonet 2000?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would restore Amtrak's eligibility to continue leasing vehicles from the General Services Administration's Interagency Fleet Management System. 
   The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 inadvertently removed this eligibility. By way of further explanation, in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Amtrak was removed from the list of ``mixed ownership and government corporations.'' 
   An inadvertent and unintended consequence of this change was brought to Amtrak's attention earlier this spring. The Federal Railroad Administration questioned Amtrak's eligibility to continue leasing automobiles from the General Services Administration's Interagency Fleet Management System. The Federal Railroad Administration and General Services Administration agreed that Amtrak was no longer eligible. 
   As a result of this inadvertent change, there is a fleet of some 1,650 vehicles for which Amtrak currently pays $10 million to lease through the General Services Administration. If Amtrak is forced to lease its vehicles privately, it will cost a total of $25 million annually. 
   The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act was intended to allow Amtrak to transition to operating self-sufficiency. 
   This legislation was not intended to put new financial burdens on the corporation, which is in a transition to operating self-sufficiency. This problem was called to my attention yesterday by Governor Tommy Thompson, who is Chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors. The operation for Amtrak has been in high gear to operate like a business in its goal to achieve operational self-sufficiency by fiscal year 2003. The strategy that Governor Thompson and others have articulated, as provided to me, involves, one, developing high-speed rail corridors; two, building a market-based rail network; three, forging partnerships with State and local authorities and large commercial clients; and four, offering a new service guarantee, which is unparalleled in the transportation industry.  
   These strategies are already producing very considerable results. Amtrak's annual revenues reached a record of $1.84 billion in fiscal year 1999. Just over 21 million passengers traveled on Amtrak last year, for a third consecutive year of ridership growth. Overall ridership in the last 5 months is up 8 percent over the same period of last year. Ridership on the high-speed regional service corridor is up nearly 40 percent over the trains that were replaced. 
   Further information provided to me is that the development of more commercial partnerships has boosted mail and express revenue by 35 percent in this calendar year. Amtrak's net worth growth strategy, introduced in February, will expand passenger rail service to 21 States, based on a comprehensive economic analysis of the national rail system and potential market opportunities. The national growth strategy is expected to add as much as $229 million of revenue by the year 2003. New partnerships have been forged with Motorola, Dobbs, and Hertz Corporation, among others. Amtrak's new web site for ticketing has been named one of the 100 most popular bookmark sites on the Internet. For fiscal year 2000, sales are up 113 percent over the same period last year. 
   Since Amtrak's announcement of its service guarantee, it has recorded a satisfactory rate of 99.97 percent. These results point to the successful turnabout Amtrak is making in its efforts to achieve operational self-sufficiency. A goal has been set for Amtrak, and Amtrak is taking the proper steps to achieve that self-sufficiency. My suggestion to the Senate is that we not undermine the corporation by forcing it to swallow some $15 million in unintended costs, while losing its GSA eligibility for the remainder of the glidepath. 
   The General Services Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Amtrak agreed that the legislation referred to contained an unintended consequence and should be rectified. Amtrak must return all 1,650 vehicles by October 1 of this year, under the existing law. This provision puts an undue and unwarranted burden upon the General Services Administration, which does not want many of these specialized vehicles back in their inventory because they have nobody else who would lease them, so it would be a loss to GSA, as well. 
   This amendment would restore Amtrak's eligibility to continue leasing vehicles from the General Services Administration's Interagency Management Fleet. I am advised by staff, who have consulted with the staff of the General Services Administration, that both GSA and the Federal Railroad Administration, as well as Amtrak, support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, it would be preferable, candidly, not to put this amendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill. I have consulted with the Parliamentarian, and there is a defense of germaneness, which is an answer to a challenge on grounds that this is legislation on an appropriations bill. The provisions of H.R. 4461 that we are currently considering, on page 5, line 9, provides the following under ``Payments, Including Transfers of Funds'':  
   For payment of space rental and related costs pursuant to Public law 92-313, including authorities pursuant to the 1984 delegation of authority from the Administrator of the General Services to the Department of Agriculture under 40 U.S.C. 486, for programs and activities of the Department which are included in this Act, and for the operation, maintenance, improvement, and repair of Agriculture buildings, $150,343,000, to remain available until expended.  
   As I say, I am advised by the Parliamentarian that this language is sufficient to establish germaneness, and germaneness is a defense for challenging this amendment as legislation on an appropriations bill. 
   There is an obvious concern raised here about whether Amtrak should be able to have the benefit of this leasing arrangement because Amtrak is supposed to be self-sufficient, some might say. The reality is that Amtrak is under a transition period to attain self-sufficiency. We are looking at an additional 2-year window here. I suggest that the savings of $15 million to Amtrak really would not be at the expense of the Federal Government. These are savings which, if the leasing were not possible, and the GSA has nobody to lease it to, is actually a net gain for the Federal Government. While Amtrak would have to pay $25 million annually instead of $10 million to GSA, if GSA doesn't have anybody to lease these vehicles to, which is what has been represented to me, it ends up that the Federal Government loses $10 million, which it would get from these leases. So it is a win-win situation for the Federal Government to have the $10 million in lease payments, and it saves Amtrak some $15 million. 
   What we really need to do is, obviously, put Amtrak back on its feet. In the course of just a few minutes today, I was able to find 10 cosponsors of this legislation. If we had more time to survey the Senate, I think we would find many more Senators. I don't think this is necessary as a disclosure of interest, but I have an interest in Amtrak, besides being a Senator, in wanting Amtrak to succeed. I ride Amtrak every day. It is really an enviable position to be in, whereas some of my colleagues have to fight airplane schedules. Some of us can ride the metroliner, which leaves on the hour. I can tell you that the metroliner is good service, and the other service is excellent as well. Those trains are filled and they are money-makers. The new Acela train is about to be established, which will get from Washington to Philadelphia even faster. 
   Amtrak has come out with a new guarantee and it is moving ahead. There is no reason, it seems to me, to let this technicality stand, which would cost Amtrak $15 million and probably cost GSA $10 million if, as expected, it is unable to lease out all of these vehicles, which would be returned on October 1 of this year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I welcome an opportunity to present these issues to students. Anyone in the balcony observing this debate, students, and as the Senator from Arizona alludes to students, perhaps a more elite audience, wanting to know the theory, the philosophy, the approach, the ethics of the proposition, I welcome addressing students on this subject as I  spend a good bit of my time addressing high schools, colleges, junior high schools, and even grade schools taking the message to the students about what government ought to be doing. 
   It is a fairly common reference--not too humorous anymore--to analogize making sausage to the making of legislation. But the making of legislation is a very complicated matter. It has to take into account the accommodation of 260 million Americans and many contrary issues and many contrary differences. 
   When the argument is raised about this is a matter turned down by the authorizing committee, the Commerce Committee, and turned down by the Governmental Affairs Committee--they are not the last word. The chairman of the Commerce Committee does not have the last word. He may have it as the Commerce Committee is organized, directed, and run. And the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee may have the last word as to how that committee is run. But the Senate has the last word. 
   There are 100 of us and each Senator has rights under the rules of the Senate. When this Senator offers an amendment, this Senator is offering an amendment within his rights. Even if the full Commerce Committee backs the chairman, or even if the full Governmental Affairs Committee backs the chairman, those committees are not the last word. The last word is the Senate, the 100 Members who constitute the Senate. 
   In offering this amendment, this Senator is functioning within the rules. When the Senator from Arizona says that this amendment has nothing to do with agriculture and he finds the amendment offensive, I take a little offense at that. I set forth the germaneness, which entitles this amendment to be offered on this bill. 
   It is not an unusual occurrence in the Senate to offer legislation on an appropriations bill. That rule has been breached so often that it is hardly referenced anymore. We are trying to come back to a standard of not legislating on an appropriations bill, but the rules of the Senate govern that, and I cited the provisions of the bill we are considering from the House of Representatives which makes this germane. 
   That is the advice I received from the Parliamentarian. That is not my own peculiar, personal opinion. If someone wants to challenge the amendment, there are ways to do so if someone says this violates the rules. But I do not think it does, and the Parliamentarian does not think it does. 
   When there are references to illegal activities by Amtrak, if there are illegal activities, let's refer it to the Department of Justice. Some might say a reference to the Department of Justice doesn't do much good in the United States of America today, and I would not want to argue that point too vociferously, but let's give 
   them a chance. Has it been referred to the Department of Justice? 
   I attended a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation where Governor Thompson appeared last year. But we met yesterday on another matter. He called this issue to my attention. 
   This is not exactly my purview, to take up this issue. It doesn't come within any of my committee responsibilities. But no high-priced lobbyist came to me to talk about this issue, a high-priced lobbyist who might be fundraising for me. Nobody came to talk to me about it. In fact, not even a low-priced lobbyist came to me to talk about it. But Governor Thompson, a very distinguished American and very distinguished public servant, did. I told him I was concerned about it. Before the afternoon, I had a flood of telephone calls from Amtrak, asking me to look into it, to check it out. 
   This morning I called Senator KOHL who had been working on the matter. Then I started to canvas a few Senators and got 10 cosponsors very promptly. Senator JEFFORDS--I ask unanimous consent he be added as a cosponsor.

   Mr. SPECTER. There is a reference here to ``idiotic.'' I take more than umbrage at that, and would cite rule XIX which says:  
   No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.  
   I can't represent whether I was called an idiot, or whether I was said to have offered an idiotic amendment. But either way, offering an idiotic amendment is not becoming conduct for a Senator. And I consulted with the Parliamentarian. The rule is that a Senator may challenge another Senator who violates rule XIX by standing and saying: I call the Senator to order. 
   I choose not to do that. I don't want to make a Federal case of it. But, also, I choose not to ignore it, and I think it is unbecoming conduct for a Senator to offer an idiotic amendment. But I don't think this amendment is idiotic. But I will let the body decide that on a vote, either on a challenge on procedural grounds or on a vote on the merits. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of brief response to the argument by the Senator from Colorado, I agree with him that Amtrak needs to be self-sufficient, and that is the purpose of the legislation. The question is, How fast is that going to occur? They are looking for self-sufficiency under the existing legislation by the year 2003. What they are asking for here is an extension from October 1, 2000, to October 1, 2002. I went into some detail on the information provided by Governor Thompson, who is chairman of the Board of Amtrak, as to the progress which they are making. 
   When the Senator from Arizona says there is no mistake here, he may be right about that. Maybe this is not an unintended consequence, but where you have a provision which reaches the extent of leasing under these circumstances, I doubt that anybody thought about that when the legislation was drafted. Maybe it is not an unintended consequence, but I doubt very much that it is an intended consequence. It is something that happened that nobody had thought about. Perhaps if nobody had thought about it, it is genuinely an unintended consequence. 
   Considering the issues we face in this body, when you are talking about $15 million, although not unsubstantial, we seldom take a protracted period of time as we wrestle with the budget of $1.850 trillion. I have not calculated the percent, but it is a mighty tiny fraction. This is symbolic as to what we are trying to do to get Amtrak on its feet. 
   When the Senator from Arizona says it is wrong to put this amendment on this bill, I have to categorically disagree with that as a matter of fact because if the rules allow this amendment to go on this bill, it is not wrong to put this amendment on this bill. It may be an unwise amendment, it may be against public policy, but it is not a wrongful act to put this amendment on this bill when the advice that the Senator from Arizona got was the same as the advice this Senator got: that as a matter of parliamentary procedure, it is an appropriate matter. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is a heavy cloud hanging over the Senate Chamber today. A bouquet of flowers with a black tapestry is on the desk of our departed colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL, whose presence will be greatly missed. 
   There is a saying that in Washington, in Congress, in the Government, a great deal could be accomplished if there was less concern--perhaps no concern--for who gets the credit. PAUL COVERDELL epitomized that concept. 
   He was always in the thick of the action. He was always prepared to help. He did it with conciliation, with good will and accommodation, and in the spirit of compromise; self-effacing and never interested in the credit, not interested in the news reports or the television acclaim or any of what is customarily associated with the politics, the public relations of the Congress in Washington, DC. That kind of effective, quiet Senator behind the scenes is a relative rarity here. 
   He had a very distinguished career in the Georgia Legislature, in the Georgia State Senate, going back to 1970. He was the Republican leader. Just this morning I talked with people who knew him in Georgia. It was the same PAUL COVERDELL 30 years ago whom we saw in Washington heading up the Peace Corps, a nonglamorous but a very important undertaking to project America around the world with young people, and then in his election to the Senate in 1992 and the immediate recognition of his colleagues who knew him well, even though he was not so well known with the television cameras but very well known by his colleagues, and elected to a leadership position, No. 4, in the Republican caucus. 
   He was the point man for the Republican caucus on education. He brought  to that very important subject, a subject of priority second to none in America today and in the world today, again his quiet effectiveness. 
   I had the opportunity to work with him on the appropriations bills on the subcommittee which I chair which covers, among other Departments, the Department of Education. For the last 2 years, we had a list of a couple hundred amendments, and in the flurry of floor action, PAUL COVERDELL was enormously effective in talking to Senators about their amendments, saying which ones could be accepted, which ones could be accommodated without coming to the floor even for a voice vote, and then narrowing the frame of reference as to which ones had to be debated with time agreements and which ones had to be voted upon. 
   The management of a Senate appropriations bill is a complicated matter, especially when you have a $100 billion-plus budget and you have to worry about Head Start, drug-free schools, the National Institutes of Health, worker safety, and the myriad problems. PAUL COVERDELL was an effective man to get that job done. 
   Senator BILL FRIST--Dr. BILL FRIST--gave us all a report on the medical aspects of what happened to Senator COVERDELL: that it was not painful, an extraordinary medical incident with problems which simply could not be contained or controlled. 
   I know every Senator sends sympathies to the Coverdell family, to his wife Nancy. He will be sorely missed for the great contribution which he has made. 
   There are tough days in the Senate. Last year, in October, we had the passing of our dear friend, John Chafee, and now the 
   passing of PAUL COVERDELL. While we intend to focus on matters of Government and high finance, international affairs and war and peace, nothing is more sobering than to see what is really important with the loss of a very special friend and a really great Senator.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the 20th century story of the Shanin Family portrays the success of immigrants in America and the success of America itself. 
   The naturalization papers of Freda Mermorvich Shanin show that she traveled from Lugansk, Russia and arrived at Ellis Island on October 31, 1906, with her two children, Lilli and Max, enroute to joining her husband, Mordecai Shanin, in St. Joe, MO. The Shanin Family grew with the addition of five more children: Annie, Louie, Rose, Albert, and Margaret. Mordecai Shanin struggled to earn a living with a variety of occupations including selling Singer sewing machines. 
   Lilli Shanin, later to become my mother, told me about her father dying in her arms form a heart attack in 1916 on the backstairs of the Shanin home at 922 South Ninth Street. My grandmother, Bubbie Freda, told me she was left a widow with seven children and seven dollars. Deeply religious, proud and independent, Freda Shanin raised her children with the help of Lilli, who left school to work in a tablet factory, and the other siblings pitching in when they became old enough to contribute to the family's support. 
   In 1917 Freda Shanin met a young immigrant, Harry Specter, who was buying dry goods and blankets at the wholesale house for sales in his travels to farms in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. Harry Specter asked Freda Shanin if she had a daughter. ``Yes I do'' said the protective mother, ``But she's too young for you.'' 
   Harry Specter courted Lilli Shanin, won her heart, went off to World War I, was wounded in the Argonne Forest, and returned in uniform to St. Joe to marry the beautiful 19-year-old redhead in her resplendent white gown carrying a large bouquet of roses. That union produced Morton, Hilda, Shirley, and ARLEN SPECTER, who in turn brought Mordecai and Freda Shanin 10 great grandchildren, 25 great-great grandchildren and 6 great-great-great grandchildren. 
   The three sons, Max, Louie, and Albert grew up in hard times in St. Joe with Albert, who added a granddaughter to the family tree, becoming a prosperous pharmacy owner who spent much of his time and drugstore medicines devoted to his ailing mother. Annie, who wrote a book of Hebrew poetry in 1945, married a distinguished chemist, Dr. Morton Kleiman, and they in turn had Dr. Adina Kleiman, a noted psychologist, and Dr. Jay Kleiman, an eminent cardiologist, who added two more great grandchildren to the Shanin family. Margaret ``Mashie'' Shanin married handsome Leslie Hoffman, who brought a truckload of watermelons from the family produce business in Waco, TX, to St. Joe. Mashie added to the family tree with four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 
   Rose Shanin left St. Joe at the age of 18 to live with her sister, Lilli, in Wichita, where Rose became a high-powered executive secretary for the Beyer Grain Company. In 1930, at my birth, Tante Rose intervened to save me from the name ``Abraham'' with the suggested ``Arlen'' after the famous movie star, Richard Arlen. Rose would later start my brother Morton and me in the 
   development of our work ethics as messengers riding our bicycles all over Wichita delivering bills of lading for Beyer and other grain companies. Rose married Julius Isenberg and added a daughter and son to the growing family tree. 
   Judaism has continued to be the mainstay of the Shanin Family with many, albeit not all, maintaining strictly kosher homes, with a few emigrants to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to strengthen the State of Israel. The 70 descendants of Mordecai and Freda Shanin have contributed to the values, prosperity, and success of the United States. Interspersed in the family tree are Ph.Ds, LL.Ds, MDs, a Federal judge, businesspeople, professionals, and elected public officials. 
   Today, members of the Shanin Family have assembled in Washington for a Shanin Family reunion led by the matriarchs of the family, Annie Kleiman and Rose Isenberg and Joyce Specter, who were privileged to meet with the President today. The entire family visited the White House, the Senate, the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Monument, President Kennedy's gravesite, and the Secret Service headquarters. 
   America is the spectacular story of immigrants who have come in search of freedom and opportunity who have contributed so much. The Shanin Family is typical of the great contributions by immigrants, who, along with native Americans, have made the United States the greatest country in the history of the world.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. of Allentown, Pennsylvania and an industrial team are developing a unique oxygen-producing technology based on high-temperature, ion transport membranes (ITM). The technology, known as ITM Oxygen, would be combined with an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system to produce oxygen and electric power for the iron/steel; glass, pulp and paper; and chemicals and refining industries. The ITM Oxygen project is a cornerstone project in the Department of Energy's (DOE) Vision 21 program and has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of so-called ``tonnage oxygen'' plants for IGCC systems. 
   Working in partnership with DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory, the first of three phases of this $24.8 million, 50 percent cost-shared research program will be completed in September 2001. Research and development conducted as part of phase 1 of the ITM Oxygen program has addressed the high-risk materials, fabrication and engineering issues needed to develop the ITM Oxygen technology to the proof-of-concept point. In phase 2, a full-scale ITM Oxygen module will be tested and will be followed by further scale-up to test the production and integration of multiple full-scale ITM modules. In the final phase, a pre-commercial demonstration unit will be designed, constructed, integrated with a gas turbine and tested at a suitable field site. At the end of phase 3, it is expected that sufficient aspects of the technology will have been demonstrated to enable industrial commercialization. 
   I thank the Senator from Washington for adding $3.2 million to Department of Energy's IGCC. I also understand that the House of Representatives added $3.2 million to the FY01 budget request for IGCC without designating any one project to receive the increased funding. As part of its FY01 budget, DOE requested $2.2 million as part of its $32 million IGCC budget to complete phase 1 of ITM Oxygen. 
   Now I would urge the Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory to provide $2 million of the $3.2 million as an increase to the FY01 budget request for IGCC to allow the programs second phase to begin in FY01. This additional funding would allow the ITM Oxygen team to have a smooth transition to the program's second phase and to level over future years the DOE cost share needed to maintain the program's schedule. This additional funding would also allow the ITM Oxygen team to make an early commitment to accelerate construction of the test facility and the full-scale ITM Oxygen module. Accelerating this program makes sound business sense. Now I am confident that DOE and the National Energy laboratory will have the funding to do this. I urge them to work with the ITM Oxygen team and make it happen.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one item came up in the course of the consideration of the bill on which I commented I would respond to regarding the increase in this bill over last year's bill. 
   This year's bill contains a program level of $104.5 billion for fiscal year 2001. This is a $7.9 billion increase over fiscal year 2000, which had a program level of $96.6 billion. When assertions have been made that the bill has grown by 20.4 percent--that is over 20 percent--that is not correct. That calculation is made by comparing the fiscal year 2001 program level of $104.5 billion with the fiscal year 2000 budget authority level of $86.5 billion. That is not an accurate comparison. 
   When you compare the 2001 actual program level to the 2000 program level, the real increase is 8.2 percent. 
   This question has come up with some frequency. I thought it would be useful to make that explanation. 
   Mr. President, I think we are now prepared to proceed to the Wellstone amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the objective of the Wellstone amendment is laudable in trying to have reasonable prices. The difficulty is that this was tried 7 or 8 years ago and was found to be very counterproductive. Instead of encouraging tests and development of pharmaceutical products, it discouraged them. We have already adopted the Wyden amendment which provides for a study on this issue. 
   There are some very important matters raised by the Senator from Minnesota. Our subcommittee will hold hearings on this subject shortly upon our return in July to try to find out whether the NIH ought to have a share of the patents or what would be a fair approach. There has been substantial experience with what the Senator from Minnesota suggests in the 1992, 1993, 1994 range, and it was counterproductive. That is why, although the objective is laudable, I am forced to oppose the amendment. 
   I move to table the Wellstone amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

Adding $8.75 billion is going to put a burden on the biggest spenders in this Chamber to support this kind of an increase. I want to see a lot more funding in a lot more places, including IDEA, but this is just over the top. I say that with great respect for my esteemed colleague.

   Mr. SPECTER. I am familiar with the horrible effects of Huntington's disease. In my state, 1,200 people are affected. But I am optimistic about a cure. HD research is advancing rapidly and could be the Rosetta stone to treatments for Alzheimer's Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative disorders that together strike millions of people and their families. 
   I am also hopeful that through public and private medical research funding, we will soon approach a better understanding of, and perhaps even a cure for, this terrible disease. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are part of this effort. The federal government clearly has a significant role to play in this struggle. In Fiscal Year 1999, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) dedicated $62.5 million to Huntington's Disease research. Also commendable is the commitment of the Huntington's Disease Society of America (HDSA), which this year will allocate an estimated $2.8 million to research in this area.

   Mr. SPECTER. I understand the Senator's concerns. The Committee has included nearly $1.2 billion in this year's appropriations bill for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS. This is a significant increase over the FY00 level. I believe that the NINDS, and the NIH generally, devote additional resources to Huntington's disease research in FY 2001. I also believe that the NINDS could increase support for the centers of excellence and other programs developed by the Huntington's Disease Society for the care of HD patients.

   Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator knows, we are entering the third year of a bipartisan effort to double funding for the NIH. Within that budget, we have been able to provide significant increases in the budget for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
   It is my hope and intention that, with these additional funds, NIDDK will fully implement the Strategic Plan for PKD put forward by a panel of blue-ribbon experts which they convened in 1998. These expert scientists and doctors have stated that, with a total PKD research budget of $20 million, which we provide in this bill, they are confident that a treatment for PKD can be achieved in the very near future. In fact, I am very heartened by recent reports indicating that a drug currently used to treat cancer has been shown to actually stop the progression of PKD in laboratory animals. This discovery, coupled with statements from our leading genetic researchers to the effect that PKD is the most rapidly advancing area of genetic research, convinces me that the additional funds provided in this bill will allow NIDDK to produce a treatment and eventual cure for this devastating disease. 
   May I say to my colleague that I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that NIDDK implements the Strategic Plan for PKD. This bill provides the budgetary means to do that, and I will be following up with NIDDK on the disposition of those funds.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to raise a very important issue concerning the vital safety-net hospitals in my state of Pennsylvania. As my colleagues are aware, the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital program consists of special supplemental payments made to hospitals to offset the costs for providing uncompensated care. I worked closely over the last few years with Pennsylvania hospitals and the Health Care Financing Administration to resolve a dispute concerning the inclusion of a State's General Assistance population as a part of its Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment calculation. In August 1998, HCFA asserted that Pennsylvania hospitals were incorrectly including General Assistance (GA) days in their Medicare DSH calculation, and claimed that they should only have included Medicaid days. These payments represent a significant portion of many hospitals' revenues, and any proposed reduction puts the Commonwealth's neediest populations at risk. 
   The dispute raised further concerns about how HCFA interpreted its own rules and regulations. Medicare fiscal intermediaries had been reimbursing hospitals with the GA days included for the past twelve years. Yet, beginning in mid-1998, HCFA reversed its own intermediaries' interpretation and began recouping the so-called overpayments for certain years, as far back as fiscal year 1993. The impact to Pennsylvania's hospitals would have totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   Indeed, I was encouraged when Secretary Shalala and Administrator DeParle were able to work out a retroactive solution regarding the DSH calculations. As of October 1, 1998, Pennsylvania hospitals stopped including the GA days in their DSH calculations, but since the law was unclear enough for the fiscal intermediaries to have been confused for twelve years, they did not have to give back any reimbursements. I understand that 35 other States had been including General Assistance days in their Medicare DSH calculations, thus the resolution of this dispute was critical for many safety-net hospitals across the nation. 
   However, Mr. President, it now appears that Pennsylvania hospitals are once again at a disadvantage with regard to their Medicare DSH reimbursements, as HCFA is graying the regulatory area we thought had been clarified last year. 
   I understand from Pennsylvania hospitals that HCFA is unfairly applying the GA days and Medicare DSH calculation policy across States. Beginning in January of 2000, HCFA began allowing some States which operate under Medicaid Section 1115 waivers to include the GA population in the Medicare DSH calculation, thus significantly increasing those States' DSH reimbursements. Since Pennsylvania hospitals operate under a Section 1915 waiver rather than Section 1115, it has been made clear to them that they cannot count GA populations in their calculations. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in my commitment to ensure that HCFA clarifies once and for all how the GA population should be treated under the Medicare DSH program, thus assuring that Pennsylvania and all States will be treated fairly under one uniform and understandable policy.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. We were conferring about the last amendment so I was unable to be on the floor when this debate started. We are interested in a time agreement. I have just discussed the matter with the Senator from North Dakota, who has the second-degree amendment. It would be in the managers' interest to see if we could limit debate to 1 hour equally divided on the first-degree and second-degree amendment, and then have votes on both amendments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought a parliamentary inquiry a few minutes ago. I am glad to wait 5 minutes until Senator KENNEDY has finished his comments. I have asked the Parliamentarian to review his rules. 
   There was a very heated exchange for more than an hour back in 1987, shortly after Senator BYRD had Senator Packwood arrested, as to the practice of having one Senator, the leader, yield time to other Senators. I believe the correct application of the rule is that the first Senator who seeks recognition is recognized and then the question arises as to whether time will be yielded to him when there is a time agreement. That is the point I was making. I have no concern about waiting 5 minutes or longer for another Senator. I do have a concern about the propriety of a Senator being recognized who first seeks recognition. 
   I have sought recognition to comment briefly about this legislation. I believe the Jeffords amendment is a solid amendment. His committee has looked into this issue very extensively with respect to eliminating discrimination based upon genes and medical information and research with respect to health care. 
   I do think the objectives of the Daschle amendment are sound, in seeking to avoid discrimination in employment as well as in health care. I have had an opportunity to review the Daschle amendment very briefly. From the review which I have made and which staff has made, I have some grave concerns about some of the provisions which are very complicated and which have not been subjected to hearings. 
   Again, I think its objectives are laudable. I think the American people do expect protection and confidentiality on these issues on employment as well as on health care. 
   I express my concern about our ability to handle this matter in conference on this state of the record. I think it is more than a matter of people's rights and obligations and objectives and what we ought to have. We need to have a bill which sticks together, which makes sense, and which will stand the kind of scrutiny and examination and analysis to which it will be subjected. 
   One of the grave problems our legislation has, when subjected to judicial review, is that it is hard to figure out sometimes, especially when there are no hearings, no markups, and no analysis. I have discussed with the Senator from Vermont the possibility of his committee having hearings in July. He may have a problem with that. My subcommittee will have hearings on this subject so that if the Daschle amendment passes and we have in conference its consideration, we will try to work through the complexities of this legislation. 
   Again, I think the objectives of what Senator DASCHLE looks to are exactly right. I do think those people who vote against the Daschle amendment are going to be questioned for not having concerns about privacy on a very important matter. 
   Last week we had a motion to recommit this bill for prescription drugs. If that motion had passed, I, frankly, don't know what my subcommittee would have done on prescription drugs. Our subcommittee is a very competent subcommittee, but I don't know that our competence extends to legislating on prescription drugs, taking that into account and working that 
   through, which is really a matter for the Finance Committee. I have been questioned about why I was unwilling to have the recommitment. I have said, because I have the responsibility for dealing with it as the manager of the bill. 
   So there is a lot to recommend the Daschle amendment in terms of objectives and moving along, but I caution my colleagues about where we end up in terms of this bill without the hearings, without the refinement, without the analysis. I am not making any critique or criticism of the author of the bill. Any bill which is constructed without hearings and without markup and without that kind of rigorous analysis has natural problems. Even with hearings and with markup, there are still problems that have to be worked out. 
   I express my agreement with the Senator from Vermont on his legislation, express my agreement with the objectives of the legislation of the Senator from South Dakota, and say that if we have it in conference, we will do our best to try to work through the kinds of problems and deal with this very important issue.

   Mr. SPECTER. What I would like to say for the record is that we hope to have a unanimous consent agreement here--we are not ready to propound it--where the Dorgan amendment and the Nickles amendment, which would be ordinarily a second-degree amendment, would be treated as first-degree amendments and try to seek a time limit of 45 minutes on each. But we understand that we are not in a position to do that because there has not been an adequate opportunity to review the Nickles amendment. I wanted to make that statement. 
   If the Senator from North Dakota wants to lay his amendment down, that is entirely appropriate. We just hope that when we have another amendment ready to go, either the Helms amendment or Wellstone amendment, we could set aside the Dorgan amendment and proceed with argument on something we can close debate on, and then come back at the earliest moment to the Dorgan amendment, just as a management matter.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before I comment on the pending amendment,  the ranking member of the subcommittee and I have conferred, as we have been trying to have all of the amendments submitted. We make a request at this time that any Senator who has an amendment to this bill, let us know what it is by 11 o'clock. It is our intention, shortly thereafter, to propound a unanimous consent request that the amendments submitted to us at that time be the only amendments which will be considered on the bill. That is by 11 o'clock. 
   Briefly, on the pending amendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, it is a very good amendment which allocates $25 million to fetal alcohol syndrome. Some $15 million is currently allocated. It may be even a greater amount should be allocated for this very pressing problem.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill which has been reported out by the Appropriations Committee appropriates some $40.2 billion to education funding, an increase of $4.6 billion over last year. This bill has $100 million more than the President asked for. We have assessed the priorities as the subcommittee saw them and as the full committee saw them and have made very substantial increases in very many important accounts. 
   For example, on the title I grants, there is an increase of $394 million, bringing the total to $8.3 billion. On the 21st Century Afterschool Program, there is an increase of $146 million, coming to $600 million. On special education, where we have made an extraordinary effort to try to have the Federal Government meet its obligation, we have made an increase of $1.3 billion to $7.3 billion. On title VI innovative education State grants, we had an increase--this was considered so important--from $400 million to $3.1 billion. On Pell grants, we had an increase of $350, to $3,650, a very important grant program enabling people to go to college. On the higher education programs, we had an increase of $165 million to $1.7 billion. 
   The amendment which the Senator from Massachusetts has offered is a very worthwhile amendment. I do not deny that for a moment. If we had more funding, I would be glad to see us increase the money in that account by what the Senator from Massachusetts would like to have. But the difficulty is that we have assessed the priorities. We have stretched the subcommittee allocation to $104.5 billion. That is the maximum amount which could be obtained, consistent with the wishes of our caucus. In fact, that is stretching the matter. 
   Last year, we lost some 20 members of the Republican caucus of 55 because there was too much money in the bill as it was viewed on our side of the aisle. But we have come in here with $104.5 billion and made allocations as we see fit, as we assessed the priorities. 
   Regrettably, I could not be on the floor yesterday to debate the Wellstone amendment and the Bingaman amendment and the Murray amendment because I was busy on a Judiciary Committee hearing where I have the responsibility to chair the subcommittee  on the Department of Justice oversight. If time permits today, I am going to talk a little bit about that. But when Senator WELLSTONE offered an amendment for $1.7 billion to increase title I funding, I would, frankly, like to see that funding done. Title I is very important, but I had to vote against it because it is a matter of assessing the priorities. 
   When Senator BINGAMAN offered a $250 million increase, again on title I, it was very meritorious. There is no higher priority, in my opinion, than education. The only priority which equals education is health care. 
   The allocations which our subcommittee has made have to take into account education and health care. We have increased the funding very materially on the National Institutes of Health and on drug rehabilitation programs and on school violence programs--all of which have to come out of the overall funding of $104.5 billion. 
   Senator MURRAY offered an amendment on class size, wanting to add $350 million. She disagreed with what the committee has done on the subcommittee recommendation, meeting the President's request for $1.4 billion for teachers to reduce class size. But we added a provision, if the local school districts want to use it for something else, they could get their share somewhere else. 
   So we come now to the amendment which is pending. It was just authorized in 1997-1998. There was no appropriation for support for teacher quality and professional development in 1998. In fiscal year 1999, there was an allocation of $77 million. It went up last year to $98 million. It is true, the funding has leveled. 
   I heard the Senator from Massachusetts say this funding is an indictment. That is just a figure of speech, but if it is an indictment, the President is included as well as the Appropriations Committee because that is the President's request. The President has already issued a veto threat on the bill because he doesn't like our allocations and our priorities. But the last time I read the Constitution, the Congress has the appropriations responsibility. Certainly the President has to sign the bill, or we can have passage over the veto, but we have established the priorities. On this matter of teacher quality and professional development, we have met the President's figure. 
   I approached the Senator from Massachusetts for some light talk before the amendment was offered. I said: Senator KENNEDY, how much money do we have to have in the bill so as to preclude a Kennedy amendment to add money? I ask him that every year. I want to know what the answer is next year, so we can bring a bill, hopefully, which would have sufficient money. But if it is $1.4 billion for class size, someone is going to offer an amendment for more money. Senator MURRAY did so, for $350 million more. Whatever the amount of money we put in, somebody is going to offer an amendment for more money. 
   I said last year, in voting against the add-ons, that I had 
   cast more difficult votes that I did not like in the 4 days I managed this bill than I had cast in the previous 18 years I had been in the Senate because I am a firm believer in education. 
   In the Specter household, my parents had very little. My mother went to the eighth grade; my father, an immigrant, had no formal education. My brother and two sisters and I have been able to share in the American dream because of educational opportunity. I have been on this subcommittee for my entire tenure in the Senate, and I am doing everything I can to promote education in America so everybody has the maximum opportunity. 
   I would like to spend more money on teacher recruitment, teacher development, but it cannot be done within the confines of the very enormous allocation we have at the present time. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have left on the 30 minutes?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the argument on education, it is a matter of priorities. We have a very extensive allocation of $104.5 billion. Much as I would like to see additional funding for teacher training and teacher recruitment, it is simply a matter of priorities. I am constrained to oppose the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my remaining time, or at least in a portion of it, I think it worthwhile to comment on the very extensive hearing which was held by the Judiciary Committee yesterday on the issue of independent counsel because the matter is now pending before the Attorney General of the United States as to whether independent counsel ought to be appointed. 
   The subcommittee on the Department of Justice oversight has conducted extensive hearings. Even before the subcommittee began its hearing process, this is an issue which I raised with the Attorney General on judiciary oversight more than 3 years ago in April of 1997. At that time, I raised the question of hard money and have consistently called for an investigation. We had the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Federal Election Commission testify a week ago today on current complaints which have been stated by Common Cause and by Century 21, that both political parties ought to be investigated for abuses on soft money and for coordination of soft money with their campaign accounts. I have long contended that the investigations ought to be as to both parties  on a bipartisan or on a nonpartisan basis. 
   The issue, as I say, was raised first in April of 1997. FBI Director Freeh then made a request for independent counsel. That recommendation to the Attorney General was in November of 1997. Charles LaBella, who was appointed by the Attorney General as special counsel, made a similar request for independent counsel in July of 1998. 
   Within a week after the Freeh report was issued, I asked for a copy and was denied that. Within a week after the LaBella report was issued, I requested a copy and was denied that. We finally received those documents when Judiciary Committee subpoenas were issued, returnable on the 20th of April. 
   Then it came to light when Vice President GORE announced that he had been questioned by the new chief of the task force, Robert Conrad, that the matter was still open. Somehow, notwithstanding the fact that the Vice President had been questioned on four prior occasions, no questions were ever asked on two matters which had received very substantial publicity: the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple fundraiser and the issue of coffees in the White House. 
   As a result of the investigation of the judiciary subcommittee, we determined that Mr. Conrad had made a recommendation to the Attorney General again for independent counsel, just like the LaBella recommendation, just like the Freeh recommendation. Mr. Conrad testified before our subcommittee a week ago today and declined to respond to questions about that matter. It was my judgment that it was a matter for the public to know. The public had a right to know. There was a necessity for the public to know if we were to have accountability by the Attorney General. As is the established custom as a subcommittee chairman, I made that public disclosure which was in accordance with our practice and something where there was solid justification for doing so. 
   In the hearing which we had with the Attorney General yesterday, it had been scheduled long before the disclosure was made that Mr. Conrad had made a recommendation of independent counsel. We went over with the Attorney General quite a number of factors, starting with the statements which Attorney General Reno had made during her confirmation hearing in 1993. 
   The Attorney General--then not the Attorney General but the district attorney of Dade County in Miami, FL--came in and asked for our support and our votes, and I voted for her in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor, in part because of her strong stand that the Independent Counsel Act was an important act. She said this during her confirmation hearings:  
   It is absolutely essential for the public to have confidence in the system, and you cannot do that when there is a conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, in effect, the chief prosecutor.  
   The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President who appoints her and is obviously very close to the President and to the Vice President. 
   Attorney General Reno further said at her confirmation hearing:  
   The credibility and public confidence engendered with the fact that an independent and impartial outsider has examined the evidence and concluded prosecution is not warranted serves to clear a public official's name in a way that no Justice Department investigation ever could.  
   She quoted from Archibald Cox who said:  
   The public could never feel easy about the vigor and thoroughness with which the investigation was pursued. Some outside person is absolutely essential.  
   It is in that context that the evidence was examined in our hearing yesterday as to whether independent counsel should have been appointed as to the Vice President and as to the President as well. 
   As to the Vice President, the issue arose about the veracity of statements which he made about telephone calls raising hard money from the White House. If the money was so-called soft money, it was not a contribution and not covered by the act. But if it was hard money, then there could be a violation of the act. The Vice President was questioned about that and said he did not raise hard money, did not know that hard money was to be raised. 
   I questioned the Attorney General at some length about the specifics which had been produced. For example, there were four witnesses who testified that at a meeting on November 21, 1995, hard money was discussed, certainly probative raising the inference that if a Vice President is at a meeting where hard money is discussed, he knew he was raising hard money or that hard money was the objective. 
   Leon Panetta, White House Chief of Staff, was very blunt about his testimony that the Vice President was there and listening and said the purpose of the meeting was ``to make sure they''--the President and Vice President--``knew what the hell was going on.'' 
   The Attorney General and I had a protracted discussion about the fact that she discounted the evidence from David Strauss who was the deputy Chief of Staff for the Vice President who had made contemporaneous notes at this November 21, 1995, meeting: ``Sixty-five percent soft, 35 percent hard.'' 
   Mr. Strauss said he could not remember. Notwithstanding that, the law of evidence is conclusive that if there is prior recollection recorded and a contemporaneous record made, that is evidence which can go before a grand jury or before a court. 
   The attorney said he did not remember, even after he looked at his notes. That raises an evidentiary report of prior recollection refreshed, and that is evidence. Even if a person does not now remember, if they had notes and that refreshes their recollection, the person may testify from the notes on the approach of current recollection refreshed. It does not rule out what his notes had on prior recollection recorded, even though he could not remember it. That was some very important evidence. 
   In addition, the Vice President received 13 memoranda from Harold Ickes who was involved and running the campaign. Those 13 memoranda recited hard money. The Vice President said he did not read the memoranda. That is a question which would call for further investigation. 
   The memoranda were put in his in box. And a secretary testified that the input was culled very carefully to keep out extraneous matters. But the Ickes memoranda always went in. 
   Then the Vice President further said that: The subject matter of the memoranda would have already been disclosed in his and the President's presence. 
   The Vice President further conceded, in interviews with the FBI--he acknowledged that he had ``been a candidate for 16 years and thought he had a good understanding of hard and soft money.'' 
   It is important to focus on the fact that the matters presented to the Attorney General are not such that would warrant a prosecution, but only that the matters call for further investigation. 
   The independent counsel statute is very carefully structured so that the Department of Justice does not do very much. The Department of Justice only makes a preliminary inquiry, and then, in the language of the statute, ``The Attorney General, on completion of a preliminary investigation, determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.'' 
   The others who were present at the meeting, who ``did not recall,'' should have been called before a grand jury, which the Attorney General cannot do on her preliminary inquiry. That is to keep the Department of Justice really out of it, but to turn it over to an independent counsel at an early stage. 
   The Attorney General did say yesterday that they did not submit this to a grand jury. Certainly that is the next step. When witnesses are questioned, it is one thing, but it is quite another to come into the formality of a grand jury, under oath, and to be asked questions. That is why there is the provision for further investigation. 
   The Attorney General testified yesterday, relying on her submission to the court declining the appointment of independent counsel, that ``the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.'' That said, the standard for further investigation for appointment of independent counsel does not involve proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it is only that there is reason to have a further investigation. 
   I shall not characterize the Attorney General or draw conclusions at this  stage, but only lay out the facts and suggest that on the face of the very substantial materials produced, further investigation was required and independent counsel should have been appointed. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the subject then arose as to what were the factors related to the famous fundraiser at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple on April 29, 1996. 
   The Vice President had received an e-mail from his scheduler asking whether there should be another stop on the April 29 itinerary on top of the ``two fundraisers in San Jose and LA.'' 
   The Vice President responded:  
   If we have already booked the fundraisers, then we have to decline.  
   But the Vice President said he did not know there were any fundraisers, that the Hsi Lai Temple was a fundraiser. 
   Then Harold Ickes sent the Vice President a memorandum on April 10 identifying the Los Angeles fundraiser which would raise $250,000 and a supplemental memorandum on April 25 saying the Los Angeles fundraiser would raise up to $325,000. Within 24 hours of receiving this memorandum, the Vice President was given briefing materials from the Democratic National Committee informing him that the DNC luncheon he would attend on April 29 was at the Buddhist temple. 
   During the course of the event, two of the guests who ate lunch with the Vice President talked about fundraising. Witnesses 
   there said--``One speaker commented that they had raised x amount of dollars.'' And another witness at the luncheon said that a speaker took the podium and reassured the assembled guests that they had ``doubled checked'' and it was ``OK to give contributions at the Buddhist temple.'' 
   So here again, there are substantial indicators which certainly would call for going forward with independent counsel. 
   Then the question was raised about the coffees which raised more than $26 million. When the Vice President was questioned about the coffees--and the Vice President released the transcript--he said: 
   Question:  
   In terms of a fundraising tool, what was the purpose of the coffees?  
   His response was:  
   I don't know.  
   Then he was asked:  
   With respect to raising $108 million, did you have discussions with anybody concerning the role coffees would play in raising that type of money?  
   The answer of the Vice President:  
   Well, let me define the term ``raising.''  
   Shades of what ``is'' is. 
   Later, he was questioned:  
   You had indicated earlier you may have attended one coffee. What were you talking about?  
   His response:  
   Although it was not my practice to go to any of these coffees, there may have been one that I attended briefly.  
   The Vice President's lawyer then submitted a letter 2 days later, saying:  
   As best we can determine from the Vice President's schedule, he was designated to attend four White House coffees. The Vice President hosted approximately 21 coffees at the Old Executive Office Building.  
   Here again, those matters require further inquiry. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raised a question with the Attorney General as to why the Department of Justice went to ask the Vice President these questions on April 18. The apparent reason was that the subcommittee had finally gotten subpoenas out to get the Freeh and LaBella memoranda returnable on April 20. 
   So the subcommittee would soon find out that the Vice President had never been questioned about the Buddhist temple fundraiser or about the coffee klatsches and that, in fact, the Department of Justice was embarrassed by that omission. 
   I believe the Attorney General did a substantial disservice to the Vice President in failing to have these matters resolved one way or another at an early stage. 
   I said at the outset, last Thursday, when I discussed the matter as to the Conrad recommendation for independent counsel, that there is a sharp distinction between the level of information evidenced to call for an independent counsel's investigation and the level to return a criminal prosecution. 
   I raised a question with the Attorney General yesterday that her failure to act on these matters in 1997, and when Director Freeh called for an independent counsel in 1998, and when LaBella called for an independent counsel, has now put the 2000 Presidential elections in some state of controversy. These matters should have been cleared up. Why the questioning on April 18? 
   If independent counsel is appointed now, can there possibly be a determination to clear the Vice President before the Democratic convention in August? It seems highly unlikely. 
   If independent counsel or special counsel is appointed now, is there time to resolve the matter before the general election? It seems highly unlikely. 
   So that by delaying, it really is too late, at this point, to have special counsel. And that is a responsibility which falls squarely with the Department of Justice and the Attorney General for failing to appoint independent counsel in a timely manner. 
   It is puzzling why the matter would be reinvestigated and re-inquired into on April 18. The reason is obvious--so they would not be further embarrassed by not having asked about these two matters before. But what is to be done at this stage? 
   All of this leads to a conclusion that there ought to be some form of judicial review on the Attorney General's judgment on an independent counsel. I had tried for a long time to have a mandamus action brought to take it for judicial review to see if an independent counsel should have been appointed under the mandatory provisions of the statute or the discretionary provisions where there was an abuse of discretion. The problem was one of standing. 
   It would be my recommendation to the subcommittee that the subcommittee recommend that there be provision for standing to the Judiciary Committee to bring an action for judicial review to have a court determine whether an independent counsel should be appointed because of an abuse of discretion by the Attorney General or because of mandatory provisions of a new statute. This will be a very constructive result, so we do not find ourselves in a situation where these questions linger for more than 3 years and cannot really be resolved before the conventions and so that the Democratic Party would know who their candidate ought to be or what baggage that candidate would have. 
   How much time remains, Mr. President?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is not too much need for me to respond to the Senator from Connecticut. I think he has already stated my position in toto. I do think this afterschool program, which he has proposed to add to, is a worthwhile program. But it is beyond the limits with which our subcommittee has to work. He is correct that I will make a motion that it exceeds the allocation to our committee at the appropriate time. 
   Afterschool is very important. It is sort of a twin brother to day care. Last year, I agreed with the Senator from Connecticut to scrimp and save and use a sharp pencil to find $817 million more to bring day care up to $2 billion, which we did. I thought that kind of an allocation might have satisfied the Senator from Connecticut for a year. But it has not. So we will have to face this when it comes along. 
   He said to me: That is day care. 
   I said: Day care is very important. Bringing it up by more than $800 million to $2 billion was a tough job, Senator DODD. 
   I called him CHRIS at the time. 
   We thought that being a twin brother to afterschool, we might have avoided an amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. It is very tough being the manager of a bill that funds the Department of Education because there is no priority higher than education. The only one on a level with it is health care. And we have the funding coming out of the same pool of money. 
   We made the allocations as best we could. I know of the devotion of the Senator from Connecticut to this cause. He and I were elected at the same time. He withstood the Reagan landslide in 1980 to be one of two Democrats elected to open seats, when 16 Republicans came in. And he and I cochaired the Children's Caucus at that time. 
   In 1987, when he proposed family leave, I was his cosponsor, with a lot of turmoil just on this side of the aisle. We have worked together over the years for education and for children. I commend him for all that he has done. 
   We have added to education some $4.6 billion. We are $100 million more than the President in education this year. 
   We have increased funding tremendously for children and young people in America. The Head Start Program comes, curiously enough, under the Department of Health and Human Services. There is an increase this year of $1 billion to Head Start, coming up to $6.2 billion. We have increased special education by $1.3 billion, bringing it up to $7.3 billion. We have increased innovative State grants by $2.7 billion for more teachers, class size, and for school construction, with the proviso that it is limited. It is up to the local school district if they decide to do something else with it. 
   When it comes to the program the Senator from Connecticut is talking about, the 21st Century Learning Centers, we have added $146.6 million to bring the figure up to $600 million. In fiscal year 1999, it was $200 million. So we are moving right along on it to provide the maximum amount of money we can. 
   It is not an easy matter to allocate $104.5 billion--as much money as that is--for the National Institutes of Health and for drug programs and for school violence programs. We have done the best job we could. It is with reluctance that I raise a point of order.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, here again, there is little doubt that technology literacy is a very important matter for America. There is no doubt about that at all. Here again, it is a matter of how our allocations are going to run. 
   We debated the Dodd amendment earlier today about afterschool programs--again, a good program. There is a question about the amount of money and where the priorities are. 
   We debated the Kennedy amendment about teacher recruitment--another good program. 
   We had to turn down amendments yesterday by Senator WELLSTONE who wanted more money for title I; Senator BINGAMAN, also more money for title I; Senator MURRAY asked for an additional $325 million on top of $1.4 billion which was supplied for class size. There is no doubt that so many of these programs are excellent programs. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts in offering this amendment noted the constraints we are operating under with respect to how much money we have in our allocation. We have established priorities. We have greatly increased the education account by some $4.6 billion. That is a tremendous increase, coming to a total of $40.2 billion. In our education account, we have $100 million more than the President asked for. 
   I have already today gone over a long list of items where we have increased funding on education on very important items. It is a matter of making the appropriate allocation and the setting of priorities. 
   I say to my colleague from Massachusetts that the House of Representatives has established a mark of $517 million in this account. It is entirely plausible that the figure that is in the Senate bill will be substantially increased. 
   We will certainly keep in mind the eloquence of Senator KERRY's arguments. There is no doubt about technology and about the need for more funding in technology. 
   I believe that a country with an $8 trillion gross national product can do better on education. I said earlier today and have said many times on this floor that I am committed to education, coming from a family which emphasizes education so heavily, my parents having very little education and my siblings and I being able to succeed--I guess you would call it success to come to the Senate--because of our educational opportunities. 
   That is the essence of our position. We have substantially more time. 
   I inquire of the Chair: How much time remains?

   I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act, as amended, that the effect of adopting the Kerry amendment provides budget authority in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocations under the fiscal year 2001 concurrent resolution on the budget, and is not in order.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt that the GEAR UP program is a very fine program. It has been in existence for a fairly short period of time. It originated with Congressman CHAKA FATTAH from Philadelphia, who had the initial idea and took it to the President, who agreed with it. It was put into effect just a few years ago. It started out at a funding level of $120 million. Last year, the President requested an increase, and we came up to some $200 million, and our Senate bill has $225 million in the program. 
   Coincidentally, I happened to attend the President's program where he did one of his Saturday speeches on it. So I know the program thoroughly. In fact, with Congressman CHAKA FATTAH, I visited a school in west Philadelphia where this program was being used. Regrettably, there is simply not enough money to accommodate all of the programs, which are good programs, which we would like to have. It is not possible to accommodate the program Senator KERRY of Massachusetts offered about technical training, or the Bingaman amendment on an extra $250 million for title I, or the Wellstone amendment of $1.7 billion. 
   We have put substantial money into job training programs. Job Corps is up to more than $650 million, with almost a $20 million increase. We have structured a program on school safety as to  violence and a program as to drugs. These are programs we have structured to do the best we can. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island has commented about what Senator HARKIN and I have attempted to do in this bill, which is the maximum stretch, as I had said earlier, that can be accommodated on this side of the aisle at $104.5 billion. Regrettably, the money is simply not present. I wish it were. 
   The House has $200 million, which is less than the $225 million we have on the Senate side. We will do our best to maintain that kind of an increase, which would be $25 million, which is as far as we can realistically go. 
   How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will just add one thing. I appreciate the sincerity of the comments of the Senator from Rhode Island that this is a more important program. That is what the proponents of all of the amendments have had to say. If the Senator from Rhode Island could find offsets within the budget resolution and tell me and Senator HARKIN what programs are less important and have offsets, I would be pleased to entertain that consideration. To add to the budget, it is the same point that has been made repeatedly--that everybody's program is special. And I happen to agree with them; they are all special programs. But if you made it more special than something already in the program and have an offset, we would not raise the rule. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the Reed amendment be stacked to occur later today at a time to be agreed upon by the leaders.

   Mr. SPECTER. Let me make a short statement. We are anxious to move ahead with our votes scheduled at 3:30. 
   The amendment is acceptable. The subcommittee held a hearing on this matter in February and had extraordinarily heartrending testimony from families who had been touched directly by suicide. The hearing was held at the request of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID. It was quite compelling. 
   The subcommittee and the full committee allocated $662 million to the mental health services, an increase of $31 million over last year. A number of amendments have been offered seeking to reallocate the money in a variety of ways. I have responded that, unless they have offsets, we have made the allocations as best we can. 
   I think the fact we have such a large sum of money in mental health services on a relative basis, including a $31 million increase for this year, is a testament to the propriety or the value judgments which have gone into the structure of this bill. The $3 million for the hotline can be accommodated easily within the existing funds. We had already urged the mental health services to find ways through their research to prevent suicides--to find other means of communicating with people who were emotionally stressed coming to grips with the issue, and preventing suicides. The substantial allocation the Appropriations Committee has made is a testament to the value judgments and the priorities we have established. 
   I thank Senator REID for sharing his own experiences. It is a very telling matter. At his request, we had a very informative hearing in February, with quite a few people coming forward, including Danielle Steel, the noted authoress who talked about her own son's experience. It made quite an impact. I think it is true that while the C-SPAN 2 audience may not be enormous, people will hear what is being said and it can have a salutary effect.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the point of order has been raised because, although the Dodd amendment for afterschool programs takes up a meritorious subject, we have already added approximately $150 million to that account, bringing it up to $600 million. 
   The program has been in effect for only a few years. We have provided for additional funding in many similarly related situations. We believe the priorities established were appropriate. Had there been a suggestion for an offset, had the Senator from Connecticut made a suggestion that this priority was more valuable than others, we would have been willing to consider it. But it simply breaks the allocations and therefore the point of order has been raised. We urge it be sustained and not waived.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call on our colleagues to oppose the waiver. This bill has $4.5 billion more than last year's, $100 million over the President's request, and it is a matter of allocation of priorities. 
   There is no doubt that technical literacy is an important objective. We have, in the Senate bill, $425 million. If the Senator from Massachusetts could establish its priority over others, and add offsets, that is something we would be glad to consider. I wish we had more money to spend on things such as technical literacy, but we do not. To accept this amendment would exceed our 302(b) allocations. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to vote no on the waiver.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt this is a good program. It has been in effect only since 1999 when we put in $120 million; last year, up to $200 million; this year our figure is $225 million. 
   Again, it is a matter of priorities. This bill has $4.5 billion more than last year's education bill. It is $100 million higher than the President's figure. When the Senator from Rhode Island argued the matter as being a very special program, I posed a practical question: What should be offset? What is less important? 
   We think we have established the appropriate priorities. As much as we  want to have additional funds for a program of this sort, it simply isn't there. The extra million dollars would exceed our 302(b) allocation. Therefore, we ask our colleagues not to waive the Budget Act.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as with so many of the pending amendments, the objective is good if we had more funding. We have increased the funding for the Department of Labor by $400 million. We have funded two new programs requested by the administration: incumbent worker training for $30 million and responsible reintegration of youthful offenders for $20 million. 
   Over the last 4 years, there has been a 32-percent increase for dislocated workers and a 25-percent increase for the Job Corps. If it were possible to have additional funding, we would be glad to provide it. We think we have established the priorities in an appropriate order for this complex bill. I ask the motion to waive the Budget Act be denied.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might respond, if the point of order is sustained, we would lose $2.4 billion and there would be required an adjustment of the bill which would be catastrophic. 
   So it is my suggestion that we set it aside, taking the willingness of the Senator from Texas to do that, and then proceed with other amendments so we can try to figure out what other allocation might be possible. We have an amendment ready by the 
   Senator from Vermont and one by the Senator from North Carolina. We have not had many Republican amendments. It is my hope that we can proceed. We have to find a way out of this. If we have a little time, we have a chance to find our way out of it. So I hope we will proceed. 
   If I may have the attention of the Senator from Nevada, he will have the opportunity to--we will have to set it aside, as I understand the parliamentary ruling, each time a new amendment is called up. Is that correct, Mr. President?

   Mr. SPECTER. In formulating this question as to whether we are going to cut it by 6.75 percent, may I suggest to the distinguished ranking member and comanager that we will not cut funding by 6.75 percent. 
   What we are seeking to do now is to obtain a reallocation. Discussions are underway with the chairman of the full committee to reallocate some funds to this bill from other bills, which delays the day of reckoning for the whole process. That is the way things are done, not only around here but generally. 
   It is my hope we can accomplish that. The chairman of the full committee is now busy working on a supplemental, but he will be here in a few minutes. I believe we will find a way on a reallocation to satisfy the issue which has been raised by the Senator from Texas. 
   Unfortunately, we had three amendments queued up and ready to go to make progress, but seeing the state of affairs on the floor, our amendment offerers have dispersed. We are trying to find some more amendments, and we have an amendment ready to be offered. 
   It is my hope that on the representation we are making progress on finding an allocation, which will leave our bill at $104.5 billion, we take the Senator from Texas up on his willingness to set his issue aside so we can proceed with the bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a very short statement to make. 
   I applaud the Senator from Louisiana for this amendment. I do believe it is a very good idea to target funds for disadvantaged children under title I. The difficulty is that the $600 million will be taken from title VI, where we have already allocated the principal sum of those funds to meet the President's requirements for new school construction and for class size on the condition that local boards may use it for other purposes if they decide they do not need classroom construction or additional teachers. 
   When the Senator from Louisiana concludes, I will move to table the amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, my preference would be to move for the poor schools first. 
   In constructing this bill, there were many objections as to how the money was going to be allocated. The only way we could work through the complications was to put it in title VI. That was not my first choice, nor are the programs my first choice. 
   Working through a great many considerations, we ended up in title VI leaving the options to school districts, if they choose not to have construction, or if they choose not to have reduction in class size. That is an accommodation to very many disparate views.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont believes very deeply about the importance of the IDEA program and the necessity and desirability of the Federal Government to fund it. 
   The difficulty is--and we wish we had more funds in the education budget, although this budget has $4.5 billion more than last year, and $100 million more than the President's figure--but when it comes out of the construction account, or any other account, they are very carefully calibrated to provide the appropriate balance. 
   The construction account is one of the President's priorities. We have met that, as with class size, subject to the discretion of the local school boards. If they make a finding they do not need additional buildings or additional teachers, they may use it for what they choose. It may be that they could use it for the purposes articulated by the distinguished Senator from Vermont. So it is with reluctance that we are opposing his amendment. And I move to table.

But in constructing this bill, we have tried to fashion it in a way that it will be signed by the President. We have put the money into construction to meet requests with the proviso that if the local boards do not need it for construction, or want it, they can use it as they choose. If we had additional funds, I would be delighted to acknowledge Senator JEFFORDS' request. But in its present form, we cannot take those funds without increasing the chance of a veto.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, I have been asked to announce the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. Under the order, there will be closing remarks by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, on his pending amendment regarding pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance monitoring and prevention. A vote will occur on the Cochran amendment at 9:45 a.m. Following that vote, we will turn to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, regarding the Internet. We will be seeking a time agreement on that amendment. 
   We ask all Senators who have amendments to offer to come to the floor. We are trying to establish a list so we can proceed to the disposition of this bill. It is hoped that in the next day or so we could have a unanimous consent agreement which will limit pending amendments so we can proceed to conclude action on this bill. 
   Senator LOTT has asked that the announcement be made that rollcall votes may be expected throughout the day. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I ask all Senators who have an interest in offering amendments to come to the floor so we can proceed to move this bill forward. At the moment, we have three amendments which are pending, which are up for consideration. We have the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH, and he is prepared to withdraw his amendment in the nature of a second-degree amendment to Senator MCCAIN's amendment on a consent agreement that his amendment will not be second degreed. 
   The distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, has an interest in debating his amendment only for a few  minutes later but having it listed for a vote later today. 
   Senator MCCAIN is prepared to debate his amendment briefly now and then when Senator LEAHY is available to debate his amendment at greater length. 
   I ask unanimous consent that there be no second-degree amendment to the SMITH amendment--the distinguished Senator from Iowa says there cannot be an agreement on the pending SMITH amendment. Until we clarify that, my suggestion is that we proceed with debate on Senator SMITH's amendment at this time for however long that takes and then proceed to debate Senator MCCAIN's amendment for however long that takes. We will try to get the procedures worked out. 
   In the interim, we will be considering the amendment by Senator KERRY from Massachusetts. Again, I ask anybody who has an amendment to offer to come to the floor as promptly as possible. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. In the absence of a vote on Monday, it was hard to find business; we could not find it yesterday. We have had a vote. Senators are in town and on campus. When the Senator from Nevada talks about finishing the bill this week, the majority leader told me last week that this bill would be finished, if we had to work through Saturday. That is specifically what Senator LOTT said. That is when he anticipated starting the bill about Wednesday of this week. 
   The majority leader would like to finish this bill no later than tomorrow so that he could start on other business, perhaps the Interior bill on Thursday. So I say that what the Senator from Nevada has announced is exactly right, that if Senators want their amendments to be considered, now is the time.

Mr. President, the second amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada to add $10 million to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that would come from administrative costs, is what we think a worthwhile objective. We are candid to say that the charges to administration are now very heavy. 
   So it would be my intention to accept this amendment, subject to the understanding that we are going to have to work out in conference where the funding will come from. After a while, the administrative costs deduction is so overburdened that it becomes intolerable, but subject to that limitation, we will be prepared to accept the amendment on this side.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oregon for this amendment. I think it is a good amendment and it puts the finger on a source of potential funding which would be fair and just. The National Institutes of Health have engaged in extraordinary research and have had phenomenal results. To the extent that research has resulted in profits to private companies, it is a fair request; it is fair to ask that the Federal Government share in those proceeds. 
   During the course of the past several years, our subcommittee has taken the lead on substantially increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health. Four years ago, we raised the funding by almost $1 billion; 3 years ago, by $2 billion; last year, by $2.2 billion; and this year, $2.7 billion. We seek to bring the total funding for the National Institutes of Health to $20.5 billion. 
   Where we can find that private industry has benefited and made a profit, a fair return ought to be given to the NIH. It is preeminently reasonable to have that sort of provision in law, to ask the Director of the National Institutes of Health to make that report to the appropriate committees. 
   We are also considering the funding in terms of how much is spent for administrative costs. In the subcommittee, we are going to be directing inquiries to the recipients of NIH funds as to how much is being allocated for overhead and administrative costs. This is an effort to increase the moneys which may be available for research. 
   Phenomenal results have been achieved on a variety of ailments. Parkinson's is now perhaps as close to 5 years from being solved. There have been significant advances on Alzheimer's and heart disease. I printed the whole list in the RECORD during my opening statement. 
   I am glad to accept the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Oregon.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma for offering this amendment because there is no doubt that the appropriations for impact aid are very important. As a basic matter of fairness to the States, this obligation ought to be undertaken by the Federal Government. It is candidly like many obligations the Federal Government ought to undertake which the Federal Government has not undertaken. One of the most notable examples is special education. 
   I have discussed this matter with my colleague from Oklahoma and think it worth putting into the RECORD the advances which the subcommittee, and now the full committee, have made on this important subject. 
   Last year, the total impact aid was $906.4 million. The request by the administration, according to information provided to me, is only $770 million. The House of Representatives in its bill has allocated $985 million. So the Senate is some $45 million higher now than is the House of Representatives. 
   I do recognize, as I said privately to the Senator from Oklahoma, the importance of this account and the desirability of increasing the funding. 
   We are prepared to accept the amendment on the understanding, as I discussed privately with Senator INHOFE and now state publicly for the record, that the funding comes out of administrative costs, and that is an item which has already been hit very hard. 
   A few moments ago, when the Senator from Nevada offered an amendment to add $10 million for NIOSH, we accepted the amendment, stating candidly, openly, that we would do our best in conference. That is the same thing I have told the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma: That we recognize the importance, the validity of the purpose, and we will do our best, but we are going to have to work out a great many complicated matters. On that state of the record, we are prepared to accept the amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this bill accommodates the President's request for $1.4 billion for class size reduction. It is joined with $1.3 billion for school construction, trying to structure a bill which could be signed. But we leave, in the final analysis, the judgment to the local boards as to whether the local boards decide that they do not need construction or if they do not need class size reduction. 
   That is what is objected to by the Senator from Washington. We have gone more than halfway to meet the President in putting up this money. 
   In addition, the Murray amendment would add $350 million, which exceeds our allocation. We think we are stretching and stretching and stretching. If the President is going to veto this bill, then let him do so. We expect to present this bill to him long before the end of the fiscal year, and then we will debate it before the American public. 
   I make a point of order that the amendment violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, I have been asked to announce that we will proceed with further consideration of the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We have an amendment to be presented in a moment or two by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND. We urge all Senators who have amendments to come to the floor to offer those amendments. Any rollcall votes will be considered sometime early next week under the schedule announced by the majority leader. 
   We are trying to move ahead with this bill. There are quite a few Senators who have stated their intention to offer amendments. Staff and I have canvassed a good many of the Members in an effort to have them come to the floor to take up their amendments. That would help in the disposition of this bill. We are going to be in session until at least close to noon today. We do know that in the early stages of bills, there is time for discussion, for debate, and later the time becomes very crowded, time is limited, and Senators may be allotted only a few minutes under time agreements. So now is the time to come to take up the issues. 
   The majority leader has also asked me to announce that the Senate may turn to the Department of Defense authorization bill on Monday.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill before the Senate today contains a program level of $104.5 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion or 8.2 percent over the fiscal year 2000 program level. This program level was achieved by savings in the following areas: The temporary assistance to needy families, supplemental security income, and the State children's health insurance programs. Further, savings were also achieved by advance funding an additional $2.3 billion of education dollars into fiscal year 2002, while keeping the same overall level of advances as last year. The actual budget authority in the bill is $97.35 billion, the full amount of the subcommittee's allocation under section 302(b) of the Budget Act. 
   Given the subcommittee's allocation there were inadequate resources to sufficiently fund important health, education and training programs. Therefore savings needed to be found in order to expand these high priority discretionary programs. For example, savings were achieved by shifting $1.9 billion in unspent fiscal year 1998 State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds into fiscal year 2003. Currently 38 States and the District of Columbia have not spent their SCHIP funds which are due to expire on September 30, 2000. By reappropriating funds, these 38 States and the District of Columbia will have an opportunity to spend these dollars in future years. 
   The recommendations made in the bill both keeps faith with the budget agreement and addresses the health,  education, employment and training priorities of the Senate. 
   While consistent with the budget agreement, many tough choices had to be made. Senator HARKIN and I received over 1,800 requests from Members for expanded funding for programs within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. In order to stay within the allocation and balance the priorities established in the budget agreement and expressed in Member requests, we had to take a critical look at all of the programs within the bill. I want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, for his hard work and support in bringing this bill through the committee and on to the floor for full consideration by all Senators. 
   The programs funded within the subcommittee's jurisdiction provide resources to improve the public health and strengthen biomedical research, assure a quality education for America's children, and offer opportunities for individuals seeking to improve job skills. I'd like to mention several important accomplishments of this bill. 
   Nothing is more important than a persons health and few things are feared more than ill health. Medical research into understanding, preventing, and treating the disorders that afflict men and women in our society is the best means we have for protecting our health and combating disease. 
   Since January of 2000, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee has held nine hearings on medical research issues. 
   We have heard testimony from NIH Institute Directors, medical experts from across the United States, patients, family members, and advocates asking for increased biomedical research funding to find the causes and cures for diseases Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, ALS, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and many other serious health disorders. We have also heard from advocates on both sides of the stem cell debate. The bill before the Senate contains $20.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal government. The $2.7 billion increase over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation will support medical research that is being conducted at institutions throughout the country. This increase will continue the effort to double NIH by fiscal year 2003. These funds will be critical in catalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments and cures for a whole host of diseases. 
   Head Start: To enable all children to develop and function at their highest potential, the bill includes $6.2 billion for the Head Start program, an increase of $1 billion over last year's appropriation. This increase will provide services to an additional 60,000 children bringing the total amount of kids served in fiscal year 2001 to 936,000. This increase will put us on track to enroll one million children in Head Start by the year 2002. 
   Community health centers: To help provide primary health care services to the medically indigent and underserved populations in rural and urban areas, the bill contains $1.1 billion for community health centers. This amount represents an increase of $100 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. These centers will provide health care to nearly 11 million low-income patients, 4.5 million of whom are uninsured. 
   Youth Violence Initiative: The bill includes $1.2 billion for programs to assist communities in preventing youth violence. This initiative, begun in fiscal year 2000, will continue to address youth violence in a 
   comprehensive way by coordinating programs throughout the Federal government to improve research, prevention, education and treatment strategies to identify and combat youth violence. 
   Drug demand initiative: To curb the effects of drug abuse, the bill includes $3.7 billion for programs to help reduce the demand for drugs in this country. Funds have been increased for drug education in this Nation's schools; youth offender drug counseling, education and employment programs; and substance abuse research and prevention. 
   Women's health: Again this year, the committee has placed a very high priority on women's health. The bill before the Senate provides $4.1 billion for programs specifically addressing the health needs of women. Included in this amount is $27.4 million for the Public Health Service, Office of Women's Health, an increase of $6.1 million over last year's funding level to continue and expand programs to develop model health care services for women, provide monies for a comprehensive review of the impact of heart disease on women, and to launch an osteoporosis public education campaign aimed at teenagers. Also included is $253.9 million for family planning programs; $169 million to support the programs that provide assistance to women who have been victims of abuse and to initiate and expand domestic violence prevention programs to begin; $149.9 million for sexually transmitted diseases; $177.5 million for breast and cervical cancer screening; and $2.7 billion for research directed at women at the National Institutes of Health. 
   Medical error reduction: The Labor-HHS Subcommittee held several hearings to explore the factors leading to medical errors and received testimony from family members and patients detailing their experiences with medical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine also gave testimony and outlined findings from their recent report which indicated that 98,000 deaths occur each year because of medical errors. The bill before the Senate contains $50 million to determine ways to reduce medical errors and also recommends that guidelines be developed to collect data related to patient safety, best practices to reduce error rates and ways to improve provider training. 
   LIHEAP: The bill maintains $1.1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The bill also provides an additional $300 million in emergency appropriations. LIHEAP is a key program for low income families in Pennsylvania and cold weather states throughout the nation. Funding supports grants to states to deliver critical assistance to low income households to help meet higher energy costs. 
   Aging programs; For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the Senate recommends $2.4 billion, an increase of $133 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Included is: $440.2 million for the community service employment program which provides part-time employment opportunities for low-income elderly; $325.1 million for supportive services and senior centers; $521.4 million for congregate and home-delivered nutrition services; and $187.3 million for the National Senior Volunteer Corps. Also, the bill provides increased funds for research into the causes and cures of Alzheimer's disease and other aging related disorders; funds to continue geriatric education centers; and the Medicare insurance counseling program. 
   AIDS: The bill includes $2.5 billion for AIDS research, prevention and services. Included in this amount is $1.6 billion for Ryan White programs, an increase of $55.4 million; $762.1 million for AIDS prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control; $60 million for global and minority AIDS activities within the Public Health and Social Services Funds; and $85 million for benefit payments authorized by the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Trust Fund Act. 
   Education: To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill before the Senate contains $40.2 billion in discretionary education funds, an increase of $4.6 billion over last year's funding level, and $100 million more than the President's budget request. 
   Education for disadvantaged children: For programs to educate disadvantaged children, the bill recommends $8.9 billion, an increase of $177.8 million over last year's level. These funds will provide services to approximately 13 million school children. The bill also includes $185 million for the Even Start program, an increase of $35 million over the 2000 appropriation. Even Start provides education services to low-income children and their families. 
   Title VI block grant: For the Innovative education program strategies State grant program, the bill contains $3.1 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion over fiscal year 2000. Within this amount, $2.7 billion is to be used to assist local educational agencies, as part of their locally developed strategies, to improve academic achievement of students. Funds may be used to address 
   the shortage of highly qualified teachers, reduce class size, particularly in the early grades, or for renovation and construction of school facilities. How the funds shall be spent is at the sole discretion of the local educational agency.  
   Impact aid: For impact aid programs, the bill includes $1.030 billion, an increase of $123.5 million over the 2000 appropriation. Included in the recommendation is: $50 million for payments for children with disabilities; $818 million for basic support payments, an increase of $80.8 million; $82 million for heavily impacted districts; $25 million for construction and $47 million for payments for Federal property. 
   Bilingual education: The bill provides $443 million to assist in the education of immigrant and limited-English proficient students. This recommendation is an increase of $37 million over the 2000 appropriation and will provide instructional services to approximately 1.3 million children. 
   Special education: One of the largest increases recommended in this bill is the $1.3 billion for special education programs. The $7.1 billion provided will help local educational agencies meet the requirement that all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate public education, and all infants and toddlers with disabilities have access to early intervention services. These funds will serve an estimated 6.4 million children age 3-21, at a cost of $984 per child. While also supporting 580,500 preschoolers at a cost of $672 per child. 
   TRIO: To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-income first-generation college students, the committee recommendation provides $736.5 million for the TRIO program, a $91.5 million increase over the 2000 appropriation. These additional funds will assist in more intensive outreach and support services for low income youth. 
   Student aid: For student aid programs, the bill provides $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion over last year's amount. Pell grants, the cornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased by $350 for a maximum grant of $3,650. The supplemental educational opportunity grants program has also been increased by $70 million, the work study program was increased by $77 million and the Perkins loans programs is increased by $30 million. 
   21st Century Community Learning Centers: For the 21st Century After School program, the bill provides $600 million, an increase of $146.6 million over last year's level. This program supports rural and inner-city public elementary and secondary schools that provide extended learning opportunities and offer recreational, health, and other social services programs. The bill also includes language to permit funds to be provided to community-based organizations. 
   Job training: In this Nation, we know all too well that unemployment wastes valuable human talent and potential, and ultimately weakens our economy. The bill before us today provides $5.4 billion for job training programs, $16.7 million over the 2000 level. Also included is $652.4 million, an increase of $19.2 million for Job Corps operations; $950 million for Adult training; and $1.6 billion for retraining dislocated workers. Also includes is $20 million for a new program to upgrade worker skills. These funds will help improve job skills and readjustment services for disadvantaged youth and adults. 
   Workplace safety: The bill provides $1.3 billion for worker protection programs, an increase of $90 million above the 2000 appropriation. While progress has been made in this area, there are still far too many work-related injuries and illnesses. The funds provided will continue the programs that inspect business and industry, assist employers in weeding out occupational hazards and protect workers' pay and pensions. 
   There are many other notable accomplishments in this bill, but for the sake of time, I mentioned just several of the key highlights, so that the Nation may grasp the scope and importance of this bill. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator HARKIN and his staff and the other Senators on the subcommittee for their cooperation in a very tough budget year.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment our distinguished colleague from Missouri for offering this amendment and for his steadfast support over the years. I compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator BOND, for his continued support for community health centers. This has been a matter he has taken a special interest in and he has organized enormous support, with a letter having 67 signatories, 58 cosponsors, and reflecting a very broad consensus as to the importance of this program. 
   The program would add in the current fiscal year $1.187 billion for community health centers. The Appropriations Committee has increased funding by $100 million over fiscal year 2000. Senator BOND now wants an additional $50 million, with an offset from administrative expenses pro rata among the three Departments. 
   We are prepared to accept Senator BOND's amendment. This is always a matter of finding enough money and adjusting the priorities. There is no one among the 100 Senators who knows that better than Senator BOND, because he chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies. I think his subcommittee and this subcommittee have the toughest job in funding matters. But we agree there ought to be more money in community health centers to serve people in both rural and urban areas who are disadvantaged and do not have access to primary health care. 
   There is nothing more important than health, so we are going to accept the amendment. When we come to conference, we may have to modify the offset as to the administrative cost, but we will do our very best to maintain the funding in this important item. 
   One other comment. I commented yesterday that the President had issued a veto threat after the subcommittee reported out a bill, and Senator HARKIN had some words for the President, which I thought came better from the ranking member in the same party as the President. I made the point yesterday--and I think it is worth repeating today--about the priorities established by Members of Congress. We have contacts that the President does not have. There are 535 of us who fan out across America. Most of the Senators have fanned out already today, going back to their States to assess local needs. 
   The Constitution gives the Senate the authority for appropriations. Bills have to be signed by the President. But what Senator BOND has done is a good illustration of getting a broad consensus. That makes an impact upon the subcommittee when we look at our priorities. If 67 Senators sign a letter and 58 sign on as cosponsors, you wonder what happened to the other 9 in the interim. That is a very strong showing, and we intend to make that point when we do our best to honor the full $150 million increase and as we move down to have an assessment of our priorities versus the President's priorities. 
   Speaking for the majority, we are prepared to accept the amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is a meritorious amendment on institutional development within the National Institutes of Health. We have a figure of $60 million there as part of $2.7 billion. 
   The subcommittee and the full committee have been very--aggressive, is the right word--to increase NIH funding. We did it at $2.7 billion in this bill. We had $2.2 billion last year, $2 billion the year before, a billion before that. I agree totally with the thrust of what the Senator wants to accomplish. 
   When we sit down with the House in conference, there is always a lot of give-and-take with a bill that is at $104.5 billion. It would be my intention to do what we can to reach the figure of $100 million, which is what the Senator wants, because I think that is the right figure. What I suggest is that the Senator give Senator HARKIN and me and the other conferees the flexibility to negotiate. There is a lot of give-and-take. 
   For those watching on C-SPAN, the process is, after we pass our bill, we go to a conference with the House, which has passed a bill. Then we sit down with long sheets and go over all the points and try to reach a compromise. To have that flexibility would be helpful. I know there are a number of programs the Senator from North Dakota would like to stay at the Senate figure, as opposed to the House figure which may be lower. If we could reach that accommodation, I believe we would obtain the objectives which the Senator from North Dakota wants, to give the conferees that flexibility to assert the Senate position on other matters.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments about what Senator HARKIN and I are trying to do--and, really, it is the whole committee and the full Senate. We will, I think, accomplish what he is looking for--the $100 million--in the final analysis. I think the old saying that you don't want to see either sausage or legislation made may have some merit. I think when we deal with our national health, we are dealing with ``prime rib.'' We will make some tasty morsels here for the benefit of America, I think. 
   Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague, Senator SANTORUM, in words of praise for Rev. Gus Roman. As a fellow Philadelphian, I have had an opportunity to watch his work. He has an outstanding record and an outstanding reputation. 
   It was very nice of him to come to Washington and lead the Senate in the opening prayer. When Senator SANTORUM makes comments about the work of Reverend Sullivan, that has been acclaimed nationally and internationally. I had my first opportunity to work with Reverend Sullivan many years ago when he took a deserted police station in north Philadelphia and turned it into the Opportunities Industrialization Corps, providing job training. It is worthy to note that Reverend Sullivan is in town today. There is an African American summit dinner tonight at the ballroom of the Washington Hilton--not to give too many advertisements in conjunction with the prayer. 
   Reverend Sullivan's work, as Reverend Roman's work, is very distinguished and a great contribution to America.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the bill, I compliment my colleagues, the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Delaware, for their comments this morning, calling attention to the major international problems on nuclear proliferation. This body will soon be voting on legislation to have permanent normal trade relations with China. As noted by the Senator from Tennessee, the People's Republic of China happens to be a major violator in proliferating nuclear weapons. They sent the M-11 missiles to Pakistan, which have been the basis for the nuclear arms confrontation between India and Pakistan. They have helped to proliferate weapons in Iran and North Korea. It is my view that the best way to restrain the People's Republic of China from posing an enormous international threat is to continue to give them permanent trade relations on an annual basis. 
   I have discussed this many times with my distinguished colleague from Tennessee. I hope he will join me in ultimately opposing normal trade relations as the best leverage to try to keep the people's Republic of China in line. 
   We have seen, again and again, problems that the executive branch cannot be, candidly, relied upon, with waivers being granted. Separation of powers has been established. The Senate is here and the House is here in order to see that there is another view about what is happening with China. The most effective leverage is to have an annual checkup on them, and to have the normal trade relations as the leverage, which would be very, very important. 
   I urge my colleague from Tennessee and others to consider that when that vote comes up. There is more involved in that issue than just the money; the future of civilization may be on the line if we do not contain the People's Republic of China from proliferating weapons of mass destruction.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to make the opening statement on the pending appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. The subcommittee, which the distinguished Senator from Iowa and I work on, has the responsibility for funding these three very important and major departments. We have come forward with a bill which has program level funding of $104.5 billion. While that seems like a lot of money--and is a lot of money--by the time you handle the priorities for the nation's health, by the time you handle the priorities for the nation's education--and the Federal Government is a relatively minor participant, 7 percent to 8 percent, but an important participant--and by the time you take care of the Department of Labor and very important items on worker safety, it is tough to find adequate funding. 
   We have structured this bill in collaboration with requests from virtually all Members of the Senate who have had something to say about what the funding priorities should be based on their extensive experience across the 50 States of the United States. We have come forward on the Department of Education with a funding budget in excess of $40 billion, more than $4.6 billion more than last year, and some $100 million over the President's request. We have established the priorities which the Congress sees fit. We have increased the maximum Pell grants. We have increased special education by $1.3 billion, trying to do a share of the Federal Government on that important item. We have increased grants for the disadvantaged by almost $400 million. 
   We have moved on the Department of Health and Human Services for a total budget of over $44 billion, which is an increase of almost $2.5 billion over last year. We have increased Head Start by some $1 billion, so it is now in excess of $6 billion. We have structured a new drug demand reduction initiative, taking the very substantial funds which are available within our subcommittee, and redirecting $3.7 billion to try to deal with the demand reduction issue. 
   It is my view that demand reduction is the long-range answer--that and rehabilitation--to the drug problem in America. We may be spending in excess of $1 billion soon in aid to Colombia, and it is my view that there is an imbalance in the $18 billion which we now spend, with two-thirds--about $12 billion--going to so-called supply interdiction and fighting street crime. They are important. As district attorney of Philadelphia, my office was very active in fighting street crime against drug dealers. 
   In the long run, unless we are able to reduce demand for drugs in the United States, suppliers from Latin America will find a way to grow drugs, and sellers on America's street corners will find ways to distribute it, which is why we have made this initiative to try to come to grips with the demand side. 
   Last year, we structured a program to deal with youth violence prevention. We have increased the funding by some $280 million so that now it is being directed in a coordinated way against youth violence, and some substantial progress has been made in the almost intervening year since this program was initiated. 
   A very substantial increase in funding has been provided in this bill for the National Institutes of Health. I would suggest that of all the items for program level funding in this $104.5 billion bill, the funding for the National Institutes of Health may well be the most important. 
   I frequently say that the NIH is the crown jewel of the Federal Government, and add to that, in fact, it may be the only jewel of the Federal Government. Senator HARKIN and I, in conjunction with Congressman PORTER and Congressman OBEY on the House side, have taken the lead on NIH. Four years ago, we added almost $1 billion; 3 years ago we added $2 billion; last year we added $2.3 billion, which was cut slightly in across-the-board cuts to  about $2.2 billion; and this year we are adding $2.7 billion. 
   There have been phenomenal achievements by NIH in a broad variety of maladies. There is nothing more important than health. Without health, none of us can function. It is so obvious and so fundamental. 
   These maladies strike virtually all Americans. I will enumerate the diseases which NIH is combating and making enormous progress: Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, cancers--leukemia, breast, prostate, pancreatic, lung, ovarian--heart disease, stroke, asthma, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, autism, osteoporosis, hepatitis C, arthritis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, kidney disease, and mental health. 
   I daresay that there is not a family in America not touched directly by one of these ailments. For a country which has a gross national product of $8 trillion and a Federal budget of $1.85 trillion, this is not too much money to be spending on NIH. We are striving to fulfill the commitment that the Senate made to double NIH funding in the course of 5 years. We are doing a lot. We are not quite meeting that target, but we are determined to succeed at it. 
   This bill also includes $11.6 billion for the Department of Labor, an increase for Job Corps, an increase for youth offenders, trying to deal with juvenile offenders to stop them from becoming recidivous. There is no doubt if one takes a functional illiterate without a trade or skill and releases that functional illiterate without a skill from prison, that illiterate, unable to cope in society, is likely to return to a life of crime. Focusing on youthful offenders, we think, is very important. 
   We have met the President's figures on occupational safety and health, NLRB, mine safety, and for a specific problem we have topped the President's figure slightly by $2.5 million, seeing the ravages of black lung and mine safety-related programs that I have personally observed both in Pennsylvania's anthracite region in the 
   northeastern part of my State and the bituminous area in the western part of my State. 
   I was dismayed when the subcommittee came forward with its budget to have the President immediately articulate a veto message. I note my distinguished colleague from Iowa nodding in the affirmative. He did a little more during the Appropriations Committee markup and not in the affirmative. I left it to my colleague to have a comment or two about the President of his own party. I learned a long time ago, after coming to the Senate, that we have to cross party lines if we want to get anything done in this town. 
   I am pleased and proud to say Senator HARKIN and I have established a working partnership. When he chaired this subcommittee, I was the ranking member. I like it better when I chair and he is the ranking member. He spoke up in very forceful terms criticizing the President, the President's men, and the President's women for coming forward with that veto statement when we have strained to put together this total bill of $104.5 billion, and it has been tough going to get the allocations from the Appropriations Committee. 
   I thank Senator STEVENS, the chairman, and Senator BYRD, the ranking member, for coming up with this money. When the President asked for $1.3 billion for construction and $1.4 billion for additional teachers and class size, we put that money in the budget. We did add, however, that if the local boards make a determination, factually based, that the money is better used in some other line, the local school boards can spend the money in that line, giving priority to what the President has asked for, but recognizing that cookie cutters do not apply to all school districts in America. 
   We have structured some different priorities in this bill. The last time I read the Constitution, it was Congress who had the principal authority on appropriations. It is true the President must sign the bill, but to issue a veto threat after the subcommittee reports out a bill, before the full committee acts on it, before the full Senate acts on it, before there is a conference seems to me to be untoward. 
   Regrettably, in the past, this bill has not been finished until after the end of the fiscal year, so we have been unable to engage in a discussion with the President and a discussion with the American people about what are the priorities established by Congress. I emphasize that this is a bill which receives input from virtually all Members. We have hundreds of letters which pour into this subcommittee which we consider, and the same is true on the House side. This is no small matter as to who may be assessing the priorities for America. For the President to say his priorities are the only ones to be considered seems to me untoward. 
   That is as noncritical a word as I can fashion at the moment. I thank the majority leader, Senator LOTT, for scheduling this bill early. We intend to conference this bill promptly with the House and have a bill ready for final passage in July--hopefully in early July--and then let us see the President's reaction. 
   We are prepared to take to the American people the basic concept that if school districts do not need additional buildings, they ought to be able to use their share of the $1.3 billion for something else. If some school districts do not have a problem with the number of teachers they have, they ought to be able to use their share of the $1.4 billion for something else. 
   This is a very brief statement of a very complicated bill. 
   At the outset, I thank my colleague, Senator HARKIN, for his diligence and his close cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. It is the intention of the committee to support these two prestigious institutions in building upon the very important Temple University Masters of Law Program in Beijing, which is the first and only foreign law degree-granting program in China. After reviewing the case of Yongyi Song, a librarian at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who was released in January after being held under dubious charges in China, I believe the U.S. Congress should support programs that advance the rule of law in China. At a time when the People's Republic of China is seeking permanent most-favored-nation status and seeking entry into the World Trade Organization, it is my hope that the government of the PRC will respect basic norms for due process such as an open public trial and the right to confer with counsel. International Rule of Programs such as the Temple University/NYU Program are important means to build understanding and respect for these basic norms in the Chinese legal community.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment is that up to $1 million shall be made available to the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and other bodies to work with the appropriate authorities of the Cuban Government to provide for greater cooperation, coordination, and other mutual assistance in the interdiction of illegal drugs being transported over Cuban airspace and waters, provided that such assistance may be provided after the President determines and certifies to Congress that Cuba has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air and that there is no evidence of the involvement of the Government of Cuba in drug trafficking. 
   The Government of Cuba has been prepared for some time to provide further assistance to the United States through the use of their airspace and coastal waters on drug interdiction. 
   In June of 1999, I had occasion to visit Cuba and I had a long meeting with their President, Fidel Castro. We covered a wide variety of subjects. One of them was the issue of drug interdiction. 
   I believe this is a measure which our officials in all branches of the Federal Government favor to try to cut down on the flow of drugs. There is, obviously, a sharp disagreement as to what our policy should be toward Cuba with respect to the embargo. But whatever anybody may think about those subjects, it is my view that there is no doubt that we ought to take up the availability of assistance from Cuba on drug interdiction. That is what this amendment will do. 
   There is a real issue about U.S. policy toward Cuba. I voted against the Dodd amendment, which would create a commission to make recommendations on that policy, because I think that the issue of policy really ought to be decided by the next President of the United States in conjunction with the Congress. The times have certainly changed, so that Castro no longer presents a threat to export communism to Latin America. I believe that the consideration of change in policy really ought not to be entrusted to a commission at the present time, which would report after January 20 of next year, when the issue really is for the President of the United States--whoever may be elected. 
   I supported the Gorton amendment, which would strike the funds for Colombia, although I knew at the time that the funding for Colombia would pass by a large number. I have visited Colombia on a number of occasions over the past decade. I am very much in favor of assisting Colombia in restoring law and order to that nation, to try to avoid the destabilizing effect of the drug cartels. But I do not believe that it is appropriate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars--almost a billion dollars in the Senate appropriations and $1.4 billion in the House. I believe there is currently an imbalance in the $18 billion a year spent on drugs, with about two-thirds of that--or $12 billion--going to the so-called supply side, and some $6 billion going to the so-called demand side. 
   My view is that we would be doing better to spend money on rehabilitation and education to try to eliminate the demand for drugs. I was an original sponsor of legislation many years ago to bring in the military on interdiction, and I think that it is a good policy. But no matter how strong our interdiction is, drugs will come into the United States as long as there is a demand for drugs. My experience as district attorney of Philadelphia shows that a great deal can be done to prosecute drug dealers and street crime and move up the chain to drug kingpins. But, again, as long as there is a demand for drugs, there will be a supply. So it is my view that the wiser course of action is to spend more money on education and rehabilitation through the drug courts, which are now part of the crime bill of 1994. It is because of my view that funds are better spent on rehabilitation and education and the demand side that I supported the Wellstone amendment. 
   I thank my many colleagues who have worked with me to clear this amendment. As with most Senators, I would like to have a rollcall vote. We are trying to bring this matter to a conclusion. Tomorrow, we are going to start on the appropriations bill of Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, which comes from the subcommittee I chair. So I appreciate the acceptance of this amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment which will give jurisdiction to the Federal Government over hate crimes. Ordinarily, I support jurisdiction for the district attorney. Senator HATCH points out the National District Attorneys Association has taken on a position. I was a long-term member of that association as district attorney of Philadelphia. The fact is, prosecutors are county officials of the State system. There are great pressures against prosecutions where there is a matter of sexual orientation, or where there may be a matter of race, or where there may be a matter of religion or other hate-related crimes. 
   That is why I believe this is a unique field where the Federal Government ought to be involved. Ordinarily, it should be up to the local prosecutor. That is a principle to which I subscribe. But here it ought to be a matter for the Federal Government.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have reserved time for an amendment which would deal with funding for mailings for open house town meetings. The budgets today are very restrictive. In years gone by, there was an opportunity for a Senator to schedule an open house town meeting in a county seat and send out postal patron notices to everybody in the county. Then, an open house town meeting would be held where a relatively small number of people would appear, but at least everybody in the county had notice that the Senator was coming. Everyone had an opportunity to hear a short report about what was going on in Washington and then an opportunity to ask the Senator questions. 
   We are under considerable fire and criticism on the issue of fundraising and the issue of access. For example, when we have fundraisers and people attend, they certainly do have access to Senators. There is no way to have a fundraiser where people attend without having that kind of access. 
   The question then arises: Is that kind of access unfair? I believe there is a very good answer to that by having the Senator go to the county seat, and make it convenient for people in the county to have access to the Senator to ask questions. The concept of having a town meeting to let people express themselves is something that I believe is very important and very fundamental. 
   The budget we have today does not allow for that. I was just discussing the matter with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee to see if we might structure something which could be accommodated without having a contested amendment and a contested debate and then a rollcall vote. 
   What the Senator from Utah and I were talking about was an analysis of how many of our colleagues want to have open house town meetings. Many of our colleagues do not choose that as a form of communication with constituents. Others may have only a few open house town meetings. There is a big difference between small States and big States. There is a different picture that certainly arises in Utah than Pennsylvania. 
   As I said to the Senator from Utah, I would not necessarily be concerned about having the town meetings in the big metropolitan areas where there is a greater opportunity to communicate with the citizens through television and through newspaper stories. However, if you take, say, some of the northern tier counties of Pennsylvania or the north central or southern tier, unless you actually go to the county, it is very hard to make that kind of contact. 
   I would not want the entire year to go by without taking action. As I discussed with the Senator from Utah, perhaps in collaboration with the Senator from California, who is the ranking member on this subcommittee, and the Senators on the Rules Committee, we could try to get an estimate and perhaps put a funding mechanism in one of the later appropriations bills. Perhaps it could come in the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, which I chair. 
   I do believe Senators would like to have this opportunity. It may well be that it would not be very expensive, depending on how many Senators chose it. Maybe we could, on an experimental basis, create a relatively small fund and find some way to administer it so  the people who want to have the town meetings can but with some limitations so that one or a few Senators do not take too much of the fund. Therefore, we could move in the direction of encouraging these open house town meetings.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from California for those statements. Let us proceed on that basis. 
   Picking up on what the Senator from Utah said, it isn't a political mailing touting what any of us may think he or she has done. It is notice that the Senator is going to have his or her body at a given place. 
   As open house town meetings go, that can be a fairly high price to pay, to go out and face the music and face the constituents because they do keep track of our votes. But they have a very hard time following us if they live in Coudersport in Potter County or live in the northern tier of Pennsylvania or a southern tier county such as Fulton. They don't necessarily get any of the major newspapers and are outside television range. They may see some national television, but that is not an effective way for Senators to communicate with the people of their States. 
   When you appear at a town meeting, there is a feeling that something is going on that is positive. We Members of Congress in the Senate and the House are subject to a lot of criticism as being ``inside the beltway'' and not being accessible. People don't know what we are doing. And then we are going to these fundraisers where people have to make contributions to have access to us. 
   This is something which is not very healthy for a democracy. So let us proceed. 
   I will not offer an amendment at this time. I will see if we can work it out, starting with the chairman and ranking member on this subcommittee, and moving over to the chairman and ranking member on the Rules Committee, to try to structure a program which would accomplish the purpose and be affordable. 
   I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from California.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for entering the order giving me 30 minutes for a statement this morning. I have sought that time to speak on what I believe to be one of the most important issues which will be presented to the Congress this year; that is, the issue of permanent normal trade relations for the People's Republic of China. 
   The Senate is scheduled to take up this issue sometime next month, depending upon what the House of Representatives does. The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider this matter next week. I thought it appropriate to make this statement at this time, to give my views on important issues of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation, insights which I gained, in large part, from serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee for some 8 years, including 2 years as chairman during 1995 and 1996, and other insights on related matters which I have seen in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on oversight of the Department of Justice. 
   My own record has been that of a strong free trader. I have supported NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I have supported free trade with the Caribbean nations. I supported, last week, free trade with the African nations. I believe the long tugs and pulls of the economy, both domestic and international, strongly support the notion of free trade. 
   But I am opposed, strongly opposed to granting permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China because of their record on nuclear proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction, because of their record on human rights, and because the executive branch, the administration, has not imposed sanctions as required by law to stop or inhibit such nuclear proliferation but, in fact, has taken affirmative action to grant waivers. So it is necessary for Congress to exercise our constitutional responsibility of checks and balances and congressional oversight of the executive branch, to see to it the national interest is preserved. 
   The Congress has authority under the Constitution. There are some constitutional inhibitions which prohibit the Congress from delegating that authority to the executive branch. I am not necessarily saying that permanent trade with China would be such an unconstitutional delegation, but at the very minimum it is an unwise delegation, based on this state of the record, based on the necessity to impose restraints on conduct of the People's Republic of China, not only as to human rights--fundamental, important human rights--but of greater magnitude, the threat to international peace through their proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   During my tenure on the Intelligence Committee I saw many instances of the People's Republic of China supplying rogue nations, nations which constitute a threat to world order, with weapons of mass destruction. 
   For example, the People's Republic of China provided M-11 missiles to Pakistan back in 1992. Those missiles, now armed with nuclear warheads, are pointed at India, creating a nuclear threat to the subcontinent, the possibility of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, and threatening world peace. 
   The People's Republic of China has assisted North Korea's missile program by providing specialty steel, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and precision grinding machinery. The People's Republic of China is providing assistance to Libya's long-range missile program by assisting in the building of a hypersonic wind tunnel which is useful for designing missiles and cooperating in the development of Libya's Al Fatah missile which has a range of some 600 miles, threatening peace and stability in that area. 
   The People's Republic of China has helped Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and Libya in a way which is very destabilizing. 
   What has been the reaction of the Clinton administration to these issues? The transfer of M-11 missiles to Pakistan falls under category 1 of the Missile Technology Control Regime, which is set up to establish gradations in seriousness of violations. That is category 1. 
   The 1991 National Defense Authorization Act mandates the President to deny for not less than 2 years certain licenses, and we find not only has the President not taken those steps on sanctions, but has, in addition, moved ahead and granted affirmative waivers to facilitate developing China's ballistic missile capability. Those waivers were granted in a celebrated case on the application of Loral Space and Technology. 
   A series of events, beginning in 1992, involving both Hughes and Loral demonstrates a very serious problem on transmitting to the People's Republic of China high-level technology. 
   On December 21, 1992, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying a Hughes manufactured satellite crashed shortly after takeoff. Without attaining the required State Department license, the Hughes personnel engaged in a series of discussions with Chinese officials, giving them very important information. 
   On January 26, 1995, a Chinese Long March 2E missile carrying another Hughes satellite exploded approximately 50 seconds after takeoff. A 1998 State Department assessment showed that, ``Hughes directly supported the Chinese space program in the areas of [accident analysis]........'' 
   The Cox committee reviewed these matters and called for a very detailed investigation as to what had actually occurred. 
   On February 15, 1996, the People's Republic of China's Long March 3B missile exploded with a communications satellite on board built by Loral. Following these explosions, Loral and Hughes transmitted to the People's Republic of China their assessments of why the rockets failed. The assessments required a prior license from the Department of State which had not been obtained. 
   In May 1997, a classified Department of Defense report concluded that Loral and Hughes significantly enhanced the guidance and control systems of the People's Republic of China's nuclear ballistic systems. As a result of the Department of Defense report, the U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation of Loral and Hughes. Then Loral applied for a waiver from the Clinton administration to launch another satellite from a Chinese rocket. 
   The Department of Justice weighed in and objected to a Presidential grant of a waiver on the ground that such a waiver would have ``a significant adverse impact on any prosecution that might take place based on a pending investigation of export violations by Loral.'' 
   Notwithstanding the very serious issue of China having sold M-11 missiles to Pakistan creating a threat of nuclear war, notwithstanding the fact that Loral and Hughes gave an assessment to China which significantly enhanced their nuclear capability system, notwithstanding the fact that there was a criminal investigation pending by the Department of Justice, notwithstanding the fact that the Department of Justice objected to the grant of a waiver on the ground that it would have an adverse impact on their criminal investigation potential prosecution, the President on February 18 of 1998 granted the waiver. 
   What are we to make of all of that, and why, in fact, was the waiver granted? A preliminary investigation has shown that in an early memorandum in  January of 1998 from the National Security Adviser, there was a reference to a State Department concern about transfers by the People's Republic of China to Iran of C-802 antiship cruise missiles. That was a January 1998 draft memorandum from National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger to the President. 
   When the final memorandum was submitted to the President by Mr. Berger on February 12, 1998, that important warning was dropped. The earlier memorandum had contained language of the importance of an expedited waiver because Loral was in the process of losing money. Isn't it curious that emphasis is placed upon Loral's financial situation while an important factor about the PRC's furnishing key weaponry to Iran is excluded in the final memorandum? 
   The decision by the President to grant that waiver is further suspect because the chief executive officer of Loral, Mr. Bernard Schwartz, had made a contribution to the President's campaign of some $1.5 million, and the chief executive officer of Hughes, Mr. C. Michael Armstrong, was the chairman of the President's export council actively lobbying on these issues, raising a very serious issue of a potential conflict of interest. 
   In the face of activity of this sort, it is my view that it is indispensable that the Congress maintain close oversight on what the executive branch is doing. It is my view that it is indispensable for Congress to maintain close oversight on the effort by the administration now to grant permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China. 
   The preferable course, by far, in my view, is for Congress to make a year-by-year analysis as to what is happening so we can exert the maximum pressure on the People's Republic of China and not delegate to the President broader authority to initiate action which will grant permanent trade status to China so there is no opportunity for the Congress to impose leverage to try to secure China's compliance with their international commitments. 
   As a result of the large campaign contribution, $1.5 million from Mr. Schwartz, the special counsel retained by the Department of Justice to evaluate the campaign finance issue, Charles LaBella, recommended to the Attorney General that an independent counsel be appointed. 
   One of the reasons cited by Mr. LaBella for the need for independent counsel was the contribution made by Mr. Schwartz. That reason, among many other reasons, was forwarded by Mr. LaBella to the Attorney General, along with a strong recommendation by the Director of the FBI that independent counsel be appointed. Notwithstanding those strong recommendations, the Attorney General declined to appoint independent counsel on a complex subject which has been the matter of extensive hearings by the Judiciary subcommittee, which I chair, on Department of Justice oversight. 
   It is an extraordinarily difficult matter to pursue the executive branch to find the facts so the Congress can exercise its constitutional responsibility and authority on oversight. 
   Notwithstanding a subpoena issued by the Judiciary Committee calling for the production of the LaBella report, the report by FBI Director Freeh, and other reports, and all related documents, returnable on April 20, to this day the Department of Justice has not complied with that subpoena. 
   A hearing was held where Mr. LaBella testified about his recommendation for the appointment of independent counsel, including his view--hypothetically stated during the course of the hearing--that there should have been an investigation of Mr. Schwartz, and that where a potential quid pro quo was involved--those were Mr. LaBella's words; and the language of a quid pro quo is the equivalent of bribe language--with the allegation of a bribe, that the President should be investigated as well. Yet no independent counsel was appointed. 
   The Judiciary subcommittee on oversight is pursuing the documents, is pursuing the testimony of FBI Director Freeh. It has recently been disclosed that there are other documents which the Department of Justice has not provided, notwithstanding the return date is almost 1 month old--April 20 to today, May 17--so there will be an application on tomorrow's Judiciary Executive Calendar for a contempt citation as to the Department of Justice. 
   The subpoena is issued; some documents are returned; other documents are not returned; the full scope of the subpoena is ignored. We are trying to find out what happened on many matters, including the grant of a waiver to Loral. It is a long, hard chase to pursue the executive branch. 
   On these stated facts, the question arises inevitably: Is the Clinton administration to be trusted? I am not prepared yet to respond to that question because our investigation is not complete. But I am prepared to say that it is devilishly difficult to pursue the oversight function, that the Senate, the Judiciary Committee, the Judiciary subcommittee, have been led on a merry, meandering chase trying to find answers, trying to find documents, trying to corral witnesses to find out what actually happened in these matters. 
   So when Congress has the authority to decide on normal trade relations as to China, on a year-by-year basis, we ought not to give up that very important, that very powerful prerogative. We ought not to give up on the recommendation of the Clinton administration that China should have it. We ought not to give it to China in the face of their flagrant record of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and in the face of the flagrant record by the Clinton administration of not acting with sanctions but even granting affirmative waivers to facilitate the development of Chinese capability for ballistic 
   projection. 
   I believe there is substantial evidence that the People's Republic of China will respond to pressure and to leverage. When we talk about the sanctions, we are talking about something which is really in the hands of the executive branch. But when we talk about granting permanent normal trade relations, that is a power which is in the hands of the Congress. It is very difficult--really impossible--for the Congress to legislate with sufficient specificity to compel the executive branch to impose sanctions. 
   Some of my colleagues are talking about additional legislation. But at the end of every line of public policy, at the end of every line of sanctions, at the end of the rainbow, every time we take up these issues, there is an inevitable grant of authority to the President, as Chief Executive Officer, to grant a waiver under certain circumstances for national security reasons. 
   It is not practical for the Congress to put into place--or at least we have never been able to do it--a set of circumstances which can be predetermined to anticipate every eventuality, to mandate it without giving that kind of discretion to the President. That is why, where we have independent authority, such as granting permanent normal trade relations to China, we ought not to give it up. 
   When we talk about the issue of trusting the administration, trusting the executive branch, I am reminded of President Reagan's comment when dealing with the Soviet Union. There was a lot of wisdom in his comment about ``trust, but verify''--``trust, but verify''--deal with the Soviet Union, make arrangements with the Soviet Union, but verify to see that it is carried out. 
   There may well be an inherent institutional distrust built into the Constitution with the requirement of oversight and with the requirement of checks and balances. Perhaps ``institutional distrust'' is a little strong. But in the context of this record, with what China has done, with what Loral has done, to have a waiver granted under these circumstances certainly requires that there be a determination, at the very minimum, on the part of Congress that if we are to trust, we ought to verify, and we ought not to give up any of our powerful weapons to see to it that the People's Republic of China does not proliferate weapons of mass destruction. 
   In reviewing the efficacy of sanctions, in reviewing the desire of China to have normal trade relations, there was a case involving a librarian from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, last year which bears on this issue suggesting that China does respond to pressure, does respond to leverage. 
   The librarian, Yongyi Song, was within 1 month of being sworn in as a  naturalized U.S. citizen, having lived in Pennsylvania for some 10 years, prior to the time that he and his wife Helen took a trip to China last August to study the Cultural Revolution. He is a very distinguished Chinese scholar. 
   In August, he was taken into custody by the People's Republic of China on trumped up charges. His wife similarly was taken into custody. She was released. But he remained in custody and on Christmas Eve was charged with a very serious crime. 
   The family came to me, the college came to me, and with a large number of Senate cosponsors, I filed a resolution seeking the immediate release of Yongyi Song on the grounds that he was being detained improperly, illegally, without regard to basic standards of decency and criminal justice protocol. 
   I had a meeting with the Chinese ambassador, and ultimately Yongyi Song was released. There is good reason to believe that the pressure, the leverage had some effect on what activity was taken by the People's Republic of China. 
   The condition of normal trade relations with the United States is an item which is very highly prized by the People's Republic of China. 
   And it is one which we ought to maintain in reserve to evaluate their conduct on a year-by-year basis. It is my view that when you deal with the question of weapons of mass destruction, and when China arms Pakistan, and when China arms Libya, and when China arms Iran, when China arms North Korea, those are matters of much greater consequence than the dollar profit to be gained by greater trade with China. 
   When people say, ``If we don't sell it, somebody else will,'' I respond to that comment emphatically by saying we ought not to sell it. We ought to take a leadership role in the world to try to persuade our allies not to sell it either because the almighty dollar is not worth the risk we run by giving China a free hand to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. If we are to take a cost-benefit ratio relationship, taking a look at our $300 billion defense budget, and apportioning a part to what we have to do with the 7th Fleet in the Taiwan Strait when the People's Republic of China threatens Taiwan and a test missile drops there in their bullying efforts, considering what we have to do by way of defensive efforts, it is a bad deal in dollars and cents for whatever profit we may gain with our trade with the People's Republic of China. 
   Mr. President, the question of human rights is a very important one. The record in China has been deplorable. We have utilized the trade issue to try to impose leverage on China, to try to persuade them to improve their human rights. It is a complex conclusion as to whether, on that issue alone, the people of China might be better off with expanded trade, which would improve the quality of life and living in China, which might move them along the road to democratization which, in the long run, might have an overall beneficial affect on human rights in China. And on a year-by-year basis, I have supported granting most-favored-nation status. In light of the developments on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, I am not sure that even that ought to be done on a year-by-year basis. When we take a look at the violation of human rights, including religious persecution by the People's Republic of China, it is deplorable. 
   Last September, police instructed 12 underground Catholic Church leaders in Wenzhou to go to a hotel where they were pressured to join the official Catholic Church. On October 18, last year, police disrupted services at two of Guangzhou's most prominent house churches. One of the pastors, Li Dexian, and his wife were detained, and his church was ransacked by the police. On August 24, 1999, 40 house church members were arrested, and the church leaders were sentenced to 1 to 3 years in a reeducation-through-labor camp. Other items are cited, which I will have introduced into the RECORD at the close of my statement. 
   The issue of religious persecution in China is overwhelming. In 1997, I introduced S. 772, the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, and later joined with Senator NICKLES in structuring legislation, which became law on October 27, 1997, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. 
   I make reference to that during the course of these remarks to point out the problems of violation of human rights. It happens again and again and again--repressive action taken by the People's Republic of China. That is a factor which should weigh heavily in our consideration of granting of trade relations to the People's Republic of China. 
   When I visited the Ambassador, talking about the case of 
   the Dickinson librarian, I received a lecture about not meddling in internal Chinese affairs. I responded with a short lecture of my own about human rights and about the appropriate process of decency in dealing with criminal matters as a matter of balance, noting that we in the United States have great respect for the 1.2 billion people in China. The Ambassador quickly corrected me, pointing out that there are 1.250 billion people in the People's Republic of China. I overlooked 50 million, and perhaps the number had grown during the course of our conversation. There is no doubt that China is the upcoming colossus of the world, the dominant power, and that we are going to have to be very, very careful. 
   In conclusion--perhaps the two most popular words in any speech--I believe that we have to give very sober consideration to the totality of our relationship with the People's Republic of China. In commenting about a nation of 1.250 billion people, with their potential, it is no doubt that they are becoming a superpower, if they are not already a superpower. They may become the dominant superpower with that kind of a population. When they are throwing their weight around by selling weapons of mass destruction to the likes of North Korea, Libya, and Iran, and selling missiles to Pakistan, which threatened world peace with the nuclear exchange between Pakistan and Iran, the United States ought to retain all the leverage and pressure that it can. 
   The facts are that we cannot rely upon the Clinton administration to do that. It may be that, institutionally, we cannot rely upon any administration to do that and, institutionally, the Constitution gives oversight authority to the Congress, and the checks and balances in the Constitution require that we maintain leverage and see to it that the national interests of the United States are maintained. That is a constitutional responsibility of the Congress. And it is in that context, from what I have seen on proliferation as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the dereliction I have seen in my chairmanship of the oversight committee of the Department of Justice, that I urge my colleagues to vote against the granting of permanent trade relations to the People's Republic of China. 
   My eight years on the Senate Intelligence Committee including the chairmanship in 1995 and 1996 and my current chairmanship of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Department of Justice oversight have convinced me that the People's Republic of China (PRC) threatens world peace by flagrantly proliferating weapons of mass destruction to countries like Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and Libya. 
   The Clinton Administration has not only deliberately refused to impose mandated sanctions but has also granted unwarranted waivers facilitating technology transfers to enhance the PRC's missile capabilities. As noted in the New York Times article entitled ``Clinton Argues for `Flexibility' Over Sanctions'' on April 28, 1998, President Clinton admitted that U.S. sanction laws have put ``enormous pressure on whoever is in the Executive Branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of whatever is going .....'' 
   Congress should assert its constitutional oversight and checks and balances on Executive Branch excesses by retaining annual review of trade with China to influence the PRC to honor its non-proliferation obligations and conform to fundamental standards of civility and decency in the community of nations. 
   With regards to the PRC and matters of proliferation, the essential facts are: 
   According to the unclassified extract of the classified National Intelligence Estimate of September 1999, the PRC sold M-11 missiles to Pakistan in November 1992, which are now pointed at India armed with nuclear weapons  causing or contributing to the threat of nuclear war between those two countries. 
   The PRC has supplied Iran with ballistic and cruise missiles and technology for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service entitled ``Chinese Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Current Policy Issues,'' dated April 13, 2000. 
   PRC has assisted North Korea's missile program by providing specialty steel, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and precision grinding machinery, as also noted in the ``Chinese Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Current Policy Issues'' CRS report. 
   The PRC is providing assistance to Libya's long-range missile program by assisting in the building of a hypersonic wind tunnel which is useful for designing missiles, and cooperating in the development of Libya's Al Fatah missile, which has a range of 600 miles, according to the CRS report entitled ``Chinese Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Current Policy Issues.'' 
   The PRC's transfer of M-11 missiles to Pakistan falls under Category I of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). According to the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Nonproliferation, Category I of the MTCR applies to ``complete missile systems, as well as major systems .....'' as noted in the February 8, 2000 Fact Sheet entitled ``Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).'' 
   Where there has been a Category I violation, the 1991 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 101-510) mandates the President to deny, for a period of not less than two years, licenses such as the licenses for the technology transferred to the PRC by Hughes Space and Communications, Inc. and Loral Electronics to the PRC, as specified herein. 
   On December 21, 1992, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying the Hughes-manufactured Optus B2 Satellite crashed shortly after takeoff. Without obtaining the required State Department license, Hughes personnel engaged in a series of discussions with Chinese officials in 1993 and 1994 regarding improvements in the fairing (nose cone) of the Long March 2E rocket which resulted in changes. These events were clearly outlined in Volume II of the Report of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China, also known as the Cox Report. 
   On January 26, 1995, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying the Hughes Apstar 2 satellite exploded approximately 50 seconds after takeoff. A 1998 State Department assessment concluded that, in working with the Chinese to address the cause of the failure, ``Hughes directly supported the Chinese space program in the areas of anomaly analysis/accident investigation, telemetry analysis, coupled load analysis, hardware design and manufacturing, testing, and weather analysis,'' as noted in the Cox Report. 
   The Cox Committee reviewed the Hughes launches and failure analysis and concluded that further inquiry should be conducted to determine: first, that the kind of information that may have been passed to the PRC beyond what has been revealed by Hughes; second, the application, if any, of coupled loads analysis to improving PRC ballistic missiles; and third, the likelihood that the PRC will in fact incorporate this know-how into their future missile and space programs. 
   Additionally, I was informed in a letter from Wilma Lewis, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia on May 10, 2000, that the Department of Justice, including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, has undertaken a criminal investigation of the 1995 failed launch as part of an investigation of a 1996 launch failure analysis involving both Loral and Hughes, but no prosecution decisions have been made even though the statute of limitations has expired on the January 26, 1995 launch and crash. 
   As outlined in the Cox Report, on February 15, 1996, the PRC's Long March 3B missile exploded with a communication satellite on board which was built by Loral. Following this explosion, Loral and Hughes transmitted to the PRC their assessments of why the rockets failed which assessment required a prior license from the State Department. As noted in the Cox report, in May, 1997, a classified Department of Defense report concluded that Loral and Hughes significantly enhanced the guidance and control systems of the PRC's nuclear ballistic missiles. 
   Following the DoD Report, the Department of Justice began a criminal investigation of Loral and Hughes. Then, Loral applied for a waiver from the Clinton Administration to launch another satellite from a Chinese rocket. 
   Bernard Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Loral, contributed approximately $1,500,000 to President Clinton's 1996 campaign. C. Michael Armstrong, Chairman of Hughes, who lobbied the Administration against sanctions and for expansion of satellite exports to China, had a potential conflict of interest from his contemporaneous service as Chairman of the President Clinton's Export Advisory Council.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to speak about an incident that has sent shock waves throughout the conscience of our Nation. On April 28th, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, five of my constituents were brutally murdered and one critically injured in what seems to be a hate crime. Reports indicate that the perpetrator actively and methodically sought out his minority victims during the 72-minute rampage. The victims of this brutal rampage were a 63-year-old Jewish woman, a 31-year-old man of Indian descent, a 22-year-old African-American student, a 27-year-old Vietnamese man, and a 34-year-old Chinese-American man. In addition to the five people killed, another 25-year-old man of Indian descent was shot in the neck and critically injured. The alleged killer also fired rounds at two synagogues and spray-painted the word ``Jew'' and two swastikas on the wall of one of them. 
   The alleged murderer was arraigned on five counts of homicide, seven counts of ethnic intimidation, three counts of criminal mischief, two counts each of arson and institutional vandalism and one count each of attempted homicide, firearms violations, reckless endangerment and aggravated assault. This senseless rampage that left five people dead and one in critical condition poses some of the most important and vexing law enforcement challenges currently facing our Nation. Such heinous hate-filled acts of violence divide our communities, intimidate our citizens, and poison our collective spirit. While our hearts are grieving for those who have lost loved ones, we must try and find some consolation by using this atrocity to send a strong message that hate crimes will not be tolerated. 
   Such vicious attacks are a form of terrorism that threaten the entire Nation and undermine the ideals on which we were founded. I am a principal sponsor of S. 622, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. I was the District Attorney in Philadelphia for eight years and I did not like Federal encroachment on State jurisdiction--but there are some instances when Federal intervention is necessary. Some of the ugliest instances of violence in our nation have been motivated by hatred based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and disability. It is in the case where it is plain that it was a hate crime situation--in these extremely usual situations, the I believe Federal authority ought to be present where it is necessary. 
   I know that there are those that are concerned about the expansion of Federal jurisdiction, which is something that we should be very careful about. It is with this very concern in mind that this legislation has been narrowly tailored to target a very, very important area--it has been done with a scalpel and not a meat axe. We need to let people out there know that if the crime is bad enough and the local prosecutors won't act that there is a Federal authority to come in where absolutely necessary. Current law, 18 United States Code, Section 245, permits federal prosecution of a hate crime only if the crime was motivated by bias based on race, religion, national origin, or color and the assailant intended to prevent the victim from exercising a ``federally protected right.'' These activities are: (A) enrolling in or attending a public school or public college; (B) participating in or enjoying a service, program, facility or activity provided or administered by any state or local government; (C) applying for or enjoying employment; (D) serving in a state court as a grand or petit juror; (E) traveling in or using a facility of interstate commerce; and (F) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public accommodation. The statute's dual requirement that the government has to prove that the defendant committed an 
   offense not only because of the victim's race, color, religion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's participation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected activities'' substantially limits the potential for federal prosecution of hate crimes, even when the crime is particularly heinous. The Hate Crime Prevention Act will make it easier for the Federal government to successfully prosecute ate crimes by amending current law to eliminate the dual requirement and by expanding the list groups entitled to protection under Federal law to include women, homosexuals and the disabled. Under this bill, hate crimes that cause death or bodily injury can be investigated federally, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. In cases involving violent hate crimes based on the victims gender, sexual orientation, or disability, the bill would make it a Federal crime to willfully cause bodily injury to any person, or attempt to do so through use of a firearm or explosive device, whenever the incident affected or involved interstate commerce. No longer would Federal criminal civil rights jurisdiction hinge upon whether a racial murder occurs on a public sidewalk versus a private parking lot. No longer would the Federal government be without the power to work with State and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of a racist who targets and assaults an African American. Criminals will no longer be able to evade Federal prosecution simply because their victims were not enrolling in a public school, using a place of public accommodation, or participating in any of the six federally protected activities at the time they were assaulted. 
   Mr. President, this is a bill that is narrowly tailored to reach only the most egregious forms of hate crimes. It is important to note that this bill does not impact issues such as job discrimination, political speech or graffiti. 
   America is the great melting pot. People of different races, religion, and creed join together from all around the globe seeking freedom--religious freedom, political freedom and economic freedom. But unfortunately in our society today there are those who harbor animus towards others because of the color of their skin or the church they attend. Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our Nation than crimes motivated by such hatred. We must continue to work towards freeing our Nation from such violence, discrimination, hatred, and bigotry through education and public awareness. However, while we work towards this goal we must ensure that each and every American is protected from crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would reinstate and extend the deadline for construction of a Pennsylvania hydroelectric power project. This extension is necessary because the Potter Township Power Authority (Project No. 7041) will lose their license from the Federal Regulatory Commission under Section 13 of the Power Act. On many occasions, the Congress has granted similar noncontroversial extensions to licensees for projects in other states. This legislation would provide additional time for the municipal licensees to conclude their negotiations with the potential power purchasers. In introducing this legislation, I am not expressing any personal views on whether the projects should go forward or on how the projects should be funded; that is clearly the responsibility of the municipal licensees and the residents of the township.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce five bills that will suspend import tariffs for three years on five chemicals used in the manufacturing of crop protection agents, Triazamate, Dichloro- toluene, Aminomethylpentyne, Fenbuconazole, and Methoxyfenozide. 
   These chemicals are imported by Rohm and Haas Company, a multinational manufacturer of specialty chemicals headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tariffs on these products are not needed to protect American industry since these chemicals are not manufactured in the United States. Moreover, these chemicals have no other commercial end uses other than in the manufacture of pesticides used in agricultural applications. The revenue which would be forgone as a result of the proposed suspension of duty on these chemicals is minimal and has been estimated at less than $227,000 per chemical over the entire period of the suspension. 
   These end products, used on farms around the globe, are considered important tools in the advancement of agriculture. They protect crops such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, grain and cotton, against fungal infections, weeds, agricultural mites, and insects. By providing adequate protection for these crops, farmers are able to market healthy produce and grains, while commanding the best prices for their goods. 
   Established over 90 years ago, Rohm and Haas Company has grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of specialty chemicals. With 21,000 employees worldwide, the Company continues to maintain a significant presence throughout Pennsylvania, with research facilities in Newtown, Reading, and Spring House. Additionally, Rohm and Haas Company provides grants which support many community organizations active in the delivery of health and human services, education, and civic and community improvement. 
   In consideration of the positive impact Rohm and Haas Company has on the global and local communities, I urge my colleagues to support these bills which will suspend the duties on the import of these chemicals.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the case involving young Elian Gonzalez. At 11 o'clock this morning, Senator LOTT has scheduled a closed-door proceeding with Attorney General Reno, and there are a number of important outstanding questions which, in my view, should be addressed. 
   At the outset, let me make it plain that I believe and have believed that young 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez should have been reunited with his father at the earliest possible time. I believe that as a legal matter there is no real justification for any asylum proceeding to keep young Elian Gonzalez in the United States. The purpose of asylum is to protect an alien from going back to a country where he or she will be persecuted. That certainly is not the case with Elian Gonzalez. He would be adulated. 
   Nonetheless, I believe there are some very serious issues which have arisen that the Congress ought to address, and the most prominent of those is the manner in which Elian Gonzalez was taken into custody. In my opinion, there were less intrusive ways in which that could have been accomplished. The Immigration and Naturalization Service said that they proceeded at 5 a.m. because they did not want to have any interference from the crowd. The avoidance of interference from the crowd could have been accomplished at high noon if the crowd were to have been moved back several blocks, which is customary where people have a right to demonstrate, people have a right to express themselves, but they do not have the right to do it right at the location where there may be other interests which have to be preserved. Had the crowd been several blocks away, there would have been no difficulty in taking whatever action was deemed appropriate without the risk of having a problem with the crowd. 
   Once the Immigration and Naturalization Service agents were directed to move in to take custody of young Elian, they had been armed to protect themselves. But the action necessitating their being armed had very great potential for violence. It was a potential powder keg. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. But there could have been. And it is my view that there ought to be a look by the Congress at ways to improve these procedures in the future. 
   The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Garner v. Tennessee, issued a ruling involving a Tennessee statute which involved law enforcement officers using deadly force against a fleeing felon even if that felon was unarmed. The Supreme Court of the United States held that this statute was unconstitutional because deadly force may not be used unless it is to save lives or avoid grievous bodily injury. Now, the problem with what was done by the INS in moving in with drawn weapons at 5 a.m. was that it could have triggered a chain reaction which could have led to violence. And there was really no necessity. They were not dealing with the customary INS case where they have a suspected terrorist or a violent criminal. This is not a John Dillinger who has to be taken into custody. That matter could have waited another day. 
   When I read the morning papers last Friday that the Department of Justice was considering moving in to take young Elian Gonzalez, I wrote to both the Attorney General and the President and expressed the view that there were a number of less intrusive alternatives which could have been undertaken. And I pressed hard at that time for them to have a court order. 
   When the President said the Federal court ordered Elian Gonzalez taken into custody, that is not correct. The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit specifically refused to decide and declined to issue an order requested by the Department of Justice to have the uncle turn over Elian to INS so he could be turned over to the father. The district court did not deal with the custody issue either, but only decided that if there were to be an application for asylum, the proper person to make that was the father and not the uncle. 
   On this state of the record, there is a very serious legal issue as to what authority the INS had to take Elian into custody. They certainly were not going to take him into custody to deport him because there was an order of the circuit court prohibiting that until the circuit court had decided the case. 
   There is, in my opinion, a need for Congress to take a look at another issue. The Department of Justice, regrettably, does not have a good record at Ruby Ridge or at Waco. I chaired the subcommittee hearings on Ruby Ridge which led to a change in the FBI rules on use of deadly force and currently am chairing a special task force of a subcommittee looking into Waco. In the context of what happened at Ruby Ridge and Waco and what happened with the potential powder keg in Miami last Saturday morning, it is my view the Congress ought to consider institutionalizing some permanent unit within the Department of Justice. 
   The raid, which was conducted at 5 a.m., has the potential--and it is hard to determine--of leaving very deep scars on young Elian Gonzalez. When it occurred, the question came into my mind as to why the father was not at the scene, if not present at the house, but close to the scene to assist in soothing young Elian. I think the entire matter could have been avoided had the crowd been cleared, had there been a court order, had the Government taken up the representation of the uncle's lawyer that Elian would be peacefully turned over.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, those letters set forth in some greater detail the way those hearings can be expedited. When the Million Man March occurred in 1998 in New York City, the Federal court ruled on August 26, and the court of appeals took it up on September 1 and issued a 9-page opinion the same day. In the Pentagon papers case, only 18 days elapsed from the publication of the papers until the case went through the district court, the court of appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States. I renew my suggestion to the Department of Justice to expedite those proceedings. 
   Ultimately, Elian will be returned with his father to wherever they choose to go. I hope they will stay in the United States, but that is a matter for the Gonzalezes to determine. Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the father, having parental responsibility for the child, but these are issues as to the use of this extraordinary force and what should be institutionalized in the Department of Justice, which I think the Congress should look into in oversight hearings, not to attach any blame but to improve procedures and approaches for the future. 
   Again I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in honor of their reunion to be held this month, I am pleased to call the Senate's attention to honor the crew of U.S.S. J. William Ditter who served during World War II. 
   I commend the dedication and courage of that crew of the minelayer named in honor of former Pennsylvania Congressman J. William Ditter. 
   Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 1888, J. William Ditter received his law degree from Temple University in 1913 and was admitted to the bar the same year. As a school teacher and baseball coach at Northeast High School from 1912 until 1925, one of Coach Ditter's team members was Jimmy Dykes, who later went on to become Connie Mack's star third baseman during the Philadelphia Athletics' glory years in the nineteen-thirties. Less famous, but equally important were the hundreds of young men and women who studied at Northeast High under ``Doc'' Ditter's tutelage. They constantly sought his advice and retained their affection for him in the years that followed. 
   In 1925, Mr. Ditter moved to Montgomery County, where he practiced law and became an active member of his church and community. In 1932, Montgomery County was made a separate Congressional district and Mr. Ditter was elected to serve as its first Representative. 
   As a member of the House of Representatives, he quickly became known for his tireless work, dedication to our country, and consummate skill in debate. Congressman Ditter took a prominent role in defeating President Franklin Roosevelt's efforts to pack the Supreme Court in order to insure that New Deal legislation would not be declared unconstitutional. As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Naval Affairs, he led the fight to establish a two-ocean Navy. The success of the Navy in World War II, including the ship which was named after him, was due in part to the leadership and dedication of Congressman J. William Ditter. 
   In recognition of his leadership, Bill Ditter was selected to be the Chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, a post he held until his death in 1943. While in Congress, Mr. Ditter explained his positions on public affairs by writing a weekly newspaper column, Trend of Events. During his years in Congress, he was much in demand as a public speaker, not only in Montgomery County but throughout the state and nation. 
   Congressman Ditter's political career was cut short by his untimely death in a Navy plane crash near Columbia, Pennsylvania. He was returning from Boston where he had been on a trip to participate in the commissioning of the Navy's new carrier, U.S.S. Wasp. Among the many dignitaries who attended his funeral were former President Herbert C. Hoover, a close, personal friend and my colleague Senator MCCAIN's grandfather Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., Commander of Carrier Task Force 38. Congressman Ditter was buried with military honors at Whitemarsh Memorial Cemetery. In light of his distinguished service to our nation, the Navy named a destroyer-mine layer in his honor, U.S.S. J. William Ditter (DM 31). 
   U.S.S. J. William Ditter was a fitting tribute to Congressman Ditter. The Sumner class destroyer, which was converted to a high speed mine layer, was christened by Mrs. J. William Ditter on July 4, 1944. It was commissioned on October 28, 1944, and served as a unit of Division 9, Mine Squadron 3. Congressman Ditter's dedication and service to his country was mirrored by the actions of the men on U.S.S. J. William Ditter. The ``Fighting J. Willy'', as the crew called the mine layer, destroyed many Japanese suicide aircraft and boats during its years of service. 
   The end of April marks the fifty-fifth anniversary of the brave actions of the crew in the early days of the operations in Okinawa. U.S.S. J. William Ditter greatly contributed to the success of the first landings on April 1, 1945 by escorting transport ships carrying American invasion forces. 
   On April 12, U.S.S. J. William Ditter joined the radar picket line to protect ships against attacking Japanese aircraft. On April 26, U.S.S. J. William Ditter drove off an attacking enemy aircraft, and on April 27, the crew helped to down two enemy aircraft. On April 28, the crew shot down an attacking suicide aircraft and combined its fire with another ship in order to shoot down two other hostile aircraft. On April 29, the crew detected and attacked an enemy submarine. 
   By May 28, 1945, U.S.S. J. William Ditter had shot down eight Japanese aircraft and assisted in destroying three others. On June 6, 1945, in the radar picket line of Task Force 51.5 patrolling southeast of Nakagusukua Wan, U.S.S. J. William Ditter shot down four. However, one suicide plane hit U.S.S. J. William Ditter, inflicting heavy damage and numerous casualties. Ten men were killed and twenty-seven were wounded on that fateful day. 
   Although the ship was repaired enough to make it home to the United States, it was decommissioned and struck from the Navy's fleet when the war ended. Despite the short term of service, U.S.S. J. William Ditter had a distinguished war record, keeping in honor with the person for whom the ship was named--Congressman J. William Ditter.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a very brief colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Vermont from the Committee on Labor, Health, Education and Pensions. It had been anticipated there would be a unanimous consent request to move forward on legislation on organ transplants which came out of the Labor Committee yesterday on a unanimous vote. I had been deeply involved in that matter when the issue came before the conference on the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We had crafted, after a great deal of controversy, a resolution where the Secretary of Health and Human Services came especially to an evening session and we worked out what I thought were the final details on the settlement. 
   But as I think George Shultz said, nothing is ever settled in Washington and the matter has seen a new birth. The issue came before the Labor Committee and they have crafted a new proposal. I had intended to object. It now appears that others will object and the matter will not come forward. 
   I thought it useful to have a colloquy with Senator JEFFORDS where I would not raise an objection on his assurance that out of the conference the bill of the Labor Committee would not be watered down any more. That is a minimal consideration for fairness in organ transplants. In my judgment, no bill would be better than any bill which is less than the one which is out of committee. 
   My own personal view is that the compromise crafted in my subcommittee on appropriations on that bill is a superior approach, but I did see the wave moving toward what happened in the Labor Committee yesterday. Therefore, I will not raise an objection on the assurance from the chairman that that bill will not be reduced, modified, or weakened in any way in conference.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to add $1.6 billion for NIH funding to fulfill the commitment made by the Senate on the unanimous 98-0 vote to double NIH funding over 5 years. 
   The National Institutes of Health are the crown jewel of the Federal Government. In fact, they are the only jewel of the Federal Government. There will be a second-degree amendment offered that will seek to establish a priority for this money, to take it from somewhere else, which is meaningless. The only way to fund NIH in accordance with the commitment of the Senate is to adopt this amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators HARKIN, MACK, DODD, SNOWE, COLLINS, BINGAMAN, SARBANES, MIKULSKI, BREAUX, BOXER, JOHNSON, GRAHAM of Florida, FEINSTEIN, WELLSTONE, KENNEDY, and DURBIN. 
   We have gotten a detailed appraisal from NIH as to what they have done with the money. It is being wisely used. It is the most important capital investment for America for the future.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is true that the budget for three major departments is a large budget. But it is not possible to find $2.7 billion in the budget as proposed, when we have other education programs, where we have other health programs, where we have other labor programs on worker safety. The choice really is up to the Senate; that is, whether they will authorize the $2.7 billion increase, which is what NIH needs to fulfill the commitment already made by the Senate on the unanimous 98-0 vote. A vote in favor of this second-degree amendment is a vote against NIH funding for $2.7 billion. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to Senator HARKIN.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a pending inquiry by the Judiciary subcommittee on oversight on the Department of Justice related to two subpoenas which were issued by the full Judiciary Committee to two individuals, one a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California and the second, a current employee at the Department of Justice, here in Washington, DC. 
   The reasons for the request of the issuance of these subpoenas have been set out in the public record in a variety of places, but I thought it useful to summarize the background of the applicable law at this time because there is some public concern about exactly what is going on, why it is going on, and what are the precedents. 
   Yesterday in the respected Legal Times, there was a balanced account of the request for the subpoenas and the issuance of the subpoenas, but the account, as is necessary in a relatively short publication, did not spell out in detail all of the background, which I propose to do at this moment. Some of what I say on the floor of the Senate will be supplemented by a memoranda which I will ask to be made a part of the RECORD. 
   The essential facts are these: The oversight subcommittee is looking into the plea bargain entered in the case of a man named Dr. Peter Lee in 1998. Dr. Lee had confessed to two very serious instances of espionage. In 1985, Dr. Lee provided to the scientists of the People's Republic of China information about nuclear energy. In 1997, Dr. Lee again provided to scientists of the People's Republic of China information about detecting submarines. 
   When the matter moved through the process between the assistant U.S. attorney in California to the Department of Justice, involving the Navy and the Department of Energy, there was a serious failure of communication. 
   I interviewed the assistant U.S. attorney at length in Los Angeles on February 15, and that individual told me--and it is a part of the record--that he was denied permission to seek a serious charge against Dr. Lee but was authorized only to file a criminal complaint under section 1001 of 18 U.S.C., a false statement, but could not file serious charges of espionage. 
   Records of the FBI and the Department of Defense, which our subcommittee has uncovered after laborious, painstaking efforts, disclose that the Department of Justice was prepared to authorize a prosecution under 794, which is a serious espionage statute which carries a penalty of up to life in prison or the death penalty. I am not suggesting the death penalty was appropriate or life in prison was appropriate, but that is what was provided. Those serious penalties are sometimes used as leverage to get cooperation or further information, something I saw in some detail when I was district attorney of Philadelphia. 
   The assistant U.S. attorney says he knew nothing about that. The plea bargain was entered into before there was a damage assessment. After the damage assessment was completed, Department of Energy officials classified the disclosures in the secret category. The Navy Department wrote an ambiguous letter at one stage on November 14, 1997, a letter which was hard to understand because the damage assessment had not been made and, in fact, the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense, did not make a damage assessment until requested to do so by the Judiciary oversight subcommittee. 
   When that damage assessment was finally made, they came to the conclusion that it was, in fact, classified information. They disagreed with the Department of Energy's secret classification but did classify it at the confidential level. 
   Through all of this sequence of events, the key official in the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, has declined to be interviewed. This individual is the key person who dealt with the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles and who dealt with the Department of the Navy. 
   This is, obviously, a matter of enormous importance. When one combines what was done with Dr. Peter Lee with what was done with Dr. Wen Ho Lee, who is now under indictment, where the Attorney General of the United States admitted she did not follow up on an FBI request for a warrant under the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act but delegated it to a subordinate who had no experience in the field. Attorney General Reno failed to follow up 
   on it, and in fact the FBI let the matter lie dormant for 16 to 17 months, and when you add to that other plea bargains in the Department of Justice on campaign contributions involving John Huang, Charlie Trie, and Johnny Chung, and the technology transfer to the People's Republic of China over the objections of the Department of Justice which was conducting a criminal investigation, there is a great deal which needs to be done. 
   Isolating and focusing for a moment just on the Dr. Peter Lee case, that is what we are looking at and that is why we have asked for the subpoenas. 
   The arguments in the Judiciary Committee have raised the point that this is an unprecedented event, but that in fact is not true. The Congressional Research Service summarized this issue as follows, and I will be submitting a memorandum which has a fuller citation of authority:  
   In the majority of instances reviewed, the testimony of subordinate DOJ employees, such as line attorneys and FBI field agents, was taken formally or informally, and included detailed testimony about specific instances of the Department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases.  
   This goes beyond closed cases but goes to cases which are pending and which are currently being investigated. We have seen a repeated effort by the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Reno, to use a pending investigation as a roadblock to providing congressional oversight, but in fact the cases are to the contrary. 
   The authority for these issues goes back as far as Teapot Dome and extends as recently to last year with the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. In Teapot Dome, the select committee heard testimony from scores of present and former attorneys and agents of the Department of Justice. Some of the cases upon which testimony was offered were still open at the time.  
   The investigation of white-collar crime in the oil industry, an investigation of the failure of the Department of Justice to effectively investigate and prosecute alleged crimes, took place in 1979 when joint hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. At that time, a Department of Justice staff attorney testified in open session as to the reason for not going forward with a particular criminal prosecution. 
   That is about what we are looking for here, why the prosecution did not go forward, but why they settled for an insufficient plea bargain which gave Dr. Lee no jail time but only community service, probation, and a fine. In that context, the Department of Justice asked for only a short period of incarceration. It is hard to understand why that would be done when there are documents from the FBI and the Department of Defense which say prosecution would be authorized for a penalty which carried life imprisonment or the death penalty. 
   In the Rocky Flats investigation in 1992, the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology took testimony from the U.S. attorney from the District of Colorado, an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado, a Department of Justice line attorney, and an FBI field agent. According to Congressman Howard Wolpe, the Justice Department was initially uncooperative but finally agreed to the subcommittee's requests only after the subcommittee threatened to hold DOJ in contempt. 
   In 1992, carrying through 1994, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations conducted an extensive investigation into the impact of Department of Justice activities on the effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency's criminal enforcement program. 
   Overall, the subcommittee conducted detailed interviews with more than 40 current and former Justice Department officials concerning the management and operation of the Environmental Division. 
   For months, Justice Department attorneys stalled on subcommittee requests to interview DOJ line attorneys and sought to deny the subcommittee access to numerous primary decisionmaking documents as well as documents prepared in response to the subcommittee's investigation. 
   On June 9 of last year, David Ryan, a line attorney for the Department of Justice OIPR, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in response to a committee subpoena. 
   On September 22 of last year, three FBI field agents----

   Mr. SPECTER. To respond to the inquiry of the Senator from California, I intend to speak for about 5 or 6 or 7 more minutes. As I understand the rules, if you have the floor, and if you have been allotted time, you can speak on any subject a Senator desires. 
   As I was about to say, Mr. President, on September 22, 1999, three FBI agents testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about the details of their investigation of Charlie Trie. Those individuals appeared under subpoena. There have been efforts to have the subcommittee stand down on some unspecified assurances from the Department of Justice that a way will be found to provide the subcommittee with the information it needs. 
   That is not practical under these circumstances, where the specific subpoenaed Department of Justice employee was the key link between the assistant U.S. attorney from California and the Department of Defense. But I think it not irrelevant to comment about the failure of the Department of Justice to reply continually to requests for oversight from the Judiciary Committee. 
   On July 15, 1998, I asked for the Attorney General's opinion as to whether there was ``specific and credible'' evidence of a legal violation when Mr. Karl Jackson testified that John Huang said within earshot of President William Clinton, ``elections cost money, lots and lots of money, and I am sure that every person in this room will want to support the reelection of President Clinton.'' 
   That was stated in the White House. The Attorney General responded that she would be ``happy to review it with the task force and get back to you,'' referring to me. She never did so.

   Mr. SPECTER. We are in the midst of some very serious oversight on the Department of Justice. We have seen the Wen Ho Lee case bungled badly by the Department of Justice and the chances for successful prosecution placed in real jeopardy. We have seen very serious espionage violations by Dr. Peter Lee involving nuclear power and involving detection of submarines, to which there were confessions, where a plea bargain was entered into without having a damage assessment and without having the trial attorney notified as to his authority to pursue very serious charges. 
   It is plain, in the context of what has gone on with the Department of Justice over the past many years in their refusal to provide information for oversight, even after the requests were made, and even after the Attorney General personally agreed to the request, that the only way to get to the bottom of it is to issue subpoenas and insist on congressional oversight so we can find out why these travesties of justice were carried out. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss a Dear Colleague letter which Senator BIDEN and I are circulating today. I expect to have the agreement of at least two other Senators to circulate this Dear Colleague letter. It is an effort to deal with the very serious problems which have been caused by the rise in the price of oil as a result of the activities of the OPEC countries. 
   The price of imported crude oil rose from $10.92 per barrel, for the first quarter of 1999, to over $31 per barrel in this month. In the first quarter of last year gasoline prices were, on an average, 95 cents per gallon, and heating oil was 80 cents per gallon. A year later both have peaked at $1.70. 
   On Tuesday, the day before yesterday, OPEC agreed to raise oil production over the next 3 months by up to 1.7 million barrels a day. But this is far less than what is necessary to take care of the very serious problems imposed upon Americans at the gas pump, for heating oil, diesel fuel for the truckers, and our whole society beyond the United States--foreign countries, as well--as a result of these cartels and conspiracies. 
   This conduct is reprehensible. If it were going on in the United States, it would be a clear-cut violation of our antitrust laws. 
   There have been declarations at the international level. The Organization for Economic Development, consisting of some 29 countries, made a declaration in March of 1998 that conspiracies in restraint of trade constitute a violation of international law. 
   At about the same time, 11 countries from Latin America made a similar declaration that conspiracies of cartels to restrain trade violate international law. 
   After a considerable amount of research, we are writing to the President asking him to consider two courses of litigation going to court. One course of action would be to file suit under United States antitrust laws, because these conspiracies of cartels in restraint of trade have an economic impact on the United States. There is ample authority for the Government of the United States to proceed in this way. 
   Suits were filed by private parties in 1979 in the Central District of California. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded in 1981 that it would be inappropriate for a U.S. court to pass on that subject because international law was not clearly defined at that time. But there have been significant developments in international law since that 1981 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit so that, in my judgment, the opportunities would be excellent to win this case and certainly well worth the effort. 
   The Dear Colleague letter which we are submitting has a second aspect, and that is a recommendation to the President that legal action be instituted in the International Court of Justice, perhaps for only an advisory opinion, that OPEC countries were violating international law. 
   I was surprised to see the International Court of Justice take jurisdiction in a case involving the issue of the legality to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons in war. I had thought that such an issue would be what is called nonjusticiable law, that is, not subject to going to court. You talk  about national sovereignty. You talk about nuclear weapons. Such a subject would be really beyond the scope of what the International Court of Justice would decide. But the court did take jurisdiction on that issue. The court rendered an advisory opinion it would be illegal to either use or threaten to use nuclear weapons except in self-defense. 
   We have also seen, in the last few years, very significant developments in international law with the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, where there have been indictments, 
   prosecutions and convictions for crimes against humanity. There was also the extensive use of international law from the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda. 
   In a surprising case which has captured international headlines for months, an effort has been made to try Pinochet, former leader of Chile, on the application of the courts of Spain, although the acts did not occur in Spain. Customarily under criminal law, the prosecution is brought where the acts occurred. Pinochet was in England. There was a tremendous amount of litigation there. Surprisingly, there was an extension of international law into areas where conduct is really despicable, as are the allegations related to Pinochet. Recently the former dictator from Chad was tried in the courts of Senegal on charges of torture and violation of human rights. 
   We are looking at a rapidly expanding international picture. I believe we ought to be taking every step possible to deal with these cartels and this conspiratorial and reprehensible conduct by the OPEC nations. While they have agreed to raise production slightly, we are at their whim for action any time they see fit to cut back on production, to extract and extort enormous sums of money from consumers in the United States and consumers around the world. 
   This is not a problem for this day only. This is a problem which plagued the United States, with the long gas lines in 1974, 26 years ago, but I remember them well. People lined up for three blocks waiting in a gas line to get some fuel. By the time you got there, the pumps sometimes were out or sometimes it was limited. There is no reason why we should have to put up with this kind of conduct because it does violate international norms and really ought to be stopped. 
   This letter does not contain any reference to actions on a class action basis by consumers. Right now, the antitrust law calls for actions only by so-called direct purchasers. But consideration is being given by a number of Senators to an amendment to the existing antitrust laws to allow indirect purchasers; that is, somebody who buys gas at the pump. Texaco could sue OPEC, at least would have standing to sue OPEC. There would be the other considerations that would have standing as a direct purchaser. 
   Under a case denominated Illinois v. Brick, an indirect consumer cannot sue. But I believe there would be good reason to amend our antitrust laws, limited to the field of purchases relating to oil. That is a distinction, because oil is such a critical part of our economy and such a critical part of our everyday life: for keeping our houses and offices warm, our general buildings warm, to supplying gasoline for truckers who transport necessary items for everyday life, and for the gasoline which is necessary for our automobiles. This is where we have been gouged by the OPEC conduct. 
   Some have raised the question: What good would it do to take these cases to court; what would the remedy be? The fact is, there are considerable assets from these OPEC countries in the United States which would be subject to attachment. With respect to the suit in the International Court of Justice, there would be considerable opprobrium in being sued, hauled into court. Nobody likes to be sued, whether an individual, a company, or a country. This conduct is reprehensible and we ought to call them on it. 
   I do believe, in the final analysis, our U.S. laws on antitrust would enable us to get a remedy. Actually, the International Court of Justice would hold out these international pirates to be nothing more than they are, really preying on the weak, those who have to buy the oil at any price. This conspiracy and restraint of trade and these cartels ought not to be allowed to go on.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the amendment, whose principal sponsor is the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. HOLLINGS, which would authorize the Congress and State legislatures to limit campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. 
   Senator HOLLINGS and I have been the principal cosponsors of this provision since 1988. It is denominated as a constitutional amendment, but, in fact, it is not a constitutional amendment, but instead it is a provision which would alter the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. Valeo which says that money was equated with speech. I believe that to be an incorrect constitutional interpretation, as do 209 professors of law who have submitted a statement urging the overruling of Buckley v. Valeo. 
   Since the Supreme Court of the United States is not about to do that, the only recourse is to follow the procedure today on what is denominated a constitutional amendment, but it is not a constitutional amendment because there is nothing in the first amendment which says speech is money. That is not in the first amendment. The first amendment guarantees freedom of speech, and an opinion by a majority of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. Valeo has made that interpretation. 
   Just as in the flag-burning case, there is nothing in the first amendment which says freedom of speech includes the right to burn an American flag. But in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court handed down that interpretation. It is important to note, as a matter of constitutional law, what the Supreme Court says is denominated as the opinion of the Court. If any effort were to be made to change the language of the first amendment, I would strenuously oppose any such effort. But the provision to allow Congress and State legislatures to control campaign contributions and expenditures does not do that. 
   On a purely personal note, this decision had special significance for me on January 30, 1976, the day it was handed down, because at that time I was in the middle of a campaign for the Republican nomination to the Senate for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. When the campaign started in the fall of 1975, the campaign finance law of 1974 governed, which limited the contributions of an individual for his own candidacy to $35,000, which was about the size of my bank account. 
   My opponent in the campaign was Congressman John Heinz. On January 30, the Supreme Court said that any individual can spend whatever he chose, millions if he chose, and John did. That was the balance of the election. 
   At the same time, the Supreme Court said that my brother, Morton Specter, who had the financial ability to finance my campaign--not in the Heinz style, perhaps, but adequately--was limited to $1,000 which was provided for in the law. The question, I think not illogically, came to my mind: What was the difference between John Heinz's money and Morton Specter's money? But that is what the Supreme Court said, and they said it in a very curious way. 
   They said:   
   In order to preserve the provisions against invalidation on vagueness grounds--  
   They cite the statute--  
   it must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that express in terms that advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.  
   They then drop to a footnote:  
   ..... which required language such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for Congress,'' ``vote against,'' ``defeat and reject.'' 
   That has led to the very extraordinary so-called issue advertisements, which are not controllable, where they are bought by soft money. Listen to a couple of illustrative issue advertisements in the 1996 campaign for President Clinton in the summer of 1996, which ultimately tipped the scales: 
   ``American values,'' ``do our duty to our parents,'' ``President Clinton protects Medicare,'' ``the Dole-Gingrich budget tried to cut Medicare $270 billion,'' ``protect families,'' ``President Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families,'' ``the Dole-Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on 8 million of them,'' ``opportunity,'' ``President Clinton proposes tax breaks for tuition,'' ``the Dole-Gingrich budget tried to slash college scholarships,'' ``only President Clinton's plan meets our challenges, protects our values.'' 
   That is curiously, insanely categorized not as an advocacy advertisement, but only an issue ad. But what quality is there in the English language which could more emphatically say: Elect President Clinton, defeat Senator Dole? 
   That is the consequence when millions of dollars are poured into campaigns in soft money, unregulated under the decision of the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo. 
   I note one very important factor: That the consequence of this provision, denominated as an amendment, is not to put into effect any specific reforms, but only to give the Congress of the United States the authority constitutionally to do so. This does not say what corporations can do, what unions can do, what individuals can do. It says only that the constraint of Buckley v. Valeo, the opinion of Justices in a split Court, will not preclude Congress from acting on the very important item of having democracy prevail in elections. 
   It is totally antithetical, in my opinion, to have money equated with power in a democracy. It subverts the principle of one man-one woman equals to one vote if power is equal to money and the rich can dominate the electoral process. 
   I do not believe that Members of the House and Senate sell their votes, although there is a widespread perception of that kind of corruption. 
   There is a problem of access which I try to deal with by holding town meetings in the 67 counties in Pennsylvania. On recent economies where the budgets of Senators are limited as to mailing, it has not been possible for me to mail all of my constituents who attended the town meetings. But I think that is a very practical answer to those who complain about access. 
   If Senators go to the county seat to be in the proximity of their constituents and let their constituents know by a postcard that the Senator will be present at a given time, a given place to answer their questions, then I think that kind of a guarantee of access would answer a great many skeptical comments about fundraisers and the purchase of access. 
   That is why I am proposing legislation which would permit a Senator to supplement his mailing budget for one postcard, once a year, to each constituent in each county, providing the Senator personally appears at that event. 
   The reality is, many Senators do not undertake town meetings anymore because they are very rough, tough affairs where people come in--may the RECORD show a smile on the face of the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming--they are rough, tough affairs. 
   I think the cost would probably be fairly low because I think relatively few Senators would avail themselves of that opportunity. 
   In conclusion, let me remind my colleagues that what Senator HOLLINGS and I are proposing does not change the language of the first amendment, but instead it substitutes our judgment for the judgment of the Court on what is an opinion of the interpretation of the Constitution's first amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. 
   Mr. President, on January 30, 1976, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a most extraordinary decision equating freedom of speech with money. That was a shock to me on the day the decision came down, and it remains a shock, because in a democracy political power ought not to be determined by who has the most money. 
   Since 1988, for more than 12 years, Senator HOLLINGS and I have proposed a very basic constitutional amendment which would permit Congress to regulate contributions and expenditures. There is nothing in this amendment which would limit political speech otherwise, but deals solely with the issue of contributions and expenditures. 
   The amendment states Congress shall have the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by and the amount of expenditures that may be made by or in support of or in opposition to a candidate for nomination or election to or for election to Federal office. Section 2 gives similar power to the States in identical language. 
   In 1976, the day Buckley v. Valeo was handed down, I was an announced candidate for the Republican nomination for the Senate in the State of Pennsylvania. I had entered into that contest on the basis of the 1974 Campaign Finance Act, which said that a candidate for nomination for the Senate in the State the size of Pennsylvania would be limited to spending of $35,000. My opponent in that primary contest was Congressman John Heinz. On January 30, the Supreme Court said that John Heinz could spend millions, which he did, and my brother, Morton Specter, who might have been able to finance my campaign, was limited to $1,000. I had a little bit of a hard time understanding at that point why Congressman Heinz's speech was different from Morton Specter's speech. 
   When I came to the Congress, I pursued this issue. As I say, since 1988, Senator HOLLINGS and I have pursued this constitutional amendment. This is the 106th Congress. It was in the 105th Congress and the 104th Congress, et cetera. I believe it is a very important amendment if we are to eliminate certain dangers, and certainly the perception of dangers, in our election system. 
   In the 1996 Presidential campaign, the expenditures were some $400 million. In the congressional campaigns in 1996, there was almost $300 million in the Senate, and more than $477 million in the House. In the 1988 congressional campaigns, the Senate spending level remained at about the same, while the House spent about $452 million. The time that it takes Members of Congress to raise the money has been well documented. There is a perception in the land that Members of Congress--Senators and Representatives--are for sale. I think that votes are not for sale, but I believe there is no doubt of the public perception to the contrary. 
   The amendment which has been presented is necessary because of the decision in the Buckley case, and it is improperly characterized as an amendment to the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In my personal view, the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution is inviolate. Those words have stood this country tremendously well, and I would fight any effort to change the language of the first amendment. But a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in interpreting the first amendment is not inviolate. It is not Holy Writ. These judgments are handed down by individuals who are nominated and confirmed in the Senate, and they write opinions because that is their opinion as to what 
   the first amendment means.  
   I submit that to say speech is equivalent to money is basically outrageous. But until that is changed and our Constitution requires that in the form of a constitutional amendment, it ought more accurately to be said that it is the opinion of the Congress by a two-thirds vote backed up by the opinion of the State legislatures, three-fourths of which are necessary to have the amendment come through, that the opinion of the Supreme Court is not correct. 
   We are debating at the same time a constitutional amendment on the flag-burning issue. Here again, it is not the Constitution which says that in the first amendment a citizen or anyone has a constitutional right to burn a flag. But five Justices said in opinions the first amendment raises that implication. Four Justices said the first amendment did not raise that implication. They are opinions. With all due respect to the men and women who occupy the chambers of the Supreme Court, with the columns lining directly up with the Senate Chamber, having participated in my tenure in eight confirmation proceedings, their opinions are not inviolate. And their opinions are subject to modification. As our Constitution is written, they have the last word unless the provisions of the Constitution are followed to have a change and an amendment. 
   When the Constitution was formulated, the Congress was in the first article, and I think the drafters of the Constitution thought that Congress was the primary article I body. The executive branch came in in article II. The Court came in in article III. There is nothing in the Constitution which says the Supreme Court of the United States has the power to invalidate an act of Congress. There is nothing in the Constitution which says that. But the Supreme Court of the United States, in 1803, in perhaps the most famous of all Supreme Court decisions, in Brown v. Board of Education--perhaps some others--said that the Supreme Court had that authority. I believe it was a wise decision because someone has to have the last word. But their pronouncements are not statements from the tabernacles, from the Ten Commandants, or Holy Writ. They are their opinions. It is a very tough mountain to climb to have this amendment adopted because it brings together a coalition of people who articulate the sanctity of the first amendment really misstating it as the sanctity of the opinions of the Justices. 
   Buckley v. Valeo was a split decision. Those individuals, institutions, agencies, are combined with the people who want to maintain the money chase for elective office the way it is at the present time, so there is no doubt it is a very tough proposition. 
   Go into the Cloakrooms of both parties and you find in common parlance the people who say they are for campaign finance reform really are not but say so because it will not pass. It is like the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget that requires 67 votes. There are people who say they are going to vote for it, but until it gets to 66, nobody will cast that 67th vote, so there is a fair amount of posturing on the issue before anything can be adopted. 
   It is important to focus on the fact that this provision, this amendment, this change in the opinions of the Justices of the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo does not adopt any specific kind of change in the campaign laws. It does not say what will happen to soft money, it does not say what will happen to corporate contributions, it does not say what will happen to the union money, it does not say what will happen to money of millionaires or billionaires. 
   As we speak, there are campaigns underway for $25 million in one State in a primary. Is a seat in the Senate something that ought to be up for sale? I think $25 million for a primary is too high. Our seats ought not to be up for sale. There is too much of a public trust here for any individual to buy a seat in the Senate or the House of Representatives. That is the practical fact of life. 
   When the Supreme Court of the United States decided Buckley v. Valeo--and it is one of the most challenging opinions to read; it goes on for 128 pages of single-spaced opinions--the Court said at one point:  
   We agree that in order to preserve the provision against invalidation on vagueness grounds, section 608(e)1 must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.  
   Then they have a footnote which says: The Constitution would restrict the application to communications containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat such as ``vote for, elect, support, cast your ballot for, Smith for Congress, vote against, defeat, reject,'' et cetera. 
   That interpretation, on what is called express advocacy, has led to extraordinary approval of political advertisements, so-called ``issue advertisements,'' not regulatable by campaign finance and which can be paid for by soft money which corporations or individuals or unions or anyone can put up in large amounts--millions of dollars. 
   Let me read a couple of commercials from the 1996 election early on purchased with soft money, which really turned the election. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. Both sides comport themselves about the same. 
   This is a commercial for President Clinton's reelection.  
   American values. Do our duty to our parents. President Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of them. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our challenges, protects our values.  
   Could anybody with hearing and sanity say that is not an advertisement for President Clinton? The Supreme Court of the United States says it is not. That is an issue ad. Why? Because it doesn't say ``elect Clinton.'' It doesn't say ``defeat Dole.'' But it says President Clinton protects Medicare. It says Dole-Gingrich tried to raise taxes on 8 million citizens. 
   Try another one:  
   60,000 felons and fugitives tried to buy handguns--but couldn't--because President Clinton passed the Brady bill--five-day waits, background checks. But Dole and Gingrich voted no. One hundred thousand new police because President Clinton delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want to repeal 'em. Strengthen school anti-drug programs. President Clinton did it. Dole and Gingrich? No, again. Their old ways don't work. President Clinton's plan. The new way. Meeting our challenges, protecting our values.  
   Try this one on for size:  
   Protecting families. For millions of working families, President Clinton cut taxes. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million. The Dole-Gingrich budget would have slashed Medicare 270 billion. Cut college scholarships. The President defended our values. Protected Medicare. And now, a tax cut of 1,500 a year for the first two years of college. Most community colleges are free. Help adults go back to school. The President's plan protects our values.  
   That is not a commercial for President Clinton, that is an issue advertisement, so says the law of the land handed down by the Supreme Court of the United States. To say it is ridiculous or to say it is outrageous or to say it is nonsensical, to say it is stupid is an understatement. Those are the laws we are operating under now. 
   We face very determined opposition. I heard a lot of arguments about myths and facts, arguments that the Constitution's right to freedom of speech would be changed by what Senator HOLLINGS and I and others are proposing. That is not so. It doesn't deal with the right to freedom of speech under the Constitution. It deals with campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. 
   When you talk about a good bit of the legislation which is pending, it is not going to do the job even if it is enacted. Better to try than not to try, but if you are dealing with soft money, it is going to be rejected under the clear-cut language of Buckley v. Valeo on what is express advocacy contrasted with what is issue advocacy. 
   The only way to get this job done is to adopt an amendment. We call it a constitutional amendment, but it really is not a constitutional amendment. It is not a constitutional amendment because it does not seek to change the words of the Constitution. It does not seek to change the words of the first amendment. It seeks only to say the opinions of the Justices in a split Court  are not correct. Those are men and women, not too dissimilar from Senator HOLLINGS, a very distinguished lawyer who could have been on the Supreme Court if he had chosen to be on the Supreme Court. In a fact not widely known, you don't have to be a lawyer to be on the Supreme Court. 
   Parenthetically, I tried to urge Senator Hatfield to become a Supreme Court Justice at one stage because I thought he had extraordinary qualifications, one of which was he wasn't a lawyer, but there are others who have different opinions. 
   When you equate money with speech, Justice Stevens said in his concurring opinion in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC: Money is property, it is not speech. 
   It seems fundamental that in a democracy the power of a person with money is greater than the power of a person without money. The proportion of the power goes directly in line with how much money that person has. It is not good for America. 
   Senator HOLLINGS and I are going to be around for a while pushing this constitutional amendment. We may even push it until Senator HOLLINGS is a senior Senator. He has only been here since 1966. He has a record of being the senior junior Senator in the history of the Senate. I say that only in a moment of light jest. We have a very distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. THURMOND, who is the longest serving Senator in the history of the Senate. 
   We intend to keep pushing this. The votes go up and down as the constituency of the Senate changes. We believe very strongly that we are right and that money is not speech. One day we will prevail. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. I decided to join my friend from Massachusetts in introducing the Hunger Relief Act after carefully reviewing the evidence of persisting hunger in Pennsylvania and the U.S., and after extensive consultations with local leaders who are working under enormous strains to meet growing needs. As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that covers education and labor programs, I share the concern expressed by my friend from Iowa that our education, health, and workforce improvement efforts are threatened by unmet needs for nutritional assistance. I too hope that the Budget Committee responds to the needs that our hunger relief legislation addresses, by including a reserve fund of $2.5 billion over five years.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to highlight an important provision in the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization conference report which provides more equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. 
   The devastating crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17, 1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps the community hardest hit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones who were participating in a long-awaited Montoursville High School French Club trip to France. 
   Last Congress it was brought to my attention by constituents, including parents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800, that their ability to seek redress in court was hampered by a 1920 shipping law known as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally intended to apply to the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of jumbo-jet passengers who have perished during international air travel. 
   The Death on the High Seas Act states that where the death of a person is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring more than one marine league--three miles--from U.S. shores, a personal representative of a decedent can only sue for pecuniary loss sustained by the decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. Therefore, the families of the victims of aviation accidents, such as TWA 800, Swissair 111 and EgyptAir 990, all of which occurred more than three miles offshore, were precluded from recovering non-pecuniary damages such as loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how great the wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane manufacturer. 
   In the 105th Congress Representative McDade and I introduced legislation to remove the application of the Death on the High Seas Act from aviation incidents. Our legislation was not enacted into law, and in the 106th Congress, Representative SHERWOOD and I again reintroduced this measure. The House bill, H.R. 603, passed by an overwhelming margin and was incorporated into the House FAA reauthorization bill. The Senate version of the FAA bill included a provision allowing victims' families to recover non-pecuniary damages, but with a cap of $750,000, which I opposed. 
   On October 18, 1999, I was successful in convincing 15 of my colleagues to join me in a letter to Chairman MCCAIN urging the Senate to accept the House provision in conference. Representative SHERWOOD and I also worked closely with Chairman SHUSTER and his staff to press our case before the conferees. 
   I am very pleased that the final provision agreed upon in the FAA reauthorization conference report accomplishes the primary goal of our free-standing legislation by extending the territorial seas of the United States from three to twelve miles for the purpose of aviation accidents after July 16, 1996. This effectively removes TWA 800--which crashed roughly ten miles offshore--from coverage under the Death on the High Seas Act. In addition, while the Death on the High Seas Act will still apply to other aviation accidents which occurred beyond twelve miles, such as Swissair 111 and EgyptAir 990, non-pecuniary damages will now be recoverable for the first time. 
   Our success in this matter would not have been possible without the work of many, and I would particularly like to recognize the efforts of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, Frank Carven and Will and Kathy Rogers, all of whom have lost loved ones as a result of tragedy in international air travel. These individuals first brought this issue to my attention and served as able advocates. I would also like to thank Dan Renberg and Mark Carmel of my staff, who worked tirelessly on behalf of all the victims' families. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman SHUSTER, Chairman MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS and Senator GORTON for working with Representative SHERWOOD and myself to address this matter. 
   This issue is not about large damage awards. It is about ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families of victims of plane crashes. While nothing can ever completely take away the pain and grief felt by those who lost loved ones in these tragedies, I am hopeful that the victims' families are comforted with the knowledge that some measure of fairness has been restored and the American civil justice system is now more accessible.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about the ``Report on the Investigation of Espionage Allegations against Dr. Wen Ho Lee.'' I have circulated this 65-page report with a Dear Colleague letter today, but I think it important to speak about it on the Senate floor. 
   The Dear Colleague letter urges Senators to support S. 2089 which is designed to reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to avoid the mistakes which were made in the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. 
   In the Wen Ho Lee matter, the FBI went to the Attorney General personally to ask for approval for a FISA warrant and was turned down. The Attorney General in August of 1997 assigned the matter to a subordinate who had no experience on FISA matters. The Attorney General did not check on the matter, and the FBI request was, therefore, rejected. The FBI then let the matter languish for some 16 months before taking any investigative action. 
   At that stage, the Department of Energy meddled in the matter by giving a lie detector test to Dr. Lee, representing he had passed it when, in fact, he failed it, throwing the FBI investigation off course. The FBI then gave another polygraph on February 10  which Dr. Lee failed, but there was no action taken to remove him from the office until March 8, so that he stood with access to this very important information for some 19 months. 
   This information was so important that, according to the testimony of Dr. Stephen Younger at the bail hearing, it could 
   change the global strategic balance. 
   The legislation seeks to correct these failures by requiring the Attorney General personally to review the matter when requested in writing by the Director of the FBI, and then, if the FISA application is declined, to state in writing the reasons, which will give a roadmap to the FBI as to what to do, and then for the Director of the FBI to personally supervise the investigation and to centralize the authority of the FBI to keep the meddling of the Department of Energy illustratively out of it. 
   This report is disagreed with in some manner by the Department of Justice, and there is some disagreement by other Federal agencies and some Senators. But it sets out a narrative, and anybody who has a disagreement will have an opportunity to testify before the oversight subcommittee. 
   This legislation has been cosponsored by Senator TORRICELLI, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator BIDEN, Senator THURMOND, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator SESSIONS, Senator SCHUMER, Senator HELMS, and Senator LEAHY. There is widespread support for the legislation even though there is some disagreement as to whether the probable cause was adequate for the FISA warrant or some of the other specific statements of fact. 
   This report has been prepared with the exhaustive work of Mr. Dobie McArthur. It summarizes in detail what happened on the errors of the Wen Ho Lee investigation. I am circulating it, as I say, with a Dear Colleague letter to Senators. 
   I think it is an important matter. It has been cleared by the Department of Justice and other agencies so that it does not contain any classified information. It can be found at my Senate website: www.Senate.gov/ Specter. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Dear Colleague letter and the executive summary be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate takes up the nominations of Ms. Marsha Berzon and also Judge Richard A. Paez. These nominations have been pending in the Judiciary Committee for a considerable period of time. I supported both of those nominees in moving them to the floor from the Judiciary Committee. 
   Ms. Berzon has an outstanding record academically and as a practicing lawyer. She received her bachelor's degree from Harvard and Radcliffe colleges in 1966. She received her J.D. degree, doctorate of law, from the University of California, Boalt Hall School of Law in 1973. Thereafter, she clerked for Ninth Circuit Judge James R. Browning and then for Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan. 
   She has been in the practice of law since 1975 and most recently, from 1978 to the present time, with the firm of Altshuler, Berzon, Nussbaum, Berzon & Rubin, where she has had a very active litigation practice. She argued four cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, which is a large number of cases for a practicing lawyer to have before the Supreme Court. 
   That kind of appellate practice is a strong indicator of her preparation for work as an appellate court judge on the Ninth Circuit to which she has been nominated. 
   There have been objections raised to Ms. Berzon on ideological grounds. It is my view that this kind of a challenge ought not to be a basis for defeating a nomination to the Federal court. 
   She has opposed as a personal matter the death penalty, as many nominees do on a personal level, but has stated her willingness to follow the law in imposing the death penalty. 
   She has been supported by many police organizations, which I ordinarily would not mention except that the challenge has been made to her qualifications based upon her opposition to the death penalty. 
   I think it appropriate to note that she has been supported by a number of law enforcement organizations, including the National Association of Police Organizations, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the International Union of Police Associations, and the Los Angeles County Professional Police Officers Association. 
   I have attended the hearings on Ms. Berzon, which have been very detailed. I recall one day the hearing was interrupted. We came to the floor to vote and later continued the hearing in one of the Appropriations Committee rooms. On the basis of that hearing and her familiarity with the law and her extensive practice, especially her appellate practice, I believe she is qualified to be confirmed for the Ninth Circuit. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support her. 
   Judge Richard Paez is also on the list for confirmation. Judge Paez brings a distinguished record. He is a graduate of Brigham Young University where he received his Bachelor's degree in 1969; a graduate from Boalt Hall, University of California at Berkeley in 1972; worked for the California Rural Legal Assistance as a staff attorney from 1972 to 1974; took on work for the next 2 years for the Western Center on Law and Poverty as a staff attorney; and from 1976 to 1981 was with the Legal Aid Foundation. 
   Those are tough jobs, not high-paying jobs. I know from my work as district attorney of Philadelphia where I saw public defenders work--did a volunteer stint many years ago in the public defender's office--I know the pay in those positions and I know the nature of the work. It is a real contribution. 
   From 1981 to 1994, Richard Paez was a judge on the Los Angeles municipal court, and from July of 1994 until the present time, he has been a U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. 
   A number of objections have been raised to Judge Paez. One, that he made a speech in 1995 where he criticized a couple of initiatives in California: Initiative 187, on benefits to illegal aliens; and a second, No. 209 on affirmative action. 
   I don't think a judge gives up his right to freedom of speech when he is on the bench. It could be said it would be a little more prudent not to speak on matters that might come before the court. But if the matter does come before the court, there are many other  judges who can undertake the litigation matter on recusal. Even if Judge Paez had not spoken up on the matters and had such strongly held views, that probably would have been an appropriate matter for recusal in any event. I don't think speaking up on those matters is a burden or inappropriate for his judicial duties. Again, it might be better not to do that, but it is not a disqualifier. 
   Objections have been raised on two matters where he refused to dismiss a case brought against Unocal involving charges of abuse of human rights in Bosnia--a pretty tough standard to get a case dismissed on a preliminary motion. There again, not a weighty matter which would warrant disqualification. 
   An issue was raised at him being a municipal court judge handling a case involving Operation Rescue where there was an issue of whether he stormed off the bench or simply called a recess for a cooling off period, and some issue as to how he treated people in the audience who were waving Bibles, an issue of whether he threatened to take the Bibles away. 
   Again, I think the aggregate of these three matters are not sufficient to rise to the level of disqualification. 
   There is one matter which concerns me and that was a plea bargain which Judge Paez handled on a case involving John Huang. I have reviewed that matter in some substantial detail on the notes of testimony, of the sentencing, and of the Government's brief filed on the downward departure and believe that the Government did not present all the evidence, all the materials which should have been presented at the John Huang sentencing. I have discussed the matter with Judge Paez by telephone. 
   There has been a pattern on plea bargains where the Department of Justice has, in my judgment, not done the vigorous, forceful work that a prosecutor ought to do in the plea bargain. One of 
   those cases involves Dr. Peter Lee, where there were serious charges of espionage. I went to California and talked to the Chief Judge Hatter out there about that case and found there was insufficient information presented to Judge Hatter. I mention that because it is a parallel to the case involving John Huang with Judge Paez. 
   The Judiciary oversight subcommittee, which I chair, is looking into the Huang plea bargain, as we are looking into the Dr. Peter Lee plea bargain, as we shall look into other campaign finance matters, including the probation of Charlie Trie in the campaign finance case, and the probation of Johnny Chung in a campaign finance case. However, there were very serious matters which were not presented to Judge Paez. The essence of the complaint filed by the Department of Justice involved only $7,500 of illegal campaign contributions, and an obtuse, obscure reference in the Government's brief to a figure of $156,000 for the period covered by the conspiracy, which lasted from 1992 to 1994. 
   What the Government did not bring forward was information disclosed by the Governmental Affairs Committee that John Huang was involved in soliciting $1.6 million which was returned by the Democratic National Committee. In that was a $250,000 contribution from a John H. Lee, a South Korean businessman, which Huang collected, knowing that Lee was a foreign national, and also the Huang solicitation for arranging for Ted Sioeng, a foreign businessman, with connections I will not describe on the Senate floor, which should have been called to Judge Paez's attention. 
   After reviewing the records in the case, the notes of testimony at sentencing, and what was made available in the Government's memorandum, none of these matters were called to Judge Paez's attention. 
   I have made a request of Judge Paez, as I made a request of Chief Judge Hatter in the Dr. Peter Lee case, to examine the presentence report. That is customarily a confidential matter, but Judge Paez said on a showing of cause after notification of the parties, that might be made available to the Judiciary subcommittee on oversight. 
   I make these references to Judge Paez on this state of the record, and we are continuing to make the inquiries as to what the Government put on as to John Huang, but there is nothing on this record which suggests that Judge Paez knew of these other factors, which I think would have warranted a very different and a much more substantial sentence, just as I think had Chief Judge Hatter been informed about the details of Dr. Peter Lee, there would have been a different sentence in that espionage case. 
   These matters are now ripe for decision by the Senate. There has been some suggestion of a further investigation on this matter, but when Judge Paez's nomination has been pending since January of 1996, and all of the factors on the record demonstrate it was the Government's failure, the failure of the Department of Justice to bring these matters to the attention of Judge Paez and on the record, he has qualifications to be confirmed. I do intend, on this state of the record, to support his confirmation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my support for the nomination of Julio M. Fuentes to be a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   I recently had the opportunity to meet Judge Fuentes when he came before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his nomination hearing on February 22nd. At that time, I questioned the Judge on his experience and credentials for the bench and was persuaded that he will be able to meet the great challenge of serving on the Third Circuit. 
   Judge Fuentes has had a distinguished legal career. He earned his law  degree from the State University of New York in Buffalo in 1975. He then entered the practice of law in New Jersey and continued to practice for 7 years. While he was practicing, Mr. Fuentes was appointed to be a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, where he served from 1979 to 1987. In 1987, Judge Fuentes was appointed to the New Jersey Superior Court, where he has served until the present day. 
   His 20-plus years on the state bench have given Judge Fuentes a strong judicial background that will serve him well on the Third Circuit. Many of the issues that Judge Fuentes will encounter on the federal bench, from criminal law to torts to contracts, are ones with which he will be well acquainted from his time on the state bench. Other issues before the federal courts, such as antitrust and securities cases, will be new to Judge Fuentes. But I am confident that his experience has given him the skills and temperament needed to tackle these issues. 
   The Third Circuit is a prestigious court with a proud history. It has a tremendous volume of very high-powered litigation. I wish Judge Fuentes a long and productive career in this most important position.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation which would correct procedures under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I offer this bill on behalf of Senator TORRICELLI, Senator THURMOND, Senator BIDEN, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator HELMS, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator SESSIONS. 
   This is legislation which is designed to correct a very pressing problem. This bill refines the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to enable the appropriate investigations of espionage to avoid the very serious mistakes which were made during the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. The references to Dr. Lee's investigation are made only for the purpose of illustrating the procedural problems which this legislation is designed to correct. The determination as to whether or not Mr. Wen Ho Lee is guilty will remain for the court of competent jurisdiction where he has been indicted. 
   There was information released into the public domain at Mr. Lee's bail hearing which underscores the tremendous importance of this particular case. Dr. Stephen Younger, assistant laboratory director for nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, testified at Dr. Lee's bail hearing on December 13, 1999, and said:  
   These codes and their associated databases and the input file, combined with someone that knew how to use them, could, in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global strategic balance.  
   It is hard to have any item of greater importance than changing the global strategic balance. 
   Dr. Younger further testified:  
   They enable the possessor to design the only objects that could result in the military defeat of America's conventional forces..... They represent the gravest possible security risk to ..... the supreme national interest.  
   Again, it is hard to find more forceful language as to the seriousness of this particular matter than the potential military defeat of America's conventional forces. 
   During the course of this investigation, there were very serious time lapses while the FBI sought to get a warrant on Dr. Lee under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The FBI made the FISA request in June of 1997. It was refused by the Department of Justice on August 12, 1997, and then FBI Director Freeh sent FBI Assistant Director John Lewis to talk personally to Attorney General Reno. Attorney General Reno then appointed a Department of Justice subordinate named Daniel Seikaly, who reviewed the matter and rejected it. Attorney General Reno, as she conceded in testimony presented to the Judiciary Committee on June 8, 1999, did not follow up on the matter, leaving this very important request rejected. 
   The proposed legislation would require that when the Director of the FBI makes a request for a FISA warrant that the Attorney General personally must make the decision as to whether the FISA warrant request should be submitted to the court for action. The legislation further provides that when the Attorney General declines to submit the FISA application to the court, the rejection must be in writing. This would give the FBI Director a roadmap, so to speak, as to what additional information is necessary to have the warrant request submitted to the court. 
   After the Department of Justice declined to submit the FISA warrant to the court, the FBI investigation of the case was inactive for some 16 months. It took from August of 1997 to December of 1997 for the FBI Headquarters to send a letter regarding the FISA request to the FBI Albuquerque Field Office, where it lay dormant until November of 1998. From the time the FISA application was not forwarded to the court to the time the FBI office in Albuquerque finally acted, some 16 months elapsed. These 16 months were very crucial with respect to the activities of Dr. Lee. 
   This legislation further provides that when the Attorney General rejects a FISA application in writing, the Director of the FBI has the obligation to personally supervise the matter. 
   The Department of Energy then initiated a polygraph of Dr. Lee, in a very unusual way, that has since been criticized by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The Department of Energy represented that Dr. Lee passed the polygraph when, in fact, he had not. The Secretary of Energy even made an announcement on national television to the effect that Dr. Lee had passed the polygraph when, in fact, he had not. That threw the FBI off course, thinking that a passed polygraph exonerated the suspect. This legislation provides that an agency such as the Department of Energy may not take action on a polygraph, that these matters are to be left to the FBI, which has the paramount authority to investigate these matters. 
   The FBI then conducted another polygraph, but not until February 10, 1999, some 6 weeks after the polygraph he allegedly passed. Even though Dr. Lee failed this second polygraph, no action was taken to terminate Dr. Lee until March 8. In the interim, he deleted many of the files that are in issue. These deletions took place on January 20, February 9, 11, 12, and 17, all to the potential prejudice of the United States. Dr. Lee did not have a search warrant executed until April 9, which is a very long lapse before any official action had been taken. 
   The legislation further provides that when a suspect is left in place for the purpose of the investigation, the FBI must make this request in writing and that to that agency. The agency, such as the Department of Energy, must then formulate a plan within 30 days to structure how that suspect will be left in place while minimizing the exposure of classified information to that person. 
   One of the reasons given by the Department of Justice in declining to go forward with the FISA application was that Dr. Lee was not ``currently engaged'' in objectionable activities--to use mild words. This bill changes that requirement to probable cause on the totality of the circumstances. 
   That is a brief summary of what this legislation would do. It is the view of the sponsors of this bill that it is very important 
   for it to move forward so that on pending espionage investigations we do not have the lapses that occurred in this very important case. 
   I am pleased to note that all the members of the Judiciary Subcommittee have joined in cosponsoring this legislation. I thank my colleague, Senator TORRICELLI, for his cooperation. Senator THURMOND, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator SESSIONS have all cosponsored among the Republican members, as have Senators FEINGOLD and SCHUMER, in addition to Senator TORRICELLI. Senator BIDEN was consulted specially and is a cosponsor because he was the author of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act back in 1978. Senator HELMS has asked to be added as a cosponsor, which he has. 
   The subcommittee has had some substantial difficulty in ``birth'' pains; it has not really been born, to the extent that the subcommittee has not been funded. We have worked really from our own personal staffs. We have had three fellows and one detailee. We have completed a very lengthy detailed report, some 65 pages, which is the product of extraordinary work by Mr. Doman McArthur of my staff, in collaboration with Senator TORRICELLI's staff and the staffs of others. We have gone through the 65-page report with a fine-tooth comb to be sure that it is precise, exact, and does not make any disclosures as to any classified information. 
   The subcommittee has deferred holding hearings on the Wen Ho Lee matter, which had been scheduled for December, at the specific request of Director Freeh. Director Freeh met with TORRICELLI and myself and requested that the hearings on Dr. Lee not go forward substantively, which might cause some problem with the pending prosecution. We do have hearings scheduled on the legislation for March 7, 8 and 21. I have already informed FBI Director Freeh of our intentions to proceed with those hearings, which will be on the substance as to how the act should be reformed. We have given notice to Director Freeh that we would appreciate his presence as a witness. He has said he would be glad to attend. 
   That is a very brief statement of a very complex matter. It is my hope we will have the final clearance from the  Department of Justice to be able to file the full 65-page report which will elaborate upon the brief summary which I have presented. 
   I am delighted to yield to my very distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator TORRICELLI, the ranking member of the subcommittee.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the 50th anniversary of Dr. Hilary Koprowski's feeding a child the very first dose of oral polio vaccine, I am pleased to offer this tribute so that America and the world can know more about this extraordinarily distinguished scientist. I have come to know Dr. Koprowski as a friend, a counselor and a constituent. The world owes Dr. Koprowski an enormous debt of gratitude for his scientific achievements as he will celebrate on February 27, 2000 the 50th anniversary of the first application of his oral polio vaccine. 
   Vaccination of children in the United States, and mass vaccination trials with oral vaccine in Africa and Poland, paved the way for the eradication of paralytic polio in the Americas since 1991 and, hopefully, the elimination of polio from the rest of the world this year. Prior to the discovery of the oral vaccine, polio, a crippling disease, claimed numerous victims throughout the world. In the period from 1951 through 1953, here in the United States, 26 cases of polio were recorded for every 100,000 people. 
   Dr. Hilary Koprowski is one of the most distinguished and respected biomedical researchers in the world recognized for his many achievements including the development of the first oral polio vaccine, in 1950, and the development of the genetically engineered oral rabies vaccine used all over the world. Dr. Koprowski pioneered the development of monoclonal antibodies for the detection and treatment of cancer. Dr. Koprowski continues his important work on gene-related vaccine using his wide scientific experience and profound scientific knowledge combined with strong organizational insight. Dr. Koprowski is the Director of the Biotechnology Foundation Laboratories and the Center for Neurovirology at Thomas Jefferson University and is Professor Laureate at the Wistar Institute. From 1957 to 1991, as Director, Dr. Koprowski led the Wistar Institute, where he is currently on the Board, to become one of the nation's leading biomedical research institutions with a staff of more than 600 people. 
   Dr. Koprowski is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences and twenty-eight other learned institutions. He is a recipient of more than  eighteen major awards, including the Order of the Lion, awarded by the King of Belgium, the Legion of Honor of France and the Nicolaus Copernicus Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1990, he received the most prestigious honor of his home city, the Philadelphia Award. He is the author or co-author of more than 850 scientific papers. 
   In addition to his truly outstanding career in medicine, Dr. Koprowski holds degrees in Music from the Warsaw Conservatory as well as the Santa Cecilia Academy of Music in Rome. His compositions are published and are currently being played by various orchestras. 
   His biography, ``Listening to Music'', by Roger Voughan, was recently published by Springer-Verlag.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator HARKIN and myself, I am introducing legislation captioned the Medical Error Reduction Act of 2000. This legislation is introduced in response to a report from the Institute of Medicine which shows a very high death rate as a result of errors in hospitals. 
   The statistics show that the death rate from errors in hospitals may be as high as 98,000 people. A chart has been prepared demonstrating that at the 98,000 figure, which is the uppermost estimate, medical errors are the fifth  leading cause of death in the United States, problems which certainly need to be addressed. 
   The legislation we are proposing follows a hearing which our Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education conducted on December 13, 1999, and also a hearing conducted on January 25, 2000, in conjunction with the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Our legislation has input--not support, but input--taking into account concerns from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, the American Psychological Association, and others. 
   The core provisions of the bill will provide for 15 competitively awarded research demonstration projects to make a determination of the scope of medical errors and the ways to correct these medical errors systemically. Five of these demonstrations will have a mandatory reporting requirement with confidentiality when there is a medical error. Five of these demonstration projects will have a voluntary reporting program with confidentiality, and five of these demonstration projects will have a mandatory reporting requirement and also a mandate that the patient and/or the family be notified of the error. 
   This, we think, is fundamental in terms of the professional responsibility of a doctor and the professional responsibility of a hospital to notify the injured party where error has occurred. Parenthetically, a similar obligation, I believe, is incumbent upon professionals generally. 
   The legislation has further provisions for the studies to be conducted in a way to make a determination as to what is feasible on hand-held prescription pads and on other technical devices which will look to the system's errors which are encapsulated and encompassed in hospitals and medical care. 
   On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report, ``To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The report concluded that medical mistakes have led to numerous injuries and deaths, affecting an estimated three to four percent of all hospital patients. The IOM report also concluded that health care is a decade or more behind other high-risk industries in its attention to ensuring basic safety. 
   According to the IOM, at least 44,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors, and the number may be as high as 98,000. We must put this statistic into perspective, as noted in this chart: at 98,000 deaths per year, medical errors are catapulted into the ranking of fifth leading cause of death nationwide. This total outnumbers deaths from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, and AIDS. Further, medical errors resulting in injury are estimated to cost the nation between $17 billion and $29 billion, including additional health care costs, lost income, lost household production, and disability costs. 
   The IOM findings are startling and beg for national attention to determine ways to reduce the number of medical errors. We have all heard and read media reports detailing the case of Betsy Lehman, a health reporter for the Boston Globe, who died from a chemotherapy overdose; or the tragedy of Willie King, who had the wrong leg amputated in a Florida hospital. Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases. 
   On December 13, 1999, I chaired a hearing of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee to hear details of IOM's report findings. On January 25, 2000, I chaired a joint Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee/Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing to consider mandatory and voluntary reporting requirements and to begin to determine ways to reduce medical errors. Today, Senator HARKIN and I are introducing legislation that seeks to find solutions to the problem of medical errors. This legislation was developed based on our hearings and with input from many health groups and experts in the field, including the American Hospital Association; American Medical Association; American Nurses Association; Institute for Safe Medication Practices; American Psychological Association; Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences; American Osteopathic Association; Association of American Medical Colleges; American Association of Health Plans; Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania; and Iowa Hospital Association. It is our hope that we can continue to work together to reduce the number of injuries and deaths related to medical mistakes. 
   Let me review the key provisions of this bill. It would: 
   Make grants available to states so they can establish their own error reporting systems and collect data to provide to Federal researchers. The compilation of such data will help researchers understand trends in errors and determine ways to reduce them. 
   Require the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in conjunction with the 
   Health Care Financing Administration, to establish 15 competitively-awarded research demonstration projects throughout the nation, in geographically diverse areas, to assess the causes of medical errors and determine ways to reduce those errors. 
   Facilities participating in these demonstrations will be required to employ appropriate technologies to reduce the probability of future errors. Such technologies might include hand-held electronic prescription pads, training simulators for medical education, and bar-coding of prescription drugs and patient bracelets. 
   Facilities participating in the demonstrations will also provide staff training to reduce the number of errors, and encourage prompt review of errors to determine ways to prevent them from recurring. 
   Of the 15 facilities who choose to participate in the demonstrations, 5 will have a mandatory reporting requirement of all medical errors to HHS, 5 will have a voluntary reporting requirement to HHS, and 5 will have a mandatory reporting requirement to HHS as well as to the patient and/or his family. 
   Require the Secretary of HHS to provide information to all patients who participate in Federally-funded health care programs, educating them on ways to reduce medical errors. Require the Secretary to develop patient education programs to encourage all patients to take a more active role in their healthcare. 
   Make grants available to health professional associations and other organizations to provide training and continuing education in order to reduce medical errors. 
   Require the Secretary to report to the Congress within 180 days of enactment on the costs of implementing a program that identifies factors that reduce medical errors, including computerized health care systems. Require the Secretary to report on the results of the fifteen health system demonstration projects, focusing on best practices and costs/benefits of applying these practices nationally. 
   Mr. President, patients must have confidence that when they seek medical treatment, they will receive the highest quality health care in the world. They should not be fearful of injuries or even death due to medical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine panel projected that with current knowledge and with implementation of medical error reduction methods that are proven to work, we can achieve no less than a 50 percent reduction in medical errors over the next five years. I believe that the research efforts authorized by this legislation will allow us to far exceed this goal, and immeasurably improve patient safety. I think my colleagues will agree that America has zero tolerance for preventable medical mistakes, and that we should act immediately to prevent further deaths and injuries. 
   I yield to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this morning President Clinton announced the budget for the administration for fiscal year 2001. It has a large number of new programs and has a very substantial increase in spending, up to $1.835 trillion. In examining the budget as to its applicability to the Departments of Labor, Health, Human Services and Education on items which I chair, the appropriations subcommittee, I am concerned about the number of new programs. 
   On Education, there are 19 new programs. In the Department of Labor, there are nine new programs. It is a matter of concern when the President proposes programs which have mandates directing the local school districts as to what they should be doing without giving discretion to local school districts as to specific needs which they might have which might be in a somewhat different category. For example, this year the 19 new programs will increase expenditures by $2 billion 951 million--almost $3 billion. Let's put it that way, round it up a little bit. 
   Within these programs, there is a new program for school renovation of $1.3 billion. While there may be some merit to that specific kind of program, it may well be that the local school district could better use that money, depending upon local needs, for matters such as a science program, for laboratory equipment, for computers, for teacher training depending upon what the needs are in the local school district. 
   Last year, we had a considerable amount of controversy on the President's program for new teachers, a commendable objective, but it may well be that there are many school districts where the needs for some alternative programs are more pressing there. So I express a concern about the budget with its increased spending up to $1.835 trillion, and the mandate of a great many new programs which have not been authorized by the appropriate authorizing committees in the Congress. 
   When it comes to the question of paying for these programs, the President has proposed raising the caps by some $62 billion, but it is highly questionable whether that raise in the caps will accommodate all the programs which he has proposed. I think there is agreement between the Congress and the administration that Social Security and Medicare have to be kept inviolate and that there not be expenditures which would threaten Social Security. 
   On the face and on the figures, the President's budget does not invade Social Security, but there is the lurking possibility that Social Security could be invaded with the tremendous number of new programs which the President has proposed. 
   Last year, when the President came forward with his budget, he had proposals for some $18 billion in offsets: Federal tobacco revenues of $6 billion, FAA user fees of $1 billion, and so on, down to some $18 billion, none of which materialized. So when we take a look at the President's proposed offsets, we have to take them with more than a grain of salt as to whether they ever will materialize. 
   The President has proposed this year to have offsets for penalties for tobacco companies where they fail to live up to the reduction on teenage smoking. The administration's budget will cut youth smoking in half by charging the tobacco industry an assessment for every underage smoker, with an estimated penalty of $3,000 for each underage smoker. It does not pick up until some of the out years. 
   This is an illustration of where the President is proposing alleged cuts which may well never materialize. 
   There is one item where the Clinton administration budget is not adequately funded, and that is for the National Institutes of Health. In 1997, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution called for a doubling of the NIH budget over a 5-year period. 
   During the course of the last 3 years, very substantial advances have been made on funding for the National Institutes of Health, although we are not quite yet on target. That has been a  real battle because although the Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in 1997 calling for doubling within 5 years, when the issue has come before the budget resolution on amendments sponsored by Senator HARKIN, who is the ranking Democrat, and myself as chairman of the relevant appropriations subcommittee, those increases in funding have been rejected. But with a sharp pencil and with very substantial help from staff on allocation of funding, we have succeeded in increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health by more than $5 billion over the last 3 years. 
   Three years ago, the Senate passed an increase of $950 million. It was pared down somewhat in conference to $907 million. Two years ago, we increased NIH funding by some $2 billion, and last year we increased National Institutes of Health funding by $2.3 billion. 
   It is true the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. In fact, it may be the only jewel of the Federal Government. This year, with a long list of cosponsors who are being added incrementally each day--and I expect quite a few more by the end of the day, and more even before Senator HARKIN, the principal cosponsor, and I offer this for a budget resolution--we are proposing an increase in funding of $2.7 billion, which is the minimal amount necessary to keep funding for the National Institutes of Health on a track to approximate the goal of doubling NIH funding over the 5-year period. 
   In addition to Senator HARKIN and myself, we have cosponsorship by Senator MACK, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator FRIST, Senator SCHUMER, Senator COLLINS, Senator DEWINE, Senator SARBANES, and Senator HUTCHINSON. The advances which have been made by NIH over the course of the past several years have truly been astounding with the projection that Parkinson's may be on the verge of being solved within a 5-year period, enormous advances on Alzheimer's, enormous advances on a variety of cancer problems--breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer--enormous advances on heart disease. As a capital investment in the health of America, there is no better investment. As a capital investment for cutting costs for Medicare and Medicaid, there is no better investment. 
   Last year, the Clinton administration proposed an increase of some $300 million which was far under the mark. That was raised by Congress to $2.3 billion and signed into law by the President. 
   This year, I think, noting the strong congressional support, the administration has proposed an increase of $1 billion in NIH funding, but that, too, is short of the mark on meeting the objective of doubling NIH funding within a 5-year period. 
   I have sought recognition today to submit, with my distinguished colleague Senator HARKIN, an important resolution calling for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health, to keep us on track to double NIH funding by 2002. Specifically, the resolution which we are offering today calls for the fiscal year 2001 Budget Resolution to include an additional $2.7 billion in the health account, to be allocated for biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. 
   As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, I have said many times that the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal government. We all remain enthralled by the advances realized by the National Institutes of Health, which has spawned innumerable breakthroughs in our knowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, severe mental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and many others. It is clear that a substantial investment in the NIH is crucial to allow the continuation of these advances into the next decade. 
   On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate resolution submitted by our distinguished colleague, Senator MACK, which stated that funding for the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over five years. Regrettably, even though that resolution was passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, when the budget resolution was considered on the Senate floor, the appropriate health account had a reduction of $100 million. That led to the introduction of an amendment to the resolution by myself and Senator HARKIN. We sought to add in $1.1 billion to carry out the expressed sense of the Senate. Our amendment, however, was defeated 63-37. We were extremely disappointed that while the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, they were simply unwilling to put up the actual dollars to accomplish this vital goal. 
   The following year, during debate on the fiscal year 1999 Budget Resolution, Senator HARKIN and I again introduced an amendment which called for a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, and which provided sufficient resources in the budget to accomplish this. While we gained more support on this vote than in the previous year, our amendment was again defeated, this time by a vote of 57-41. Not to be deterred, Senator HARKIN and I again went to work with our Subcommittee and we were able, by making economies and establishing priorities, to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account for fiscal year 1999, which at the time was the largest increase in history. 
   Most recently, for fiscal year 2000, Senator HARKIN and I again introduced an amendment to the Budget Resolution which would have added $1.4 billion to the health accounts, over and above the $600 million which had been already been provided by the Budget Committee. Despite this amendment's defeat by a vote of 47-52, we were able to provide, through the maximization of our limited resources, a $2.3 billion increase for fiscal year 2000--truly an historic accomplishment. 
   In 1981, when I was first elected to the Senate, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion; for fiscal year 2000, it is $17.9 billion, a 95% inflation-adjusted increase. Through several years and several Subcommittee Chairs--Senator Weicker, Senator CHILES, Senator HARKIN, and myself--the budgets were always tight and frequently faced Administration-proposed cuts. Still, we managed to increase NIH funding tremendously. This resolution seeks to reiterate the intent of the Senate to double our investment in the National Institutes of Health: we must provide $2.7 billion to stay on track to reach that goal. I believe that this goal can be achieved if we make the proper allocation of our resources. 
   Our investment has resulted in tremendous advances in medical research. A new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in HIV infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. The human genome is on track to be 90 percent mapped by this spring, and fully sequenced by 2003. We are seeing the advent of a relatively new field of pharmacogenomics, which seeks to solve whether there is something about an individual's genetic instructions which prevent them from metabolizing a particular drugs as intended. In essence, drugs may soon be designed to fit the patient's genetic makeup. I anxiously await the results of all of these avenues of remarkable research. 
   I, like millions of Americans, have benefitted tremendously from the investment we have made in the National Institutes of Health. But to continue that commitment takes actual dollars, not just the discussion of dollars. That is why we offer this resolution today--to call upon the Budget Committee to add $2.7 billion to the health accounts so we can carry forward the important work of the National Institutes of Health.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution along with 25 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 2000, as ``Greek Independence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' 
   One hundred and seventy-nine years ago, the Greeks began the revolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return Greece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient Greeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks *.*.* we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, then, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return to that democratic tradition. 
   The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of the many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient Greeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to the United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science and law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make valuable contributions to American society, business, and government. 
   It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate will serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with whom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar resolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, with overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a distinguished Pennsylvanian, the librarian from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, Mr. Yongyi Song, who was greeted tumultuously in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon when he returned from the People's Republic of China after having been held in custody there since August 7. 
   Mr. Yongyi Song came to the United States some 10 years ago and has become a world-renowned scholar on the Cultural Revolution. In addition to his regular duties at Dickinson College, he has published extensively on the Cultural Revolution. 
   Last August, he and his wife Helen made a trip to the People's Republic of China so that he could continue his research. While there, he was taken into custody on August 7. Thereafter, his wife was released, but on Christmas Eve he was charged with transmitting state secrets. 
   A careful analysis of the case raises very severe questions as to whether there was ever any substance to the charges. A campaign was waged by scholars and academicians and by colleges and universities across the land to obtain his release. Dickinson College retained a very distinguished attorney, Jerome Cohen, an expert in Chinese affairs, who took up the cause. 
   A resolution was submitted last Wednesday by this Senator with quite a number of cosponsors--Senator BIDEN, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, being the principal cosponsor; in addition, Senator SANTORUM and others. 
   After consultation with Secretary of State Albright and others in the State Department, I sought a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador, which I had last Friday late in the morning. 
   Before going to the meeting, I heard rumors that Yongyi Song might be released. While I met with the Chinese Ambassador, I was delighted to find that he handed me a piece of paper announcing Mr. Song's release, and gave me the word that Mr. Song would soon be on a Northwest airliner headed for Detroit, and ultimately for Philadelphia. 
   We thank the People's Republic of China and we thank the Chinese Ambassador for Mr. Yongyi Song's release. We regret that he ever was taken into custody. But when he returned and commented to the news media, on a galaxy of cameras--both television and still cameras--and to many newspaper reporters, Mr. Song commented that he was not physically abused. He said he was subjected to a good bit of mental torture. He disputed the representations by the People's Republic of China that he had confessed or implicated others. But as Shakespeare would say, ``All's well that ends well.'' 
   It has been reported that this is the first time there has been a release of anybody who was charged with stealing state secrets. It is my hope that this is a significant step forward for the People's Republic of China to recognize human rights. In an era when the People's Republic of China is seeking permanent most-favored-nation status and seeking entry into the World Trade Organization, it is my hope that they will accept at least minimal norms for due process, so that if someone is taken into custody, that person is entitled to confer with counsel, should be entitled to notice of the charges, should be entitled to an open trial, and should have the requirement that evidence be presented in an open forum before any determination of guilt. 
   The detention of Mr. Yongyi Song from August 7 until January 28, in my judgment, was excessive. But we are glad to have Yongyi Song back at his duties at Dickinson College and glad this has ended favorably. We do hope this is a first step in a continuing recognition by the People's Republic of China to give appropriate consideration to human rights.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to send to the desk, on behalf of Senator HARKIN and myself, a bill captioned the ``Stem Cell Research Act of 2000.'' It is being introduced after a series of four hearings, which have been conducted in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, which I chair and on which Senator HARKIN is the ranking Democrat. 
   The subject has been a very important one because approximately 15 months ago, there were disclosures about stem cell research which provided an opportunity for a veritable fountain of youth. The scientific discoveries have found that from the stem cells, new cells may be created which have the potential to cure a great many severe maladies. For example, on Parkinson's disease, stem cells are enormously helpful. There is potential for cures on Alzheimer's, on heart ailments, and really on the whole range of human ailments, illnesses, and diseases. 
   There has been a limiting factor on the use of stem cells because of a provision, which was inserted many years ago into the appropriations bill for our subcommittee, which limits Federal funding on research relating to stem cells. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services has handed down a ruling which would permit federal scientists to conduct research on stem cells that have been derived by private sources. 
   The concern has been that the human embryo, subjected to scientific research, would potentially destroy life. The fact is that the only human embryos which are used as a basis for stem cell research are human embryos from discarded in vitro fertilization clinics. It is not a matter of using a human embryo which has the potentiality for life to extract the stem cells because these are embryos which have been discarded. 
   Notwithstanding the legal opinion handed down by the general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services, it is our view that there are still undue restrictions on scientific research from existing law. That is why this legislation has been introduced. It will eliminate the ban on the use of Federal funding for the research on stem cells. 
   There are a number of very important restrictions. 
   First, the research would not apply to the creation of human embryos for research purposes. 
   Second, the research would not result in the cloning of a human being. 
   Third, it would be unlawful for any person receiving Federal funds to knowingly acquire, receive, or transfer any human embryos for valuable consideration, even if the transfer affected interstate commerce. 
   These limitations have been engrafted into the legislation to be sure this kind of inappropriate conduct is being prohibited. 
   The legal opinion issued by the Department of Health and Human Services covers the statutory prohibition on the use of funds, stating that human embryo research would not apply to research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells because such stem cells do not constitute a human embryo. However, applying the Federal funding solely to pluripotent stem cells is not sufficient because there ought to be an opportunity for broader research, as I have suggested. 
   The controversy on stem cell research is very similar to the controversy which had existed on prohibiting research on fetal tissue when many people advanced the argument that it would induce abortions to secure fetal tissue. It soon became readily apparent that the research on fetal tissue was from discarded fetal tissue and that, in fact, there would not be an inducement of abortions to produce fetal tissue for research purposes. That is very similar, almost identical, except for what is involved with the issue of human embryos. Human embryos which will not be used for research for stem cells where there is any possibility that they might produce life and may be used only from discarded embryos, similarly to the discarded fetal tissue. 
   When the appropriations bill was considered last fall, a provision was inserted into the committee report which would eliminate the prohibition of use of funds for research on stem cells. When it became apparent that this provision would likely stall the progress of the appropriations bill, an agreement was reached to remove that provision in committee before the bill got to the floor under an arrangement with our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, who agreed to bring up the legislation as a freestanding bill. That is the legislation Senator HARKIN and I are introducing today. 
   We intend to have an additional hearing within the next several weeks so that the stage will be set by late February or early March to proceed with the schedule of this bill as a freestanding measure and so that the Senate may vote up or down and the House of Representatives may ultimately have an opportunity to vote as well. 
   Over the past 14 months, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Subcommittee which I chair, held four hearings, the latest on November 4, 1999, to discuss the advances in stem cell research made by two research teams. One team, led by Dr. James Thompson at the University of Wisconsin, and the other headed by Dr. John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins University. Stem cell research is one area that holds particular promise for the development of future medical treatment and cures. Stem cells originating in an embryo have the unique ability, for a very limited period of time, to become any cell type of the body. This power, if harnessed by science, could lead to replacement therapies for failing cells, for example, or lead to organ tissues that could be implanted into a patient. Scientists are just beginning preliminary research into the potential practical applications of this line of work. At a Senate hearing convened by my subcommittee on December 2, 1998, Dr. Gearhart testified that he has been able to induce some stem cells to grow into nerve cells. Other scientists also stated that cures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases and illnesses that plague mankind could be greatly accelerated by stem cell research. Some scientists, for example, believe that stem cell research could lead to tangible benefits to Parkinson's Disease patients in as soon as 7 to 10 years. 
   What has been delaying the advancement of this new line of research is a provision in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that prohibits research on human embryos. On January 15, 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a legal opinion finding that the statutory prohibition of the use of funds appropriated to HHS for human embryo research would not apply to research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells because such cells do not constitute a human embryo. But even this limited use of stem cells may be blocked by those who misunderstand its purpose. According to Dr. Harold Varmus, the former head of the National Institutes of Health, research on stem cells is not the same as research on human embryos. Stem cells do not have the capacity to develop into a human being. 
   While I applaud the HHS ruling, I do not believe that it goes far enough. To achieve the greatest and swiftest benefits, Federal researchers need their own supply of stem cells. Therefore, I am proposing this legislation to enable Federally-funded researchers to derive their own stem cells from spare embryos obtained from in vitro fertilization clinics. Allowing scientists to conduct human stem cell research would greatly accelerate advances in many avenues of study and, in collaboration with private industry, expedite the production and availability of new drugs and treatments. Enacting such legislation would clarify the boundaries governing Federally-funded researchers and make clear the commitment of this Congress to biomedical research. 
   Let me review the key provisions of this bill: 
   It would amend the Public Health Service Act and give permanent authority to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to conduct, support, or fund research on human embryos only for the purpose of generating stem cells. Human embryonic stem cells may be derived and used in research only from embryos that would otherwise be discarded and donated by in vitro fertilization clinics and only with the written informed consent of the donors. 
   The Secretary shall issue guidelines governing human stem cell research, including definitions and terms used in such research. 
   All Federal research protocols and consent forms involving human pluripotent stem cell research shall be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board. 
   The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report describing the activities carried out under this section during the preceding fiscal year, including whether and to what extent research has been conducted in accordance with this purpose. 
   The following restrictions would apply:

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I will comment briefly about two trips I made over the recess. 
   On December 17, 18, and 19, I traveled to Key West, FL, to observe Coast Guard operations and drug interdiction, and then on to Panama to see the immediate impact of the turnover of the canal to the Panamanian Government, and then on to Colombia, where I had an opportunity to visit with  President Pastrana. President Pastrana, coincidentally, was in Washington today and met with members of the Appropriations Committee. The text that I will submit contains a number of comments about the trip to both Key West and Panama. 
   I did want to make a comment or two about the pending request by the Government of Colombia for funding in excess of $1 billion to fight the narcotics dealers in Colombia. I am sympathetic with their problems and with the grave difficulties they have encountered. I have seen these difficulties firsthand on three visits to Colombia, the first back in 1988. 
   I have substantial reservations about a U.S. expenditure in excess of $1 billion to reduce the supply of narcotics into the United States. I filed a resolution years ago calling for the use of the military in drug curtailment and narcotic interdiction--but as successful as we have been in interdicting narcotics from Latin America and as successful as we have been in having hectares in Peru, Colombia or Bolivia replaced with other crops, the great demand in the United States and worldwide continues, and thus the supply comes back.

   Mr. SPECTER. The thrust of the private relief bill and the concurrent resolution is that they seek relief for Mr. Yongyi Song, who is a librarian at Dickinson College of Carlisle, PA. Mr. Song was detained in Beijing, China, on August 7 of this year and on Christmas Eve was charged with ``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreign institutions.'' 
   Two days ago, the People's Republic of China announced that Yongyi Song had confessed, which I believe is a representation having absolutely no credibility because Mr. Song has been held in detention for months. Any statements made in that context are inherently coercive, intimidating, and really of no validity at all. 
   The facts are that Yongyi Song is a distinguished and noted scholar who has published extensive works about the Cultural Revolution in China and that he had made a trip to the People's Republic of China earlier this year in order to further his academic research. Then he was taken into custody without cause. 
   The resolution that has been filed calls for the People's Republic of China to release Yongyi Song promptly. It calls for the fair treatment of lawyers in the People's Republic of China so they may practice in a decent manner within their judicial system, and it calls for the People's Republic of China to put into practice the reforms in the judicial system which they have, in fact, adopted on paper but are not putting into effect as a matter of practice. 
   The relationship between the United States Government and the People's Republic of China is a complex one. We have seen repeated incidents by China of flagrant disregard for human rights, and this is another instance. By taking Yongyi Song into custody and holding him in detention without charges, and months later--from August 7 until Christmas Eve--finally filing charges, and then the representation of a confession, which legal experts interpret to mean that they have no case and are doing their best to try to fashion some make-way situation is perhaps the lowest ebb of disregard for human rights and for academic freedom. 
   The resolution will be taken up concurrently in the House of Representatives as well. The bill for naturalization will enable the Government of the United States to take stronger action on behalf of Mr. Song. It will enable our State Department officials, for example, to visit with Yongyi Song, may be instrumental in obtaining the right to counsel, and may be instrumental in obtaining the right to observe any trial which is in process. 
   There has been a marked and serious determination in the activities of the People's Republic of China in their criminal justice system.

   Mr. SPECTER. It concerns lawyer Liu Jian who represented the defendant in a criminal case. He found that none of the 37 witnesses he had lined up appeared to testify because of intimidation from the Government. He found himself, a lawyer, in police custody charged with ``illegally obtaining evidence.'' While in custody, he was subjected to beatings and day-long interrogations without food or rest, and he later found his ability to practice law and his license to practice law in jeopardy. 
   It is obviously impossible to have a judicial system that functions without lawyers. The activities of the People's Republic of China have been absolutely reprehensible in this regard. Our resolution calls for relief for Yongyi Song and also calls for an improvement in the judicial system and the treatment of lawyers by the People's Republic of China. 
   Mr. President, this vital legislation would grant Mr. Yongyi Song U.S. citizenship. Mr. Song has been a resident of the United States for the past ten years, has passed his United States citizenship tests, and had been scheduled to be sworn in as a United States citizen in September 1999. However, Mr. Song, a respected researcher and librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, was detained on August 7, 1999, in Beijing, China while collecting historical documents on the Chinese cultural revolution of the 1960's. After 5 months of detention, Mr. Song was formally ``arrested'' on Christmas Eve in China, on charges of ``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreign institutions.'' 
   The People's Republic of China claims Mr. Song violated Chinese criminal law by collecting historical documents. However, the documents in Mr. Song's possession have reportedly been previously published in newspapers, books, and other ``open'' sources. The historical material Mr. Song was gathering in no way threatens the security of the Chinese Government or people. The case of Yongyi Song is an affront to basic human rights, an affront to academic freedom and affront to people around the world. 
   The bill that I am introducing today would waive the oath of allegiance and grant Mr. Song immediate citizenship, as Mr. Song passed the INS naturalization test on June 7, 1999. I believe it is vital that Congress become involved in this case: if Mr. Song were a U.S. citizen, the State Department would be in  a stronger position to insist on being able to see him while he is being detained, insist on monitoring any trial that may occur, and insist on Mr. Song's right to counsel. Further, U.S. citizenship would afford Mr. Song a better chance of being expelled by the Chinese government after the trial, rather than being forced to serve a prison sentence should the Chinese Government convict him in Chinese court. 
   Mr. Song was a young man in China during the Cultural Revolution and now, at age 50, he is languishing in a Chinese jail as a result of trying to study it. Considering the extremely high conviction rate in the Chinese judicial system, it is very probable that Mr. Song will be convicted despite my commitment to an all-out fight for his freedom and innocence. 
   This case presents an international challenge to academic freedom and the pursuit of truth. While private relief legislation is a last resort that should be used sparingly by the Congress, the urgency and the compelling nature of this situation is one that demands immediate and definitive action. I urge my colleagues to support me in this fight for justice.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for 6 years I had the pleasure of working closely with Dr. Harold Varmus, the distinguished Director of the National Institutes of Health. During his tenure as Director, great strides were made in medical research--the continued mapping of the human genome; new generations of AIDS drugs' gene therapy; the remarkable growth of information technology in health research; a strong effort to combat the global spread of infectious diseases; and exciting new scientific opportunities, such as stem cell research, that may one day lead to cures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and diabetes. 
   When I first met Dr. Varmus, I recall being impressed by the force and eloquence with which he advanced the cause of medical research. When he informed me of his intention to leave his post as Director, I could not help but think that NIH would lose one of its most valuable assets. His commitment to raise the level of scientific achievement at the NIH, and the enthusiasm and vigor that he brought to the job will certainly be missed. 
   I have no doubt that in his new position as head of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, Dr. Varmus will stimulate the same high level of excitement and energy as he did at NIH. And while Sloan-Kettering will benefit from his vast knowledge of the biology of cancer, cancer patients there will feel the warmth of his deep compassion. 
   During his tenure as NIH Director, the agency has seen unprecedented funding increases. In 1993, when he assumed the position of Director funding for NIH was $8.9 billion. Under his leadership, the NIH budget has more than doubled to the $17.9 billion. 
   Dr. Varmus was the first Nobel Laureate to serve as NIH Director. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1989 for his work in demonstrating that cancer genes can arise from normal cellular genes. He is an international authority on retro-viruses and the genetic basis for cancer. Prior to coming to NIH, Dr. Varmus was a Professor at the University of California at San Francisco. 
   I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Varmus on his new position and to salute his contribution to the Nation and the cause of medical research. His wise counsel and responsible leadership helped lay the foundation for a research agenda that will have a lasting effect on the lives of millions of people throughout the United States and the world.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999. On Veterans Day, many of the members honored America's veterans and acknowledged our debt to them for their service. This legislation gives the Senate an opportunity to do something tangible to honor our veterans. 
   The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 contains 74 substantive provisions; I refer the Members to the conference report text for a complete description. Let me highlight just a few provisions now. 
   Long-term care for veterans is one of the most pressing issues facing America--and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A half century ago, the 16 million youthful veterans of World War II looked forward to building new civilian lives. Today, only about 6 million survive, and their average age is 75. Health care is their primary concern, the long-term care is a critical component of their health care needs. Simply put, what World War II veterans need from VA is long-term care. Soon, so too will the 4 million Korean war veterans, now in their mid-sixties, and the 8 million Vietnam veterans, now in their fifties, who follow them. 
   Under current law, VA is not required to provide long-term care to any veteran. Such care is purely discretionary to VA; it is supplied on a space available basis only. Under this ``discretionary'' authority--as inadequate as it has been--VA has made a substantial contribution to the long term care needs of veterans--by directly providing (at an annual cost of $1.1 billion) nursing home care to an average of approximately 13,000 veterans per day; by paying for nursing home care received by approximately 6,500 veterans per day in private nursing homes (at as annual cost of $316.8 million); by subsidizing (at an annual cost approximately $200 million per year) nursing home care provided to approximately 14,000 veterans per day in State veterans' homes; and by providing non-institutional alternatives to nursing home care to an average of 11,000 veterans at any given time at an annual cost of $154 million. 
   Notwithstanding these significant contributions by VA, there is increasing evidence that the discretionary nature of VA's long-term care mission has created an incentive for VA to divert resources to other missions and reduce its capacity to provide long-term care. This bill responds to that negative trend by requiring VA to maintain long term capacity at least the 1998 level. In addition, this legislation would, for the first time, require--not authorize--VA to provide nursing home care to veterans who need it to treat service-connected conditions, and to severely service-disabled veterans who need it to cope with other conditions. 
   Nursing home care is the most expensive form of long-term care and, from the veterans' standpoint, the form of care which is to be avoided if possible, or delayed until it is inevitable. This bill will assure that non-institutional alternatives to nursing home care--home-based 
   primary care, home health aide visits, adult day health care, and similar services--will be available to veterans who need such services by requiring that VA include them in the package of medical services to which each veteran who enrolls for VA care is entitled. The provision of such services, as an alternative to much more expensive inpatient nursing home care, will save money and improve aging veterans' lives. 
   This legislation also directs VA to operate pilot programs to identify the best--and most cost-effective--ways to meet veterans' long term needs. Armed with the data generated by these pilot programs, Congress will reevaluate VA nursing home and non-institutional long term care after three years and determine how best to proceed at the four-year ``sunset'' point of this legislation. I might add that the conferees were all in agreement that, when we get to the point where we consider renewal of this legislation, we will be looking for ways to improve it, not to repeal it. 
   There is one additional key feature of this legislation that merits mention: this bill will plug a substantial hole in VA health care coverage by allowing VA to fund the emergency care needs of all enrolled veterans who do not have other health care coverage to fund such care. The President has stated that all Americans should have access to emergency care. This bill assures that veterans who rely on VA for care will. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill will extend, expand, and improve VA's authority to provide counseling to the victims of sexual trauma while on active duty. It will also extend and improve services for homeless veterans; it will liberalize eligibility for survivors' benefits for widows of totally disabled ex-POWs; it will expand benefits available to veterans exposed to radiation while in service; and--importantly--it will ensure that the World War II Veterans' Memorial is constructed in a timely manner by facilitating fund raising for that monument. 
   This legislation does many positive things, particularly for our older veterans. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs, however, must also respond to the needs of veterans who are leaving the service today. Educational assistance is the most important benefit that our Nation provides to young veterans. Earlier this year, the Senate passed legislation which would have substantially improved benefits under the Montgomery GI bill. Unfortunately, budgetary pressures compelled the conferees to set these provisions aside for now. I know, however, that the House supports improvements in Montgomery GI bill benefits, and we will take that issue up again in the second session. 
   This legislation reflects the hard work and dedication of many members of the Senate and the other body. I particularly acknowledge the contribution of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator ROCKEFELLER, and our Committee's longest-serving member and a member of the conference committee, Senator THURMOND. The conference committee could not have reached a successful conclusion without them, or without the energy and commitment of the chairman of the House Committee, BOB STUMP and his ranking member, LANE EVANS. I thank them. And I urge the Senate to approve this conference report.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the pending appropriations bill which includes funding for the three Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor, the subcommittee which I chair for the Appropriations Committee. 
   The legislative process has proceeded to this point in an extraordinary way.  It had been my hope and plan that the bill for my subcommittee would have been taken up by the Congress, passed, and presented to the President in advance of the close of the fiscal year, September 30, but that has not occurred. 
   It had been my hope and plan to present it to the President before the end of the fiscal year so he could have signed it or vetoed it and, had he chosen to veto it, there could have been a public debate on the priorities in the bill and also the key point of having local control on the decision of $1.3 billion, which has been allocated for additional teachers for the reduction of classroom size. 
   Unfortunately, it has been the practice in the Congress in recent years to pass the bills after the close of the fiscal year and in a context where we are going to yield to the President's wishes, subject to a veto, because it may result in the closing down of the Government. Winston Churchill had it right when he said that democracy is a terrible form of government except compared to everything else. I think that would apply to representative democracy as well. Somehow we muddle through. We are in the final stage of the muddling process now. 
   To describe the process to people who are not familiar with the inside of the Senate is very challenging. I was discussing with my son last night the plan to have the Senate convene at 12:01 a.m., November 20, Saturday morning, to take up a cloture motion on the appropriations bill, and then to vote at 1:01 a.m. It was necessary to have the conversation because I had to defer lunch with my 4-year-old granddaughter, Perri, and picking up my 6-year-old granddaughter, Silvi, from school, all of which is fine, but there has to be some reason for that. 
   We have Senators exercising their rights which, to be repetitious, they have a right to do, such as to have bills read for several hours, which does not change the ultimate outcome, or to have cloture votes with these extraordinary scheduling problems. I learned a long time ago that the Senate is a lot smarter than I am and the rules of the Senate are in place for a purpose. 
   As one of our distinguished colleagues said yesterday in a closed caucus, Senators ought not be discouraged from exercising their rights because when they take to the floor and debate, have a filibuster, and have extended discussions for the purpose of acquainting the country with what is going on, perhaps it may arouse some public reaction to perhaps change what the Senate might be doing. 
   So, in essence, I am delighted to see the Senate rules observed and rights to Senators activated. For whatever delay there is, so be it. It is my hope that next year the appropriations bill for my subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education will be completed at an early date. I have talked to our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, and I have had some encouragement that my bill may be taken up first next year, so that priorities can be established in regular course by the subcommittee, the full committee, and the Senate--the same on the House side--then conferenced and presented to the President for his signature or for his veto. If he chooses to veto the bill, so be it. 
   The bill which was voted out of the Senate by a vote of 73-25 had been very carefully crafted on a bipartisan basis with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator TOM HARKIN. I learned a long time ago that if you want to get anything done in Washington 
    in the Senate and the Congress, it has to be bipartisan. Senator HARKIN and I worked through our bill. We had a very attractive bill. We had emphasized $300 million more than the President's figure on education, establishing the priorities which we thought were in order. 
   We had provided very substantial increases to the National Institutes of Health because of the great work done there in looking for cures and being on the verge of cures for very many major maladies. We are within 5 years striking distance, so the experts say, on Parkinson's and have made great progress on Alzheimer's and heart disease and cancer--prostate cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer. 
   We picked a figure of $93.7 billion because we thought that would attract very substantial bipartisan support, that being $300 million higher in education than the President had, that it would qualify for a President's signature. 
   Regrettably, the House of Representatives did not pass the bill. In conference, the bill was substantially altered, being joined with the bill for the District of Columbia. It had an across-the-board cut of almost 1 percent. The bill was ultimately vetoed. Then it came back for reconsideration. 
   On reconsideration, the White House administration wanted to add some $2.3 billion more. I knew that would cause a major strain on the Republican side of the aisle, and there was a great deal of pressure to yield to the President because of the bad experience we had in December 1995 and early 1996 when the Government was closed down and the Republican-controlled Congress took the blame. The result is that the Congress is now gun shy to fight with the President, gun shy because, with his threatened veto, the Congress has a strong tendency to back down, perhaps not on every point--the family planning issue and the U.N. dues was a notable exception--but backing down on almost every point. The result has been that we are developing an imperial presidency because we have a gun-shy or timid Congress. That is very unfortunate. 
   The issue came into sharp focus on the matter of classroom size reduction and additional teachers, with the President's program to add 100,000 teachers. I think it is a very good program. I support it. But I do not support it if the local school district says that there are other needs at the local level which are more important to the school district than additional teachers and classroom size. 
   When we crafted our bill, we said we would acknowledge the President's ideas as the first priority, but if the local school district made a decision after a fact finding study that they wanted to use the money for something else, then let them use the money for something else. We held tough to that position. Without going into all the details, finally we were undercut. The rug was pulled out, and there was a concession to the President on that point, 
    with a bone being thrown to the Congress so that 25 percent could be used for teacher training. But that is not the kind of flexibility that is best public policy. The best public policy is, OK, class size reduction and additional teachers are important and they are the first priority, but if a local school district says our local needs are different, then let's not put them in a Washington, DC, bureaucratic straitjacket. That is the result of what has happened. 
   It is my hope that next year we can take this bill up early. This issue will still be with us next year and President Clinton will still be with us next year. When Senator HARKIN and I and other Republicans and Democrats, on a bipartisan basis, establish our priorities, let's legislate. As the Constitution says, the power of the purse is with the Congress--the appropriation power--so let us present the bill to the President. If he vetoes it, let's take the case to the public. I think we can certainly win on the issue of local control versus the Washington bureaucratic straitjacket. To do that, the bill has to be presented to the President before the end of the fiscal year. It has to be presented to the President in September--hopefully early September. That is the plan for next year. 
   I would like to see the process modified where we do not have the White House officials in the legislative process as part of the negotiations. The Constitution says that Congress submits a bill to the President and he signs it or vetoes it. But that system has been aborted, observed in the breach more often than in the rule by having OMB officials, the Director of OMB, sitting down with the appropriators to decide what the President will accept before the Congress makes a decision and submits a bill to the President. That is not the constitutional way and we ought to change it. 
   So against that backdrop with substantial concerns about what has been done, I do intend to vote for this appropriations package. I do so because the good points outweigh the bad points, perhaps close, but the benefits do outweigh the negatives. We come through in this bill with an increase in the National Institutes of Health funding by  $2.3 billion, for a total of $17.9 billion. Senator HARKIN and I have taken the lead with an increase, 2 years ago, of almost $1 billion, last year $2 billion, and this year $2.3 billion. Some objections have been lodged, but nobody with sufficient bravado to try to take it out of the bill. 
   Enormous advances have been made on dreaded diseases. They are within 5 years of curing Parkinson's, so say the experts, with major research advances in Alzheimer's, cancer, heart ailments, and a whole range of various other ailments. With the Federal budget of $1.8 trillion, $17.9 billion is not chopped liver, but it is not too much. 
   This bill also has an increase in special education by $913 million, bringing the total to more than $6 billion on what is essentially a Federal obligation, and it frees State and local funds for other purposes. The Head Start increase is $608 million, to more than $5.2 billion. Afterschool learning centers more than doubled for a total of $453 million. The substance abuse and mental health program increases by $163 million over fiscal year 1999, for more than $2.6 billion. AIDS funding increased by $185 million over last year to almost $1.6 billion. There is first-time funding of $75 million for the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Act, which are appropriations that are long past due. 
   We worked out an accommodation on the issue of organ allocation and, regrettably, at the last minute on a backdoor arrangement, a different provision has been added to another bill that will be voted upon by the Congress. Organ allocation has been very contentious. Last year we agreed, under considerable reluctance, to a 1-year deferral. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, promulgated regulations on October 1, and then came the cry for an additional delay. Some wanted it at 90 days. 
   Finally, in a rather unusual way in my capacity as chairman of the conference, I invited Secretary Shalala to come to the conference on Wednesday, November 10. She was on her way home. We reached her in her car and she turned around from Georgetown and headed back to Capitol Hill. For more than an hour and a half we had a meeting with the House chairman, BILL YOUNG, who very much wanted a 90-day delay and the ranking Democrat on Appropriations, Congressman OBEY from Wisconsin, who also argued strongly for a delay. I urged that we not have the delay, as did Congressman JOHN PORTER, chairman of the House subcommittee. Finally, we hammered out an agreement for 42 days--21 days for additional comments and 21 more days for a response to those comments. 
   I had thought that closed the matter out and reported back to the leadership. The general rule is to leave these issues with the subcommittee chairmen, and we have hammered it out. I found out late yesterday that there is another bill with a 90-day extension. It is not possible to put a hold on the other measure, which is a conference report. There could be some delay, such as a reading of the bill, a vote for cloture, but the result would be the same. 
   Let me say this to those who have increased the delay: It increases our tenacity to get these regulations into effect. There is some thinking that there will be an authorization bill that is going to validate the regulations. I am not one for predictions, but I am prepared to make one here. There won't be 60 votes for cloture. If that should be wrong, there certainly won't be 67 votes to override a Presidential veto. George Shultz, when he was Secretary of State, once made a prophetic comment that ``nothing is ever settled in Washington.'' That very thing is true in Washington; he hit that right on the head. Nothing is ever settled in Washington. I thought the delay on the organ transplant issue had been resolved, but it wasn't settled. George Shultz may be wrong; we may settle it with finality when this 90-day period expires. 
   In summary, the Congress will finally get the job done on this appropriations bill and finally move ahead on the bill from my subcommittee on funding the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor and Education. I have given a brief thumbnail description as to what the pluses and minuses are. I will vote for it because the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. But it is my hope that we will learn from the experiences this year and do a much better job next year. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the time had been set at 5 o'clock for the beginning of the votes. There are a number of us who have commitments to depart, and have had for some time. Ordinarily it would not be a matter of concern to this Senator, but if we are to complete the arrangements which have been made with a great many Senators, I understand from the Parliamentarian that under the prevailing order, debate will resume on this matter but at the conclusion of the votes.

   Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my distinguished colleague, the ranking subcommittee member. States should have the authority to regulate CRNA's in the same manner as States regulate other health care providers. There is a wealth of information already in existence that supports the view that the issue of supervision should be left to the States, just as HCFA has proposed.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as it appears unlikely the House and Senate conferees will come to agreement this year on a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation which will provide equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. This measure is identical to legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, and similar to provisions contained in both the House and Senate FAA bills. 
   As my colleagues know, the devastating crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17, 1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps the community hardest hit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from Montoursville High School who were participating in a long-awaited French Club trip to France. 
   Last Congress it was brought to my attention by constituents, who include parents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800, that their ability to seek redress in court is hampered by a 1920 shipping law known as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally intended to cover the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of jumbo-jet passengers embarking on international air travel. 
   Under the Warsaw Convention of 1929, airlines are limited in the amount they must pay to families of passengers who died on an international flight. However, domestic air crashes are covered by U.S. law, which allow for greater damages if negligent conduct is proven in court. 
   The Warsaw Convention limit on liability can be waived if the passengers' families show that there was intentional misconduct which led to the crash. This is where the Death on the High Seas Act comes into play. This law states that where the death of a person is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas more than 1 marine league which is 3 miles from U.S. shores, a personal representative of a decedent can sue for pecuniary loss sustained by the decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. The Act, however, does not allow families of the victims of TWA 800 or other aviation incidents such as the Swissair Flight 111 crash and the recent EgyptAir 990 tragedy to obtain other types of damages, such as recovery for loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how great the wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane manufacturer. 
   My legislation would amend Federal law to provide that the Death on the High Seas Act shall not affect any remedy existing at common law or under State law with respect to any injury or death arising out of an aviation incident occurring after January 1, 1995. In effect, it would clarify that federal aviation law does not limit remedies in the same manner as maritime law, and permits international flights to be governed by the same laws as domestic flights. 
   My legislation is not about blaming an airline or airplane manufacturer. It is not about miltimillion dollar damage awards. It is about ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families of victims of plane crashes. 
   The need for this legislation is suggested by the Supreme Court decision Zicherman v. Korean Airlines, 116 S. Ct. 629 (1996), in which a unanimous Court held that the Death on the 
   High Seas Act of 1920 applies to determine damages in airline accidents that occur more than 3 miles from shore. By contrast, the Court has ruled that State tort law applies to determine damages in accidents that occur in waters 3 miles or less from our shores. Yamaha v. Calhoun, (1996 WL 5518) 
   I believe it is inequitable to make such a distinction at the 3 mile limit in civil aviation cases where the underlying statute predates international air travel. I would note that the Gore Commission on Aviation Safety and Security noted in its final report that ``certain statutes and international treaties, established over 50 years ago, historically have not provided equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. Specifically, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Warsaw Convention of 1929, although designed to aid families of victims of maritime and aviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family members of international aviation disasters from obtaining fair compensation.'' 
   I would further note that in an October, 1996 brief filed at the Department of Transportation by the Air Transport Association, the trade association of U.S. airlines, there is an acknowledgment that the Supreme Court in Zicherman did not apparently consider 49 U.S.C. &#167;40120(a) and (c), which preserve the application of State and common law remedies in tort cases and also prohibit the application of Federal shipping laws to aviation. My legislation amends 49 U.S.C. &#167;40120(c) to clarify that nothing in the Death on the High Seas Act restricts the availability of remedies in suits arising out of aviation disasters. 
   In September, 1998, during consideration of the Federal Aviation Administration authorization bill, I offered a compromise amendment with a limit on damages in order to move ahead to obtain some possible compensation for victims' families beyond pecuniary damages. I did so because had an amendment to the Death on the High Seas Act been enacted which would have had unlimited damages, there was the announced intent to filibuster the bill. While my amendment was accepted by a voice vote in the Senate, the underlying FAA bill was not enacted into law. 
   This year the Senate passed a new FAA reauthorization bill which included the compromise provision agreed to last year. As the bill conferees appear unlikely to reach agreement with the House this year, I am re-introducing the original version of my bill because I fundamentally oppose any cap on damages and am hopeful that this legislation can be enacted independently of the FAA bill to provide the fullest amount of relief to the families of aviation disaster victims. 
   At a time when so many Americans live, work, and travel abroad, taking part in the global economy or seeing the cultural riches of foreign lands, they and their families should know that the American civil justice system will be accessible to the fullest extent if the unthinkable occurs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to working with them to ensure its ultimate enactment during the second session of the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce a bill which will overturn what has come to be known as the ``Feres doctrine.'' In the 1950 case of Feres v. U.S., the Supreme Court held that the United States Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to military personnel where the injuries are sustained ``incident to service.'' Under the Feres doctrine, therefore, a soldier would not be able to seek compensation from the government for injuries sustained due to government negligence unless the soldier happened to be on leave or furlough at the time he or she sustained the injuries. 
   Over the years, we have seen the Feres doctrine produce anomalous results which reflect neither the will of  the Congress nor basic common sense. For instance, under Feres, a soldier who is the victim of medical malpractice at an army hospital cannot sue the government for compensation. Likewise, his family cannot sue for compensation if the soldier dies from the malpractice. But a civilian who suffers from the same malpractice would be entitled to file suit against the government. Likewise, if a soldier driving home from work on an army base is hit by a negligently driven army truck, he is barred from suing the government for compensation. If the soldier dies in the accident, his family will be barred from suing for compensation. Meanwhile, a civilian hit by the same truck would have a cause of action against the United States. Unfortunately, the individuals hurt by the Feres doctrine are the men and women of our armed forces--people whom we should protect and reward, not punish. 
   The recent decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in O'Neil v. United States illustrates the troubling results produced by the Feres doctrine. In O'Neil, the family of slain Naval officer Kerryn O'Neil was barred from pursuing a wrongful death claim against the government under the Feres doctrine. O'Neil was murdered by her former fianc&#233;, George Smith, a Navy ensign. The two met at the U.S. Naval Academy and were stationed at the same Naval base in California. After Ms. O'Neil broke off their engagement, Mr. Smith began to stalk her. One night while Ms. O'Neil was sitting in her on-base apartment watching a movie with a friend, Smith came to her building and killed her, her friend, and then himself. 
   After the murders, Kerryn O'Neil's family learned that Mr. Smith had scored in the 99.99th percentile for aggressive/destructive behavior in Navy psychological tests. Under Naval procedures, these results should have been forwarded to the Department of Psychiatry at the Naval Hospital for a full psychological evaluation. Had their claim not been barred, the O'Neils would have argued that the Navy was negligent in failing to follow up on these extreme test results. I do not know whether the O'Neil's deserved to be compensated under the Act--this depends on the specific facts and the case law in this area. But it does seem clear to me that the O'Neils should not have been barred from pursuing their claim because their daughter's fatal injuries were sustained ``incident to service.'' 
   Of course, there are situations in which soldiers should not be allowed to sue the government in tort. For example, in a combat situation, countless judgment calls are made which result in death or injuries to soldiers. We cannot have lawyers and juries second guessing the decisions made by field commanders and combatants in the heat of battle. But such considerations do not necessitate that military personnel should lose the right to sue the government in any context. 
   The bill I introduce today will reverse the court-created Feres doctrine and return the law to the way it was originally intended by Congress. My bill is very short and simple. It amends 
   the Federal Tort Claims Act to specifically provide that the Act applies to military personnel on active duty the same as it applies to anyone else. My bill further specifies that military personnel will be limited by the exceptions to government liability already included in the Act, including the bar on liability for injuries sustained by military personnel in combat and the bar on liability for claims which arise in a foreign country. In short, my bill will ensure that members of our armed forces will be entitled to damages they deserve when injured through the negligence or wrongful actions of the Federal government or its agents, except for certain limited cases contemplated by Congress when it originally passed the Act. 
   Congress passed the Federal Tort Claims Act in 1946 to give the general consent of the government to be sued in tort, subject to several specific restrictions. Under the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity, the United States cannot be sued without such specific consent. The Act provides that the government will be held liable ``in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under the circumstances.'' Thus, the Act makes the United States liable for the torts of its employees and agents to the extent that private employers are liable under state law for the torts of their employees and agents. 
   The Act contains many exceptions to government liability, but it does not contain an explicit exception for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service. In fact, one of the Act's exceptions prevents ``any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard during time of war.'' By including this exception, Congress clearly contemplated the special case of military personnel and decided that certain limits must be placed on government liability in this context. But by drawing this exception narrowly and limiting it to combat situations, Congress rejected any broad exception for injuries sustained ``incident to service.'' The Supreme Court did far more than interpret our statute when it significantly broadened the limited combat exception provided by Congress. This bill leaves intact the government's exemption for injuries sustained in combat. 
   The Feres doctrine has been the subject of harsh criticism by some of the leading jurists in the nation. In the 1987 case of United States v. Johnson, a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that the Feres doctrine bars suits on behalf of military personnel injured incident to service even in cases of torts committed by employees of civilian agencies. Justice Scalia wrote a scathing dissent in Johnson, in which he was joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens. Scalia wrote that Feres was ``wrongly decided and heartily deserves the widespread, almost universal criticism it has received.'' 
   Judge Edward Becker, the Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, has also spoken out strongly against the Feres doctrine. He has noted that ``the scholarly criticism of the doctrine is legion'' and has urged the Supreme Court to grant cert. to reconsider Feres. Judge Becker has written to me that given the failure of the Court to overturn Feres thus far, I should introduce legislation doing so. 
   Even in the Feres opinion itself, the Supreme Court expressed an uncharacteristic doubt about its decision. The justices recognized that they may be misinterpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act. They called upon Congress to correct their mistake if this were the case. The Court wrote:  
   There are few guiding materials for our task of statutory construction. No committee reports or floor debates disclose what effect the statute was designed to have on the problem before us, or that it even was in mind. Under these circumstances, no conclusion can be above challenge, but if we misinterpret the Act, at least Congress possesses a ready remedy.  
   Congress does possess a ready remedy, and I call upon my colleagues to exercise it. The bill I introduce today will eliminate the judicially created Feres doctrine and revive the original framework of the Federal Tort Claims Act. There is no reason to deny compensation to the men and women of our armed services who are injured or killed in domestic accidents or violence outside the heat of combat. I hope that when we resume our business next year my colleagues will join me in supporting and passing this legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss two important provisions that were added to the bankruptcy reform bill by unanimous consent. The first provides that bankruptcy attorneys who represent debtors will be liable for paying certain attorneys' fees only if their own actions are ``frivolous''--the bill had originally required these attorneys to pay fees for merely losing the argument on a motion to remove a case from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. The second of these provisions empowers judges to waive the bankruptcy filing fee for individuals who cannot afford to pay it, even in installments. I have fought for these two provisions, together with Senator FEINGOLD, since this bill first came before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress, and I believe their inclusion in the bill is a significant improvement that will ensure sufficient access to justice for all who seek relief in our bankruptcy courts. 
   As originally drafted, the bankruptcy bill provided that if a debtor files in Chapter 7, and a bankruptcy trustee prevails on a motion to remove the debtor to Chapter 13 because the debtor is found to have the ability to pay at least 25% of his debts, then the debtor's attorney must pay the reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the trustee in filing and arguing the removal motion. 
   This was an inappropriate provision. We would have had attorneys being penalized not because they were bad actors, but because they engaged in zealous advocacy on behalf of clients and happened to lose the argument. This would have had an enormous chilling effect on debtors' attorneys. In all cases where the outcome was less than certain, lawyers would have been inclined to file their clients in Chapter 13, even if they truly believe that the clients belong in Chapter 7, in order to avoid the penalty. 
   When the bill came before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress, I offered an amendment together with Senator FEINGOLD to provide that the debtors' attorneys should pay these fees only if their actions in filing in Chapter 7 were ``frivolous.'' Our amendment was defeated by a roll call vote of 9-9. We then offered our amendment on the Senate floor, where it was tabled by a vote of 57-42. 
   As the result of our efforts last Congress, the attorneys' fees standard was improved when the bill was re-introduced this Congress. The current version of the bill provides that lawyers must pay these fees only if their actions in filing in Chapter 7 were not ``substantially justified.'' Still, I believe that this standard is too broad and will still chill attorneys from zealous advocacy. As in every other area of the law, lawyers must be punished only if their actions are ``frivolous'' or in  bad faith. I am glad that this is the standard that is now in the bill. 
   A second problem with the bankruptcy bill as originally drafted was that it did not permit bankruptcy judges to waive the bankruptcy filing fee for indigent individuals. Individuals who petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy must pay a filing fee of approximately $175. There are many individuals who are so indigent by time they decide to seek the relief of bankruptcy, however, that they cannot even afford this relatively small fee. As a result, some individuals are actually too poor to go bankrupt. This is an absurd result. In such limited cases, we must empower a judge to decide that the filing fee can waived. 
   Many individuals opposed to waiving the filing fee have argued that doing so would open the door to an enormous increase in the number of individuals taking advantage of the bankruptcy system. The idea is that ``free'' bankruptcies will lead to a bankruptcy bonanza. 
   Unfortunately, these individuals have failed to look at the record. In the appropriations bill for FY `94, Congress authorized a pilot in forma pauperis program in six federal judicial districts, including Eastern District of Pennsylvania, for three years. These pilots demonstrated that the program worked as intended, and did not significantly change the number or nature of bankruptcy filings. 
   In the six pilot districts, waivers were requested in only 3.4% of all non-business Chapter 7 cases, and waivers were granted in only 2.9% of all non-business Chapter 7 cases. This number was small enough that it did not lead to a significant increase in the number of overall Chapter 7 filings or a significant loss in revenue to the courts. 
   When the bankruptcy bill was before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress, I offered an amendment to permit the waiver of filing fees together with Senator FEINGOLD. Our amendment was defeated in Committee by a vote of 9-9. When we introduced our amendment on the floor of the Senate, however, the motion to table the amendment was rejected by a vote of 47-52, and the amendment was accepted into the bill. I am glad that this Congress our waiver provision has been included without the necessity of a vote. 
   Taken together, these two provisions ensure that all who are in need will have access to our bankruptcy courts and will enjoy the benefits of zealous advocacy on their behalf that is the cornerstone of our legal system. They are valuable improvements, and I commend Senators GRASSLEY, LEAHY, TORRICELLI and FEINGOLD for their inclusion in the bill.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator TOM HARKIN, my colleague and distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, which I chair, in introducing the Medicaid Attendant Care Services and Supports Act of 1999. This creative proposal addresses a glaring gap in Federal health coverage, and assists one of our Nation's most vulnerable populations, persons with disabilities. I would also note that a similar version on this bill was included in the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999 (S. 24), which I introduced on January 19, 1999. 
   In an effort to improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those with long-term disabilities, this vital legislation would allow for reimbursement for community-based attendant care services, in lieu of institutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such services based on functional need, without regard to the individual's age or the nature of the disability. The most recent data available tell us that 5.9 million individuals receive care for disabilities under the Medicaid program. The number of disabled who are not currently enrolled in the program who would apply for this improved benefit is not easily counted, but would likely be substantial given the preference of home and community-based care over institutional care. 
   Under this proposal, States may apply for grants for assistance in implementing ``systems change'' initiatives, in order to eliminate the institutional bias in their current policies and for needs assessment activities. Further, if a state can show that the aggregate amounts of Federal expenditures on people living in the community exceeds what would have been spent on the same people had they been in nursing homes, the state can limit the program, perhaps by not letting any more people apply; no limiting mechanism is mandated under this bill. And finally, States would be required to maintain expenditures for attendant care services under other Medicaid community-based programs, thereby preventing the states from shifting patients into the new benefit proposed under this bill. 
   Let me speak briefly about why such a change in Medicaid law is so desperately needed. Only a few short months ago, the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires States, under some circumstances, to provide community-based treatment to persons with mental disabilities rather than placing them in institutions. This decision and several lower court decisions have pointed to the need for a structured Medicaid attendant-care services benefit in order to meet obligations under the ADA. Disability advocates strongly support this legislation, arguing that the lack of Medicaid communty-based services options is discriminatory and unhealthful for disabled individuals. Virtually every major disability advocacy group supports this bill, including ADAPT, the Arc, the National Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association. 
   Senator HARKIN and I recognize that such a shift in the Medicaid program is a huge undertaking--but feel that it is a vitally important one. We are introducing this legislation today in an attempt to move ahead with the consideration of crucial disability legislation and to provide a starting point for debate. Mr. President, the time has come for concerted action in this arena. 
   I urge the congressional leadership, including the appropriate committee chairmen, to move forward in considering this legislation, and take the significant next step forward in achieving the objective of providing individuals with disabilities the freedom to live in their own communities.

   Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of our distinguished majority leader, I have been asked to make the following announcements. 
   Today the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy reform legislation with 1 hour of debate on the pending minimum wage amendments. Following the debate, the Senate will proceed to two rollcall votes at approximately 10:30 a.m. There are numerous pending amendments, and others are expected to be offered and debated during today's session. Therefore, Senators may anticipate votes throughout the day. Progress is being made on the appropriations issues, and it is hoped that those remaining issues can be resolved prior to the Veterans Day recess.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment, if I may, on one of the items referred to in a statement by the majority leader about the appropriations process, which I think will be of interest to our colleagues and perhaps to others who may be watching on C-SPAN 2. 
   We had negotiations beginning at 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon with officials from the White House, and we are trying to resolve those issues in a spirit of accommodation. With respect to the dollars involved, the bill which came out of the Appropriations Committee was $93.7 billion for the three Departments. That was $600 million more than the President's figure, and it was $300 million more than the President's figure on education. 
   I worked on a bipartisan basis with my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN. The bill was crafted with what we thought was the right dollar amount--frankly, the maximum amount--to pass with votes in substantial numbers from Republicans and an amount which would be acceptable to Democrats and to the President because it was somewhat higher than his figure and we emphasized increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. 
   The administration has come back with a figure of $2.3 billion additional, and Congressman PORTER and I made an offer yesterday to add $228 million, provided we could find offsets because it is very important that we not go into the Social Security trust funds. So that whatever dollars we add to accommodate the President's priorities--we are going to have to have offsets on priorities which the Congress has established. We are prepared to meet him halfway on priorities on dollars--we are going to have to have offsets on priorities which the Congress has established. 
   There is a much more difficult issue in this matter than the dollars, although the dollars are obviously of great importance, and the issue which is extremely contentious is what will be done on the President's demand to have $1.4 billion to reduce classroom size to have additional teachers. 
   The Senate bill has appropriated $1.2 billion which maintains the high level of last year's funding. When it comes to the issue of the utilization of that money, we are prepared to acknowledge the President's first priority of reduction of classroom size for teachers. But if the local school board makes a factual determination that is not the real need of the local school board, then we propose that the second priority be teacher training. If the local school board decides that is not where the money ought to be spent, then we propose to give it to the school board the discretion as to the spending to local education, as opposed to a straitjacket out of Washington. 
   The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement this morning saying that these funds could be used for vouchers, and that is not true. That is a red herring. To allay any concern, we will make it explicit in the bill that the President's concern about the use of these funds for vouchers will be allayed. We are prepared to make that accommodation, although there had never been any intent to use it for vouchers. However, we will make that intent explicit in the bill. 
   Behind the issue of classroom size and the President's demand is a much greater constitutional issue. That is the constitutional issue of who controls the power of the purse. The Constitution gives the authority to the Congress to establish spending priorities, and we have seen a process evolve in the past few years which does not follow the constitutional format. The Constitution is very specific that each  House will decide on a bill, have a conference, and send that bill to the President for his signature or for his veto; and if he vetoes it, the bill then comes back to the Congress for reenactment. But what has happened in the immediate past has been that executive branch officials sit in with the appropriators and are a part of the legislative process, which is a violation of the principle of separation of powers. Now, I must say that I have been a party to those meetings because that is what is going on. But I want to identify it as a process which is not in conformity with the Constitution. It is something we ought to change. 
   When it comes to the power and the control, what we have seen happen in the last 4 years is that the President has really made an effort, and to a substantial extent a successful effort, to take over the prerogative of the Congress on the power of the purse. 
   When the Government was closed in late 1995 and early 1996, the Republican-controlled Congress was blamed for the closure. That, candidly, has made the Congress gun-shy to challenge the President on spending issues. Since that time there has been a concession to the President on whatever it is that he wants, sort of ``pay a price to get out of town'' when people are anxious to have the congressional session adjourn. 
   Speaking for myself and I think quite a few others in the Congress are not going to put on the pressure to get out of town. We are going to do the job and do it right. Senator LOTT held a news conference yesterday and was asked about the termination time. He said he thought it was possible to finish the public's business by the close of the legislative session on Wednesday, which is tomorrow, but it was more important, as Senator LOTT articulated, to do it right than get it finished by any arbitrary deadline. I concur totally with Senator LOTT. I think it is possible to get the business finished by the end of the working day tomorrow. But it is more important to get it right than to get it finished on any prescribed schedule. In modern times there is too much concern about getting out of town, than perhaps getting the job done right. But we are determined to get it done and to get it done right. If we can get it done by the end of business tomorrow, that is what our goal is. But we are not going to sacrifice getting it done right in order to be able to finish up by Wednesday afternoon to get out of town.

   Mr. SPECTER. No, I will not yield here, but I will in just a minute. 
   What we have seen is the President's ultimatum. He says this issue on schoolteachers is nonnegotiable. That is hardly the way you get into a negotiation session. Then his Chief of Staff, John Podesta, said on Sunday that if the Congress wants to get out of town they are going to have to accede to the President's demands on teachers, to do it his way. I think that is not appropriate. Congress has the power of the purse under the Constitution. It is our fundamental responsibility on appropriations. We are prepared to negotiate, but we are not prepared to deal with nonnegotiable demands. We are not prepared to deal with ultimatums. We are going back into a session--I don't know whether I should call it a negotiating session or not, because the President talks about nonnegotiable demands. Frankly, I am prepared to meet that with a nonnegotiable demand, not giving up on our prerogative to make a determination as to how the money is to be spent and getting local control over a Presidential straitjacket. 
   Now I would be delighted to yield to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as noted, there are two modifications to the amendment. They are minor modifications. One relates to the court which will have jurisdiction. Instead of the Court of International Trade, it will be the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. And the second is the striking of language citing antitrust laws, which has been deleted to avoid any possible question as to whether this is a Finance Committee jurisdictional matter and appropriate amendment for this bill. 
   The essence of this bill is to provide a private right of action to damaged, injured parties when goods are imported into the United States which are dumped in violation of U.S. trade laws and in violation of international trade laws. Many American industries have been decimated as a result of this illegal practice, and the existing remedies are totally insufficient to provide adequate safeguards for the violation of these trade laws. 
   This bill does not deal with any issue of inappropriate consideration for domestic industries and is really not protectionist, as that term has been traditionally defined. The international trade laws are specific that the goods ought not to be sold in the United States at a lower price than they are sold in the country from which the exports are made and imported into the United States. Our trade laws in the United States preclude dumped goods from coming into this country. International trade laws preclude dumped goods. 
   This is an approach I have been advocating for more than 17 years now, with my initial bill having been introduced in the 97th Congress, S. 2167, on March 4, 1983. I followed up with similar legislation in the 98th Congress, S. 418 on February 3, 1983; in the 99th Congress, with S. 236; in the 100th Congress, with S. 361; in the 102d Congress, with S. 2508. The thrust has always been the same, that is to provide a private right of action so injured parties could go into Federal court and secure redress on their legal rights because the proceedings through section 201, through the Department of Commerce, through the International Trade Commission, are so long that they are virtually ineffective. 
   If an injured party goes into the Federal court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is possible to get a temporary restraining order on affidavits within 5 days, then a prompt preliminary hearing and a preliminary injunction and prompt equitable proceedings for a permanent injunction. 
   The initial legislation, which was introduced back in 1982, called for injunctive relief. The pending amendment provides for a remedy of duties or tariffs equal to the amount of the dumping, the difference between what the product would be sold at in the United States compared to what the product is being sold at in the home country. 
   I have a list of antidumping duty orders in effect on March 1, 1999. I ask unanimous consent this list be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the conclusion of my statement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the 5 pages which I am submitting, there are some 290 items which are being subjected to the antidumping orders as of March 1 of this year. 
   Some illustrative provisions: In Argentina, there is a dumping order on carbon steel; as to Bangladesh, a dumping order on cotton shop towels; Belgium, a dumping order on sugar; Canada, a dumping order on red raspberries; Chile, a dumping order on fresh cut flowers; China, a dumping order on garlic. So the list goes on and on and on. 
   When I testified at the hearing before the Finance Committee in favor of this bill, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD, made a comment that this kind of provision might well be applied to wheat and wheat farmers, where they are subjected to dumping from other countries. I suggest to my colleagues who are listening to this on C-SPAN, or to the staffs, that there is hardly a State--there 
   may be no State--which is unaffected by dumping where goods come in from a foreign country and are sold in the United States at a price lower than they are being sold in the foreign country in violation of U.S. trade laws and in violation of international trade laws. 
   The remedy has been modified to provide for the duties or tariffs, as I have stated, in order to comply with GATT, because a question had arisen as to whether injunctive relief was appropriate under GATT. I frankly believe it is. But to avoid any problem, the relief has been modified to duties or tariffs. 
   The difficulty with the proceedings with the existing laws is the tremendous length of time which is taken. For an illustration, there was an antidumping order issued as to salmon. It was initiated on July 10, 1997. The order was finally issued on July 30, 1998--time elapsed, 380 days. 
   A second illustrative case involved garlic from China, initiated on February 28, 1994; the order issued on November 16, 1994--200 days. 
   A third illustration, magnesium from Ukraine: Initiated April 26, 1994; the order issued May 12, 1995--360 days. 
   Hot rolled steel from Japan: The initiation of the action was October 27, 1998; the order issued on June 19, 1999. These are only illustrative of the enormous lapse in time. 
   Contrasted with what can happen in a court of equity, a temporary restraining order can be issued within 5 days on affidavits, prompt proceedings for preliminary injunctions, prompt proceedings for injunctive relief generally. 
   The difficulty with existing law is that the decisions are made based upon political considerations and foreign relations, and not based upon what is right for American industries who are being undersold by these dumped goods and have suffered a tremendous loss of employment. 
   My State, Pennsylvania, has been victimized by dumping for the past 2 decades. Two decades ago, the American steel industry employed some 500,000 individuals. Today that number has dwindled to 160,000, notwithstanding the fact that the American steel industry has spent some $50 billion in modernizing. 
   Under existing laws, the executive branch has the authority to issue suspension agreements. One illustration of that was a suspension agreement issued on July 13 of this year when Secretary Daley announced the United States and Russia had reached agreements to reduce imports of steel. That was immediately followed by strenuous objections by a number of steel companies operating out of my State, Pennsylvania--Bethlehem Steel, LTV, National Steel Corporation, U.S. Steel Group--where they made strenuous objection to these suspension agreements which undermine the effectiveness and credibility of U.S. trade laws and a rule-based international trade system. 
   I recall, in 1984, a time when the American steel industry was especially hard hit by imports, dumped imports. 
   The International Trade Commission had issued an order 3-2 in favor of the position of American Steel. The President had the authority to overrule that decision. Senator Heinz and I then made the rounds and talked to International Trade Representative Brock who agreed that the International Trade Commission order in favor of American Steel should be upheld. We talked to Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige who similarly agreed. We then talked to Secretary of State George Shultz who disagreed, as did Secretary of Defense Weinberger, with Secretary of State Shultz putting it on  grounds of U.S. foreign policy and Secretary of Defense Weinberger putting it on grounds of U.S. defense policy. 
   When these matters are left to the executive branch, the executive branch inevitably does a balancing of what is happening in Russia, what is happening in Argentina, what is happening in Japan, what is happening in Korea. 
   It is certainly true that when the suspension agreements were entered into by Secretary Daley on July 13, 1999, the Russian economy was in a precarious state, but then so were certain aspects of the economy of western Pennsylvania. 
   The thrust of taking the matter to the courts is that justice will be done in accordance with existing law, contrasted with what the desirability may be for U.S. foreign policy or for U.S. defense policy. 
   There is stated from time to time a reluctance to take matters to the court, but my own view, having had substantial practice in the Federal courts as well as the State courts, is that is where justice is done. If there is a case that could be made to show there is a violation of U.S. trade laws and foreign trade laws on dumping, those legal principles will be administered by the courts. Where the wheat industry is being victimized by dumping or the steel industry is being victimized by dumping or the sugar industry is being victimized by dumping or the fresh cut flower industry is being victimized by dumping, justice will be done in the Federal courts. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the antidumping procedures are not antiquated at all. I have noted some 290 antidumping orders in effect as of March 1 of 1999 dealing with a wide variety of products: Steel, sugar, towels, raspberries, fresh cut flowers--the list goes on and on. 
   The grave difficulty is that the enforcement rests with the executive branch, and the executive branch is more concerned with foreign policy matters and defense policy than with any specific U.S. industry. 
   The trade-off is made, decimating industries and costing thousands of jobs in an unfair way. As of July 12 of this year, there were bankruptcies of five medium-size steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, Gulf States, Qualtech, and Geneva. 
   When the argument is made that there will be an effect on prices of automobile manufacturers, that is true. But our laws are designed to provide fairness as fairness and justice relate to the steel industry and the auto industry. The auto industry ought not to be able to buy steel from a foreign importer where it is dumped--sold in the United States at a price lower than it is sold in the foreign country. 
   When the distinguished chairman of the committee makes a reference to wire rod, it ought to be noted that steel wire rods continued at record high levels, more than 14 percent over levels about a year ago in September of 1998. The wire rod industry has sustained serious damage, losses of some $94 million during the first half of 1999. A petition was filed on December 30, 1998, and the President, expected to make his determination by September 27, 1999, to postpone that decision, on September 28, claimed that the matter was still under review. To date, there hasn't been a decision. 
   Contrast that with what could be obtained in a court of equity, where a decision could be made on affidavits on an ex parte order in 5 days, within a few weeks on a preliminary injunction. It is not true that the Federal courts are unable to handle these serious matters. They do handle complicated antitrust matters all the time and deal with complex economic matters. If a damaged party is in a position to prove the case, they move into court and get a prompt decision in a court of equity, certainly nothing like a year's delay. 
   The line pipe industry filed a section 201 petition with the ITC claiming that, in 1998, some 331,000 net tons of lime pipe had been imported into U.S. markets at an increase of 49.5 percent over 1997. This petition was filed on June 30, 1999. The ITC issued an affirmative finding on October 28, 1999, but the President is not expected to review the matter until December 17 of this year, long after an equitable court would have been able to take care of it. 
   The lamb issue is similar. On September 30, 1998, the American sheep industry filed a section 201 petition to stop the flood of imported lamb into the United States. During the 1998 Easter/Passover season, U.S. slaughtered lamb prices were at a 4-year low, some 60 cents a pounds. On March 26, 1999, the ITC unanimously decided in favor of the industry and forwarded its recommendation to the President for decision by late May. In this case, the President did not make a decision to provide relief to the industry until July 7, 1999, which shows the enormous delay in proceedings under the International Trade Commission. 
   When the suggestion is made about having the matter taken up in Seattle, the grave difficulty is that the international trade agreements leave the ultimate discretion with the executive branch, and that works to the disadvantage of the American company and the American workers. We have provided that there would not be an opportunity for judge shopping, to go into a court in a jurisdiction where the industry was located where most of the damage had been done, by providing that the jurisdiction would be lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 
   I think it is a matter of fundamental fairness as to whether our trade laws will be enforced, our trade laws consistent with GATT. 
   We see, again and again, enormous delays, very little effect, and then the executive branch taking over with suspension agreements to protect the Russians instead of seeing to it that there is justice for American industry and for American workers. This goes far beyond the question of steel, which is a major matter in my State. It goes to virtually every product on the books, as illustrated by the some 290 products which are subjected to 
   antidumping orders in effect as of March 1, 1999. 
   This is an idea I have been pushing since 1982. My own experience in the court system, as a trial lawyer, shows me that when you go to court, you get the laws enforced--you have justice--contrasted with the executive branch decision, which will vary on many collateral considerations: U.S. foreign policy and U.S. defense policy. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides for a private right of action to go into Federal court and stop dumped goods from coming into the United States in order to enforce U.S. trade laws and international trade laws, consistent with GATT. 
   For example, today, if you take a case under 30201, the International Trade Commission takes up to a year to have it acted on, and then the administration can have a suspension order and eliminate it totally. Dumped goods are unfairly taking jobs from farmers, where dumped wheat comes into the United States. Textiles are dumped, steel is dumped, lamb is dumped; and the administration consistently decides these cases--as they did on steel with Russia--on a suspension agreement as to what is going to help the Russian economy for foreign policy and defense reasons, as opposed to seeing to it that United States trade laws are enforced that prohibit dumping--selling in the United States at a lower cost than illustratively selling in Russia. 
   This would give an injured party a chance to go to court and get an injunction within a few weeks, to have countervailing duties imposed, which would be an effective way to see to it that our antidumping laws are enforced and we do not have the disintegration of industries such as steel or unfair practices for wheat farmers, lamb farmers, and the like.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for yielding to me. 
   It is my hope that the Senate will support this conference report. I am saddened to hear the arguments from the other side of the aisle which have turned this matter pretty much into a partisan debate. 
   When we talk about the 1 percent across-the-board cut, frankly, that is something I do not like. But when you take a look at the increases which are in this bill, they remain largely intact, notwithstanding the fact that there will be a 1-percent cut. 
   For example, on Head Start, at $5.2 billion, it has an increase of some $608.5 million. The 1-percent across-the-board cut will leave, instead of a $608.5 million increase, a $570.9 million increase. You will find that throughout the bill. 
   When the last Senator who spoke made a reference to the difficulties of the National Institutes of Health in stopping and starting, I point out that it has been the initiative of our subcommittee, significantly a Republican initiative, to increase NIH, which has had the full concurrence of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, representing the Democrats. 
   But 3 years ago, we sought an increase of almost $1 billion, an increase of some $900 million, after the conference. Last year, we increased NIH funding by $2 billion. This year, the Senate bill had $2 billion, and on the initiative of Congressman PORTER in the House, a Republican, we increased it an additional $300 million. The ranking Democrat would not even attend the conference we had. 
   So it does not ring with validity for those on the other side of the aisle to point to the National Institutes of Health and say this conference report, this Republican conference report, is doing damage to NIH. The fact is, it is this side of the aisle that has taken the lead. Again, I include my colleague, Senator HARKIN, who has been my full partner. But the lead has been taken on this side of the aisle for the NIH. 
   Now, this bill has, for these three Departments, in discretionary spending, $93.7 billion, which is an increase of $6 billion over last year. We have $600 million more than the President on these very vital social programs. When it comes to education, this bill has $300 million more than the President. We have provided very substantial funding. 
   There is a disagreement between this bill and what the President wants on class size reduction. The President has established a priority of class size reduction and wants it his way, and his way exactly. But we have added a $1.2 billion increase in this budget and we have done so listing the President's priority first; that is, to cut class size. We say, if the local school districts don't agree that class size is their No. 1 priority, they can use it on teacher competency, or they can use it for local discretion, but they don't have an absolute straitjacket. I believe that is the solvent principle of federalism. 
   Why say to the local school boards across America they have to have it for class size if they don't have that problem and they want to use it for something else in education? 
   Now, Senator HARKIN and I--and I see my distinguished colleague on the floor--have had a full partnership for a decade. He is nodding yes. When he was chairman and I was ranking, and now that I am chairman and he is ranking, we have worked together. I can understand the difficulties of parties, Democrats and Republicans. I know he is deeply troubled by the 1-percent across-the-board cut; so am I. We tried to find offsets and we tried mightily to avoid touching Social Security, without a 1-percent across-the-board cut. 
   It had been my hope that on my assurances to my colleague from Iowa we could have stayed together on this. I can understand if it is a matter of Democrats and Republicans and he does not see his way clear to do that at this time. I say to him, whatever way he votes--and he smiles and laughs--my full effort will be to avoid a 1-percent across-the-board cut so we can come out with the bill he and I crafted, the subcommittee accepted, the full committee accepted, and the full Senate accepted, which is a very good bill. 
   In order to advance to the next stage, it is going to be a party-line vote, something I do not like in the Senate. But I urge my colleagues to support the bill so we can move to the next stage. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for yielding. I know there are other Senators on the floor waiting to speak, so I shall be relatively brief. 
   I do chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We thank the managers of the District of Columbia bill for allowing us to participate in their conference and for bringing our bill along. 
   The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, and I had worked through, in our subcommittee, a bill to finance the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services which received a vote of 73 to 25. It is a very solid bill. 
   We then proceeded in a rather unusual way, because the House of Representatives had not passed a bill, to have an informal conference where Senator HARKIN and I represented the Senate and Congressman PORTER, chairman of the subcommittee on the House side, represented the House. Congressman OBEY, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, declined to participate because there had not been a House bill.  
   We are trying to make the best of a very difficult situation. As I noted, I will speak relatively briefly because I came to the floor on Wednesday, October 27, and spoke at some length when we had just finished the conference. Those remarks appear in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for October 27. 
   In substance, the portion of this bill on Labor, Health and Human Services is a $93.7 billion bill. It is an increase of $6 billion over fiscal year 1999, an increase of some $600 million over the President's figure. On education, which is a very high priority in America, priority second to none, this bill has appropriations totaling some $35 billion, and it is a $300 million increase over what the President had recommended. 
   We have sought to accommodate the President's interests and recognize his priorities. On Head Start, we had an increase of some $608.5 million, bringing the total funding for Head Start in excess of $5 billion. On GEAR UP, we had a 50-percent increase, from $120 million to $180 million. The President wanted a doubling. We could not find that much money. It is a good program, but we think a 50-percent increase was very substantial. 
   There is a point of controversy on the question of teacher classroom size. We have funded that at $1.2 billion. The President wanted $200 million extra. We anticipate that in negotiations that figure could be raised. Mr. Jack Lew, head of the Office of Management and Budget, has some add-ons he wants to make when the negotiations finally do occur, and they have some additional offsets to talk about at that time. 
   There has been a disagreement over whether there ought to be a mandate for those funds to be used for classroom size reduction or whether there ought to be some flexibility on the school districts. On this matter, we have specified that classroom size is the first item on the agenda, but we have given the local districts the option of using them for teacher training or some other local purpose. 
   We do not believe there ought to be a straitjacket coming out of Washington, if the local districts have some other need and can demonstrate that. I know this causes some heartburn to the administration. I talked to the President about it personally and talked to Jack Lew about it. It seems to us this is a matter where there ought to be some significant congressional input. The primary responsibility on appropriations comes to the Congress. That is what the Constitution says. Of course, the President has to sign the bill, and we are always concerned and take into consideration the President's priorities. But as a matter of public policy, it makes a lot of sense to allow local school districts to make a different allocation from classroom size reduction if they don't have a problem on classroom size. So that is one issue where there is disagreement. 
   One aspect of the final bill, which came out of the conference, provides for a 1-percent across-the-board cut, with which, as I noted 2 days ago, I am personally not in agreement. My preference would have been to go through the bill and itemize various programs to make those reductions without a 1-percent across-the-board cut. There was a very strenuous effort made by the leadership of the House and Senate and the representatives of the subcommittee and the full committee to find another way out, to have this bill come in without touching Social Security. Simply stated, this was the least of all the undesirable alternatives. 
   It is my hope the President will sign this bill. He has already stated he will veto it. This is another step in the process of the appropriations procedures to come back to negotiations and to try to find a bill which will be acceptable to the President and to the Congress. 
   I note that when we talk about a 1-percent across-the-board cut on a program such as Head Start, there will still be an increase of some $569 million, not as much as the $608 million we had hoped for but still a very substantial increase. When it comes to a variety of other programs, we have added very substantial increases, so even when there is a 1-percent across-the-board cut, there is still a net advance. 
   Two more items are worthy of brief mention. We have added very substantially to the National Institutes of Health, some $2.3 billion. That is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. They are making enormous strides. The expert testimony specifies that the cure for Parkinson's may be only 5 years away; great advances on Alzheimer's, great advances on cancer--cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer--heart disease, the entire range of problems. 
   We have in this bill an allocation of some $800 million for a program directed at youth violence. The actual figure is $733.8 million, where no additional funds were added, but there is a redirection to try to deal with that major problem in America. 
   In essence, I think the bill that passed the Senate was a really good bill which would have clearly merited the President's signature, even though some differences have existed with the 1 percent across-the-board cut. I understand the problems there. But if somebody has a suggestion on how to have offsets or cuts to protect Social Security, we are prepared to sit down and meet with the officers of the executive branch and the President to try to work out a bill that is acceptable to both the administration and the Congress, to be sure there is adequate funding for these three very important Departments. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a few moments ago, a conference on the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education was completed. It was a rather unusual procedure because the conference report was incorporated into the conference of the District of Columbia appropriations bill. That arose in light of the fact the House of Representatives had not passed a bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education--an appropriations bill for those three departments, but the Senate did. 
   The procedure was adopted to have an informal conference with Senator HARKIN, ranking member of the subcommittee, and myself representing  the Senate, and Congressman JOHN PORTER, chairman of the House subcommittee representing the House. I had talked to the ranking Democrat, Congressman OBEY, and had invited him to participate. He did come to one of the meetings but said he did not intend to participate because of his objection to the nature of the proceedings, in light of the fact that the House had not passed an appropriations bill. 
   This is not the ideal, proceeding in the manner I have described, but it is the best that could be done under the circumstances. There is a real effort to complete the 13 appropriations bills and submit them to the President before the close of business tomorrow so it all would be on the President's desk before the current continuing resolution expired. It may be that the President will veto the District of Columbia bill and the inclusion of the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services. If that is to follow, then we will be proceeding to try to reach an accommodation as to what the bill ought to be. 
   My suggestion is the bill, which has been submitted, is a good bill, not a perfect bill--I haven't seen one of those in the time I have been in the Senate--but, I submit, a good bill. 
   It contains a program level of $93.7 billion, which is about $2 billion less than the program level passed by the Senate. This bill was crafted by Senator HARKIN and myself on a bipartisan basis, crafted in a way to obtain the signature of the President of the United States. We have directed very substantial funding to the three departments where the total bill is $6 billion over fiscal year 1999 and an increase of some $600 million over what the President requested. 
   Education is a priority in America of the highest magnitude. This bill contains a program level of $35 billion for the Department of Education, constituting an increase of $2 billion over fiscal year 1999 and some $300 million over the administration's request. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks, and for the purposes of this oral statement, I will summarize the highlights.

   Mr. SPECTER. With respect to the very important issue of Head Start, the bill contains $5.2 billion, which is an increase of $608.5 million over the fiscal year 1999 level, and it matches the very substantial request for an increase requested by the President. 
   Special education, another very important item, contains $6.035 billion, an increase of some $912.5 million over last year. 
   On the program GEAR UP, which is to support early college preparation for low-income elementary and secondary schoolchildren, there is an increase of some $60 million, a 50-percent increase over last year's funding level of $120 million. I mention GEAR UP specifically because we have not met the President's request, which was a doubling to $240 million from $120 million, but accommodating as far as we could some 50-percent increase, or some $60 million. 
   There is a contentious issue on class size, and the President has requested some $1.4 billion with the money to be directed to class size reduction. We have appropriated $1.2 billion, which is the same as last year's appropriation, a very substantial sum of money, and we have done it in a way which is somewhat different from the President's request. This class size reduction is the priority specified in our bill. But we do allow the local school districts, if they decide, in their wisdom, they want to use the money for something else, such as professional development or any other need of the school district, to direct the funds in that manner. 
   The President would like to have it limited only to classroom size reduction. This is a matter I have personally discussed with President Clinton, and it seems to me that, public policy-wise, the provisions of this bill are the preferable ones. I say that because we give priority to what the President wanted--that is, classroom reduction size--but if the local school district makes a determination that their local needs are different, they ought to have the latitude to make that change. That does not provide a straitjacket coming out of Washington, DC, but states the preference and allows the latitude for the local district to make the change. 
   This bill contains a program for fighting school violence, with some $733.8 million being reallocated from existing programs to focus on the cause of youth violence. I convened three extensive roundtable discussions, or seminars, in effect, with experts from a variety of agencies within the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and also the Department of Justice, to analyze the problems of school violence. We came up with a variety of programs from existing funds to be directed in this manner. 
   The bill also contains very substantial increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. Congressman PORTER, Senator HARKIN, and I think the Congress generally has acknowledged that the National Institutes of Health are the crown jewels of the Federal Government. Sometimes I say they are the only jewels of the Federal Government. But enormous increases have been made in medical research to combat Parkinson's disease, with the experts now telling us we may be within 5 years of conquering Parkinson's. There have been enormous advances on Alzheimer's, breast cancer, 
   lung cancer, prostate cancer, heart ailments, and the whole range of medical problems. 
   Stem cells have become a focal point of medical research. Almost a year ago, they burst upon the scene and provide a real opportunity--a veritable fountain of youth--with these cells being replaced in the human body to conquer these medical maladies. In essence, the bill is a very comprehensive effort to deal with the funding needs of these three major departments. 
   Another aspect of the conference today was an effort to have offsets in order to obtain the goal that we not touch Social Security, and we have done that with an across-the-board cut of 0.95 percent in budget authority and 0.57 percent in outlays. That is a little less than a 1-percent cut across the board in budget authority and a little more than a half-percent cut in outlays. 
   Frankly, I do not like an across-the-board cut. But among all of the alternatives we were considering to avoid touching Social Security, this was the least undesirable of the alternatives. And while there will be cuts below what I would like to see, the increases, by and large, are sufficient so that there will be a net increase nonetheless. 
   For example, in the Head Start program, we increase funding by some $608 million. The 1-percent cut will reduce that figure by $38.7 million, to about a $569 million increase. On special education, for example, we had a $912 million increase. A 1-percent across-the-board cut will reduce that by $23 million, so there still will be a net increase of some $889 million. 
   We have structured this bill with some advances, but we have made a determination not to come in with advances higher than what the President had proposed. It is my hope that President Clinton will sign this bill. From all of the collateral considerations, it appears unlikely he will sign the bill. 
   I have personally contacted Mr. Jack Lew, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in an effort to negotiate with the White House in advance of this conference report. But there have been objections raised by some on the Democratic side in the House to having those discussions move forward because the House, in fact, did not pass a bill on Labor, Health, and Human Services. 
   If this is another step in the legislative process, so be it, with the bill heading toward the President's desk. If he signs it, great; if he vetoes it, we are prepared to go to work and try to move through what ought to be done. If someone has a better idea on offsets, we are prepared to listen. The objective of not touching Social Security, I think, is a consensus objective. The objective of not raising taxes, again, is a consensus objective. We have provided, I think appropriately--some would say generously--for important education and health programs, worker safety programs, and we will be prepared to move forward to see to it that these very important functions are carried  out and to seek agreement between the legislature--the Congress--and the administration. 
   One final note: In my discussions with the President when we talked about his interest in having classroom size done to his specifications, I think it is fair to note that the Constitution gives the principal authority on the appropriations process to the Congress. Of course, the President has to sign the bill. But constitutionally, the Congress has the principal line of responsibility. The President would like to have this appropriations bill serve as an authorization vehicle. The authorizers are not happy about that with the process in the Congress for a separate committee to do the authorization and the separate committee to do the appropriations. We have undertaken the authorization but have exercised our congressional preference in setting public policy to establish the President's program for classroom size as the priority, but giving the latitude to the school districts to do it differently. We think that is consistent with the constitutional responsibility we have. 
   We think some deference ought to be paid to our determination of public policy. But again we are prepared to work with the President to reach a bill which will be acceptable to both the Congress and the President. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a bill to provide federal assistance to States and local governments for drug courts to provide treatment rather than expensive imprisonment for drug addicted nonviolent offenders. 
   This legislation would reauthorize and improve upon a novel program by which States and localities may obtain Federal funds to assist in the implementation of a ``drug court'' within the State and local criminal courts. Drug courts are designed to select from the general criminal population nonviolent offenders who test positive for drugs, and put them through a program of court supervised drug treatment and rehabilitation. In this way, we can both aid first-time drug offenders by preventing them from becoming career criminals and provide localities the funds to enable them to control the serious backlogs in their criminal court caused by the drug crime wave. In the long-term, this solution to the drug plague promises to be less expensive than incarcerating these nonviolent offenders. 
   In 1991, I introduced similar legislation (S. 648), which was proposed by a  1990 study commissioned by the Philadelphia Bar Association entitled, ``Clearing the Road to Justice.'' This study found that state and local courts are overwhelmed by a large number of drug related crimes committed by first time offenders. The study concluded that a separate drug court division could both speed processing of drug related cases and provide mandatory drug screening programs to target first-time nonviolent drug offenders, and at the same time free up the rest of the court system to focus on violent criminals. 
   Congress enacted legislation to authorize a federal drug court grant program as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. However, in an action without any debate and that I believe reflected poor judgment, Congress repealed such authority in the Omnibus Consolidation Recessional and Appropriations Act of 1996 (PL 104-134). Although Congress rescinded the authority for this program, it has had been good sense to continue to appropriate some funds to the program by increasing funding from $11.5 million in 1995 to $40 million in 1999. 
   As a result of this federal funding, there has been a considerable increase in the number of drug courts in the United States. Since 1994, the total number of operating drug court program has grown from 42 to approximately 300. However, there is still not enough funding to adequately support the program despite the increased interest. Last year the Department of Justice received 216 grant applications, but was able to award only 88 grants. Justice reports that there were at least 38 additional programs that would have received grants had there been funding available. 
   During my travels in Pennsylvania, I have confirmed that there is a great deal of interest in implementing this program. Currently, there are six counties (Allegheny, Chester, Lycoming, Philadelphia, York, Erie) that are in various stages of planning and implementing drug court programs. I had the opportunity to speak to a number of prosecutors, judges and participants of these programs. They are very positive about their initial progress and very optimistic about the results that they will achieve in the future. 
   As a member of the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees, I have been an advocate of increasing funds for this program. I am committed to a balanced federal budget and realize that we must be careful in how we make federal expenditures. With this in mind, I have chosen this program carefully as one in which we should invest federal funds. I believe that Congress must step 
   up to the plate and commit to this program by authorizing it and appropriating sufficient funds to meet the growing demand for drug court alternatives. It is necessary that the criminal justice system and Congress face up to the fact that realistic rehabilitation must be a part of the process of drug treatment and crime reduction. 
   I believe that the drug courts are extremely effective in breaking the cycle of substance abuse and crime and will save large amounts of money that otherwise would have been spent on incarceration. With this program, first-time drug offenders may be prevented from becoming career criminals, and localities will be provided with funds to minimize the serious backlogs in criminal courts caused largely by drug crimes. The most recent Drug Court Survey Report, published by the Office of Justice Programs' Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistance Project at American University found that the drug court programs reported low recidivism rates between 2% and 20%. The survey also found significantly reduced drug use even among those who did not graduate from the programs, with as many as 93% of participants testing negative for drugs. Further, this alternative promises to be less expensive than incarcerating nonviolent offenders. Drug courts offer significant cost savings as compared to incarceration. According to the Drug Court Survey Report, the average cost for the treatment component of a drug court program ranges between $900 and $1,200 per participant, and savings in jail bed days have been estimated to be at least $5,000 per defendant. Additional reported savings include reductions in police overtime, witness costs and grand jury expenses. 
   While these statistics are very promising, they are not necessarily representative of all of the drug court programs. In 1997, GAO issued a report entitled ``Drug Courts: Overview of Growth, Characteristics and Results,'' which found that nearly half of the drug court programs do not maintain follow-up data regarding recidivism or relapse to drug abuse. Accordingly, GAO recommended that the Attorney General require drug court programs to collect and maintain follow-up data on recidivism and drug use relapse. This legislation includes a requirement for such follow-up so Congress can better determine the program's efficacy. 
   This legislation would authorize up to $200 million per year for this innovative program, the original level from the 1994 law. Additionally, in order to create greater flexibility for states and local governments to fund the drug court programs, this legislation would allow federal funds that are received from sources other than the Drug Courts Program Office to be counted as a part of the 25% grantee matching contribution requirement. The current Justice policy requires the grantee to contribute 25% of the total program costs--none of which can come from a federal source. 
   Additionally, the 1994 law required the Department of Justice to consult with HHS concerning administration of the drug court program, and although the drug court provision was rescinded, Justice has continued to consult with HHS in an informal manner regarding treatment programs. As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I recognize the important role that HHS can play in improving the treatment aspect of the drug court program. Accordingly, this bill would reinstate the requirement that Justice consult with HHS regarding administration of the drug court program and would authorize $75 million to be appropriated to HHS to be used for drug treatment services associated with drug court programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important program which provides an effective alternative to imprisonment for drug addicted nonviolent offenders.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been asked to make the opening comments on behalf of our distinguished majority leader. 
   This morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 434, the African trade bill. As a reminder, cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill was filed on Friday. Therefore, pursuant to rule XXII, that vote will occur tomorrow 1 hour after the Senate convenes unless an agreement is made between the two leaders. Later today, the Senate is expected to proceed to executive session in an effort to debate several nominations currently on the calendar. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate Chamber this morning to comment about the untimely passing of our distinguished colleague, Senator JOHN CHAFEE. 
   Senator CHAFEE died last night of heart failure, and I learned about it when I arrived in town this morning, at, I must say, a considerable shock. Senator CHAFEE sat next to me in the Senate. In addition to proximity, we were very close on many, many other lines. Senator CHAFEE leaves behind an extraordinary record as a great humanitarian, a great Senator, and a really great American. His political career is legendary--four terms in the Senate, elected in 1976, 1982, 1988, and again in 1994. Prior to that, he served three terms as the Governor of Rhode Island. His biography on the web site states that Senator JOHN CHAFEE is the only Republican to be elected to the Senate from Rhode Island in the past 68 years. 
   He brought a unique perspective to the Senate as a protector of the environment and as a firm advocate for expanding health care to every American. During the contentious days in 1993 and 1994 when the Senate was considering  the extension of health care, Senator CHAFEE organized a small group of centrists to meet in his office every Thursday morning at 8:30, and came forward with a very solid bill on health care. More recently, Senator CHAFEE was the leader of a group of centrists, both Republicans and Democrats, to come forward with a Patients' Bill of Rights. He had an understanding and a political breadth that led to accolades from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and from the American Civil Liberties Union. 
   He was the leader of a small group of centrists, also known as moderates, and he brought a degree of civility to this body and this Congress at a time when civility was sorely lacking. JOHN CHAFEE could walk into a room full of controversy and arguments, strike a middle course, and bring Senators and Members on all sides to a position of coalescence and accommodation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, listening to Senator BAUCUS, I am reminded of a couple of other items about Senator CHAFEE which I think ought to be mentioned. One is that he served as Secretary of the Navy, and, secondly, he served in the Marine Corps during  World War II and was part of the invasion of Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. 
   He was recalled during the Korean war. I had always wondered about the fairness of the World War II veterans being recalled during the Korean war. I served myself during the Korean war stateside as a special agent in the Office of Special Investigations of the Air Force. At that time, so many of my colleagues avoided military service by going off to law school or graduate school. I had noted at that time that so many veterans were so called. Ted Williams stuck in my mind, a great baseball player, who served during World War II and went off to the Korean war, cutting short his playing time. 
   I had a discussion with JOHN CHAFEE about that one day. I asked him about his views on being recalled to active service during the Korean war when so many were not serving at all. In his characteristic patriotic way he said, no, there was a job to be done and he was going to do it. He was glad to serve again in Korea, a marine in the toughest kind of work. 
   That was JOHN CHAFEE; always a great patriot and a great American.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to comment about a distinguished American who is retiring from service in the U.S. Senate. Charles Battaglia has been associated with me in the Senate for the past 14 years. He came to help me as an assistant when I served on the Intelligence Committee and stayed with me to become staff director of the Intelligence Committee during the 104th Congress when I chaired that committee, and then, in the 105th Congress, moved over with me to be the staff director when I chaired the Veterans Affairs Committee through the first session of the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. Battaglia has a distinguished record. Following graduation from Boston College, he served 25 years in the U.S. Navy, serving in the offices of the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, and the Naval War College. In 1978, Mr. Battaglia was selected by the Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Stansfield Turner, to be his special assistant at CIA. He received his MBA from Bryant University, and in 1991 completed the Kennedy School of Government's international security program, was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has an extraordinarily distinguished military record in the Navy, in the intelligence community and CIA, as an assistant on the Intelligence Committee, and later as staff director there. 
   He has earned retirement status. I might say we are making some effort to bring him back on a contract part-time basis to help with our inquiry into alleged espionage and other matters on oversight at the Department of Justice. 
   He has had an extraordinary record and become a personal friend of mine in the intervening 14 years. He has done great service for the military and as a member of the Senate family. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted in favor of cloture on the amendment denominated the Daschle amendment, which was the Shays-Meehan bill, because I believe comprehensive campaign finance reform is highly desirable. The bill, as embodied in the Daschle amendment, would eliminate soft money for all issue advertising. I believe that is sound. 
   I voted to oppose cloture to the Reid amendment, which would curtail soft money for issue advertising for only six committees: The Republican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Republican House Campaign Committee, and the Democratic House Campaign Committee. 
   It is my view that if soft money is to be prohibited on issue advertising, then soft money should be prohibited across the board. To approve the lesser provisions of the Reid amendment, which would affect only six political campaign committees, would be unfair, because other organizations could use soft money for issue advertising. 
   That is the distinction on my vote on the Daschle amendment where I voted for cloture contrasted with the Reid amendment where I opposed cloture. 
   Furthermore, I believe the comprehensive reform embodied in the Shays-Meehan bill is what ought to be adopted. The bill has another very important provision; and that is the provision relating to the changing of the definition of ``express advocacy'' and ``issue advocacy.'' At the present time, issue advocacy would incorporate an advertisement, which could detail the ways one candidate is bad, and his opponent is good. But as long as the ad did not say, ``Vote for the opponent; vote against the candidate,'' it is considered issue advertising. That is totally unrealistic. Shays-Meehan would make an important change on that provision. 
   I would add one caveat as to constitutionality. All of this is subject to some very stringent tests under the Buckley decision. I believe before we are going to get comprehensive campaign reform, we need to overrule the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. Valeo. 
   Senator HOLLINGS and I have proposed constitutional amendments now for more than a decade. I would not consider amending the language of the first amendment, but I disagree when a Supreme Court decision, made by a divided Court--says that money is equivalent to speech for the individual person but not for contributors. I ran in 1976 in a contested primary against my good friend, the late Senator John Heinz. In the middle of that campaign, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that an individual can spend millions, where my opponent spent a considerable amount of money--but as my brother he was limited to a $1,000 contribution. His speech as an individual contributor, was limited in the context, where my brother could have financed a campaign. Ultimately, we are going to have to change the Buckley decision. 
   To repeat, I would not change the language of the first amendment. But, I think other legal judgments, perhaps mine included, would be as good as the Supreme Court Justices who decided Buckley v. Valeo. 
   But I do believe that if there is to be a curtailment of soft money, it ought to be done as Shays-Meehan did it in the Daschle amendment; not with the Reid amendment, which would limit only six political committees and leave others in a position to finance soft money campaigns, which would be an uneven playing field and unfair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation designed to permit certain youths (those exempt from attending school) between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in sawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I introduced an identical measure at the close of the 105th Congress and am hopeful that the Senate can once again consider this important issue. Similar legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative JOSEPH R. PITTS, has already passed in the House this year.  
   As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased funding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, that accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from compulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is extremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be provided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer employment where they live. 
   The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish community. Last year, I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. They explained that while the Amish once made their living almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand into other occupations as farmland disappears in many areas due to pressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to rely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish culture expects youth upon the completion of their education at the age of 14 to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become productive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one of the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system limits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are currently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they reach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and lifestyle of the Amish. 
   In the 105th Congress, the House passed by a voice vote H.R. 4257, introduced by Representative Pitts, which was similar to the bill I am introducing today. I am aware that concerns to H.R. 4257 existed: safety issues had been raised by the Department of Labor and Constitutional issues had been raised by the Department of Justice. I have addressed these concerns in my legislation. 
   Under my legislation youths would not be allowed to operate power machinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as sweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires that the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris and wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult supervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to insure that they are enforced. 
   The Department of Justice stated that H.R. 4257 raised serious concerns under the Establishment Clause. The House measure conferred benefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious sect or division thereof whose established teachings do not permit formal education beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the ``benefit'' of working in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain religions, the Department argues that the bill appears to impermissibly favor religion to ``irreligion.'' In drafting my legislation, I attempted to overcome such an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all youths who ``are exempted from compulsory education laws after the eighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader focus is necessary to create a sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are legally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities. 
   I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in Wisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. Yoder held that Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law requiring children to attend school until the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise clause. The Court found that the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school beyond the eighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and practices of the Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be made with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their population grows and their subsistence through an agricultural way of life decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to the continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills denies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-reliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish do not need the final two years of public education. 
   I offer my legislation once again with the hope of opening a dialogue on this important issue. This is a matter of great importance to the Amish community and I urge its timely consideration by the Senate.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding. I support the treaty because I think the balance of risks are in favor of ratifying this treaty. It is not without risk, but it is not in perpetuity. The United States may withdraw at any time that it chooses. If we reject this treaty, it is an open invitation to other nations to test. I think that is a greater risk than the risks involved in ratifying the treaty. The events of the last 24 hours in Pakistan show the undesirability of having the Pakistanis test in their race with the nation of India, not to speak of the other nations, Iran, Iraq, North Korea. 
   I suggest the President of the United States call the majority leader of the Senate and try to work this out. More than that, of the Senators here, many who are opposed to the treaty think we should not vote it down. It is not over until it is over. I believe it is possible for the President to say to the majority leader what would satisfy the majority leader to take this treaty out of the next Congress. And I believe the majority leader could convene the Republican caucus--and we can do that yet this afternoon or into the evening on this momentous matter. I think it is still possible to avoid this vote to give extra time for security measures, to give extra time for testing, but not to cast a vote which will be a vote heard around the world to the detriment of the United States.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the question that I have for the Senator relates to the letter from President Clinton to our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, where President Clinton has asked that the Senate not consider consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I believe it is very much in the national interest that we not vote on the treaty today because it would undermine national security by sending a message to the world that we are not for this treaty. I think it would encourage nations such as India and Pakistan, and perhaps rogue nations such as Libya, Iraq, and Iran, to test. 
   But the first of two questions which I have for the Senator from Delaware is whether the President might go further. The Senator and I attended a dinner last Tuesday night with the President. We both had occasion to talk to the majority leader and have heard the public pronouncements. The majority leader has set a threshold, asking that the President commit in writing that he would not ask to have the treaty brought up next year. I believe we have to find a way to work this out so the treaty is not voted on. 
   The first question I have of the Senator from Delaware is, What are the realities of getting the President to make that request? He has come pretty close in this letter. Why not make that additional request?

   Mr. SPECTER. I had one more. 
   I believe I asked one question. I had one more. I would like leave to ask one more question. 
   The question I have for Senator BIDEN is, Is there any other way procedurally that this vote can be put off? We are considering the treaty. There is a unanimous consent request, and while I do not agree with what the Senator said in his first response--I believe the President can say more without being against the treaty. And I believe there are political considerations which are behind not having the matter brought up in fair consideration to Senator LOTT's request there be a commitment not to take it up all year. I think it highly unlikely that there would be a shift among Republicans on a procedural matter to find 51 votes--50 votes plus the Vice President. But we are dealing here with matters of extraordinary gravity. I hope this matter can be worked out short of a procedural vote. 
   But I direct this question to the Senator from Delaware, whether there is any other procedural alternative to getting this vote off the Senate agenda.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset, I compliment my distinguished colleague from Mississippi for the outstanding work that he has done as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations. 
   I have had the pleasure to work with Senator COCHRAN for some 19 years now. We have been on the subcommittee together for that time and the full committee for that time. There is no more difficult area in the Senate than working out a farm bill on the Agriculture appropriations bill because, candidly, the farmers are faced with so many problems. These are subjects very near and dear to my heart because I grew up in farm territory in the State of Kansas. I was born in Wichita and moved to Russell County, KS, when I was 12, worked on a farm as a teenager, drove a tractor, and have some firsthand experience with the problems which the agricultural community has. 
   I am very much concerned with a number of provisions in the bill. I declined to sign the conference report, and with great reluctance because of the hard work that the chairman has done and others have done. I intend to vote against the conference report, although I think there are enough votes present to pass it. There is a cloture motion pending. The issue has been raised as to whether there would be an attempt to filibuster. It may be that the issues can be worked out without a filibuster. I hope the issues can be worked out. But if the filibuster vote comes up I will vote against cloture to continue the consideration of this issue, even though I realize fully the importance of resolving our appropriations bills in the very immediate future. 
   The reasons that I am concerned about the provisions of the bill relate to two issues. 
   First, it is my view that Mid-Atlantic States, and my State of Pennsylvania specifically, have not gotten a fair share of the disaster assistance. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides for $8.7 billion in disaster assistance. But the vast majority of this money goes to farmers in the Midwest to compensate for low commodity prices. It may be that the disaster assistance is a broader category than you might expect, or perhaps the disaster assistance is modified by the fact that some $7.5 billion goes to the Midwest to compensate for low commodity prices. Only $1.2 billion is provided for natural disasters. That $1.2 billion must compensate not only for the drought but also the disasters including Hurricane Floyd, flooding in the Midwest, livestock loss, and fishery loss. Pennsylvania alone has sustained $700 million in drought loss. The Mid-Atlantic States have suffered $2.5 billion as a result of the drought this summer. 
   Year after year, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic Senators have supported massive aid packages to farmers in the Midwest--some $17 billion between August 1998 and June 1999. Now that the Mid-Atlantic farmers are facing a real crisis, my view is the Congress has not provided sufficient compensation. 
   There is another issue of concern; that is, the amendment which I was prepared to offer in the conference. Senator COCHRAN has accurately described the conference. It was rather anomalous. 
   At about 7:15, the House conferees asked for a recess of 10 to 15 minutes. And more than an hour and a half later they had not returned. 
   Although many of the conferees wanted to vote to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact and to allow Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia to join, the leadership in the House was opposed. I believe the Northeast Compact ought to be reauthorized, and a number of States, including Pennsylvania, ought to be permitted to join. 
   Without going into elaborate arguments, this is to provide price stability without any cost to the Government, but to the benefit of consumers. The price fluctuated from as much as $17.34 in December of 1998 to a little over $10 in January of 1999. With that kind of instability, it is very difficult on the farmers. 
   There is another issue about option 1-A which some 60 Senators and 240 House Members have recommended; contrary to that very large majority, the Secretary of Agriculture proposed a rule which was different, 1-B. Dairy compact legislation was offered on April 27, 1999, by Senators JEFFORDS and LEAHY. I joined with 40 cosponsors. When the Senate considered the issue of dairy pricing and compacts on August 4, 1999 on a vote for cloture, we received 53 votes--short of the 60 majority. 
   It is my hope yet we will work out the compact for the Northeastern United States and also the 1-A pricing. These are matters which impact very heavily upon my State and upon the farmers far beyond my State as a national matter. 
   With reluctance, I intend to vote against the conference report and to support the postcloture for extended debate to try to bring about greater equities. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me time at this time. 
   Mr. President, this debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may one day be classified as a historic debate. The issue which is being framed today, in my opinion, is the most important treaty issue, international issue which has faced this Senate since the Treaty of Versailles, which was rejected by the Senate, setting off an era of isolationism and, for many, enormous international problems resulting in World War II. 
   It is my hope this treaty will be ratified. I do not expect it to be ratified in a vote on Tuesday because the picture is clear that there are not enough Senators to provide the two-thirds constitutional balance. But it is my hope before that scheduled vote arises on Tuesday that we will have worked out an operation to defer the vote on this treaty. 
   I agree with my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator KYL, that a nuclear deterrent is vital for the national security of the United States. When he cites the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as being negotiated by the Clinton administration--really an idea of the Clinton administration--I would point to the statements of President Eisenhower more than 40 years ago when he articulated the national interest in a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
   In a speech on August 22, 1958, President Eisenhower said this:  
   The United States ..... is prepared to proceed promptly to negotiate an agreement with other nations which have tested nuclear weapons for the suspension of nuclear weapons tests. .....  
   In a very succinct statement in a letter to Bulganin, on January 12, 1958, President Eisenhower said:  
   ..... that, as part of such a program which will reliably check and reverse the accumulation of nuclear weapons, we stop the testing of nuclear weapons, not just for two or three years, but indefinitely.  
   It is hard to give a more emphatic bipartisan flavor than President Eisenhower's specific statements. 
   When the Senator from Arizona cites a list of six preeminent former Secretaries of Defense, I say that is, indeed, impressive. I would look to the assurances which we have today from Gen. Hugh Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, in analyzing the two basic issues which have been set forth in the parameters by Senator KYL. And they are: Can we assure stability of our stockpile? Can we reasonably verify compliance by others? 
   There is a balance of risks. There is no test which will be absolute in its terms. But the essential question on balancing the risks and balancing the judgment is whether we would be better off with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or without it. 
   The United States has an enormous lead on nuclear weapons. We have the nuclear deterrent. We have seen other nations--India and Pakistan--starting the test process. We have reason to be gravely concerned about North Korea's capacity with nuclear weapons. We worry about rogue nations such as Iraq, Iran, Libya, and others. So that, at least as I assess the picture, on a balance of risks, we are much better off if we limit testing than if we proceed to have testing. 
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program, I think, is reasonably effective. Is it perfect? No, it is not. The issue of verification, I think, is reasonably effective. It does not get some of the low-yield weapons. And activities are underway to try to solve that. 
   Secretary of Energy Richardson was in Moscow within the past week working with the Soviets on the so-called transparency test--illustrative of one of the efforts among many being undertaken to narrow the gap on verification. But again, it is a matter of balancing the risks. With or without the treaty, where are we better off? 
   I had an occasion to talk to Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, earlier this week. I asked General Shelton the details of these questions, about the stability of our nuclear stockpile and the verification procedures. General Shelton said that we were in good shape on both issues. 
   Then I asked General Shelton the obvious question: Was his view, was his judgment colored to any extent by being in the administration of President Clinton as President Clinton's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? It is not unheard of for even four-star generals to be a little concerned about what the Commander in Chief might prefer. General Shelton looked me in the eye and said: Senator, these are my honest views. If they weren't, I wouldn't state them; and rather than state views I didn't believe in, I could always retire. 
   I had occasion to talk at some length with Secretary of Defense William Cohen. It is true, as the Senator from Arizona outlines, at one point then-Senator Cohen had a different view. And as Secretary Cohen testified in hearings this week, a number of factors have led him to a different conclusion. 
   The question might also be raised as to whether the Commander in Chief of the Secretary of Defense might color, to some extent, his views. I am satisfied that Bill Cohen, with whom I worked in this body for some 16 years, would not put America at risk if he didn't believe what he said, that this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, balancing all considerations, was appropriate. 
   Once moving beyond the study of the treaty, which I have done, having announced my support for the treaty some time ago, after study and after looking at some of the experts, the question, in my judgment, is essentially a political question. I believe the lessons of history support arms control. That is a view I have held for some time. 
   I started my own personal studies of the United States-Soviet relations as a college senior, majoring in international relations at the University of Pennsylvania, and wrote my college thesis on United States-U.S.S.R. relations. One of the first resolutions I offered, coming to the Senate in early 1982, was a resolution for arms control. In 1982, Senators were pretty well lined up on philosophical grounds, those who favored arms control and those who did not favor arms control. 
   I recall that as a very tough debate against the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John Tower. Who  is ARLEN SPECTER to tell the President what to do in pushing for a summit agreement? Senator Tower put me through the paces, so to speak, and we talked about our nuclear deterrence. 
   Fortunately, I had been to Grand Forks, ND, taken a look at the Minuteman silo, absolutely terrified to see that enormous missile, looked down; about 100 feet into the ground it went. I had gone to Charleston, SC, to take a look at our nuclear submarines. I had been to Edwards Air Force Base to take a look at some of our latest bombers. The Senate decided with my position, on a vote of 90-8, we ought to have a summit. President Reagan was a major proponent of arms control, and President Reagan then pushed the summit concept. So the idea of arms control is not an idea which has originated with President Clinton, with President Eisenhower, President Reagan foursquare behind it. 
   I have not hesitated to buck the arms control concept if I thought the United States had some technical advantage to be gained by stepping out on our own, if that would promote our national security. Attending the Geneva arms control talks in the mid-1980s, I became persuaded that the Strategic Defense Initiative was a sound proposition, though very controversial, that turned on our ability to develop the SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, as to whether the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was subject to the broad interpretation or the narrow interpretation. 
   There were some very heated debates on the floor of the Senate. Senator MOYNIHAN was involved. Senator Nunn, a leading expert in the entire field, argued very strenuously for the narrow interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I argued for the broad interpretation, which I thought was legitimate, because it would give leave to develop the strategic arms initiative. That was a complex issue. Many people said it was Star Wars, spy in the sky, couldn't be done. 
   I recollected, historically, that Vanevar Bush, a leading expert in the field, testified before Congress during World War II, actually in 1945, that it would be ``impossible to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.'' Fanciful as it may have been in 1945, we now know they have been developed. 
   Then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said, in 1945, that the United States had such a tremendous lead, the Soviets could never catch us. He was wrong, too. They caught us and surpassed 
   us. We know the story that is not apocryphal, that a clerk in the Patent Office resigned at the turn of 19th century because there was nothing new to be discovered. I agreed with President Reagan's vision on the Strategic Defense Initiative that we spent a lot of money on it, and I don't think the money was wasted because we still are working and, more recently, with some success on missile defense. 
   In that context, President Reagan had an idea for control. President Reagan spoke out about sharing what we would learn with the Soviets to give them our defense system so there would not be an imbalance, so the nuclear deterrence on both sides, that balance of power, would not be affected. 
   I had occasion to have a long discussion with President Reagan on September 17, 1987, the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United States. President Reagan went to my hometown, Philadelphia. We had a long plane ride and a fair-sized car ride. I asked the President how he could see to it that the Soviet Union had our secrets when it really wouldn't be a matter during his Presidency and really it is a matter up to Congress. Candidly, President Reagan had no absolute answer to that point. But it was his vision that we would have the Strategic Defense Initiative and that we would share it with the Soviet Union. 
   When we take a look at the specifics and the technicalities, my sense is, there are reasonable assurances but it is a matter of balancing the risks. 
   We had a remarkable closed session of 5 hours in S-407 upstairs, which is the room where we have our secret briefings. After 5 hours, there was no doubt that it is a complicated subject. The distinguished chairman of the Arms Services Committee, Senator WARNER, came to the Republican luncheon caucus on Tuesday and said there is an adequate record to assure a negative vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I later had a chance to discuss with my distinguished colleague from Virginia the converse question. May the RECORD show he is on the floor now; nothing behind his back.

   Mr. SPECTER. We may come to that. 
   I will repeat the assurances that Senator WARNER gave me, that while he said there was an adequate record for a negative vote, he also said there was an adequate record for an affirmative vote, depending on how one looked at the evidence. So my view is, it comes down to a judgment call. It comes down to an issue which is essentially a political question as to how the national security of the United States is better served by relying on our superiority today and stopping other nations from achieving superiority. 
   I believe the United States would be well advised to move ahead to ratify this treaty and to show the world we still have a preeminent role of world leadership in moral terms as well as in armament terms. 
   We have the unprecedented event just this morning, where we have the op-ed piece appearing in the New York Times with the Prime Minister of Britain, the President of France, Chancellor of Germany, all urging this Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. 
   I had occasion to travel to Ukraine in August; I talked to the President of Ukraine, Foreign Minister, and other ranking officials. The ratification of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty was high on their agenda. Ukraine has taken a unique attitude in giving up nuclear weapons. Many nations around the world seek nuclear weapons as a sign of their national power. Ukraine is prepared to give them up. I asked the leader of that country why. President Kuchma responded: Well, we prefer the Japanese model of economic strength. Also, we have had the terrible experience at Chernobyl, and we do not want to have nuclear weapons for fear of what happened at Chernobyl. But high on the agenda of the Ukraine top officials is ratification by the United States. 
   Senator Hank Brown and I had occasion to travel to the subcontinent in 1995. We talked to Indian Prime Minister Rao. 
   He told us that he would be very interested in seeing the subcontinent nuclear free. A day or two later, we were in Pakistan talking to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and we related to Prime Minister Bhutto what Premier Rao had to say. She said, ``Did you get it in writing?'' We thought it was a little flip, perhaps. 
   We said, ``No,'' and countered with, perhaps, an equally flip question: ``When was the last time you talked to the Prime Minister of India?'' She said, ``We don't talk.'' Senator Brown and I said, ``Well, we think you should.'' 
   The next day, August 28, we had departed for Damascus. Senator Brown and I sent a letter to the President urging him to call into the Oval Office the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

   Mr. SPECTER. There is great power in the Oval Office. No one declines an invitation to the Oval Office--at least, I don't know of anybody who has declined an invitation to the Oval Office. I had occasion to speak to the President about it later in 1995, and he said he thought it was a good idea, but he wanted to defer it until after the 1996 election. I talked to him after the 1996 election, and he said he still wasn't ready to do it, and what would happen with China and India. 
   I am not going to criticize the President for not calling them in. I hope he will yet. But I think when India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in the spring of 1998, it was a very dangerous sign for the world. How can the United States ask India and Pakistan not to test nuclear weapons when we won't ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty? It simply doesn't make any sense. And that is why I think the national security of the United States would be enhanced on a balance of risks. It may not be perfect on verification, or it may not be perfect on the stability of our stockpiles, but whatever risk is involved there, I believe it is minimal. It is a small risk compared to having India and Pakistan test nuclear weapons and set off an arms race there that can be duplicated around the world. 
   The failure of the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has caused a ripple around the world. People wonder why the United States has not ratified this treaty. But if the Senate were to reject the treaty on a Senate vote, there would be a wave around the world, and it would be a tidal wave. What is now a ripple of wonderment would turn into a tidal wave of disbelief and could cause a chain reaction, which would be----

   Mr. SPECTER. To repeat my last thought, which might have been lost in the UC request, the failure of the United States, up to date, to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has caused a ripple of wonderment. A vote by the Senate rejecting the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty would cause a tidal wave of astonishment. It might set off a chain reaction around the world, which would be even more serious than the chain reaction of the atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 
   When we take a look at what is scheduled for next Tuesday, where we have the vote, it is my hope that we will find a way yet to work our way out of the unanimous consent request. I believe that a vote of rejection on Tuesday--and I have used this word before, and I use it advisedly, but I think it is accurate--I think rejecting the treaty would be catastrophic. 
   We are in a situation where our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, is unwilling to defer the vote if he is going to have to face a crescendo of demands during next year. Senator LOTT did not want to schedule the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty vote at this time. I know because I had asked him to do so. I had asked him to do so in private conversations. When he had given me his reasons, I awaited his judgment. There was substantial urging, maybe even 
   agitation, maybe even goading on the Senate floor by some that Senator LOTT should schedule this vote. He finally responded to it. He responded to it in a context where the treaty is assured to be defeated. 
   President Clinton held a dinner last Tuesday evening, which was attended by a number of people here, including Senators WARNER, BIDEN, HAGEL, myself, and others. I think it is fair to comment, as it has been in the media. 
   The President declined to ask that the vote be deferred on the condition that the President not ask that it be taken up all during the year 2000. I think the President felt that would signify backing off, and he thought some events might develop where he had to call for the treaty to be ratified. He said, candidly, he would have a hard time explaining it to our allies. 
   Well, I can understand Senator LOTT not wanting to see this matter become a political football in the year 2000. It has that potential, whether the parties intend it or not. If there is a crescendo of demand for the treaty to be ratified, taken up in the spring, fall, or summer of next year, it could have an affect on the election in 2000. I think it is realistic to take it out of the election. 
   Senator LEVIN, the distinguished ranking member of Armed Services, made a public comment in the hearings that he thought the treaty should not come up for ratification before the election. I think that is a sound judgment. There may be a way out of that dilemma by scheduling the treaty debate and vote on November 15 of the year 2000. That will take it out of the election cycle and it would allow President Clinton, who has advocated the treaty, to be a spokesman and have it decided on his watch. 
   There is another alternative, which is not as good as doing it in November of 2000, but that would be to schedule the debate and vote between January 3 and January 20 of 2001. We would not have a lame duck Senate, and it would be out of the election cycle. 
   I think it is very important to take this treaty out of politics and out of partisanship. There is an overhang that we should not ignore--a partisan overhang to this debate. All 45 Democrats are said to be in favor of the treaty. The number of Republicans is unknown precisely, but very, very limited. That is bad for America and that is bad for the world. When we had the vote on the use of force in the Gulf in January of 1991, it was largely partisan, where 42 Republicans and only 10 Democrats backed a Republican President. When we had a vote on the use of airstrikes in Yugoslavia earlier this year, it was 58 to 41. Only 17 of 55 Republicans joined the Democrats. That partisanship is highly undesirable. 
   I ask for one additional minute.

   Mr. SPECTER. Love doesn't last very long if it is only up to a minute. 
   I think there ought to be a recognition of another problem, which I will state in 20 seconds. There is a certain lack of trust between Capitol Hill and the White House, and that is a fact that we have to take into account in our calculations. Within 20 seconds, I can't recount why. 
   In conclusion--the two most popular words in any speech--I think we ought to avoid playing nuclear roulette with the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Russian roulette is a great sport, played with a revolver in which one chamber has the bullet. 
   But I think in this matter, we are playing with nuclear roulette if we go to a vote next Tuesday and reject this treaty. 
   I urge my colleagues to work hard to find a way to debate and vote this issue at a later time.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to respond to that question from the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee on a number of levels. 
   First of all, the clause is there, so that when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and others support the treaty because of the presence of that clause, that is a very important factor. And that clause is worth relying upon. 
   That is the reason, if there should be a problem either with the stability of our stockpile, or with the verification, and we felt it was necessary for national security to invoke that clause and withdraw, that we would do so. 
   With respect to other nations which might ratify the treaty based on our leadership, they do so with the full knowledge that that clause is present, and that we have the right to withdraw in our supreme national interest, so that if we should exercise the right of this entire affair in our dealings with those nations because they have known from the very outset that is a distinct possibility, there is nothing hidden about that. 
   When you ask the pointed question at the very end of the series of implicit questions, when you ask the question, how would it look for our national security if we made a concession that we had a test, and withdrew from the treaty, I would say to my distinguished colleague from Virginia that is no worse than if we did not have the treaty and we started to test. 
   The only reason we would exercise that clause and withdraw from the treaty would be so that we could start to test. 
   Assume that we don't have the treaty. Assume down the road that we start to test. That is going to be a loud signal, an explosive signal, to the world that we are not satisfied with the status quo when we have to test. 
   I think that exercising that clause would be no more emphatic or no more of a problem for the United States than not doing so. 
   But I think when you take a look behind General Shelton, and other Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs--General Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, David Jones, Bill Crowe, only Admiral Vessey, Chairman Vessey, was on the other side. 
   I think that is a very weighty consideration.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly, I think that Japan is well advised to rely on the United States and our nuclear deterrent for whatever risk there may be of pulling out. But Japan has, up to the present time, as the Senator from Virginia knows, relied upon the United States. 
   Japan has had ample opportunity to develop whatever nuclear system they could have wanted. They have made the decision to the present time not to. There is no reason to believe they are about to change, regardless of what the United States does. 
   However, when we talk about the withdrawal provision, that is not unique to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have debated repeatedly on the floor of this Senate the provisions of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which allows withdrawal on notice--again, for supreme national interests. So the insertion of this clause in the treaty is no signal that we are considering using it. I think that is a standard provision.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce that we will proceed now to the consideration of the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. The pending amendment is one offered by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM. 
   We are culling the list, and we have it now in reasonable shape so that I do believe that if we are able to have a  couple of very contentious amendments not acted upon and proceed promptly, we can complete action on this bill today. 
   The leader has asked me to announce that following completion of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, it is the intention of the leader to consider the Agriculture appropriations conference report, and the Senate may also consider any other conference reports available for action. 
   When we move beyond Senator ABRAHAM's amendment, the next amendment to be offered is by Senator BINGAMAN. It is hoped that we could get reasonably short time agreements. 
   I would ask if we may proceed now, as we had on so many matters yesterday, with a 30-minute time agreement equally divided on this pending amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate bill language, as it currently reads, is as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, no funds appropriated under this act shall be used to carry out any program of distributing sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that such programs are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the illegal use of drugs. 
   The amendment, which is now pending, would strike the discretion of the Secretary to make a determination that such a program would be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and would not encourage the use of illegal drugs. 
   This issue on needle exchange is a highly emotional issue. There is no doubt the reuse of needles by drug addicts does result in the infection of more people with HIV/AIDS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has never used this waiver language to make a determination that such programs are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of illegal drugs. There is dispute on whether clean needles would, in fact, prevent the spread of HIV and whether clean needles would--in fact, could--be used without the encouragement of the use of illegal drugs. 
   It is the view of the subcommittee and the full committee, which passed this in its present form, that question ought to be left open to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has never used this exception and is not likely to use it promiscuously but only if there was a very sound scientific base for doing so. My own preference is to continue the discretion of the Secretary to be able to make this waiver, if the facts and figures show that such a needle exchange would not encourage the use of illegal drugs, that such a legal exchange would prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
   There is some concern within the community that is interested in having needle exchange that raising this issue again may lead to some broader prohibition, which might even reach private groups. I think that is highly unlikely. But those are concerns that we are trying to resolve in deciding what step to take with response to the Abraham amendment.

   I think it is possible to have a time agreement. However, if the other side intends to talk at length--I do not want to inject the word ``filibuster'' into the discussion, but if the other side wishes to talk at length and is unwilling to enter into a time agreement, I do understand that; I do not understand that any matter is so complicated as to preclude a time agreement.

   Mr. SPECTER. I will speak since I have the floor and I am manager of the bill. 
   Mr. President, this issue has been the subject of very contentious debate for years. Last year in the conference committee in the House and Senate, we debated at great length; the year before, we debated at great length. There is no doubt about emotions running high. 
   The subject of ergonomics is an effort to have some way to stop repetitious motions which cause physical injury to workers. Many of the big companies have adopted procedures which will protect their employees because it is cost effective to do so in the long run. Small businesses face a little different situation, which I understand. The distinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee has offered this amendment. I understand the point he is making. 
   I point out that there have been many studies on the issue. In 1998, a peer review of the National Academy of Sciences involving 85 of the world's leading ergonomic experts found ``research clearly demonstrates'' that specific interventions can reduce or prevent musculoskeletal disorders. The 6-month study answered the same seven questions the National Academy of Sciences is now reviewing. 
   A 1997 review by NIOSH of 600 studies produced the same result and found that ergonomic solutions were being successfully applied in many work settings. During last year's negotiations,  Congress and the administration agreed, by funding the study, they did not intend to delay OSHA's ruling. House Appropriations Chairman Livingston and ranking member OBEY--I think, on the record--made it clear that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jack Lew, also concurred. We 
   have had a letter from the Secretary of Labor with a veto threat. That is not unusual. 
   However, I believe there is a balance which can be obtained to protect workers and not to unduly burden businesses, including small businesses. That is why, as chairman of the subcommittee involved in the conference for several years, I have tried to work this out so we can find a way not to overburden small business and at the same time to protect workers from these musculoskeletal problems. 
   Right now, the Office of Management and Budget has the regulation and we do not know what form it will finally take. But someday we have to come to grips with the issue and stop studying it. Studies are very important to find out what the facts are, and then we must act on the facts. When studies are used to interminably delay, it doesn't become a study; it is a filibuster by study on one side, as it is filibuster by an assertion that it is too complicated, too intricate, to be able to come to grips with it and decide. 
   We are sent here to try to decide the issues. It is my hope we can debate the facts, try to understand what the underlying issues are, and then try to find a consensus on public policy. At some date, we will have to go ahead and act one way or another on the protection of the workers. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, first let me commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for those very thoughtful remarks on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I share his concern about the timing of the vote. I think the Senate is not yet ready to vote. My view is that there should have been hearings a long time ago. I attended part of the hearings--closed-door hearings--in S-407 on Tuesday of this week. They lasted about 5 hours. 
   I concur with the Senator from West Virginia that it is a very complex subject. I had studied the matter and had decided to support it. But I do think more time is necessary for the Senate as a whole--not just to have a day of debate on Friday and a day of debate on Tuesday and to vote on it. I think the Senate ought to ratify, but only after adequate consideration has been given to it. While the United States has been criticized for not taking up the treaty, if we were to reject it out of hand on what appears to be a partisan vote, it would be very disastrous for our foreign policy. 
   So I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his customary very erudite remarks on the Senate floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. 
   The Davis-Bacon Act was passed in 1931, and it was enacted in order to see to it that the Federal projects would not pay lower than the prevailing wage rate in a given area. That is not necessarily a union rate, but may be a nonunion rate as well. The Federal Government has moved in this direction in order to assure the quality of the work that would be done. In order to have quality work done and to see to it that people in a local area receive the work, the Federal Government has established this standard. 
   Federal contracts are awarded on a low bid proposition, to who makes the lowest bid. If an out-of-area contractor were to come forward and make a lower bid, that would deprive people in the area of that employment and would not provide the kind of quality work that would be assured. 
   Robert Reischauer, head of the CBO, testified a few years ago that the payment of the prevailing wage rate is designed to help the Federal Government get the kind of quality necessary. This was the quote of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert Reischauer, when he testified before Congress on May 4, 1993.  
   Higher rates do not necessarily increase costs. If these differences in wages were offset by hiring more skilled and productive workers, no additional construction costs would be involved.  
   It is also important to note that Davis-Bacon creates a financial incentive for contractors to fund and support apprenticeship training by allowing them to pay employees in registered apprenticeship programs less than the prevailing wage rate otherwise required. 
   When we have had votes on this matter--and I have looked for a contested vote--as recently as 1996, there was bipartisan support to uphold Davis-Bacon. There is also a concern that if this exception were to be enacted on disaster areas, there would be a problem in finding skilled workers to come into the disaster areas and do the work. Thirty-seven States are involved in disaster areas, including my State of Pennsylvania; and if the prevailing wage rate were to be disrupted for the purposes of their Federal contracts, it would not be possible to get the same skilled laborers from the immediate area to come in and perform the necessary services. 
   As I say, Davis-Bacon has been enacted since 1931. It has a very important purpose--for the Federal Government to get quality work, including the considerations advanced by others on paying a fair wage. It has been challenged from time to time, and while I respect the arguments made by Senator SMITH, it seems to me that this amendment ought to be rejected. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, I think that Davis-Bacon is American. It has been American since 1931, almost as long as I have been in America; right about the same time. It has worked very well. 
   There is merit to what the Senator from New Hampshire has argued in some respects. But to say that it is not American, this has been the Federal law for a very long time.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for that statement. I have just a word or two to say about the same subject. 
   The White House made a comment--Mr. Lockhart--that I was one of three Republican Senators who voted for Judge White in committee and then voted against him on the floor. It is inaccurate to say I voted for him in committee because I did not. What happened was, the Judiciary Committee had a very abbreviated session off the floor and I went there to see if there was a quorum. When there was a quorum, Justice White was voted out of committee on a voice vote, but I was not present for that voice vote. 
   I was especially sensitive to Judge White because Judge Massiah-Jackson came before the Senate last year and withdrew her nomination in the face of very considerable opposition by the State District Attorneys Association. 
   So I took a close look at the letters, and even had a brief conversation with the ranking Democrat before casting my vote, which I did at the tail end of the vote on Justice White. 
   But contrary to what Mr. Lockhart of the White House said, and contrary to what has appeared in a number of press accounts, I did not vote for Justice White in the committee.

These savings would be realized as a result of a change in direction by HCFA for a managed care related project, and is not at all related to fee-  for-service Medicare. I understand the Senators' concerns and want to assure them Medicare contractor services will not be harmed. These savings of $30 million for HCFA's managed care project will not result in any related funding cut to the Medicare contractor budget. 
   I understand the issues both Senators are raising and the importance of adequately funding the Medicare contractor program. Let me assure my colleagues that the savings reflected in this bill will not hamper Medicare contractors' ability to fulfill their responsibilities as Medicare administrators.

The scientific research community believes that it is realistic to think that we will conquer Parkinson's in 5 to 10 years. Dr. William Langston, President of the Parkinson's Institute told the Subcommittee at the hearing that we have an historic opportunity with Parkinson's because the research is at a point where a focused, adequately funded effort will produce a cure. He also testified that once we understand and unravel Parkinson's, we will have answers to many other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease.

On two personal notes, I had said earlier that I had recused myself from consideration of the funding for the National Constitution Center because my wife is the director of development there. I want to repeat that and include, again, a copy of a letter to Senator COCHRAN who took over on that issue as the next senior ranking Republican. 
   I have one other item on a personal note. Senator INOUYE for some time has urged the naming of a building for me, which I had resisted. After my wife heard about it and the grandchildren, I have succumbed to the majority vote on the naming of the building the National Library of Medicine. 
   In conclusion, I hope we will have a very strong vote in favor of this bill. This bill stretches about as far as it can and is about as low cost as it can be with the chance of getting the President's signature. This is only one step along the way toward conference, and we need a very strong vote in favor of this bill if we are to take care of the important funding, especially for not only worker safety but health and education.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the very strong vote in support of this bill. I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN, ranking member, for his cooperation, for his leadership, and for his extraordinary diligence. We have had an extraordinary process in moving through this bill. 
   It is very difficult to structure funding for the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor which can get concurrence on both sides of this aisle. The bill came in at $91.7 billion. There have been some additions. It is hard to have enough spending for some, and it is hard not to have too much spending for others. I think in its total we have a reasonably good bill to go to conference. 
   The metaphor that I think is most apt is running through the raindrops in a hurricane. We are only partway through. We are now headed, hopefully, for conference. I urge our colleagues in the House of Representatives to complete action on the counterpart bill so we may go to conference. 
   We have already started discussions with the executive branch. I had a brief conversation with the President about the bill. He said his priorities were not recognized to the extent he wanted. I remind Senators that the Constitution gives extensive authority to the Congress on the appropriations process. We have to have the President's signature, but we have the constitutional primacy upon establishing the appropriations process at least to work our priorities. I am hopeful we can come to an accommodation with the President. 
   We have had extraordinarily diligent work done by the staff: Bettilou Taylor, to whom I refer as ``Senator Taylor,'' has done an extraordinary job in shepherding this bill through and taking thousands of letters of requests from Senators; Jim Sourwine has been at her side and at my side; I acknowledge the tremendous help of Dr. Jack Chow, as well as Mary Dietrich, Kevin Johnson, Mark Laisch, and Aura Dunn. On the minority staff, Ellen Murray has been tremendous, as has Jane Daye. 
   There is a lot more that could be said, but there is a great deal of additional business for the Senate to transact. I thank my colleagues for passing this bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce that the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Nickles amendment on the Labor-HHS bill regarding the Social Security trust fund. It is hoped that Senators who have filed amendments will work with the bill managers. What we propose to do is continue to alternate, and we are going to seek time agreements of 30 minutes equally divided so that we can move ahead and complete the bill. We have contentious amendments which are pending on both sides. We are working on the Republican side to try to have these amendments considered with very short time agreements, or reasonably short time agreements so that we can proceed. 
   We have the obligation to finish this bill, or at least the expectation of finishing this bill by the close of business tomorrow. There are dinners both Wednesday evening, this evening, and tomorrow evening which will keep our sessions not too long unless we establish a window, which we will have to do. And if a window is established, that means very late night sessions if we are to recess from 6:30, 7 o'clock, 8:30 or 9 o'clock. That is something to be avoided. We have culled down the amendments, and we think we are in a position to move ahead very promptly. 
   The leader has asked me also to announce that the Senate may consider conference reports to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill and any other conference reports available during this week's session of the Senate. 
   Until one or two other Senators arrive, I would like to take a moment or two to comment about another matter of business, a very important matter, and that is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the President invited a number of Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to the White House last night for dinner, including the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, who is now presiding. I had expressed a view publicly before the dinner began that I thought the vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should be deferred; it should not be held on Tuesday. I have stated that position because it is plain that there are not enough votes in the Senate to pass the treaty. I favor the treaty. I said so publicly some time ago. I think it is also not timely to take up the treaty on the existing schedule because of the complexity of the issue. 
   Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee held 5 hours of hearings. I attended part of them. The subject matter is very complicated. It is my judgment that Senators are not really prepared to vote on the matter and that the vote may take on partisan overtones, political overtones, party partisan overtones, which I think would be very undesirable. 
   It has been reported publicly that all 45 Democrats are in favor of the treaty; that there are only a very few Republicans who are in favor of the treaty, and that many Senators on both sides have really not had an opportunity to study the treaty in depth to have positions which might lead some to disagree with the party position.  
   It is my thinking that it would be calamitous--a very strong word, but I think that is the right word--if the Senate were to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. At the present time around the world, many eyebrows are raised because the Senate has not ratified the treaty. But if the Senate were to reject the treaty, then it would be highly publicized worldwide. It would be an open excuse for countries such as India and Pakistan to continue nuclear testing, which I think is very undesirable, destabilizing that area of the world, and give an excuse for rogue nations such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and other rogue nations to test, and it would be very undesirable. 
   It is a complicated issue because our distinguished majority leader has scheduled the vote under a unanimous consent agreement with the minority leader after very substantial pressures have been building up with many floor statements demanding a vote. 
   The majority leader gave them what they asked for, and it was agreed to. It is not an easy matter to have that unanimous consent agreement vitiated. Any Senator can object to the vote. We will go ahead and schedule it. The administration has expressed the view it does not want to make a commitment to have no vote during the year 2000. The leader has propounded a substitute unanimous consent agreement, as I understand it--I wasn't on the floor at the time--which would vitiate the unanimous consent agreement on the condition that no vote be held in the year 2000. 
   The administration takes the position if they were to agree to that, or go along with it, that it would look as if they were backing off the treaty and it would be complicated for other world leaders as to how the administration would explain that kind of a position when we were pressing other nations to stop nuclear testing and to end proliferation. 
   It may be the matter is really for the Senate without the administration. We set our own schedule. Perhaps a group of Senators representing both Democrats and Republicans could take the responsibility to oppose a vote during the year 2000. 
   Another idea which occurred to me this morning was to have a vote in the year 2000 but have it after the election so the treaty does not become embroiled in Presidential politics. One of the key Democrats expressed the view that he would oppose considering the treaty in the year 2000 because it would become embroiled in Presidential politics and surely lose. 
   If a debate were to be scheduled by mid-November and then a vote held in November that could accommodate the interests of not having it involved in a Presidential campaign and still give President Clinton an opportunity to have the treaty decided upon during his tenure as President with him being in the position to advocate. 
   I make these comments because I think with the schedule for debate on Friday and then again on Tuesday and a scheduled vote on Tuesday that time is of the essence--in this case very much the essence, not unlike that expression which has arisen in real estate transactions--that there are very serious international implications. 
   I know many Senators will be following up on the dinner meeting of last night by communicating with our distinguished majority leader and by communicating with people on both sides to see if we can accommodate all of the competing interests. 
   We are facing one of the most important votes of our era. It will set back arms control and nonproliferation very substantially if this treaty goes down. If after study and deliberation and an adequate time for debate the treaty is rejected, so be it. That is constitutional process. But to have it go down with the kinds of pressures to schedule it, and a schedule which has been entered into knowingly with leaders on both sides having unanimous consent agreements all the time, and any suggestion that there is any inappropriate conduct on anybody's part is totally unfounded. That is the way we operate. But, as I view it, it is an unwise course for the reasons I have stated.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the consensus has been clear cut that Social Security trust funds ought not to be invaded. The pending Nickles amendment recites that the Congress and the President should balance the budget excluding the surplus generated by the Social Security trust funds. That is really agreed upon, I think on all sides. 
   The second finding is that Social Security surpluses should be used only for Social Security reform, or to reduce the debt held by the public, and should not be spent on other programs. That is generally agreed upon. 
   Then the sense-of-the-Senate clause: It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an onbudget deficit, excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security trust funds, by adopting an across-the-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit, if necessary. 
   The sense of the Senate is not binding, as we all know; it is what we think ought to be done. 
   I do not like the idea of reducing the discretionary spending, although I think the figures cited by the Senator from Iowa are extreme. I don't think we are looking at a 5-percent across-the-board cut, which would have a deep impact on Head Start, which we ought not to do, or a deep impact on NIH, which we ought not to do. 
   In proposing this amendment, Senator NICKLES seeks to put the Senate on notice--and appropriately so--that we had better come within the confines, and not exceed the caps, and not go into Social Security. I think that is an appropriate objective. 
   When the Senator from Iowa articulates proposals for savings in quite a number of other directions, I don't think they are realistic. I don't think the Congress is going to cut defense by $4 billion. When he articulates the view about penalizing tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking by $6 billion, that is a laudable objective, if we can find more tobacco money. It is  too bad we don't have some of the money which was worked out on the $203 billion settlement for the Federal Government. But I don't think that is likely either. Reducing waste, fraud, and abuse is the most lofty objective the Congress can articulate. But finding the money to achieve that is so hard. 
   While I have worked very closely with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, I don't really think those figures are realistic. I don't think we are going to reduce Head Start. I don't think we are going to reduce NIH. But there is a stick. It is a stick to stay within the budget limitations. 
   Among a great many alternatives which are undesirable, I believe the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolution is the least undesirable. So I am going to support it. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   I ask unanimous consent the pending first- and second-degree amendments be laid aside and the Senate now proceed to the conference report to accompany the foreign operations bill and there be 1 hour for debate equally divided; the conference report should be considered read.

If the managers insist on taking the full hour,  then the vote will start at 12:15. But it is hoped, so we can move this bill along, to repeat, that we can have the time yielded back and start the vote as early as 11:45.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am interested in the comment by the Senator from New Jersey about ``he is not a lawyer, but'' with respect to what has been offered on the floor of the Senate. I would suggest that if the Presiding Officer were a judge and was looking for competent evidence, evidence that had a factual basis, the speeches would be much shorter in this Chamber. 
   One of the things I have been impressed with over the years is the difference in the kinds of assertions--on both sides of the aisle. I am not referring to anything the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has said. But when he talks about the authenticity of representations of fact, this body takes extraordinary liberty in what is represented as fact. When it comes to the numbers, my preference would be--and I know the Senator from New Jersey did not use the expression ``lying  about the numbers,'' it is some budget expert--but I do not think a comment about lying, suggesting untruthfulness, is very helpful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for that. I walked in a little late and hadn't heard him say that. Maybe he repeated it. I respect the comment that there are different views. But to have a chart about lying, when the matters are subject to widespread disagreements as to how you calculate numbers, I would be very critical of budget expert Stan Collender--not critical of Senator LAUTENBERG--for using the expression ``lying.'' I don't think that advances the ball very much. 
   I agree with a great deal of what is in the Lautenberg amendment. I agree we ought not cut Head Start, education, VA hospitals, border patrols, transportation, environmental funding, defense funding. I think that is exactly right. But when the Senator from New Jersey comes down to the sense of the Senate and says we should avoid using budget scorekeeping gimmicks, close special interest tax loopholes, and use other appropriate methods, starting with the budget loopholes--the President's budget had more than $20 billion of advance funding. Advance funding, regrettably, has become a commonplace practice that has been engaged in on all sides. I think the precedent and the custom are used generally and not subject to criticism from someone who uses them. 
   When the President submits a budget with a tax increase of 55 cents a pack on cigarettes resulting in revenues of $6.5 billion, I might support that kind of a tax increase, but it is not money in the bank. It is pie in the sky. It is not even Confederate money. It doesn't exist anywhere. So when the President includes that in his budget, that is hardly a subject to criticize Republicans on grounds of gimmickry. 
   When the advance funding is accepted that the President uses, and the Republicans have used it, too, but you can't have a tax increase to pay for discretionary programs under the Balanced Budget Act. I don't know if that is a very good provision, but I do know it is the law. I do know it is a law the President signed. So when the sense-of-the-Senate resolution calls for eliminating gimmicks and you have that approach--I won't call it gimmickry; why disparage the administration; just call it ``that approach''--it hardly is valid. 
   Then the final line on the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey is ``and by using other appropriate offsets.'' I am all for appropriate offsets, but what are they? Where are they? 
   I think what we have to do--and we are still struggling on this--is to bring our appropriations bills within the caps, not to cut Social Security. I agree totally with the Senator from New Jersey on not touching Social Security. I think that is an accepted conclusion on all sides. 
   We are struggling with this bill, and we have a lot of amendments yet to be offered. This is a very massive bill, $91.7 billion. This bill was crafted in the subcommittee, the full committee, to take the maximum load that could be borne on this side of the aisle. I may be wrong about that. My distinguished colleague from Oklahoma raises some significant questions with me about the propriety of that amount of money. 
   Well, we have to really, my metaphor is, run between the raindrops in a hurricane to find a bill which shall be passed by this body and go to conference with the House and can be signed by the President. I had occasion to have a word or two with the President about this bill last night, when we were talking about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The President doesn't like the 
   bill because it takes out a lot of his programs. 
   The Constitution gives some authority to the Congress on appropriations--a little more expressed, explicit authority to the Congress than to the President, although the President has to sign the bills, but we do have some standing. So when we disagree with some of the priorities and have added $2.3 billion to education and are $500 million more than the President, we are trying to fit this bill within the budget constraints and within the caps which we have. 
   While we have dueling sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, I intend to vote against the resolution offered by the Senator from New Jersey. I voted for the resolution offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. I think, in all candor, that neither of these resolutions advances this bill a whole lot. What we have to deal with on this bill are the hard dollars and the specific programs. In the interest of moving the bill ahead, I will inquire how much time I have remaining in anticipation of yielding it back.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the arguments by the Senator from South Dakota. When he talks about Democrats being locked out, certainly he isn't talking about this bill. The ranking member and I worked on this bill in a collaborative partnership. I don't know if he is referring to other bills or just this bill, but there was no lock out here. When the Senator from South Dakota objects to across-the-board cuts and says--may we have order, Mr. President--that we ought to take a look at matters one by one and make the tough choices, we ought to have the offsets, I would certainly be in favor of that. 
   If the Senator from New Jersey had made specific requests on offsets, I would have been glad to vote on them one by one instead of saying ``other appropriate offsets.'' If he had identified special interest tax loopholes, I would have been prepared to vote on those one by one instead of the generalization. But I think it is worth noting that on this bill nobody on that side of the aisle has made any suggestion for any offset--not at all. 
   We added to block grants $900 million by an amendment from the Senator from Florida. We had $900 million offered from day care and added to the bill by the Senator from Connecticut. We had $200 million offered but rejected by the Senator from California for afterschool; $200 million offered but rejected on class size by the Senator from Washington. We have amendments pending now by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, $3 billion for disadvantaged education; $3 billion for Head Start. Other amendments, the Senator from Massachusetts, $200 million on one; the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, $200 million on another. 
   I think those are all very worthwhile programs. But it hardly lies in the mouth of those on the other side of the aisle to talk about hard decisions of offsets when they don't talk about any offsets and they don't talk about any hard decisions. They don't talk about specifics. 
   I don't like across-the-board cuts, either. I have said so. I don't think we are going to have across-the-board cuts. I think that is the sword of Damocles which is hanging over this appropriations process to keep us within the caps. But we have hardly heard of any offsets or any tough decisions on the other side of the aisle. 
   I yield the floor.

I can personally vouch for the fact that we are striving mightily on a conglomerate of 13 bills to come within the caps. I am personally opposed to the cuts across the board, as I have already said. When the Lautenberg amendment was argued a few moments earlier this afternoon, I said if there were specific proposed cuts, we ought to take them up one at a time. I hope we don't get to that either. If we do get to cuts, I think that education ought to be preserved. 
   This bill has an increase in education of $2.3 billion, some $500 million more than the President's budget. That reflects the concerns that the distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, and I have had. If there are to be cuts, I would want to exclude education. 
   It is true that it becomes difficult, once something is excluded, to not want to exclude other items. I would not want to see a cut in NIH. It hardly makes a lot of sense to add $2 billion to NIH if it is going to be cut almost $1 billion. Senator HARKIN and I probably would have increased it $3 billion in that case. 
   The Senator is laughing. It is good to have a laugh in the middle of the afternoon. 
   But what we have to do is avoid across-the-board cuts. If it comes to that, then we will start to make exclusions, and we are making choices to have other cuts instead of these cuts. Then when we start to exclude virtually everything, we will ultimately have to come down to what cuts are necessary if these 13 appropriations bills do not come within budget. 
   Mr. President, I see no other Senator on the floor seeking recognition. How much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt about the importance of teacher quality enhancement. Teachers are the backbone of the educational system. There is no doubt about the importance of education. It is a truism that education is a priority second to none. The bill that has been presented on the floor by the distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, and 
   myself through subcommittee and full committee has recognized the importance of education in that we have increased education funding by $2.3 billion this year over last year's appropriation. It is now in excess of $35 billion on the Federal allocation. Bear in mind that the Federal Government funds only about 7 percent of education nationwide. 
   When we talk about teacher quality enhancement, this is a program which is a very new program. It was not on the books in fiscal year 1998. For the current year, fiscal year 1999, we have an appropriation in excess of $77 million. When we took a look at it this year, we provided a $3 million increase. This is a matter of trying to recognize what the priorities are. 
   The President had asked for $115 million, and we thought that in allocating funds on a great many lines--title I, Head Start, and many other very important education programs--the proper allocation was $80 million. Now, when the Senator from Massachusetts comes in and asks for an increase of some $220 million, he is requesting $185 million more than the President's request. It would be an ideal world if our funding were unlimited. But what we are looking at here--and we have had very extensive debate today on whether the budget is going to invade the Social Security trust fund. I think this Senator, like others, has determined that we do not invade the Social Security trust fund. 
   We had debated whether or not there ought to be a pro rata increase or a decrease, if we ran into the Social Security trust fund, to make sure we didn't use any of the Social Security moneys, or whether, as the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, offered in an amendment, to have other targeted cuts. My view is that we have to structure this budget so we don't cut into the Social Security trust fund. 
   Senator STEVENS was in the well of the Senate earlier today, and I discussed the matter with him. We are trying to structure these 13 appropriations bills so we don't move into the Social Security trust fund. But if we make extensive additions, as this amendment would do, adding $220 million, as I say, which is $185 million more than the President's request, it is not going to be possible to avoid going into the Social Security trust fund. 
   We have already had very substantial increases in funding on this bill. We have a bill of $91.7 billion, which is as much as we thought the traffic would bear on the Republican side of the aisle, realizing that we have to go to conference with the House which has a lower figure, and realizing beyond that, that we have to get the President's signature. We have already had $1.3 billion added to the $91.7 billion for block grants. We have had $900 million added for day care. Now, if we look at another amendment for $220 million, it is going to inevitably at one point or another break the caps. 
   These are not straws that break the camel's back. These are heavy logs which will break the back, and it is not even a camel. 
   Much as I dislike opposing the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts, I am constrained to do so in my capacity as manager of this bill. 
   In the course of the past week, I have voted against more amendments on funding for programs that I think are very important than I have in the preceding 19 years in the Senate. But that is the responsibility I have when I manage the bill--to take a look at the priorities, get the allocation from the Budget Committee, have a total allocation budget of $91.7 billion, and simply have to stay within that budget. 
   Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is remaining on the 45 minute time agreement.

   Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce that we will now begin 30 minutes of debate on the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, regarding diabetes. Following that debate, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the amendment at approximately 9:30 a.m. 
   The Senate is expected to continue consideration of the Labor-HHS bill during today's session. Senators who still intend to offer amendments to the bill are encouraged to work with the managers to schedule time for those amendments. Following the Labor-HHS bill today, there will be a period of 
   morning business. 
   The leader advised me last night that the Senate will be proceeding to other business on Monday and Tuesday and that we will return to the Labor-HHS bill on Wednesday. 
   There are a great many amendments pending. As the chairman of the full committee announced yesterday, it is his intention, and for that matter, mine, too, to challenge any amendments which violate rule XVI; that is, to offer legislation on an appropriations bill. I encourage all Senators to consult with me or have their staffs consult with committee staff to work out time agreements and sequencing so that when the amendment is called we can move to it as promptly as possible. 
   The leader called my attention to the fact that following next week's session, we will be on the holiday for Columbus Day, so there may be some motivation for people to want to get the Senate business in order to be concluded as promptly as possible before the start of that 3-day weekend. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, for offering this amendment. I agree with her that the amendment will appropriately  focus attention on the problems of diabetes, especially among the young people in America. 
   I thank Senator COLLINS for noting the work of the subcommittee and the full committee in moving ahead with funding on this important ailment and, as she noted, with the very strong language that is present in the bill encouraging the National Institutes of Health to move forward. 
   I think it appropriate to note for the record that on June 22 of this year we had a special hearing on diabetes. At that time, we had testimony from officials at the National Institutes of Health, the Director, Dr. Harold Varmus; Dr. Phillip Gorton, the Director of the Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; as well as a number of others. 
   It is very important to put a human face on the issue, as Senator COLLINS did with the specific reference in her speech to the youngsters. At that time, we had coming forward the celebrity, Mary Tyler Moore, a juvenile diabetic; Mr. Tony Bennett, the famous singer, the grandfather of a child with diabetes; Mr. Alan Silvestri, a composer and father of a child with diabetes; and also our distinguished colleague, Senator STROM THURMOND, who has a daughter with diabetes. 
   It is a curious factor, but a fact of life nonetheless, that when people of celebrated stature come and testify, there is more public understanding of the ailment and more willingness to face up to it in the appropriations process. 
   In order to carry forward on what this sense-of-the-Senate resolution requests--and I feel confident in predicting it will pass 90-something to nothing; the only open question is how many Senators will be present to vote for it; I think it will be a unanimous vote, but our ability to carry that forward depends upon what we appropriate. 
   In the bill currently pending, we have an increase in NIH funding of $2 billion. That is a tremendous sum of money. We have a bill which is $4 billion higher than last year's bill, with the funding coming largely for education, where we have an increase of $2.3 billion. In assessing the priorities in education, we have put in more than $500 million more than the President's request. We have in excess of $35 billion for education. 
   When it comes to health care, Senator HARKIN and I have taken the lead in adding $2 billion, as we did last year. When we have assessed those priorities, it has made it necessary to reduce funding on some other proposals. I found myself in a very unique position in managing this bill. I have voted against amendments I never voted against before. I voted against an amendment to add $200 million on class size, which I would like to have supported. The bill continues the funding at $1.2 billion. If we added the $200 million on class size, in addition to the $1.2 billion, there would not be room for funding for NIH, for programs such as diabetes. 
   Then we had an amendment come up on afterschool programs, again, a request for $200 million more. There is $200 million in the current budget, and Senator HARKIN and I took the lead of adding $200 million to bring it to $400 million. I would like to have more for afterschool programs, but I had to vote against that amendment, because if we add $200 million more to afterschool programs, it has to come from some place. And NIH is a big target out there. The amendment adding the $200 million for afterschool 
   programs was offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER. 
   Then Senator DODD offered an amendment to add about $900 million more to day care. I have always supported. But again, when you have a bill of $91.7 billion, which is at the breaking point as to what this body will pass--and I think there is a question as to whether we will have 51 votes for that because it is a lot of money, although staying within the caps--again with great reluctance, I could not support Senator DODD's amendment on day care. 
   Then we had a very important social service block grant, again where it is a matter of priorities. When it comes to health, I believe there is no higher priority. I have said with some frequency that the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government. 
   In my position as chairman of the subcommittee, which has the baseline responsibility to fund the National Institutes of Health--and Senator HARKIN has the same consideration--we receive requests constantly from people who have Parkinson's--we had a hearing this week on Parkinson's disease. We had a hearing on prostate cancer, a special concern on breast cancer, heart ailments, a very large number of unknown diseases. 
   I said on the floor yesterday that Senator HARKIN is very frequently lobbied when he gets on the plane between Washington and Des Moines. I find a lot of people with unique ailments on the Metroliner between Washington and Philadelphia. 
   As Senator COLLINS has brought forward the issue this morning, I think it is a very profound message. But to accomplish what Senator COLLINS seeks, we have to appropriate the increase of $2 billion. Even then, if there are 10 doors with research projects behind them, 7 of those doors will not be opened, even with funding NIH at a level of $17.6 billion. 
   So again, I thank my colleague from Maine--carrying on the great tradition of Maine Senators. 
   I yield the floor, leaving her the remainder of the time before 9:30 to close. 
   Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when we concluded yesterday afternoon, the ranking member and I talked about a unanimous-consent agreement for all amendments to be filed. We had talked about 12 noon today, and there was concern that since the announcement was made late in the day, Senators would not have an opportunity to understand that since many had gone home. But it is my expectation that when Senator HARKIN arrives, we will confer and try to pick a time when we will ask unanimous consent that all amendments be filed.

   Mr. SPECTER. The essential point on the amendment of the Senator from California is to add $200 million to afterschool programs. I believe afterschool programs are very valuable, and I have supported afterschool programs in the past. In fact, in collaboration with Senator HARKIN, we included $200 million in addition to the $200 million now allocated for afterschool programs. This is an enormous increase on a program that just 3 years ago was at $1 million, then increased to $40 million, then to $200 million, and we have doubled it this year to $400 million. It is an integral part of the school violence prevention initiative. 
   In crafting this bill, which comes in at $91.7 billion, Senator HARKIN and I have made an assessment of priorities among some 300 programs. And while we would like to have more money for afterschool programs--we would like to have more money for many programs--it simply is not possible to do it. 
   In crafting this bill, which will be passed by the Senate, to get at least 51 votes, there is very considerable concern on my side of the aisle about a bill with $91.7 billion. Then we have to go to conference. Then we have to find a bill which the President will sign. The metaphor is, it is like running between the raindrops in a hurricane. So it is  with reluctance I must oppose the Boxer amendment; it is not realistic to do it. 
   Some have argued that the $200 million advocated yesterday by Senator MURRAY, which was defeated, or the $200 million sought to be added by Senator BOXER would dip into Social Security. I am not going to make that argument because no one really knows that. We are determined to craft a total appropriations package which is within the caps. In order to accomplish that, there has to be advance funding. Of course, the Boxer amendment provides for advance funding as well. But at some point, if there is sufficient advance funding going into the projected $38 billion in surplus for fiscal year 2000, even on the advance funding line, Social Security will not be intact, and I think there is agreement that we have to protect Social Security and Medicare, that our expenditures even on an advance line cannot go beyond. 
   I note my distinguished colleague from California is ready to present her case, so I yield the floor.

For the record, I ask unanimous consent the time restraints outlined in the previous consent agreement apply to the Boxer amendment, with a vote to occur at 10 o'clock.

   Mr. SPECTER. We thank the Senator more for the accurate identification than the congratulations. My vote against it was based upon concern of what the surplus would be. 
   I think it ought to be noted the President has come forward with a proposal for a tax cut of his own. It is not a tax cut of the magnitude passed by the Senate and the House, but he has come forward with a role for a tax cut. 
   Back to the issue on more money for afterschool programs. I think it is very important to consider this issue in the perspective of what has happened with this program which was created as recently as 1994. For the fiscal year 1995, enacted in 1994, the last year when the Congress was controlled by the Democrats, the afterschool program was $750,000. The next year it was $750,000. In fiscal year 1997, it went to $1 million. In 1998, when I chaired the subcommittee and Senator HARKIN was ranking, we raised it to $40 million. Last year, we raised it to $200 million. This year, we are raising it another $200 million. I believe there has been a real recognition of the value of the afterschool program. 
   The Senator from California and I had an extended debate yesterday afternoon on the question of whether there would be a 
   request for more money. Had we added $400 million, there would still have been many applications and many meritorious applications. Among the total number--there were some 2,000 applications--only 184 were granted. That brings me to the conclusion that regardless of what we craft in a bill and how much money we add for afterschool programs there will be an effort by someone to up the ante so that no figure is satisfactory. 
   Someplace the line has to be drawn. The overall education budget, which the subcommittee recommended and the full committee recommended and is now before the Senate, increases educational funding over last year by $2.3 billion--$2.3 billion. It is more than $500 million more than the President's request. When we take education in the  aggregate, we have done more than President Clinton has asked. When we go down to some of the specific items, we have not put quite as much as he wants into some programs. He asked for the program on preparing disadvantaged secondary high school students for college, GEAR UP; he asked for an increase from $120 million to $240 million, doubling it. We increased it to $180 million, $60 million over last year's funding level. 
   However, the Congress has the principal responsibility in the appropriations process under the Constitution. It is true the President has to sign the bill, but we are the baseline appropriators. While we have disagreed on some of the priorities, I believe that Senator HARKIN and I have crafted a bill, which the subcommittee accepted and the full committee accepted, that is a realistic and appropriate allocation of those priorities. It is for that reason, as much as I like afterschool programs, there has to be some limit before we go into Social Security, some limit considering how much we have added to education.

   Mr. SPECTER. If I may have the attention of the Senator from Delaware, I do believe it is important for the Senate to consider the treaty. I support it. I believe it is very difficult for the United States to use moral suasion on India and Pakistan not to have nuclear tests if we have not moved forward on the ratification process. 
   However, I ask my colleague from Delaware about the problems of considering the treaty on this state of the record where we have been looking for some expert guidance on some questions which are outstanding as to whether there can be an adequate determination of our preparedness without having tests. 
   One thing we have to consider very carefully is whether the interests of disarmament will be promoted by pressing to bring the treaty now, which may result without the two-thirds ratification, as opposed to trying to clear up some concerns which some have expressed. 
   I am prepared to vote in favor of the treaty.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered and argued by the Senator from Nevada because the subcommittee worked out a very carefully crafted set of priorities, joined in by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, my distinguished ranking member. In structuring a bill of $91.7 billion, we had to take into account many programs, some 300 programs. There is difficulty in having this bill accepted with 51 votes considering the expenditures involved. 
   We have given priority to items such as education where the bill is $500 million in excess of the President's request. We have given priority to programs for the National Institutes of Health and raised $2 billion. We have had to cut some programs which I, frankly, did not like to see cut. But we have established the priorities. 
   With respect to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, we have increased their funding by $10 million, from $340 million to $350 million. This year's allocation of $340 million was an increase from $300 million the year before and an increase from $250 million the year before that. It is true that back in 1992, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting had an allocation of $327 million and it has gradually been built up. I have been supportive of public broadcasting. The question is on priorities, and it is my judgment that in a tight fiscal year with tight budget constraints that we have been reasonably generous with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
   On another matter I think ought to be commented upon, although it is not the reason for opposing the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, is the finding by the inspector general of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that 53 of the 591 public broadcasting grantees exchanged donor lists with or rented them to political organizations, which is a matter of some consequence. Earlier this year, the Boston Globe reported that the local public television station in Boston, WGBH, exchanged its donor list with the Democratic Party. There were other media reports about exchanges involving public broadcasting with WNET in New York, WETA in Washington, DC, and WHYY in Philadelphia. 
   Steps have been taken by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop that practice, but I do think it is a factor which ought to be in the public record and ought to be commented upon at this time. 
   It would be a curious reward if, in the face of a problem this year of this magnitude, we had a proportionately large increase in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. These factors were considered very carefully when our bill was crafted. I do listen to public broadcasting myself, and I do concur with Senator REID that it is a very useful instrumentality, given the considerations on commercial broadcasting. But we have gone about as far as we can go in allocating a $10 million increase which brings the corporation up to $350 million.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for that observation. It is my hope we can stack the votes until late this afternoon. We find that the votes set for 15 minutes with a 5-minute leeway go much longer. We have an amendment lined up by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. HUTCHINSON, to start in 10 minutes, and behind that--in sequencing we have had two amendments from that side of the aisle, so we are looking for another Republican amendment behind Senator HUTCHINSON. Then we will have Senator GRAHAM of Florida. 
   We wish to move this bill expeditiously giving ample time with time agreements. So we will be looking to stack the votes very late this afternoon. 
   Then we have lined up an amendment on ergonomics to come late this afternoon. It is anticipated there will be considerable debate on that. But we want to move through the ``meat'' of the day, so to speak, getting as much done as we can. So I concur with what Senator REID has had to say about stacking the votes later.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while not an enormous matter, while we are waiting for the next amendment to be offered, the issue has arisen as to whether the lists were made available to which political parties. I have been furnished, by staff, with a response by the inspector general of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to Congressman DINGELL's questions in the House of Representatives. 
   This is one question:  
   When stations made donor lists available to Democratic organizations either directly or through list brokers/managers, were the lists made available to Republican organizations as well?  
   Answer by the inspector general, as represented to me here:  
   Although, none of the identified exchanges or rentals of donor names from public broadcasting stations involved Republican organizations, we could not conclude that such names were not available to them. In this regard, we found no indications or evidence that Republican organizations had ever sought or been turned down for names requested from public broadcasting stations. In addition in visiting two stations, we were advised that when they learned that names were being exchanged with or rented to Democratic organizations, they had proposed exchanges with Republican organizations to their direct mail consultant or list broker. These stations were later advised that such exchanges were turned down.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the Senate floor we do not frequently have the quality of evidence which assures authenticity, unlike a courtroom where you have to have witnesses who saw, observed, or documentation which is authenticated. 
   I have marveled, from time to time, during my tenure in the Senate how many representations of fact are made which have no authentication. We had a little time left over from the debate, so the Senator from Nevada and I have talked a little bit about these lists being made available to political parties. 
   You have the inspector general's report which will be made a part of the RECORD which says what it says. I have already stated that. I am not going to repeat it. But what we say on this Senate floor is viewed by a lot of people. I am sure the Corporation for 
   Public Broadcasting will be looking very closely at what Senator REID and I have had to say. And other public institutions will be on notice, as well, that when there is public money involved, it is a public trust and not to be partisan for either Democrats or Republicans, and that we will take a look at it. 
   Again, I repeat that, notwithstanding this concern, we did not seek to have that influence our determination as to what the funding should be. We added $10 million. We know the problem has been rectified, but we want the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and everyone else, to be on notice that the Congress will not tolerate partisanship or political activity of either party with public money, which is a Federal trust. 
   Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when this bill was crafted with some 300 items, great care was exercised on the establishment of priorities. That is always a difficult matter. Where is the $1.800 trillion in Federal money to be spent? We have a bill of $91.7 billion. We have had a series of amendments to change the allocations and assessments of priorities which the ranking member and I came to initially with staff, and then the subcommittee and then the full committee. 
   I am inclined to agree with my colleague from Arkansas about the desirability of having more money in the consolidated health centers. He came from a small town, as he recited, of several hundred that has grown to more than 1,000. The town where I went to high school was a big city by comparison. It had several thousand people. Russell, KS, has now 4,998 people. It used to have 5,000 until Dole and I left town. 
   I appreciate what the Senator from Arkansas has had to say about the virtues of living in a small town. I have appreciated the virtues of living in a small town even more since I moved to a big city. I knew Russell, KS, was a great place to live, but after I moved to Philadelphia I concluded Russell, KS, was a greater place to live. 
   When the Senator from Arkansas talks about smalltown life and the need for health centers, he is right. They are needed not only in Arkansas but in Pennsylvania, in Kansas, and everywhere. 
   When we made the allocations, as has already been noted by the Senator from Arkansas, we paid a very substantial increase to consolidated health centers. Consolidated health centers were a little over $900 million and we added $99.3 million to bring them to $1.24 billion. That is, I am advised, $79 million over the President's request. 
   But, even so, when the Senator from Arkansas says he would like to have more money, I would not disagree with him. But then it is a question of establishing priorities, as to what we do. I listened closely to the statistics which were cited by the Senator from Arkansas on the decrease in the backlog. But even after the backlog has decreased--and I am searching for those exact statistics myself--there still is an enormous backlog which is pending before the National Labor Relations Board. 
   When the Senator from Arkansas makes a comment about the board establishing priorities, I think that is to the board's credit. They are not going to be able to take all the cases, so they ought to establish priorities. I hope their priorities are not subject to as much challenge as mine are on the floor. I am not really too serious about that, there haven't been too many challenges. But then the day is not over yet, either. We are waiting for all the amendments to be filed by 2 o'clock this afternoon. 
   But I compliment the National Labor Relations Board for establishing priorities, to take up the most important cases first. The fact that there are a great many unmeritorious claims filed is not surprising. There are sometimes unmeritorious amendments filed--not this one. But there are lots of cases filed in court or any adjudicatory process where there are unmeritorious matters. But I do not think that can be the basis of judgment. My analysis of the caseload of the National Labor Relations Board, and I am going to put these figures into shape during the  course of this debate, to be specific and put them into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, is that this funding is needed. 
   The National Labor Relations Board, by word of just a little explanation for those who may be watching on C-SPAN2, is a board created to take into consideration complaints, either by labor or by management, as to what is happening in a labor practice and to identify unfair labor practices and to produce labor peace by having an administrative remedy which would stop people from going into court. 
   I know there are others who wish to speak who are waiting now, but I think a careful analysis of the backlog, of the procedures of the National Labor Relations Board, and the entire picture, will show that this kind of increase is warranted and certainly in consideration of the significant increase accorded to the consolidated health centers, which I have already noted.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commented earlier that I would defer to the statistics. I am about to put a detailed chart into the RECORD. It is true that the backlog went down from about 6,200 to about 5,500 because we added $10 million to the budget. We are now proposing to add approximately $24 million to the budget, which will buy a computer, which is not inexpensive. Computers are expensive. That will enable the NLRB to move part way into the latter part of the 20th century, if not the 21st century. 
   The projection is that the backlog would then be reduced to about 1,960 cases. If this is not done, there are many employees who are now at the NLRB who would be lost. I think it is plain that for the NLRB to keep up with the backlog and do its job, they need these additional employees.

   Mr. SPECTER. Just a few comments about the merits of the pending amendment; then I will move on to a unanimous-consent request. 
   I believe that in the bill, as it is currently drafted, there is an appropriate balance between consultation and enforcement. I agree with the Senator from Wyoming that this consultation is very important, and there are many places where consultation will work. I think there are some areas where enforcement is necessary. 
   I saw in my line of work as district attorney of Philadelphia, under somewhat different circumstances, what enforcement does and what deterrence does and what the prospects of penalties may do. 
   We have crafted this bill as carefully as we can. I think it has about the right mix, although I welcome the suggestions from the Senator from Wyoming and the spirited debate which we have had. 
   As I take a look at the figures, in the period from 1995 to 1999, the enforcement funding falls $3 million this year below the 1995 level; $145 million to $142 million. 
   By contrast, in the same period, fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2000, OSHA's consultation program has grown from $31.5 million to almost $41 million; an increase of about 30 percent. 
   Even at the level that we have here, there are 7 million workplaces in the United States but only about 2,300 OSHA inspectors. Of the 12,500 most dangerous workplaces in the Nation, OSHA is able to inspect only about 3,000 a year; so 9,500 will not be inspected. The enforcement shows that there is an average decline of some 22 percent in the 3 years following inspections. 
   So when I take a look at the entire picture, I think we have it about right in the current bill. 
   Therefore, I move to table the second-degree amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now going to propound a unanimous-consent agreement on the pending matter. 
   I have been asked to pause for a minute so that other Senators may consider the unanimous-consent agreement. 
   What we propose to do by way of schedule today to move ahead is to set the vote aside, then move to an amendment by Senator GRAHAM of Florida. I hope we can work out a time agreement on that which is not yet agreed to. Then we would go to an amendment by Senator DODD for 30 minutes, equally divided, and then come back, perhaps, to Senator GREGG, and then move to an amendment which may be contentious on ergonomics, to be offered by Senators BOND and NICKLES. We would plan to have the votes before the ergonomics amendment, which may take some considerable time and move into the evening. 
   We are still working as fast as we can through a long list of amendments to try to see when we can bring this bill to a conclusion at the earliest moment. 
   May I inquire of the Senator from Minnesota if he is prepared for me to propound the unanimous consent request?

   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the second-degree amendment, only if agreed to, Senator WELLSTONE be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment under the same terms as outlined above. 
   Finally, I ask consent that following the disposition of the first second-degree amendment, if tabled, the first-degree amendment be withdrawn.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to the arguments by the Senator from Florida I can understand his interest in adding funds to what the committee mark is. I have no disagreement with the importance of the funds which are at issue. 
   I am constrained to oppose the amendment because in constructing this overall bill for $91.7 billion, in collaboration with the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, we have juggled some 300 programs. If we are going to add a very substantial amount of additional funding to education, which we have some $2.3 billion over last year, and if we are to add $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and to have an initiative against juvenile violence, it is a matter of the allocation of priorities. 
   The comment has been made about the use of the tobacco funds. Those are very substantial sums of money, some $203 billion over a number of years. 
   I fought on the Senate floor to try to bring some of those tobacco funds to the Federal Government so we would have more moneys available. It is an obvious suggestion, when the States are the recipients of so much of that funding, that some of it be used where other Federal funds had been made available. This is another illustration, along with the request for additional funds for after school, $200 million more, or for class size, for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--all of those are items which, under normal circumstances, I would say are very good programs, they are very good approaches, we would like to see them. But when it comes to assessing priorities, it is my sense, after working through very carefully with staff and then with the Democratic staff, the full subcommittee and the full committee, that this is an appropriate assessment of priorities. 
   Therefore, even though I have sympathy for what the Senator from Florida has had to say and think these are good programs, on a priority basis I have to oppose this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I find it extremely difficult to speak to and vote on this amendment because I have supported this amendment on so many occasions. Senator DODD accurately relates, when we were elected in 1980, we cochaired the Children's Caucus. Then, in 1987, after we were reelected, we were cosponsors of the first parental leave program which had just begun. We have been soldiers in the field. I have voted for this amendment again and again and again. But I am deeply concerned if we agree to this amendment at this time and add another $900 million to the current bill of $91.7 billion, we are not going to have any bill at all. We are not going to get 51 votes in this Chamber to pass this bill and to go to conference. I say that because of the deep-seated concerns which have  been expressed by so many Senators about where we are. 
   We have a bill at $91.7 billion which is within the budget caps. We have to go to conference with the House. We have to present a bill which the President will sign. I do not believe we will be able to do that if we add $900 million more. 
   I can count the number of cosponsors which the persuasive Senator DODD has. It may be he will have enough sponsors to defeat a tabling motion. I think next Tuesday, when Republican Senators return, on the vote on the underlying merits it may be different, although I very much would like to support him. We have been very concerned about children in this bill. We increased the child care block grant $182 million for fiscal year 2000, which brings it to $1.182 billion. Senator DODD would like to have it added to $2 billion, and so would I, if I thought we could get that bill passed. This $1.182 billion is in addition to the child care entitlement which was increased $200 million, to $2.367 billion next year. So we have on child care more than $3.5 billion. 
   In addition, States can transfer up to 30 percent, or $4.8 billion, of their temporary assistance to needy families, the so-called TANF block grants, to the child care block grant. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, States had $4.220 billion in unobligated TANF balances. 
   So there have been very substantial allocations for children. I might say, this is an especially tough vote for me because earlier today, my daughter-in-law, Tracey Specter, took the lead in establishing a child care center in Philadelphia where she and her husband, my son, Shanin Specter, have made a very generous contribution for child care. I know of the importance of child care so working mothers can provide needed assistance for their families in an era of two-wage-earner families and in an era of single mothers. I know how vital child care is. But this is going to be the log that breaks the camel's back. I think the camel now is burdened so that a straw would break the camel's back, but this is not a straw, this is a log. 
   I do not know quite where we are going to be when final passage comes on this bill and we do not have 51 votes. So it is a longstanding partnership I have with the Senator from Connecticut, elected on the same day to this body, worked hand in glove, almost as longstanding a relationship as with Senator JEFFORDS. Usually Senator JEFFORDS says, ``Jump,'' and I say, ``How high?'' on matters which he has in mind. But it is with the greatest reluctance that I say I cannot support this amendment, much as I would like to, for the reasons I have given. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with reluctance, again, that I am compelled to oppose the Reid amendment. I like public broadcasting, but this bill has been crafted with some 300 programs. Public broadcasting is getting a $10 million increase. This is in the face of some very substantial problems which were raised with public broadcasting on the sale of lists to political organizations. Public broadcasting is very important, and with tight budget constraints, I think $350 million is an adequate allocation. 
   I must say, as the Senator from Nevada mentioned ``Sesame Street,'' again, it is a family matter. My three granddaughters are mad about ``Sesame Street.'' On goes the television, and their behavior is a model. 
   This budget can only stretch so far. It is crafted for more than 300 programs. The better course is to take the  $10 million increase, and $350 million is sufficient.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as much as I have always favored the social services block grant program, the funding level in this bill is established as a matter of priority. 
   If we want to add to education $2.3 billion, significant additions to the National Institutes of Health, and crafting some 300 programs, this is the level which is appropriate. The States can transfer up to 5 percent of their temporary assistance to needy families in this program through these block grants, which amounts to $16.5 billion. Mr. President, $825 million are available there. 
   At the close of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 States had $4.22 billion, so it can be made up. People may not want to consider the tobacco funds, but the States have about $203 billion which has been given to them, where the argument was it should have come to the Federal Government to support these block grant programs. 
   If we are to pass this bill, if we are to get 51 votes, $91.7 billion, we can't add additional funds with this amendment.

In the last 5 years, enforcement has declined $3 million, from $145 million to $142 million; conciliation has grown from $3l.5 million to almost $41 million, an increase of 30 percent. 
   I think the bill as written is proper. I might add that it does not unduly prejudice the case on the merits, and if the Enzi amendment is not tabled under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator WELLSTONE has leave to file a second-degree amendment with 15 minutes to argue it, to be followed by another rollcall vote.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce that today the Senate will immediately begin consideration of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. Amendments to the bill are expected to be offered. Therefore, Senators may expect votes throughout the day and into the evening. Senators who intend to offer amendments should let us know as promptly as possible. Based on the number of amendments which are anticipated so far, it is possible we could finish action on the bill today. In any event, action on the bill must be finished before the close of Senate business tomorrow so that the Senate will have acted on all of the appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year, September 30. 
   As always, Senators will be notified as early as possible as votes are scheduled. Senator LOTT has asked for notification that the Senate may also consider any conference reports available for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention in this matter.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill on which we are now proceeding allocates some $91.7 billion for the three Departments--the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. It is an increase of $4 billion  over the program levels for fiscal year 1999. Most of that money is taken up by additional funding for the Department of Education, $2.3 billion, and an increase in the National Institutes of Health, $2 billion. 
   This bill is very close to the President's mark. It is within $1.4 billion of the President's mark. It contains advance funding for programs that are currently forward funded of some $16.46 billion. 
   Last year, the advance funding was $8.5 billion. The advance funding, of course, is a consistent, customary practice for the appropriations process. It is worth noting that the President's suggested mark had advance funding, forward funding, in excess of some $20 billion. 
   In reporting this bill out from the Appropriations Committee yesterday, I thanked our distinguished chairman, Senator STEVENS, and our distinguished ranking member, Senator BYRD, for the allocations which have enabled us to reach the floor. This appropriations bill is within the caps. My distinguished colleague, Senator TOM HARKIN, and I have cooperated on a partnership basis. Senator HARKIN and I have worked for more than a decade as chairman or ranking member, depending on which party is in power. 
   I learned a long time ago that if you want to get something done here in Washington, you have to be willing to cross party lines and work on a bipartisan basis. When we are dealing with the two top priorities of the country on the domestic scene--education and health care--in addition to the very important programs in the Department of Labor on worker safety and job training, a bipartisan approach is necessary. Senator HARKIN and I do present this budget in a bipartisan context. 
   It is our projection, as we move down the line, to present a bill to the President which will be signed. That is not an easy matter, given the budget constraints, given the many different views in the Senate, and, quite candidly, given the differing views in the House of Representatives where we will have to go to conference. But it is our hope that we will present to the President a bill which will be signed. That has not been accomplished in recent years. In fact, last year we didn't even get to bring the bill to the floor of the Senate. 
   I think it is generally recognized that the American people are fed up, really sick and tired of partisan political bickering in Washington. If we are able to have a bill which can be signed by President Clinton, who is a Democrat, presented to him by a Congress which is controlled, both Houses, by Republicans, it will be good for the country. It will be good for both parties. It will be good for everyone to be able to present a bill on these high priority items of education and health care which can be agreed to. 
   Just a few of the highlights of this bill: The bill is more than $500 million over the President's requests on education. We think that is a matter of great significance because education funding is a priority second to none. Head Start, which has been a very important program for everyone, but emphasized by the President--and I enumerate a number of items where we have acceded to the President's priority line but, in accordance with the constitutional authority to the Congress for appropriations, we have exercised our own judgments. Senator HARKIN will comment on this, as we have had a bipartisan approach, which is an approach with Democrats--not necessarily the President's approach, but an approach by the Democrats--as we have put in some of our own priorities, as they have been reflected in requests we have received from 100 Senators and from many in the private sector. 
   We have received over 1,000 letters from Senators requesting 2,188 report, bill, or number item changes. In addition, the subcommittee received over 1,000 requests from outside individuals and organizations. Many of those requests have come in air travel from Washington to Chicago and Des Moines, where Senator HARKIN has been importuned by his constituents, not only from Iowa but his constituents from the United States, because he is a United States Senator as well as a Senator from Iowa. Many of these requests have come on the Metroliner between Washington and Philadelphia, as people have approached me with their requests. 
   So that in coming to this proposal, it is a matter of establishing priorities. That is not easy to do. With a budget of 
   nearly $1.8 trillion, the whole budget process is priorities. We have established what we think are appropriate lines of priorities. It is worthwhile to note that the President has emphasized Head Start; we have agreed with him. We have a Head Start Program in excess of $5 billion, with an increase of more than $600 million. 
   We have had requests from the President on an important program called GEAR UP, which is designed to help low-income elementary and secondary school children prepare for college. My distinguished colleague, CHAKA FATTAH, a Member of the House of Representatives from Philadelphia, originated this program. The President has embraced it, and we have funded it this year for $120 million. The President asked for an increase. Senator HARKIN and our subcommittee and the full committee have increased it by 50 percent to $180 million. I joined the President in one of his weekly radio announcements and talked to him afterward, as I listened to his interest in this on a priority basis. We have increased, as I say, funding there by some 50 percent. 
   Special education has been a matter of high priority. Now we have more than $6 billion, an increase of more than $900 million this year. I could go over quite a number of the other lists, but the President's priorities have been accorded very substantial consideration and approval. 
   The Ricky Ray Program now has $50 million to compensate hemophilia victims. On our Pell grants, in accordance, again, with the administration's request, we have put in an increase to bring them to $3,325 on the maximum Pell grant a year. Again, on an item of importance emphasized by the White House and many Senators, LIHEAP, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, has been funded for $1.1 billion. 
   On the health line, the subcommittee included a mark of $2 billion, which was approved by the full committee. The National Institutes of Health, in my judgment, are the crown jewels of the Federal Government, perhaps the only jewels of the Federal Government. We are on the verge of phenomenal breakthroughs on many dreaded ailments. 
   Yesterday, we had a hearing on Parkinson's disease with Michael J. Fox coming in, putting a face on that human tragedy, a person who is well known and loved by so many millions of Americans as a television personality. It happens to be a fact of life that when Michael J. Fox comes in and testifies about his own trauma, a young man at the age of 39, with three children, facing a very uncertain medical future--medical experts testify that we may well be within 5 years of a cure for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart ailments and a long list of very tragic ailments. One of the aspects of chairing the subcommittee has been to be the recipient of requests from people with strange and rare illnesses. We have tried to raise the level of funding at the National Institutes of Health so there can be maximum accommodation for research on so many lines. Even with this $2 billion increase, raising from $15.6 billion to $17.6 billion, there are many lines which we cannot fund totally. 
   We still have, out of every 10 doors of research, the possibility that 7 will remain unopened. 
   It is my personal view that with a national budget of $1.8 trillion we ought to fund all of the meritorious applications. That can't be done. Many people have looked at this $2 billion increase, and have said: How can we afford it? The response that Senator HARKIN, our subcommittee, and the full committee have given us is: How can we not afford it? 
   One item we ought to be mentioning is that the language on stem cell research, which would have eliminated certain restrictions from the National Institutes of Health, has been deleted. That was inserted on the initiative from the leadership of the subcommittee because the stem cell research has such enormous potential. The stem cell research can go forward now with private funding extracting the stem cells from embryos, and then the Federal funding coming in on the stem cells which have been extracted.  
   It is my personal view--and the view which Senator HARKIN expressed forcefully at the subcommittee yesterday--that some of the existing limitations ought to be eliminated from this bill. The embryos which are involved are not embryos which would create human life. They are embryos which have been discarded from in vitro fertilization. The bill's prohibition against research on embryos will stay intact. 
   But what we had originally contemplated was to allow Federal funding to NIH on extracting stem cells from the embryos. But that has been eliminated at the request of the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the chairman of the committee, Senator STEVENS. We have eliminated that because we never could have finished this bill by the close of business tomorrow had it remained. 
   Senator LOTT has made a commitment that he will take up a freestanding bill in February, and our subcommittee will move forward to extensive hearings so that everybody may be informed. 
   There is a lack of information about the importance to medical research in these stem cells and the fact that does not really impinge upon embryos which could produce life. 
   There are many similarities between this debate and the debate on fetal tissue where for a long time fetal tissue could not be used in research because of a concern that it would promote abortions, and then the understanding was driven home that it would not promote abortions but would only use fetal tissues from abortions which had already been concluded. 
   To repeat, this will be taken up in February. 
   One other initiative which deserves attention is an initiative on school violence prevention. We have seen on a recurring basis the tragedies of school violence. The subcommittee undertook three active working sessions lasting about an hour and a half each where I presided in order to bring forward the experts on the working level. From that effort has come a program which is described on pages 6 to 14 of our report. 
   We brought together ranking officials and people very knowledgeable from the field, including the Deputy Attorney General, the Surgeon General, representatives of the Office of Management and Budget, representatives from elementary and secondary education, from the Department's units administering safe and drug-free schools, from special education, from the Administration for Children and Families, from the National Institute of Mental Health, from Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse, from the Centers for Disease Control and the Division of Violence Prevention, from the Office of the Victims of Crime, from employment and training programs from the Department of Labor, and from the Association of School Psychologists--all who have put together a comprehensive bill which essentially involves the reallocation of some $851 million. Not pointing the finger of blame in any direction but recognizing school violence as a national health problem, as suggested years ago by the Surgeon General, and putting it under the Surgeon General where we are coordinating with Bruce Reed from the White House Domestic Council--a program has been created which we believe has long range potential. Included in the funding, in addition, are important programs on worker safety. 
   In the interest of time, I will not delineate all of them. They have been set forth in some detail. 
   On a personal note, I have recused myself on the funding for the National Constitution Center, since my wife, Joan Specter, is director of fundraising for the National Constitution Center. Senator THAD COCHRAN, the senior Republican on the committee, has taken over.

   In the interest of moving us promptly as possible to the amendment from the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, I am going to yield the floor at this time and yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN, whom I again thank for his total cooperation and partnership and bipartisan approach to this important bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN, for his generous remarks. There are one or two points about which I would like to comment. 
   With respect to the stem cell issue, on the merits and on the substance, I agree with what Senator HARKIN said, that ultimately we ought to reduce the limitations on the National Institutes of Health. I think it appropriate to say that I took the initiative in putting that language in the bill. 
   I also agree with Senator HARKIN that this is an issue which I think his position and mine can prevail when it is explained. But I disagree with him on one tiny point, and that is it would not take long to explain it. I think it is going to take a long time to explain it, and a lot of people are going to want to be heard on it. 
   That is our only point of disagreement, that I don't think it realistic to conclude this bill by the end of business tomorrow. I do not blame him for a healthy share of skepticism, and he will believe it when he sees it. I predict he will see it. He and I have worked together, and our predictions to each other have been accurate right down the line without exception. 
   Senator HARKIN commented on the statement from the President which I had not seen when I started my comments. I will be responding to that when we have a break in the action. We just received the statement this morning, and he has made a comment that the President said he will veto the bill in its current form, which surprised me on that abrupt challenge. I am prepared to work through that. 
   He also said in his statement--let me read the statement specifically:  
   If this bill were to come to me in its current form I would have to veto it.  
   I was a little surprised to see that peremptory language without some preliminary consultation. But then he goes on to say:  
   I look forward to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this bill strengthens public education and other important national priorities.  
   Our objectives are the same on strengthening public education and other important national priorities. I am instructing my staff to start to work now with the Secretaries. 
   We had a hearing. I have worked closely with Secretary Shalala, Health and Human Services; Secretary Riley, Education; and Secretary Herman, Labor. We are going to be working with them as this bill proceeds on the floor and also with the Office of Management and Budget to see if we cannot have a meeting of the minds as we work through the process. 
   I know the Senator from Washington is ready to offer her amendment, so at this time I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have heard a great deal of talk about class size. There has been an absence of recognition that the bill provides $1.2 billion for teacher initiatives, which may well be defined as class size, where the authorizing committee works. We have heard a castigation about failure to fulfill a promise for the discharge of teachers, which is factually untrue. There is currently $1.2 billion to fund class size reduction on an authorization which was contained in last year's appropriation bill. 
   This year's appropriation bill includes $1.2 billion on what is called a teacher initiative. So when a number of Senators have talked about the desirability of reducing class size and what that does for education, that is something to which this Senator agrees. That is something the subcommittee agrees with, the full committee agrees with, and is not a partisan issue. It is not a matter that the Democrats say we ought to have small class sizes and the Republicans say there ought to be large class sizes. That is not an issue at all. There is not a controversy. 
   It is not a controversy that there is any reneging on a promise to take out the $1.2 billion to discharge many teachers. That is simply not factually correct.  
   The fact is, this appropriations bill contains $1.2 billion. 
   Yesterday, the Senator from Washington, in the committee, offered an amendment for $1.4 billion. So there was an increase of $200 million, and the Senator from Washington offered that amendment without an offset. This bill is already at $91.7 billion, which is at the breaking point, maybe beyond the breaking point of what this body will enact or what may go through conference. In the absence of an offset, the priorities are not subject to be rearranged, at least in my opinion. 
   There has been an objection made, understandably, by Senator JEFFORDS, who is the chairman of the authorizing committee. That is the role of the authorizing committee. 
   Yesterday, there was talk about Senator GORTON. Senator GORTON introduced or was prepared to introduce a second-degree amendment, which would have appropriated the $1.2 billion, subject to authorization, and if the authorization did not occur, then the $1.2 billion would be given to the States. They can make a determination as they see fit in a block grant concept, allocating it to class size or teacher initiative or whatever it is the States decided. 
   My preference is to see that the $1.2 billion stays in the area of class size and teacher initiative, but that is a matter for the authorizers. 
   I understand the Senator from Washington wants an up-or-down vote, but the rules of the Senate permit another Senator like Senator GORTON to offer a second-degree amendment. When the Senator from Washington says she is prepared to stay until the end of November to reoffer her amendment, she is entitled to do that. Senator GORTON is entitled to continue to offer a second-degree amendment, if he decides to do that. Those are the rules of the Senate. Nobody is entitled to an up-or-down vote if another Senator wants to offer a second-degree amendment. 
   Now, it may be that Senator GORTON and others will yield and will allow an up-or-down vote. I am not sure how that will work out, but it is not a matter of right. No Senator has a right to an up-or-down vote. A Senator has a right to follow the rules. Senator GORTON has a right to the rules, just as Senator MURRAY has a right to the rules. 
   It is simply not true that there is a reneging on the commitment for $1.2 billion. It is in the bill. It is categorized as a teacher initiative. That is another way of saying class size, or it is another way of saying what the authorizers may do by way of specifying how the $1.2 billion is to be spent. 
   We have a deadline of September 30, the end of the fiscal year, to finish our work. We had the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. GREGG, call for regular order. I called for regular order. You can articulate questions which are speeches, a lot of speeches that have consumed more than an hour. It is my hope that we can proceed with this bill, proceed with the rules of the Senate, and move to let the Senate work its will.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we have had a very solid, constructive debate this afternoon. The Murray amendment seeks to deal with class size, which I believe is a very laudable and praiseworthy objective. A difficulty I have with the amendment of the Senator from Washington is that it adds some $200 million to the bill, which is already, in my judgment, at the maximum level. It now calls for $91.7 billion; $16 billion is forward funded. Last year $8 billion had been forward funded. This bill has been crafted by the subcommittee, then accepted by the full committee, after 17 hearings, after having more than 2,000 requests from Members, more than 1,000 letters, 1,000 inputs from the citizenry. Our subcommittee, a group of experts on staff, sat down and crafted this bill which was then approved by Senator HARKIN, the ranking Democrat, and myself. We have some 300 items which we have weighed and evaluated. We have allocated $1.2 billion to the generalized subject of teacher initiative, which is perhaps the same as class size. When I say perhaps the same as class size, I say that because the determination of precisely how that money is to be used is up to the authorizing committee. 
   For those watching on C-SPAN II, if anyone, a word of explanation might be in order; that is, we appropriate. We put up the money. But we have another committee, headed by Senator JEFFORDS, which decides authorization, as to how the money is to be spent. That is the way we do business in the Senate. 
   Last year, in order to move through the process--and occasionally we do legislate on an appropriations bill--we did legislate, for 1 year, on class size. The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington was subject to challenge under rule XVI and could have been defeated because it is legislation. We decided not to do that in order to give this issue a thorough airing on the merits. 
   Frankly, I would like to add $200 billion--million--maybe Freud would say I would like to add $200 billion. I am not sure. But we have a couple of problems. One problem is we have to pass this bill. On my side of the aisle, we are at the breaking point. I may be wrong about that, we may be beyond the breaking point. I am lobbying my colleagues in the Cloakroom that $91.7 billion ought to get their affirmative vote. They raised questions about the size of the amount. Then we have to go to conference and we have to produce a bill which will be accepted by our House colleagues, who have a little different view. They want to spend substantially less money. 
   I am aware the object, the end process is to get the bill signed. Under our Constitution, it is not enough for the Senate to vote, for the House to vote, for the conference committee to vote. It has to be submitted to the President. He has to agree with it. We are very close to the President's figure. 
   He asked for $1.4 billion for class size, and I am not saying in the end we might not be there on a compromise, at the very end of the process, if we make some other adjustments. But there is a limit as to how much I can get my Republican colleagues to vote for. 
   One of my colleagues just entered, came to the floor, and said, ``That's right.'' I have been lobbying him very hard in the Cloakroom. We have to get 51 votes for this bill; that is not easy to do, at $91.7 billion. 
   So as we look at the overall structure, and we have 300 programs--the Senator from Washington did not make a 
   suggestion as to where she would like to cut $200 million. We have a structure that is not subject to the Budget Act because it is advanced funding. 
   I believe our bill, at $91.7 billion, is within the caps, and I am confident it does not touch Social Security. But that is a complicated subject because some of the money has been borrowed from defense. There are a lot of factors at play here. Senator DOMENICI and Senator STEVENS and I and others have been working to be sure we are within the caps and we do not cut Social Security. I have been told if we spend $200 million more on the amendment of the Senator from Washington, we may invade Social Security--that we will invade Social Security. I am not prepared to make that argument because I do not know whether it is true or not. But I do know every time we add money, we come very close to that and there is, not a consensus--there is unanimity not to touch Social Security, not to do that, and to allow room for Medicare. 
   In the debate earlier, I heard the Senator from Connecticut talk about adding $2 billion to another program that I like very much, but I am not prepared to spend $2 billion more on this bill and eliminate any chance at all I can get 51 votes on this side of the aisle. 
   So it was with great reluctance that I am constrained--and I voted against very little, in the 19 years I have been here, against increased education funding. If somebody wants to spend more money on education, almost always I have said yes. The authorizers may come back and may do exactly what the Senator from Washington wants, put it on class size. That is a laudable, praiseworthy objective. But there are other objectives as well. That has to be decided by our authorizing committee, under our rules. 
   So it is with reluctance that I vote against the Senator from Washington because I do not like to vote against money for education. But we have not just been fair; we have been very generous. This bill is an increase of $2.3 billion over last year. It is more than $500 million more than the President wanted. We have worked hard to craft this, among 300 programs. Agreeing to the amendment offered by Senator GORTON does not rule out class size on two grounds: One is, it could be class size if the local districts say so, or it could be class size if the authorizers say so. 
   So Senator GORTON's amendment is not inconsistent with the objectives of the Senator from Washington.  
   Chairing this subcommittee has been fascinating, and trying to put all the pieces together is really a challenge. Voting against education is something I do not like to do, to be misconstrued in a 30-second commercial, but I think the interests of American children and public education, of which I am a product, are best served by keeping the bill as it is. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Senator JEFFORDS would be willing to work with the Senator from Nevada on a bipartisan approach to needlestick prevention. I have not heard the issue broached at the hearings, but I will urge Senator JEFFORDS to include that in working with the Senator from Nevada. The issue poses a problem on the appropriations bill. This is authorization on an appropriations bill, and it is subject to our rule XVI which precludes that. But more fundamentally, it has not been aired with many of the interested parties. I am sympathetic to what the Senator from Nevada seeks to accomplish. I think there are problems. I found out about it for the first time yesterday, and I say that in no way to be critical. 
   That is what happens here. When we take it up, we have heard rural hospitals would find it difficult in its present posture. I am told by CBO that there is a substantial cost figure involved. I don't cite it with any authority, but they are talking about $50 million. I don't quite see that, but that has been reported to me. 
   I compliment Senator REID for calling attention to the issue, for focusing on it, for raising it and taking a big step in having consideration by the authorizing committee. I will urge Senator JEFFORDS to include hearings as well as a cooperative approach to try to work it out.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has broached a great many complex issues in his presentation. The question on school prayer is one of the most complex constitutional issues the Supreme Court has faced. And I do not believe those analogies are particularly apt here. I am certainly opposed to religious bigotry in any form whatsoever. When you deal with the issue of restraints on art, again, there are complex first amendment questions. 
   I learned of the amendment earlier this afternoon and do not have a total grasp of the issues on this particular display at this particular museum. 
   This amendment, while it may be offered on this bill, under our rules is not germane to the bill on Labor-HHS. We have decided to accept the matter with no assurance as to how hard we will pursue it in the conference, to put it mildly. But in the interest of moving the bill along, I think the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has made his point. I do not think it has become the law of the land. In the interest of moving this bill, not contesting it in a long debate and having a rollcall vote, which takes time, we will simply let the matter go through on a voice vote, as Senator SMITH suggested.

   Mr. SPECTER. Following the practice I have heard earlier today, I will preface my question with a statement. I do not think anybody will call for regular order. 
   When the distinguished Senator from California says perhaps if her speech is short enough, I might vote for her amendment, that is entirely possible. If the speech did not exist, which would imply the withdrawal of the amendment, I would support her position. 
   But the question I have is: We have added $200 million in this bill to afterschool programs.  
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-specter-pa-66-19990929</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Senator HARKIN, the distinguished ranking member, has been very supportive of that. We added that money in on the Juvenile Violence Prevention Program because, as Senator HARKIN has said, the safest place for children is in school. This is one facet on the direction of $851 million to prevent school violence, so we added the $200 million. 
   The question arises, after we have stretched on this budget to $91.7 billion, which has gotten the concurrence of a very strong pro-education, pro-health care, pro-worker-safety Senator --the ranking member has accepted that as the maximum amount we could get. 
   When I went to law school, there was a course in legislative process. That course ``ain't learning nothing yet'' compared to what it is in real life to find a bill that Republicans in the Senate will vote for, that can pass conference, and be acceptable to the President. 
   I have a feeling, regardless of how much money would have been added, Senator DODD would have come forward with a request for $2 billion more, Senator MURRAY with a request for $200 million more. 
   The question I have for the Senator from California: If we had included $400 million more for afterschool programs, would the Senator from California have offered an amendment to increase it even more?

What is the reason, what is the rationale, for $400 million extra being sufficient? 
   The Senator from California says there are these children waiting. But even after the $400 million would be added, had we done so, would there not be other children waiting? And wouldn't the nature of the add-on process have led to more? 
   Essentially, my question is, to focus it specifically, what are the facts that say $400 million will be sufficient to solve the problem----

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I shall not ask unanimous consent so the Senator from California will not interrupt me. The rules permit her to do so, and I do not want to deprive her of that opportunity. 
   I had posed a question to the Senator from California as to whether any amount would be enough. When the Senator from California cites the statistics of 2,000 applications and 184 were granted, and it may be that some were not meritorious, but in order to have funding of all the applications or most of the applications, all of them would be 11 times the amount. So from $200 million, say, 10 times the amount would be $2 billion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from California for that comment. I do understand her point of saying that you cannot go that far, but in extrapolating and projecting where we would be on the total number of applications--as I say, some are not meritorious--one could come up 10 times the figure of $200 million, which we had. Ten times would be $2 billion, or if you project it a little differently on $200 million and $900 million worth of applications were filed, it would be 4 1/2 times that, which would be $900 million. 
   The point I am making is that regardless of what the committee comes up with, there is going to be an add-on. When this program was started back in 1994, the last year when the Democrats controlled the Congress, and there was an extraordinarily competent chairman of this subcommittee, the figure was $750,000 for afterschool programs. 
   It could be said that the social climate of the country disintegrated in the intervening time--which was a jocular comment made while we were chatting about this. But from $750,000--the last year the Congress was controlled by the Democrats--the figure then moved to $1 million in 1997, and then to $40 million in 1998, and to $200 million in 1999, and then doubled for the next fiscal year to $400 million. 
   When the Senator from California said that I had supported her in the past on afterschool programs, she is correct, I have. I think afterschool programs are vital and necessary. But when Senator HARKIN and I constructed a budget of some 300 items--and figured that $91.7 billion was the maximum we could stretch it--we left some money for the National Institutes of Health, for drug-free schools, for worker safety, and for many other programs. 
   That is why, much as I dislike doing so, I have to oppose the additional $200 million. In the 19 years I have been here, when programs such as this have been offered, by and large, I have supported them. But when this kind of an enormous effort is made to accommodate to the maximum extent possible this important objective of afterschool programs--and it is not enough--I come back to the suggestion I made that no figure we would have reached would have been enough. 
   I think we are about to see that with the balance of the amendments which are going to be offered, notwithstanding the very large figure Senator HARKIN and I have come up with, more funds will be added in many lines, which will require a lot of very tough votes that I do not like to cast to oppose those amendments.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today is the 100th birthday of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). Yesterday, the Senate approved H.J. Res. 34, a resolution which commemorates that auspicious event. I wish to mark the occasion further by offering my congratulations to the members and families of that fine organization. 
   In my 19 years as a United States Senator I have been able to count on the VFW to convey the concerns of veterans in a fair and insightful manner. Especially during my tenure as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have always been able to rely on the VFW to assist me in ascertaining the quality of health care and benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Without the VFW's 2,000,000 strong membership, it would be extremely difficult for the Committee--or the Congress--to operate in the best interest of America's veterans. 
   Earlier this year, I had the honor of being named the recipient of the VFW Congressional Award. At the award reception, I was struck by the history of the VFW. From the trenches of Verdun to the deserts of Iraq, VFW members have taken their place in America's history, serving to preserve ``one Nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.'' 
   The service of VFW members, however, has never been limited to wartime service--as vital as that has been. VFW members also play indispensable roles within their communities--as volunteers in VA hospitals and advocates for veteran claimants and through numerous civic and youth projects in every State and locality. Indeed, America counts VFW members among its model citizens. 
   For 100 years as honorable citizens and soldiers, the VFW deserves America's gratitude for a job well done. We salute you.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on Senator DASCHLE's education funding legislation, S. Res. 187. 
   The resolution states that the funding level for the Subcommittee on  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education has been reduced to pay for other programs. I would like to set the record straight. The 302(b) allocation that was originally assigned to the Subcommittee was temporarily reduced to permit other subcommittees to mark up their bills. This was done with the intention that as these other bills moved through their conferences, additional dollars would be made available to provide the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee with the necessary resources to increase funding for education, health and labor programs. 
   As last evening's Labor-HHS-Education markup proved, there was never any intention to cut 17 percent from education programs. To the contrary, the subcommittee actually recommended $35.2 billion for education programs, an increase of $2.3 billion over the fiscal year 1999 program level and $537.6 million over the administration's budget request. 
   Instead of reducing Head Start dollars, $5.2 billion was recommended, which increased the program $608.5 million over fiscal year 1999 level and matching the amount requested by the President. 
   After school programs were doubled from $200 to $400 million; aid to disadvantaged children was increased by $320 million over last year which again matched the President's request. 
   Instead of decreasing technology programs, $550 million was recommended to maintain last year's program level. 
   The resolution also states that a $100 million reduction would be cut from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. The facts are that Safe and Drug Free schools, as part of the youth violence initiative was increased by $45 million to provide $611 million for state grants, school coordinators and programs to promote safe learning environments for this nation's children. 
   To provide a free, appropriate, public education to all children, $6.035 billion was provided to children with disabilities increasing the program $911.5 million over last year's amount and $585.7 million over the President's recommendation. 
   And finally, the subcommittee recommended a $200 increase in the maximum Pell grant to provide $3,325 to help disadvantaged children achieve a college education. 
   In closing, I wish to point out that these increases in education dollars, have been carefully balanced with savings in other areas in the bill and advance funding. The Labor-HHS-Education bill is within the discretionary spending caps set forth in the budget resolution. This fact points out once again that the findings stated in Senate Resolution 187 were not factual which is the reason I voted against it and led the effort to provide a better formula for Federal funding as reflected in the subcommittee bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for successfully managing such a complex appropriations bill as S. 1596. In particular, I want to thank him for recognizing the need for additional funding for veterans health care and increasing that appropriations an additional $1.7 billion over the President's request. Doing this was very difficult in light of budgetary constraints, but it was the right thing to do and I commend him for his foresight and courage.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is an additional matter in which I would like to have an exchange with him involving two amendments I have offered. The first involves the need for funding of a unique construction project at the Lebanon VA Medical Center for the growing problem of the long term care needs of veterans. The second involves funding for a needed national veterans cemetery in the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania. In the interest of time and space, I will not elaborate on these projects both of which have been authorized by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs in S. 1076 and S. 695 respectively and are outlined in the accompanying reports. You and I discussed them yesterday and I believe we had a meeting of the minds in which I understood that you will seek at least limited funding for both projects during conference. Is this the understanding of Senator BOND as well?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for having included language in the Senate report urging the Federal Highway Administrator to work with Drexel University to focus on the link between intelligent transportation systems and transportation infrastructure. As the Chairman knows, for the next several years the United States will be making massive investments in its transportation infrastructure, and, in view of the limited resources available for these investments, there has never been a greater need to be certain that these expenditures are wisely prioritized and based on sound assessments of the structural integrity of the existing infrastructure. In recent years, we have all been gratified to witness the revival of many of our major cities, but, while desperately needed, investments in the urban transportation infrastructure are especially costly. 
   Thankfully, we are finding that technology is coming to our aid as we seek to address the issue of transportation infrastructure investments in an urban environment. One especially gratifying example of the application of information technology--``smart'' technology--to the management and maintenance of transportation infrastructure can be found in Drexel University's Intelligent Transportation Institute. In the passage of TEA-21 last year Congress specifically recognized the outstanding work of the Institute and included a special section of that bill--Section 5118--which authorized $10 million to ``conduct research, training, technology transfer, construction, maintenance, and other activities to advance infrastructure research.'' 
   I would ask whether the Senator agrees with me that work such as that conducted at the Drexel Institute is essential for determining the actual structural integrity of urban transportation infrastructure--such as multimillion dollar bridges--monitoring their ``health'' in real-time, and determining cost-effective and innovative maintenance and operational strategies.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on August 14, I landed in Amsterdam, Holland, and proceeded directly to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. There, I met with a team of the leading prosecutors/investigators at the Tribunal including John Ralston, Bob Reid, Graham Blewitt, and J. Clint Williamson. Ralston, Reid, and Blewitt are all Australians who got their start together hunting Nazis who had immigrated to Australia following World War II. They have been at War Crimes Tribunal since 1994. Williamson is an American who used to work for the Department of Justice. 
   Recently the prosecutors obtained a very important indictment against five individuals: Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, the Serbian Interior Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and the Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Army. They have been charged with crimes against humanity in the deportation of more than 700,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and mass murder. Their theory of prosecution is that the atrocities in Kosovo were so systematic and widespread that they must have been orchestrated at the highest levels of the Yugoslav/Serbian government and military. 
   No arrests in connection with this indictment have been made to date. When I asked about the prospects of detaining Milosevic and bringing him to trial, my hosts told me that this will happen only when a new government comes to power in Yugoslavia. It is possible that such a government may quickly find that Milosevic is too great a liability and hand him over. 
   I also asked about the prospects of capturing another indicted war criminal, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the fighting in Bosnia. Karadzic is still in Bosnia and to date remains at large. Karadzic is believed to be in the French sector of Bosnia, and the French have shown no interest in arresting him. Unfortunately, the United States has also shown a lack of resolve on this issue. I believe that capturing Karadic and trying him before the War Crimes Tribunal would send a powerful signal to leaders around the world that they are not immune from prosecution, and that prosecution will not be limited merely to the troops on the ground. Had Karadzic been in custody in the Hague awaiting or standing trial, one wonders whether Milosevic would have acted as brazenly as he did in Kosovo. 
   The war crimes team all stressed that there was a great deal of work to do collecting evidence of the war crimes in Kosovo and that this work needed to be done prior to October, when winter weather would prevent further excavations until the Spring. They also told me that the work was particularly challenging because the Serbs had gone to great lengths to hide their crimes, including burning the bodies of their victims, bulldozing houses in which mass murders took place, and dispersing bodies from mass graves. 
   In early summer, the FBI sent a team of forensic experts to help collect evidence of war crimes in Kosovo, and the FBI was preparing to send a second team at the end of August. I had helped to get funding for these FBI missions, and was interested in hearing about what the FBI was doing. The team at the War Crimes Tribunal told me that the FBI had been sent to work at a number of massacre sights where most of the evidence had been destroyed, usually by burning the victims' corpses. Despite the difficulties, the FBI was able to find evidence, including bone fragments, blood stains, shell castings, and petrol cans used to start the fires. They have exhumed victim bodies and conducted autopsies. This evidence will prove invaluable when the individuals under indictment are finally brought to trial. 
   I asked my hosts if they needed any additional resources. Mr. Blewitt told me that resources continued to be a problem--the tribunal was currently borrowing against other areas of its budget in order to fund its Kosovo operations and would run out of money by early October. He mentioned that the $9 million dollars recently pledged by President Clinton would carry them through the end of 1999. 
   After leaving the War Crimes Tribunal, we proceeded to meet with General Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces. General Clark ran our war effort in Kosovo and continues to manage the day-to-day operations there, and is a valuable source of information about the situation on the ground. 
   I asked the General about the odds of capturing Milosevic and bringing him to trial. The General stated that he was optimistic that one day Milosevic and the others would indeed be captured and brought to justice. I also asked him about the chances of capturing Karadzic. He mentioned that Karadzic is in hiding, surrounded by guards, and goes to great lengths to avoid being located such as avoiding the use of cell phones. Still, I got the impression that if NATO were truly determined to capture him, they could do so. 
   I also asked General Clark about the Apache helicopters that were sent to Kosovo with much fanfare but were never used. He told me that the Pentagon had conducted a risk/benefit analysis and decided that the risk of losing one of these expensive helicopters outweighed the benefit that could be derived by their use. I expressed my view that there is no point in having all of this high priced machinery unless it is going to be used. 
   Our next stop was Kiev, the capitol of Ukraine. We arrived in Ukraine shortly before the celebration of its 8th Independence Day. During this short period, Ukraine has become an important country for U.S. foreign policy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was left with one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Our work with Ukraine has eliminated all of these nuclear weapons. In addition, Ukraine is a young country making the difficult transition from totalitarian rule to democracy and from a planned economy to a market economy. If Ukraine succeeds, it can lead the way for Russia and other former Soviet Republics to follow. If Ukraine fails, it could revert to communism and possibly join Russia and others in a union that would once again seek to pursue global power through militarism. The United States has a lot at stake here. 
   During my stay in Ukraine, I met with the top leadership of the country including President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko, Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Chalyi, and Secretary Volodymyr Horbulyn, who is the head of the National Security and Defense Council. These meetings provided valuable information on the challenges facing Ukraine and the role the United States can play to help this country on the difficult path to democracy and free markets. 
   President Kuchma is up for reelection this October. He is generally considered to be a reformer and a man who will continue down the path towards democracy and free markets. His strongest opponents are the Communists and the Socialists, who have opposed Kuchma's market reforms. 
   I was curious to know what my hosts thought would be the major issues in the campaign. Both President Kuchma  and Prime Minister Pustovoitenko agreed that one of the most important issues in the campaign would be unpaid pensions and government salaries. The government has missed a number of monthly payments of pensions and salaries this year and last. Naturally, people owed money are likely to vote for the party they believe is most likely to pay it to them. 
   Beyond the specific issue of back pay, the economy in general will also play a pivotal role in the campaign. My hosts told me that they felt threatened on economic issues, because there are many who believe that their lives were better under Communism and would therefore support the Communists. The Prime Minister noted that as an opposition party, the Communists have been criticizing President Kuchma's economic reforms and have blocked more meaningful reform. President Kuchma agreed that it is possible, although unlikely, that the Communists could come to power and return the country to totalitarian rule. 
   Although Kuchma is considered to be a reformer, there have been complaints that the pace of reform is too slow and that his initiatives have been too modest. When asked about the pace of reform, my hosts put the blame largely on the shoulders of the left wing parties. They told me that the Communists, Socialists and some others are blocking the most important reform legislation his government has introduced. They suggested that the pace of reform would pick up after the election, provided President Kuchma wins. 
   Prime Minister Pustovoitenko confirmed that Ukraine has eliminated all of the nuclear arms in the substantial arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. Today, of course, countries are competing in the most aggressive way to acquire nuclear arms. Being a member of the nuclear club gives a country great prestige and bargaining power in the world. It is for this reason that I find it truly remarkable that Ukraine had voluntarily given up its nuclear arsenal. 
   I asked my hosts why they would agree to do this voluntarily. President Kuchma mentioned that after the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, which is in Ukraine, Ukrainians understand better than most people the danger posed by nuclear power and simply did not want them. Deputy Foreign Minister Chalyi also gave me an interesting answer. He told me that he and others decided that the best development model for Ukraine to follow was Japan, which disarmed and focused on building its economy. Nuclear arms do not bring prosperity. 
   Given Ukraine's voluntary disarmament, I was interested to know what my hosts thought about the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the failure of the U.S. Senate to ratify this treaty. All of the government officials I spoke with felt very strongly that the Test Ban Treaty was an extremely important way to seek to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms and slow this dangerous arms race. Likewise, they all agreed that the failure of the U.S. to ratify this Treaty was a serious impediment to the goal of disarmament. As President Kuchma noted, ratifying the Treaty gives a country the moral right to pressure others to stop their testing and construction of nuclear arms. Prime Minister Pustovoitenko sounded a similar note when he said that the United States must set an example for the world when it comes to disarmament and would be in much stronger position to pressure other countries to stop their tests once they formally committed to stopping their own. 
   Deputy Foreign Minister Chalyi told me a very interesting story in response to my question about the Test Ban Treaty. Mr. Chalyi serves as the Chairman of the South Asia Taskforce, a group of Asian nations and their trading partners including China, Japan, Australia, Argentina and Brazil. He told me that during a visit to Pakistan, he urged his Pakistani counterparts to ratify the Treaty. A Pakistani official responded that he did not see why Pakistan 
   should have to ratify the Treaty when the Americans had not. 
   While in Ukraine, I also had a meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian Jewish Community. Of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, 1.7 million came from Ukraine. After the War, the Holocaust, and continuing emigration, the Ukrainian Jewish community now numbers approximately 500,000. I feel special concern for this community since both of my parents were Ukrainian Jews. 
   I found these Jewish leaders to be upbeat, even optimistic, about the future of their community. They told me that since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Jewish community has begun to develop rapidly. Rabbis are coming to the country, and many Jewish schools and camps are opening. They told me that there is religious freedom and opportunities for Jews in every sector of society. 
   During the Communist era, I was told, Ukraine was one of the most anti-Semitic republics in the Soviet Union. No Jew could hope to be a leader in politics or industry. In contrast, one of the Jewish leaders we met with was a successful businessman and an advisor to President Kuchma. I was informed that a former Prime Minister of Ukraine was Jewish. Another Rabbi from the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement told me that he has been walking back and forth to synagogue in his town for two years without any incident. This is certainly different from the days when the Cossacks used to ride up and down the streets of my father's town looking for Jews to harass. 
   The only complaint I heard was on the issue of communal property. Jewish property confiscated by the Nazis became government property under the Soviet Union. Now that Communism is gone, representatives of the Jewish community would like to retrieve Jewish communal property--graveyards, synagogues, schools, etc. Some feel that the government has not moved fast enough on this issue. Others stressed that this is a sensitive topic affecting many ethnic groups in Ukraine and feared that to push too loudly for restitution would lead to anti-Semitism. 
   A number of the leaders I met with, including President Kuchma, asked that the United States repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment as it applies to Ukraine. Jackson-Vanik was originally passed during the days of the Iron Curtain as a way of pressuring the Soviet Union to allow Jews and other religious minorities to emigrate. Today in Ukraine, there are open borders and free emigration. The Ukrainians don't understand why they must come to the U.S. every year and ask for a waiver from the Jackson-Vanik sanctions, and they believe that the repeal of the amendment would have great symbolic importance. 
   When I met with the Jewish leaders, I asked them about this issue. They agreed that there is free emigration from Ukraine and seemed open to the idea of repealing Jackson-Vanik. Some raised a concern, however, that today Jackson-Vanik applies to issues beyond emigration, such as the restoration of communal property, and should therefore not be repealed until the communal property issue is settled. The U.S. Congress should review this issue. 
   On my final night in Kiev, I met with a group of American businessmen living in Ukraine to hear their view of the Ukrainian economy and business climate. They all complained about the slow pace of reform, corruption and inefficiency. They contrasted Ukraine with countries such as Poland, which have converted well to capitalism. Ukraine, they argue, is still a state run economy in many important ways. Private firms have made progress in some consumer product fields such as brewing beer and making chocolates. But in major industries, the government-owned companies still dominate. Despite these problems, however, these Americans still believed in the potential of Ukraine and were devoting themselves to the task of developing their economy. 
   From Ukraine we flew to Israel where we had a series of meetings relating to the Mid-East peace process. Our first meeting was with Israeli Prime Minister Barak. I found the Prime Minister to be optimistic about the prospects for peace in the Middle East. He stated that Israel will resume implementation of the Wye Accords as soon as possible. When I asked him about the risks of peace making, Barak explained to me why he is seeking to make peace so quickly. If Israel does not make peace now, he said, then he is certain that there will be another war in the Middle East. While he is confident that Israel will win this war and survive, he knows that Israel will never  win an unconditional surrender from her Arab neighbors. So after Israel and her neighbors have buried their dead and repaired their cities, they will sit down to negotiate exactly the same issues that are on the table now. The Prime Minister believes that by making peace now he will avoid this futile loss of life. 
   In addition, Barak believes that Israel is strong enough to take the risks inherent in pursuing peace. He drew a strong contrast between his view of Israel in the Middle East and the view of his predecessor, Binyamin Netanyahu. He noted that Netanyahu once analogized the situation of Israel in the Middle East to that of a carp in a tank of sharks. Barak rejected this analogy and stated that Israel is not a carp, but a ``benign killer whale.'' His message was clear--Israel is strong enough that it does not have to fear making territorial concessions to its neighbors. 
   But the Prime Minister is also a realist and he stressed that Israel will only enjoy peace so long as it is stronger than its neighbors. He stated, I believe correctly, that there is no second chance for the weak in the Middle East. During the peace process, Israel must stay militarily strong and even supplement her strength to compensate for lost military assets, namely land and strategic depth. Towards this end, he stressed the importance of U.S. aid and the need to continue to provide the aid to help convince the Israeli public that the peace process will not jeopardize Israel's security. 
   Under the Wye River accords, the U.S. pledged to provide $1.2 billion in aid to Israel beyond the almost $3 billion it currently receives in annual economic and military assistance. This $1.2 billion is meant to pay for the costs of moving two military bases that are currently located in territory that will be handed over to the Palestinians under Wye. The money will also pay for additional missile defense deployments and research. 
   I told the Prime Minister that while there is support in Congress for such aid, there will be difficulties in procuring it. Because of the caps established under the '97 Budget Act, there is great difficulty in meeting existing requirements in the FY 2000 budget. Nevertheless, I told the Prime Minister that I believed the U.S. would ultimately provide the promised funds to implement the Wye Accord. 
   After leaving Prime Minister Barak's office, we drove directly to Ramallah, a city in the West Bank which is under the control of the Palestinian Authority. There we met with Chairman Yasser Arafat and a number of his deputies. Mr. Arafat had some complaints about the pace of negotiations with Israel, but he was still optimistic that there would be progress. 
   Some of Arafat's deputes seemed more pessimistic. Towards the end of my talk with Arafat, Saeb Erakat entered the room. Mr. Erakat is the Palestinians' chief negotiator with the Israelis over the terms for resuming implementation of the Wye accord, and he had just returned from a negotiating session with the Israelis. I asked Mr. Erakat how the negotiations went. He refused to go into details, but was clearly frustrated with the lack of progress. He complained that the Israeli settlers had too much influence and were refusing to compromise. The next day the papers reported that the Israeli-Palestinian talks had reached and impasse over the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. 
   Under the Wye Accords, the U.S. agreed to provide $400 million in aid to the Palestinians. I asked Arafat how he would use this money. He told me that it would go towards a variety of projects, including building a road from Jenin to Nablus, building a high tech industrial zone, and funding programs to help establish the rule of law in the Palestinian Authority territories. 
   I also asked Chairman Arafat about Syria and the possibility that Syria would cease to harbor Palestinian groups still pursing terrorism against Israel. Mr. Arafat told me that some of these groups may abandon terrorism on their own initiative. He told me that he is conducting negotiations with two reductionist groups--George Habash's Poplar Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Nayef Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine about the terms for ending hostilities against Israel and entering the political arena. If these negotiations succeed, the only major Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel will be the fundamentalist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
   Despite rumors about his poor health and the lip tremors that have been evident for some time, Mr. Arafat met me at his office at 8:30 in the evening. When our meeting ended at 9:40 he walked me out the door and then, I'm sure, returned to work. 
   The next morning we drove to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Foreign Minister David Levy. Mr. Levy was born in Morocco and moved to Israel in his teens. He speaks French, Arabic and Hebrew, but no English, so we spoke with the assistance of a translator. Mr. Levy reiterated the Prime Minister's commitment to quickly resume implementation of the Wye Accords. On Syria, he sounded a less optimistic note than Prime Minister Barak had. He stated that Israel cannot accept Syria's precondition for resuming negotiations that Israel accept Syria' interpretation of where negotiations with Prime Minister Rabin left off. Foreign Minister Levy stressed that Barak would be a tougher negotiator. 
   After these meetings with Barak and Levy, I though it would be worthwhile to hear from someone who is opposed to the peace process they are pursing. Perhaps no Israeli politician has been more consistent in his opposition to territorial concessions that former Prime Minister Yitzhark Shamir. So we dropped by Mr. Shamir's office in Tel Aviv for a visit. True to form, Mr. Shamir dismissed Oslo and Wye as dangerous concessions by Israel to her implacable enemies. He said that the Palestinians are real enemies of the State of Israel and that Syria will never be able to change. Shamir added that he would like to see 5 million more Jews move to Israel, but that there would be no room for such an expansion if the proposed territorial concessions take place. 
   After finishing our business in Jerusalem, we drove to Amman for a brief stay in the Jordanian capitol. Each time I visit Amman, I notice that the city has grown and developed substantially since my last visit. 
   We met with he new King of Jordan, King Abdullah, at his palace. I express my 
    condolences to the King on the loss of his father, King Hussein. King Hussein was truly a valuable force for peace in the Middle East, and I am hopeful that King Abdullah will fill the void his father's death left behind. 
   The King was upbeat about the situation in the Middle East. He believed that Ehud Barak was sincere about pursuing peace and making the sacrifices it entailed. He was also optimistic that President Assad would be flexible about negotiating with Israel and would relent on its insistence that the peace talks pick up exactly where he believes they left off with Rabin. He told me that Syria is prepared to accept all of Israel's requests regarding security arrangements in exchange for the Golan. 
   I also asked the King about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the failure of the U.S. to ratify it. He expressed his view that this was an important treaty for the safety of the world and told me that he hoped that the United States would ratify it. 
   From Amman we flew to Alexandria, Egypt, a teeming city on Egypt's Mediterranean Coast. Egypt's leaders often spend the hot summer months by the sea in Alexandria. When I met with President Mubarak in Washington this past June, he told me that he, too, would be in Alexandria for much of the summer. 
   President Mubarak shared the optimism of the other leaders I met that the Israeli-Palestinian track was going in the right direction. He was less sanguine about the Israel-Syria track, but felt that progress with the Palestinians would help bring the Syrians along. He suggested that Syria is looking to receive more from the Israelis than the Egyptians received in their peace treaty to justify the 20-year delay in making peace. 
   President Mubarak also stressed that it is essential that Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace agreement while Yasser Arafat is still alive. Mubarak fears, for good reason, that after Arafat's death there will be a power struggle among various Palestinian  factions for control of the Palestinian Authority, and that terrorism against Israel will become a feature of this competition. 
   I asked Mubarak about reports that he wanted to hold a summit on terrorism. He told me that he does intend to hold such a summit, and that he would like the focus of this summit to be terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. I think this is an excellent idea and encouraged President Mubarak to proceed with his plans. 
   I asked the President his opinion of the situation in Iran and what the U.S. policy towards Iran should be. Mubarak was not optimistic that Iran would abandon its extremism any time soon. He told me that the Iranians have named a street in Teheran after the man who assassinated President Sadat. When President Mubarak complained about this, the Iranians placed a large mural of the assassin above the street that bears his name. 
   I next asked President Mubarak when he would warm up his relations with Israel. Mubarak blamed the cold peace with Israel on Prime Minister Netanyahu. He told me that prior to Netanyahu, things were warming up and economic cooperation was beginning. When I asked him if Egypt's relations with Israel would warm up now that Netanyahu was out of office, he responded that this would ``take time.'' I reminded President Mubarak that a lot of time has already passed since Egypt and Israel signed their peace treaty. 
   From Alexandria we flew to Skopje, Macedonia, where we met representatives of the U.S. army for a one-day tour of neighboring Kosovo. We were flown by helicopter from Skopje to Prishtina, the major city in Kosovo. On the way, we flew over a number of Kosovar villages and towns. In almost every village, we saw the burnt-out remains of houses that once belonged to the Kosovor Albanians. 
   In Prishtina, we met with Bernard Kouchner, the UN's top official in Kosovor. Mr. Kouchner told us that he has witnessed some positive developments since coming to Kosovor. Most importantly, he noted that the large majority of Albanians who fled Kosovor during the war have already returned home. In addition, the Kosovo Liberation Army appears willing to accept the transition from paramilitary force to civil service. KLA members will be given approximately 2,500 places in the UN-sponsored Kosovor police force. 
   The return of the Kosovor Albanians to Kosovor is creating challenges for the UN. Mr. Kouchner told us that 60,000 homes were destroyed in Kosovor during the war, and that the UN would not be able to provide sufficient housing for all of the returnees prior to winter. The UN is going to have to rely on winterized tents and rehabilitating damaged homes to make up for the shortfall. 
   Mr. Kouchner told us that the major challenge facing the UN in Kosovo is protecting the Serbian community from Albanian retribution attacks. While he felt he was making some progress in this area, Mr. Kouchner noted that there were still a number of attacks taking place on a daily basis, including assault, arson, and murder. 
   I asked Mr. Kouchner how long the UN would have to stay in Kosovor. He estimated that it would take ``several years'' until the UN could leave. 
   From Prishtina we flew by helicopter to Camp Bondsteel, the base for the U.S. contingent 
   in NATO's Kosovo Force. There we were briefed by Brigadier General Peterson and his staff on the Army's mission in Kosovo. Although U.S. forces had only been in the country for 63 days, we saw a small city coming to life with rows of tents and some more permanent structures being built. 
   Although the war may be over, our forces still face great danger in Kosovo. General Peterson told us that up until 6 nights prior to our visit, U.S. forces had taken hostile fire every night since their arrival, mostly in the form of sniper and mortar fire at U.S. positions. Although there have been no fatalities from these attacks, some U.S. soldiers have been injured. 
   Our briefers confirmed that almost all of the Kosovar Albanians who left the U.S. sector during the fighting have since returned. Echoing what the UN's Kouchner told us, the soldiers said that one of the major problems they are now confronting is protecting the Serb population from retribution attacks by Albanians. Since some Albanians have sought to prevent the Serbs from harvesting their crops by targeting Serbian farmers, the U.S. must provide protection to Serbian farmers in the fields. 
   I asked the soldiers how long they thought the U.S. Army would need to be in Kosovo. They refused to hazard a guess. They pointed out that the region is less complex than Bosnia, since there are only two nationalities fighting each other in Kosovo, as opposed to three in Bosnia. On the other hand, they told me that by time the U.S. entered Bosnia, the Bosnians were exhausted from fighting and ready to lay down their arms. It is not clear that the parties in Kosovo have exhausted their will to fight. 
   Next we flew to the Kosovar village of Vlastica to view the sight of a massacre that took place during the war. As we entered the village, a large crowd of Albanian villagers came out to greet us. These people were clearly grateful for what the U.S. had done for them, and they were excited to hear that we wanted to help them rebuild and wanted to bring the war criminals to justice. 
   As we walked through the village, we passed a number of burned-out houses. Even the village mosque had been burned. We stopped at the charred remains of a home where 13 Albanians had been killed in one night. There, we met a 13-year-old girl named Vlora Shaboni. Vlora used to live in the house with her family, and she was at home the night the Serb soldiers came. She told us that the Serbs broke down the door and ordered everyone in the house to line up with their hands above their heads. Then they shot everyone with automatic weapons. To hide the evidence of this massacre, the Serbs set the house on fire and bulldozed the remains. 
   That night, Vlora saw the Serbs kill her mother and her brother. Vlora herself was shot in her face and the bullet lodged in her jaw, but she remained conscious and was able to escape before the house burned down. Vlora told me that she did not know her attackers but that she would be able to recognize them if she ever saw them again. 
   Vlora told her story with an anxious tremble in her voice and the frightened, downcast eyes. I don't know where she found the strength to talk about what happened that night at all. 
   The burnt remains of the victims of this massacre were left in the house, and have been recovered by a Canadian forensic team. That evidence, together with the statements of Vlora and others, will help the War Crimes prosecutors in The Hague prove their theory that Serbia's leaders orchestrated the systematic and widespread destruction of Albanian life in Kosovo. 
   From Skopje we flew to Naples, Italy, to visit the headquarters of Allied Forces Southern Europe, or ``AFSouth,'' which is NATO's southern command. There we were briefed by Lieutenant General Jack Nix, Jr., the Chief of Staff of AFSouth, and members of his staff. AFSouth is responsible for the region surrounding the Mediterranean and Black Seas. This region includes a number of hot spots such as the Middle East and the Balkans. AFSouth has been responsible for operations in both Bosnia and Kosovo. 
   We were briefed on the details of the air war in Kosovo. The allied bombing campaign was effective in Kosovo, and only 12% of bombing targets escaped without some damage. Still, our hosts agreed that there were problems with the air campaign. Most importantly, they noted that our forces were largely incapable of mounting the air campaign during bad weather. This experience convinced these soldiers that the U.S. must develop all-weather munitions that will free our forces from these weather-related limitations. 
   I asked if any broader military lessons could be learned from the Kosovo campaign. I noted that during the debate over whether to authorize the air campaign, some military experts had argued that a war can never be won by air power alone. Did Kosovo prove these experts wrong? My hosts responded that, in fact, our forces did not win in Kosovo by air power alone. Ground forces played a pivotal role in the conflict--they just weren't NATO ground forces. Towards the end of the conflict, the Kosovo Liberation Army began major ground operations against  Serbian positions. These operations pinned down large numbers of Serb troops in concentrated groups. These concentrations made the Serbian forces vulnerable to Allied air attacks for the first time in the war, and they sustained large numbers of casualties during this period. Had the KLA not undertaken this campaign, Serbian forces would have remained spread out and largely invulnerable to air attack. 
   During the air campaign, AFSouth was in charge of Operation Allied Harbor, which provided shelter to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled Kosovo. My hosts told me that during the height of the crisis, AFSouth actually exhausted the world's supply of tents in its effort to provide shelter for all the refugees. Now AFSouth is overseeing the repatriation of the Kosovar refugees to Kosovo. Our briefers confirmed what we heard in Kosovo--that most of the Kosovar Albanians who fled Kosovo during the war have already returned home. All of the refugees camps in Albania have been shut down. Among the small percentage of refugees who have not returned to Kosovo are the 20,000 who were brought to the United States and will most likely choose to remain here. 
   On August 26, I returned from Rome to Philadelphia.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my views on the Bryan amendment regarding the Timber Sales Management program within the National Forest Service. I am concerned about environmental protection and safeguarding our Nation's Forests, providing that there is an appropriate balance for economic development and job opportunities. 
   My state of Pennsylvania has one of the best run National Forests in the country. The Allegheny National Forest has some of the most valuable timber in the world, particularly its black cherry, which is used internationally for fine furniture and veneers. As an above cost forest, the Allegheny returns approximately $10 million to the Treasury annually and generates $44 million in total income and an estimated 732 jobs. The rural Pennsylvania counties that surround the Allegheny National Forest substantially rely on these revenues to fund their local school systems. 
   The Bryan amendment would provide the Timber Sales Management Program with the level of funding requested by the Administration. This is the program that funds the important work that is done to ensure that all timber cutting in our National Forests is done in an environmentally appropriate manner. The program is vital to restoring, improving and maintaining the health of our National Forests and it ensures that forests fully comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Further, the amendment would take the $32 million dollars that was added to this program by the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and would use the money to continue road maintenance and to conduct biological surveys of the National Forests. 
   I am convinced that we must continue to manage our National Forest system in a fiscal and environmental responsible manner. On final consideration, I believe this amendment strikes a fair balance between the efficient use of our National Forests and the funding of environmental programs that are vital to enhance the public's use and enjoyment of our national forests for many years to come.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator HARKIN and I have just announced a significant program on youth violence prevention, which I think is worthy of a comment or two on the Senate floor before we adjourn. 
   Next week, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education will have a markup. Senator HARKIN is ranking minority member of that subcommittee, and I chair it. We have worked through a program on a youth violence prevention initiative where we are allocating $850.8 million; $330 million is new money and the balance is a reallocation of funds within the Departments which will be directed toward preventing the scourge of youth violence of which we have seen so much in Littleton, CO, and so many other places. 
   The programs which we will be providing will involve counseling, literacy grants, afterschool programs, drug-free schools, alcohol therapy rehabilitation, mental health services, job training, character education, and metal detectors to prevent guns from being taken into schools. 
   This program will be directed by the Surgeon General, recognizing this as a national health crisis as articulated as long ago as 1982 by Dr. C. Everett Koop who was then the Surgeon General. 
   When these terrible occurrences happen at places like Littleton, there is a lot of hand wringing and a lot of finger pointing, but we have yet to have a sustained coordinated effort on a long-term basis to deal with the underlying causes and come to grips with those causes. 
   Senator HARKIN and I convened three lengthy meetings among the professionals of the three Departments: the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services. The experts who sat together said that was the first time they had been convened in that kind of a session. 
   After the first session, they went back to the drawing boards, and did so again after the second session and again after the third session and, in conjunction with our subcommittee staff, have worked out an extensive program which is comprehended in 11 pages of our proposed markup next week. 
   Included in this program is funding for the Surgeon General to pull together all the available information on the impact of movies, television, and video game violence and to undertake whatever other studies are necessary with appropriate methodology, with many in those industries claiming that the existing studies do not really deal in a methodological way that is accurate. 
   Next Tuesday, there will be a hearing of our subcommittee where the Secretaries of the three Departments, plus the Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder will participate where we will be moving forward with the specifics on this program. 
   This program has been coordinated with the President through his Office of Domestic Policy. We think it could provide a very significant step in dealing with youth violence prevention--a very major problem in America today. This goes to the underlying causes. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the 11-page text of our program be printed in the Congressional RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affair, I am pleased to report to the Senate on the features of S. 1076, the ``Veterans Benefits Act of 1999,'' as amended. This is a very important bill, and I direct the Senate's attention to some of its more salient features. 
   As is explained in detail in the Committee Report which accompanies this legislation, S. 1076 would improve and enhance the ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address a variety of the needs of the Nation's veterans. It would enhance VA's ability to provide long term care services to  aging veterans, and housing, training and other services to homeless veterans. It would extend VA programs to provide outreach and medical monitoring services to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families. It would improve and expand VA's authority to enter into ``enhanced use leases''--leases which permit VA to more effectively manage its large and costly infrastructure--and it would authorize needed construction projects. Further, S. 1076 would improve benefits provided to institutionalized veterans, to the survivors of former prisoners of war, and to certain Filipino veterans. Finally, it would clarify and codify standards governing burial in Arlington National Cemetery and provide statutory authority needed to permit the timely construction in Washington of a World War II Memorial. 
   One matter that has not yet been resolved prior to the reporting of this bill--how proposed pilot programs to provide long term care and assisted living services to veterans ought to be structured--merits explanation now. The Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, Senator Rockefeller, and I have now resolved that matter and our agreement is reflected in an amendment to the bill that we offer jointly today. As amended, S. 1076 would instruct VA to initiate pilot programs to provide veterans long term care and assisted living services. 
   The long term care pilot programs mandated by this legislation would require that VA--without interrupting current services--provide and report on long term care services offered in separate VA ``designated health care regions'' (Veterans Integrated Service Networks or ``VISNs'' under VA's current organizational structure) using three models: an ``in house'' model; a community-based cooperative model; and a model representing a hybrid of the VA-staffed and community-based approaches. We hope to demonstrate that VA can offer the Nation a meaningful methodology for managing comprehensive care to an aging clientele, and identify the model or models by which such care can be provided most cost-effectively. 
   The second pilot program mandated by this legislation would direct VA to develop an appropriate model for furnishing assisted living services to veterans, as recommended by the Federal Advisory Committee on Long Term Care. This pilot program would empower VA to provide services to aged and disabled veterans in their homes or in other residential settings to assist them with their activities of daily living--and to assist them in avoiding or deferring more costly hospital or nursing home care. The Ranking Member and I hope to thrust VA into the forefront of this growing and challenging field of health care and foster the development of new and cost-effective solutions to challenges which all aging Americans face. 
   I urge the immediate passage of this bill as amended. And I thank the Senate for its attention to the needs of the Nation's veterans.

   Mr. SPECTER. I am pleased to vote for the confirmation of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations and even more pleased to see the Senate vote on this important nomination in advance of the August recess so that Ambassador Holbrooke can start on his important assignment. 
   Ambassador Holbrooke brings unique qualifications to this position. He began his government career in 1962 joining the Foreign Service after graduating from Brown University. Among the many posts he has held are Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus in 1997, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Peace Corps Director in Morocco and U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Ambassador Holbrooke was the chief negotiator for the Dayton Peace Accord in Bosnia. 
   I had occasion to evaluate Ambassador Holbrooke's work in some detail when I served as Chairman of the Intelligence committee which undertook a  detailed investigation of the sale of Iranian arms to Bosnia. Ambassador Holbrooke was involved in a complex, highly sensitive matter and he discharged his duties with professionalism. 
   In undertaking the complex negotiations on Bosnia, Ambassador Holbrooke again performed a great service for the United States. His last minute negotiations with Yugoslavia's President Milosevic, while unsuccessful, showed his unique talents which will be put to good use for our national interest in his new capacity as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. 
   Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my view, the underlying issues on the conference report on the tax cut bill present a close question. There is much to be said for the basic proposition of returning a portion of the surplus to the taxpayers so that they, instead of Congress, can decide where to spend the money. 
   The competing view is that the projected surplus over a 10-year period is highly speculative and that great care must be exercised to be sure Social Security and Medicare are solvent. The projected surplus also requires adherence to caps or limitations on spending which both the Congress and the President now admit to be unrealistic. The projected surplus also does not take into consideration emergencies, such as the multibillion-dollar Agriculture appropriations bill which passed the Senate last night. 
   In addition, there is substantial merit to using any surplus to pay down the national debt, thus reducing the $293 billion in annual interest charges on the $5.6 trillion debt. On balance, on a close question, I believe the Nation's interest will be best served by rejecting the $792 billion tax cut, leaving open the possibility at a later time of a more modest $500 billion tax cut as proposed by a group of centrists. 
   In reality, the vote on the conference report may well be meaningless in light of the President's repeated statements that he will veto the bill. This bill is probably just another step in the complex negotiations involving pending appropriations bills, including mine as my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
   I voted against the tax bill when it was before the Senate last week, and I am opposed to the tax bill tonight. At the urging of the majority leader, Senator LOTT, I have agreed to consider a live pair with my colleague, Senator MIKE CRAPO, who is in Idaho for his daughter's wedding. As of early this morning when I talked to Senator CRAPO, there were no commercial flights which would return him to Washington in time to vote. If he returned by charter aircraft, he would miss his daughter's wedding ceremony and disrupt the family's wedding celebration. 
   I have decided to agree to that live pair, which means that during the rollcall, if it is necessary, if it turns out Senator CRAPO's vote is indispensable, I will say that if Senator CRAPO were here, he would vote aye for the bill and I would vote nay against the bill. His absent aye vote would be paired then with my nay vote which would not be cast. 
   I am concerned, candidly, that this live pair being inside the beltway would be widely misunderstood, but I believe it is preferable to compelling Senator CRAPO's return to Washington  or to have the will of the Senate exclude the vote of Senator CRAPO who could not be here unless he returned by charter jet and missed his daughter's wedding. 
   As I say, I voted against this bill last week, and I am opposed to it today. I intend to vote no unless the live pair with Senator CRAPO is indispensable for the reasons I have just outlined. 
   I thank the Chairman and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, The Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for adding $1.4 million to the Department of Energy's competitively awarded, cost-shared ITM Syngas program, specifically the ``Engineering Development of Ceramic Membrane Reactor Systems for Converting Natural Gas to Hydrogen and Synthesis Gas for Liquid Transportation Fuels'' project. This important high-risk, high-impact gas-to-liquids research and development project will convert domestic remote and off-shore natural gas to synthesis gas, resulting in lower cost production and cleaner alternative fuels. This program also promises to create new markets for U.S. domestic resources and extend the useful life of the Alaskan North Slope oil fields and the trans-Alaskan pipeline system. 
   The ITM Syngas research and development effort is a complex, high risk undertaking by the Department of Energy and its industry, national laboratory and university partners. As with any complex technological undertaking, the Department of Energy and its ITM Syngas team have had to increase the scope of the initial phase of the program and add a university partner to ensure the project's long-term success. 
   This $1.4 million is in addition to the budget request for fiscal year 2000 of $2.5 million that is in the Fossil Energy, Gas, Emerging Processing Technology Applications and the Energy Supply, Hydrogen Research program. The total DOE funding for the ITM Syngas program in fiscal year 2000 is $3.9 million. 
   The addition of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2000 will allow approximately $600,000 to be allocated to the first phase of this project to fund activities that could not have been anticipated when the program commenced last year. The remaining $800,000 will allow the second phase of the ITM Syngas to be accelerated, allowing future costs to be avoided. 
   This program brings together the Department of Energy, U.S. industry--large and small--our national laboratories and research universities. Again, I want to thank the Senator from Washington for his efforts to ensure that from the earliest phases of this important research and development effort, ITM Syngas is a success.

   Mr. SPECTER. I was surprised by the three decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on June 23, 1999 which drastically reduced the Constitutional power of Congress and even more surprised by the lack of reaction by Members of the House and Senate to this usurpation of Congressional authority. [College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4375, Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4376 and Allen v. Maine, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4374.] 
   Even though ignored by the Congress, these decisions have been roundly criticized by the academicians. Stanford University historian Jack Rakove, author of ``Original Meanings'', a Pulitzer Prize winning account of the drafting of the Constitution, characterizes Justice Kennedy's historical argument in Alden v. Maine as ``strained, even silly''. 
   Professor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, in commenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board versus College Savings Bank, said:  
   ``The decision makes no sense'', asserting that it arises from ``a bizzarre states' rights agenda that really has nothing to do with intellectual property.''  
   Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe commented:  
   ``In the absence of even a textual hint in the Constitution, the Court discerned from the constitutional `either' that states are immune from individual lawsuits.'' (These decisions are) ``scary''. ``They treat states' rights in a truly exaggerated way, harking back to what the country looked like before the civil war and, in many ways, even before the adoption of the Constitution.''  
   In addition to treating the Congress with disdain, the five person majority in all three cases demonstrated judicial activism and exhibited what can only be viewed as a political agenda in drastically departing from long-standing law. Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger described these cases as: ``one of the three or four major shifts in constitutionalism we've seen in two centuries.'' 
   A commentary in The Economist on July 3, 1999 emphasized the Court's radical departure from existing law stating:  
   The Court's majority has embarked on a venture as detached from any constitutional moorings as was the liberal Warren Court of the 1960's in its most activity mood.  
   In its two opinions in College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid and Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank, the Court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents states from being sued in Federal court for infringing intellectual property rights. In reaching these decisions, the Court discussed and dismissed two laws passed by Congress for the specific purpose of subjecting the states to suits in Federal Court: the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act. 
   These decisions leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs. Through their state-owned universities and hospitals, states participate in the intellectual property marketplace as equals with private companies. The University of Florida, for example, owns more than 200 patents. Furthermore, state entities such as universities are major consumers of intellectual property and often violate intellectual property 
   laws when, for example, they copy textbooks without proper authorization. 
   But now, Florida and all other states will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors--they will be immune from being sued for intellectual property infringement. Since patent and copyright infringement are exclusively Federal causes of action, and trademark infringement is largely Federal, the inability to sue in Federal court is, practically speaking, a bar to any redress at all. 
   The right of states to sovereign immunity from most Federal lawsuits is guaranteed in the Eleventh Amendment to the constitution, which provides that:  
   The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign state.  
   It has long been recognized, however, that this immunity from suit is not absolute. As the Supreme Court noted in one of the Florida Prepaid opinions, the Court has recognized two circumstances in which an individual may sue a state:  
   First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment--an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. Secondly, a state may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suite.--College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid at 7.  
   Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment is contained in Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' One of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section One, provides that no State shall, ``deprive any person of ..... property ..... without due process of law.'' Accordingly, Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the rights of citizens not to be deprived of their property--including their intellectual property--without due process of law. 
   Employing this power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress passed the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act in 1992. As its preamble states, Congress passed the Patent Remedy Act to ``clarify that States ..... are subject to suit in Federal court by any person for infringement of patents and plant variety protections.'' Congress passed the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act to subject the States to suits brought under Sec. 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 for false and misleading advertising. 
   In Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank, the Court held in a 5 to 4 opinion that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity from patent infringement suits when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court reasoned that in order determine whether a Congressional enactment validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunity, two questions must be answered, ``first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity ..... and second  whether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.'' 
   The Court acknowledged that in enacting the Patent Remedy Act, Congress made its intention to abrogate the States' immunity unmistakably clear in the language of the statute. The Court then held, however, that Congress had not acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. The Court wrote that Congress' enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment is ``remedial'' in nature. Therefore, ``for Congress to invoke Section 5 it must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such conduct.'' Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank at 20. 
   The court found that Congress failed to identify a pattern of patent infringement by the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional violations. The Court specifically noted that a deprivation of property without due process could occur only where the State provides inadequate remedies to injured patent owners. The Court then observed that:  
   Congress, however, barely considered the availability of state remedies for patent infringement and hence whether the States' conduct might have amounted to a constitutional violation under the Fourteenth Amendment *.*.*. Congress itself said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state remedies in the statute or in the Senate Report, and made only a few fleeting references to state remedies in the House Report, essentially repeating the testimony of the witnesses.--Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank at 27-28.  
   Accordingly, the Court concluded that:  
   The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy Act does not respond to a history of widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic Section 5 legislation. Instead, Congress appears to have enacted this legislation in response to a handful of instances of state patent infringement that do not necessarily violate the Constitution.) Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank at 31-32.  
   Not only is the result of this opinion troubling--that states will enjoy immunity from suit--but so is the reasoning which supports this result. Here we have a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court choosing to ignore an act of Congress because he has concluded that Congress passed the legislation with insufficient justification. In essence, the Chief Justice is telling us we did a poor job developing our record before passing the Patent Remedy Act. As we all know, however, many of us support legislation for reasons that don't make it into the written record. The record is an important, but imperfect, summary of or views. This is why past Courts have been reluctant to dismiss Congressional motives in this fashion. 
   In College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid, the Supreme Court decided in a 5 to 4 opinion that Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (the ``TRCA'') was not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, noted that Congress passed the TRCA to remedy and prevent state deprivations of two types of property rights: (1) a right to be free from a business competitor's false advertising about its own product, and (2) a more generalized right to be secure in one's business interests. The Court contrasted these rights with the hallmarks of a protected property interest, namely the right to exclude others. 
   Justice Scalia reached the surprising conclusion that protection against false advertising secured by Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not implicate property rights protected by the due process clause so that Congress could not rely on its remedies under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity. If conducting a legitimate business operation with protection from false advertising is not a ``property right'', it is hard to conceive of what is business property. That Scalia rationale shows the extent to which the Court has gone to invalidate Congressional enactments. 
   The Court then discussed whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though not abrogated, was voluntarily waived. Here, the Court expressly overruled its prior decision in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. 377 U.S. 184 (1964) and held that there was no voluntary waiver. In Parden, the Court had created the doctrine of constructive waiver, which held that a state could be found to have waived its immunity to suit by engaging in certain activities, such as voluntary participation in the conduct Congress has sought to regulate. Since Congress has sought to regulate interstate commerce, then a state which participated in interstate commerce by registering and licensing patents would be held to have voluntarily waived its immunity to a patent infringement suit. By overruling Parden, however, the Court held that a voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressed. Florida made no such express waiver of its sovereign immunity. 
   In other relatively recent cases, the Court has gone out of its way, almost on a personal basis, to chastise and undercut Congress. The case of Sable v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989) provides a striking example of this trend. In Sable, the Court struck down a ban on ``indecent'' interstate telephone communications passed by Congress in 1988. In rejecting this provision, the Court focused on whether there were constitutionally acceptable less restrictive means, short of a total ban, to achieve its goal of protecting minors. The Court then declared, in unusually dismissive and critical language, that Congress had not sufficiently considered this issue:  
   *.*.*.aside from conclusory statements during the debates by proponents of the bill ..... that under the FCC regulations minors could still have access to dial-a-porn messages, the congressional record presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most recent regulations were or might prove to be. 
   The bill that was enacted ..... was introduced on the floor. ..... No Congressman or Senator purported to present a considered judgement with respect to how often or to what extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and have access to dial-a-porn messages.  
   If a member of the Congress made a judgement, by what authority does the Supreme Court superimpose its view that it wasn't a ``considered judgement''? A fair reading of the statements from the floor debate on this issue undercuts the Court's disparaging characterization of this debate. For example, Representative TOM BLILEY of Virginia gave a rather detailed and persuasive discussion of how he concluded that a legislative ban was necessary. Mr. BLILEY noted that in 1983, Congress first passed legislation which required the FCC to report regulations describing methods by which dial-a-porn providers could screen out underage callers. Mr. BLILEY then walks us through the repeated failure of the FCC to pass regulations which could withstand judicial scrutiny. Finally, Mr. BLILEY notes that:  
   ..... it has become clear that there was not a technological solution that would adequately and effectively protect our children from the effect of this material. We looked for effective alternatives to a ban--there were none.  
   The Court repeats its critique of Congressional action in the case of Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Here the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act, which prohibited transmission to minors of ``indecent'' or ``patently offensive'' communications. In this opinion, the Court again discusses whether less restrictive means were available and again concludes that Congress had not sufficiently addressed the issue. The opinion notes that:  
   The Communications Decency Act contains provisions that were either added in executive committee after the hearings [on the Telecom Act] were concluded or as amendments offered during floor debate on the legislation. ..... No hearings were held on the provisions that became the law.  
   The Court in Reno later notes that, ``The lack of legislative attention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel with this case.'' 
   Once again, if Congress passes a law, by what authority does the Supreme Court conclude that we did not devote sufficient legislative attention to the law? In the Reno opinion itself the 
   Court noted that some Members of the House of Representatives opposed the Communications Decency Act because they thought that less restrictive screening devices would work. These members offered an amendment intended as a substitute for the Communications Decency Act, but instead saw their provision accepted as an additional section of the Act. In light of this record, how can the Court say that Congress did not consider less restrictive means?  
   A recent trend in Supreme Court decisions, highlighted by these three cases, shows an activist court with a political agenda determined to restructure political power in America away from Congress and to the states. What is Congress to do? We could exercise greater care in the confirmation process, but that is hardly the answer. Supreme Court nominees in Senate confirmation hearings routinely promise to respect Congressional authority and not to make new law. Once on the Court, many of the justices ignore those commitments. 
   The decision in Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank leaves a slight opening for Congress to legislate again under Article 5 of the 14th Amendment to narrowly tailor a legislative approach to satisfy the Court. Given the intensity of the Court's agenda and its inventive and extreme rationales for declaring Congressional actions unconstitutional, it is highly doubtful that anything the Congress does will satisfy the Court in its current campaign. 
   Congress may have to initiate a constitutional amendment to re-establish its legitimate authority. Before these three cases, it was unthinkable that Congress' authority over trademarks, patents and copyrights would have been undercut by a doctrine of state sovereign immunity. How could that be in the face of the provisions of Article 1, Section 8 granting the Congress express authority over trademarks, patents and copyrights by its enumerated power:  
   To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries  
   These important issues merit immediate and extensive consideration by the Congress. Perhaps a constitutional amendment is the only way to reinstate the balance between the authority of the Congress and the usurpation by the Supreme Court.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator TOM HARKIN, my colleague and distinguished ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, which I chair, in introducing the National Fund for Health Research Act of 1999. This creative proposal, which would create a dedicated health research fund in the U.S. Treasury to supplement the current federal research funding mechanisms, was first developed by Senator HARKIN and our former Senate colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. I think their idea is a sound one and ought to be adopted, and I am pleased to join Senator HARKIN in introducing this legislation as I did during the 105th Congress. I have also included this proposal as a provision of my comprehensive health care reform legislation, the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999 (S. 24), introduced on January 19, 1999. 
   I have said many times that I firmly believe that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the crown jewel of the Federal government, and substantial investment is crucial to allow the continuation of the breakthrough research into the next decade. In 1981, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion. For the past three years, NIH funding has increased by 6.8 percent in fiscal year 1997, 7.1 percent in fiscal year 1998, and 15 percent in fiscal year 1999, for a total of $15.7 billion. Senator HARKIN and I are continuing to fight to double the NIH budget, a sentiment which was unanimously supported in the United States Senate during the 105th Congress. 
   I was dismayed, however, upon examining President Clinton's $15.9 billion budget request for the NIH for fiscal year 2000--only a little over two percent growth, far less than the 15 percent needed to double NIH. At the President's requested level, new and competing NIH research project grants would drop by 1,554--from 9,171 in fiscal year 1999 to 7,617 in fiscal year 2000. This outlook on future grant awards is wholly inadequate to meet the country's most important challenges to improve the health and quality of life for millions of Americans. 
   To call the President's plan short-sighted would be an understatement. In practical terms, two percent amounts to spending less than $24 for every American who suffers from coronary heart disease. Two percent means slowing the race to cure breast cancer or discover a vaccine to prevent the spread of AIDS. And it means that some of the most promising new breakthroughs in science, like stem cell research, may be postponed for years. Breaking the code for complex problems takes a steady and sustained commitment of people and money. 
   The National Fund for Health Research Act which we are introducing today would continue Senator HARKIN'S and my unwavering commitment to increasing the nation's investment in biomedical research. The legislation would create a special fund for health research to supplement funding achieved through the regular appropriations process--possibly by as much as $6 billion annually. Our legislation would require health insurers to transfer to the U.S. Treasury an amount  equal to 1 percent of all health premiums they receive. To ensure that the additional funds generated do not simply replace regularly appropriated NIH funds, monies from the health research fund would only be released if the total amount appropriated for the NIH in that year equaled or exceeded the prior year appropriations. 
   We must all recognize that expanding our base of scientific knowledge inevitably leads to better health, lower health care costs, and an improved quality of life for all Americans. I believe that the creation of a fund for health research would bring us closer to those critical goals. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the National Fund for Health Research Act, and urge its swift adoption.

   Mr. SPECTER. This amendment calls for the creation of a dairy compact that would extend beyond the New England States, which currently have a dairy compact, and would include a number of other States, such as Pennsylvania, New York, and others. The purpose of this dairy compact is to stabilize the price of milk. The price of milk has fluctuated enormously. In December of last year, it was as high as $17.34 per hundredweight; in June of this year, it went down to $11.42 per hundredweight. 
   There is currently a dairy compact in effect for the Northeastern States--not including Pennsylvania or New York--which will expire in October of this year. The compact will provide some stability in the industry and will guarantee consumers an uninterrupted supply of milk. There has been some concern expressed about the cost to the consumers. When the Northeast Compact went into effect, the prices for milk within the compact region were 5 cents lower than retail prices in the rest of the Nation. 
   This bill would authorize member States to enter into a voluntary agreement to create a minimum price for milk in the compact region that takes into account the regional differences in the costs of production. In addition to providing the stability, it will ensure, with an appropriate safety net, that milk can be produced and be available for very important programs like WIC--Women, Infants, and Children--and the availability generally. 
   Pennsylvania passed legislation that will enable Pennsylvania to enter into this compact if it is authorized by the Congress. Some 40 Senators have cosponsored similar legislation, and Governor Ridge signed legislation that would permit my State of Pennsylvania to enter into the compact. 
   Mr. President, as I outlined earlier, when seeking a unanimous consent agreement, I do not intend to press this issue to a vote. I do not intend to do so because of the rule of the Senate that bars legislation on an appropriations bill--a recently revived rule. But I am putting it in the RECORD today and outlining its basic purpose, with the intent to bring it up in the conference with the House to try to get this enacted into law. 
   I am pleased now to yield to the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take sharp exception to the argument of the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, where the assertion is made that we fell far short of cloture. We had 53 Senators who voted in favor of cloture. We are moving up the line toward the requisite 60 number. 
   I might point out that on the campaign finance reform bill after some substantial years of effort there are 52 votes. I am one of the 52. I believe the campaign finance bill is going to get to 60 just as I think the chances are excellent that we may well get to 60 on this cloture vote. 
   But the important point is that 53 Senators signified their desire to support strong dairy prices. That is much more significant in terms of being two votes over the majority. It is hard to get 51 Senators in this body to agree to anything. It is harder yet to get 52, and harder still to get 53. 
   There is a widespread recognition in this body, including the 40 Senators who have cosponsored this legislation. I believe there is a lot of support signified by 53 votes for cloture. 
   We will have an opportunity to move ahead with this bill when it gets to conference. 
   We will let the conference work its will and it may return to the floor. There are very good reasons for this bill. I understand there are regional differences, and what may benefit the farmers of Pennsylvania may detract to some extent from the farmers in other States. 
   In our Government, in our democracy, we work these things out as best we can. I hope we can find some common ground. If we can't, let the Congress work its will.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly on the introduction of legislation for the random selection of judges. I had thought when cases were assigned in the Federal courts they were assigned in a random fashion, unless they were related to some other case where a specific judge had jurisdiction and that judge would have the case by a related case assignment. 
   During the course of the past week there has come to light a situation in the District of Columbia where the chief judge assigned specific judges to two very high-profile cases, one involving Mr. Webster Hubbell as a defendant and the other involving Mr. Charlie Trie as a defendant. 
   My understanding of the practice has been that cases would be assigned on a random basis. In checking the specifics, I have found that the Judicial Conference, which is the policy-making body for the Federal Judiciary, only recommends that Federal courts randomly assign cases. It has not become a mandate to do so. I believe that public policy warrants having it as a mandate. 
   It is customary for the Congress to legislate on matters of administration. For example, Congress has set a time limit under the speedy trial rule in the criminal courts. For another example, Congress has established time limits on Federal court habeas corpus cases where death penalty cases are appealed into the Federal courts. 
   This is not a matter where we are talking about the discretion or judgment of an individual judge on how to decide a case, where judicial independence mandates that nobody make any suggestion to the judge as to how an individual case is to be decided. But as a matter of administrative policy it is entirely appropriate for the Congress to set the rules, one of which I think should be the random assignment of judges. 
   In March of this year the Judicial Conference even rescinded its 28-year-old policy that recommended giving the chief judges, the assigning judge, latitude to make special assignments of ``protracted, difficult, or wildly publicized cases,'' so such latitude is no longer recommended by the Judicial Conference.

   Mr. SPECTER. In the reply, the chief judge says this:  
   This A.P. article alleges that I ``bypassed the traditional random assignment system'' to assign certain criminal cases to judges appointed by President Clinton, singling out the criminal case against Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, which was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, and the criminal case against Webster Hubbell, which was assigned to Judge James Robertson. The article implies that these cases were assigned to these judges based on political motivations. The unsubstantiated assertion could not be further from the truth.  
   Now, I do not question the statements made by the chief judge in denying any portion of partiality or impropriety, but I do believe that when this case is called to widespread public attention the Congress ought to act. That is why I am introducing this legislation today on behalf of myself and Senator HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
   The reasons for this legislation are articulated by Columbia University law professor H. Richard Uviller, who said:  
   As far as assigning a recently appointed judge of the same party, it's dangerous, it's risky, it's hazardous because the outcome might support the cynical view that the judge did not decide the matter on the merits even though that may be the furthest thing from the truth.  
   A similar statement was made by New York University law professor Steven Gillers, who said:  
   If the case is high-profile, that should increase the presumption in favor of random selection.  
   This issue of random selection is one that I feel particularly strongly about based on my experience as district attorney in the Philadelphia criminal courts. When high-profile or politically-tinged cases were filed in the criminal courts of Philadelphia during my tenure as district attorney, I routinely asked for a jury trial because I  wanted the facts decided by an impartial fact finder. At the outset of that tenure in January of 1966, the Commonwealth was a party to the proceeding and, like the defendant, had a right to demand a jury trial. I did demand jury trials because I found that the assignment to specific judges was not random and did on some occasions have inappropriate motivations. 
   During the course of my tenure as district attorney, the State supreme court made a change in the criminal rules and took away the right of the district attorney to demand a jury trial. That was recently reinstated by a constitutional amendment so that the experience I have seen requires a very heavy emphasis on the random selection. 
   During my tenure as district attorney, we reformed the entire minor judiciary of Philadelphia known as magistrates because of widespread corruption and inappropriate practices in that judicial system. While this in no way reflects upon the Federal courts of the United States, which I think are of uniformly high quality, I do believe that the principle of random selection of judges is a very important principle. I do believe there ought to be an exception if there is a related case; that is, where a judge was assigned a case on a random basis and another matter comes in where there are very similar, if not identical, questions of fact and questions of the parties. But this legislation removes at least the appearance and the question that there may be some collateral motivation. 
   To reiterate, I seek recognition today to introduce the Random Selection of Judges Act of 1999, a bill which will require that cases in Federal court be assigned to judges randomly, by means of a computer program. I believe that only the random assignment of cases to judges will ensure blind justice in our courts. 
   This power to assign cases creates the potential for abuse. An assigning judge who is so inclined could attempt to alter the outcome of a case by assigning it to a judge who, in the opinion of the chief judge, holds a ``correct'' view on the issue at hand. 
   A story recently in the news clearly demonstrates the potential for abuse under the current system. Over the weekend, the Associated Press reported that Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, Chief Judge of the District Court for the District of Columbia, bypassed the traditional random computer assignment system in her court and instead directly assigned criminal cases against certain presidential friends to judges appointed by President Clinton. Specifically, the campaign finance case against Charlie Trie was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, and the tax cases against Webster Hubbell were assigned to Judge James Robertson. According to the news reports, Judge Johnson's decision to abandon random assignment in these high profile cases raised concerns among several other judges on her court. It was also reported that these judges raised concerns because Judge Robertson is friends with Vernon Jordan, who played a role in the Hubbell affair, and Judge Friedman is friends with Reid Weingarten, who represents the defendants in two fundraising cases before Friedman. 
   According to the Associated Press article, it has been asserted by some that Judge Johnson assigned these cases to Clinton appointees because they would be more sympathetic to the President and his friends than Republican appointees who may have gotten the cases through random assignment. Judge Johnson has denied any political or other improper motive in a letter to the Washington Times. The fact is that Judge Johnson herself issued a number of rulings against President Clinton, including her rulings rejecting privilege claims by White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and the Secret Service. But no matter what Judge Johnson's motives, her actions make quite clear that, under the current system, the potential for abuse does exist. 
   Currently, the Judicial Conference, which is the policymaking body for the federal judiciary, recommends that Federal courts randomly assign cases. In fact, in March the conference even rescinded its 28-year-old policy that recommended giving chief judges latitude to make special assignments of ``protracted, difficult, or widely publicized cases.'' But there is still no requirement that Federal courts randomly assign cases. The problem with mere recommendations is that they can be ignored. If we believe that cases should be randomly assigned, then we must require that cases be randomly assigned. 
   My bill imposes such a requirement. Under my bill, the chief judges of the Federal district and circuit courts must assign cases by means of an automated random assignment program. Recognizing that there are some instances in which it would serve the interests of efficiency to allow the chief judges to directly assign cases to specific judges, my bill includes two important exceptions to the random assignment requirement. First, chief judges will be permitted to directly assign a case to a judge who has already heard a related case. A related case is defined as one which involves substantially the same facts, individuals and/or property as a case previously before the court. For instance, a case against a defendant in a bank robbery could be directly assigned to a judge who already heard the case against another defendant in the same bank robbery. 
   Secondly, chief judges will be permitted to directly assign a technical case to a judge who is already familiar with the subject matter at issue. Technical cases are defined as those which involve specialized, unusually complex facts or subject matter and which would demand a great deal of time to master. For example, an asbestos liability case could be directly assigned to a judge who has already developed an expertise in handling asbestos liability cases. 
   While Congress should not micro-manage the Courts, the legislation I introduce today is reasonable, limited, and well within our power. Article 1, Section 8, Clause 9 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to ``constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court.'' Pursuant to this power, Congress established the Federal circuits and originally assigned Supreme Court justices to ride these circuits. Under this power, Congress eventually established the Federal district courts and outlined their jurisdiction. The sections of the Federal Code I seek to amend today--which permit the assignment of judges in accordance with court rules--were themselves Congressional enactments. Even in recent years, Congress has imposed restrictions on the procedures of the courts. For example, the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 1996 contained a provision I authored to reform habeas corpus. This provision imposes strict time limits on both the filing of habeas corpus petitions and the response by the courts to such petitions. Likewise, many bills we pass include requirements that certain cases be heard by the Courts on an expedited basis. 
   Mr. President, I feel strongly that my bill should not become a partisan issue. As I mentioned before, one's opinion of Judge Johnson and her actions is entirely beside the point. Judge Johnson's reported actions merely make us aware of the potential for abuse in our current system and the need to rectify it. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this necessary, common-sense legislation. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a bill reauthorizing the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program. This Congressional fellowship program, created in 1992, is a fitting tribute to my late colleague and dear friend, United States Senator John Heinz. Senator Heinz dedicated his life and much of his Congressional career to improving the lives of senior citizens. He believed that Congress has a special responsibility to serve as a guardian for those who cannot protect themselves. This fellowship program, which focuses on aging issues, honors the life and continues the legacy of Senator John Heinz. 
   During his 20 years in the Congress, John Heinz compiled an enviable record of accomplishments. While he was successful in many areas, he built a national reputation for his strong commitment to improving the quality of life of our nation's elderly. Pennsylvania, with nearly 2 million citizens aged 65 or older--over 15% of the population--houses the second largest elderly population nationwide. As John traveled throughout the state, he listened to the concerns of this important constituency and came back to Washington to address their needs through policy and legislation. 
   Senator Heinz led the fight against age discrimination by championing legislation to eliminate the requirement that older Americans must retire at age 65, and by ensuring full retirement pay for older workers employed by factories forced to close. During his Chairmanship of the Senate Special Committee on Aging from 1981-1986 and his tenure as Ranking Minority Member from 1987-1991, Senator Heinz used his position to improve health care accessibility and affordability for senior citizens and to reduce fraud and abuse within Federal health care programs. Congress enacted his legislation to provide Medicare recipients a lower cost alternative to fee-for-service medicine, as well as his legislation to add a hospice benefit to the Medicare program. 
   John also recognized the great need for nursing home reforms. He was successful in passing legislation mandating that safety measures be implemented in nursing homes and ensuring that nursing home residents cannot be bound and tied to their beds or wheelchairs. 
   Mr. President, the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program will help continue the efforts of Senator Heinz to give our nation's elderly the quality of life they deserve. The program encourages the identification and training of new leadership in aging policy by awarding fellowships to qualified candidates to serve in a Senate office or with a Senate Committee staff. The goal of this program is to advance the development of the public policy in issues affecting senior citizens. Administered by the Heinz Family Foundation in conjunction with the Secretary of the Senate, the program allows fellows to bring their firsthand experience in aging issues to the work of Congress. Heinz fellows who are advocates for aging issues spend a year to help us learn about the effects of Federal policies on our elderly citizens, those who are social workers help us find better ways to protect our nation's elderly from abuse and neglect, and those who are health care providers help us to build a strong health care system that addresses the unique needs of our seniors. 
   As fellows, senior citizen advocates and aging policy experts not only have the opportunity to use their expertise to facilitate national debate about issues concerning senior citizens, they also prepare themselves to make future contributions to their local communities. The Heinz fellowship enables us to train new leaders in senior citizen advocacy and aging policy. The fellows return to their respective careers with a new understanding about how to work effectively with government, so they may better fulfill their goals as senior citizen advocates.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on Friday, August 6, 1999 John Bradley completes a two year assignment to the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In view of his outstanding performance and contributions to the Committee and our country's veterans, I am taking this occasion to recognize John. 
   In mid 1997, the Committee was without a professional staff member with expertise in veterans' health care delivery system. I turned to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the temporary assignment of such a person. In truth, I anticipated retaining whoever was assigned only until such time as my Staff Director was able to interview and propose a permanent professional staff member. VA's then Acting Secretary Herschel Gober agreed to the detailing of John Bradley since John had served a similar assignment to this Committee in the 103rd Congress. 
   John Bradley turned out to be the consummate professional and the search for a permanent professional staff member was halted. A veteran of the Vietnam conflict and a career employee of the VA with over 25 years of service, primarily with the Veterans Health Administration, John made an immediate impact. With the Committee's legislative agenda completed, he directed with great professional skill the rigors of staff conferencing with his House counterparts.  
   It also soon became apparent that John was not a bureaucrat or intent on maintaining the status quo. In fact, he is an intellectual and innovative thinker who is willing to explore new ideas to advance the cause of veterans health care. 
   During his assignment to the Committee, John played a major role in shaping the following legislation: the Veterans' Health Care Improvements Act of 1998, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998, and the Veterans Compensation Cost of Living Adjustment Act of 1998. Additionally, John has spent many hours this year working on S. 1076, the Veterans Benefits Improvements Act of 1999 which I hope will pass the Senate soon. 
   Upon his departure and on behalf of the Committee, I extend my deep appreciation to John for his courage, his innovation, his professionalism and, above all, his enduring concern for veterans. He shall be missed.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1386.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this flat tax amendment realistically as a protest against the complicated Tax Code which now numbers some 7.5 million words, costs $600 billion in compliance, and takes 5.4 billion hours to comply. This amendment is supported by Senator LOTT, Senator NICKLES, Senator CRAIG, and others. 
   In a very shorthand statement, this is a tax return under the flat tax. It is a postcard, and it can be filled out in 15 minutes. It eliminates taxes on capital gains, on estates, and on dividends, all of which have been taxed before. It is not regressive. There is no tax for a family of four up to $27,500 in earnings, which is 53 percent of Americans. There is a reduction in tax for $1,000 up to $35,000. It is even at $75,000. An affirmative vote will signal a protest to urge the Finance Committee and Ways and Means to give serious consideration to this important reform.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Louisiana. 
   Mr. President, I join in cosponsoring this centrist approach. In my view, the tax proposal to cut $792 billion over 10 years is too much. It may be that the United States would be best served by not having any tax cut at all, but it appears we are headed for some tax cut. And a group of centrists, so-called moderates, have joined together on the proposal which is now on the floor for a tax cut of some $500 billion. 
   This same group, in substantial measure, was assembled 2 weeks ago on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights, where the centrists had an alternative proposal to the more extreme proposals on the right and on the left. 
   We have rounded up the so-called ``usual suspects,'' but we have a few more; and I think there is some chance that this bill, this proposal, this amendment will be adopted, if not today, then perhaps ultimately. 
   At the outset, I acknowledge the proposition which has been advanced by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan: that the Government of the United States would be best served if there were to be no tax cut at all. 
   The projections of the surpluses are highly speculative. If you change the interest rate a bit, or if you change the unemployment rate a bit, those surpluses would change very dramatically. 
   There is a strong argument for the proposition that we would be best advised to pay down the national debt. The national debt now stands in excess of $5.5 trillion. When the Presiding Officer and I came to the Senate, after the 1980 election, the national debt was slightly under $1 trillion. Notwithstanding the so-called ``Reaganomics'' of the administration of President Reagan, by the time he had left office, the national debt was in the range of $3 trillion, and it has gone up. 
   To reduce the national debt would reduce the carrying costs on the interest, and there is a great deal to be said for that. But my sense is the temper of the times is that we are going to be looking at a tax cut to some extent. If we ameliorate, or reduce the tax cut from the proposed $792 billion to $500 billion, then we have more assurances that we can take care of other needs of America. 
   There is a consensus that the Social Security fund ought to remain inviolate, ought to be preserved at all costs. I believe that it is true that the Social Security fund will be secure under any of the pending proposals. But you can't be entirely certain of that because that significant measure depends on the economic forecasts, the unemployment rate, and the interest rate. 
   Beyond Social Security, there is a commitment to preserve Medicare. A lesser tax cut would provide a better guarantee that funds will be available for Medicare. 
   Then we have the issue of prescription drugs where, again, there is a growing sense that this is an issue which has to be taken into account. Again, a lesser tax cut gives more flexibility for prescription drugs. 
   So when we look at the imponderables and the problems, there is much to recommend a lesser tax cut,  so that a figure in the $500 billion range appears preeminently reasonable. 
   Earlier today, about an hour ago, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, said he did not think the majority of the country favored any tax cut. Well, it is hard to assess where the majority of the country is. What is going to happen in the course of the 
   next 6 weeks, probably, presumably, likely, is that a tax cut will come out of the Republican Congress. The plan is, if this tax cut is adopted, the Senate and House will go to conference, and there will be a resolution of the issue by the end of next week, before we start the August recess. 
   Then there will be an opportunity for Americans to digest the positions taken by the Republican Congress, contrasted with the position taken by the President's Administration and what the Democrats have in mind. 
   I believe if the Senate were to enact this amendment on the $500 billion tax cut, we would be in the position to have some realistic negotiations. It is perfectly obvious, at this stage of the proceeding, that the aura of politics is very heavy in this Chamber, very heavy in the House Chamber, very heavy over all of America--less heavy, frankly, outside the beltway. 
   During the August recess, as I undertake my open-house town meetings, I am anxious to get guidance as to what the Congress ought to do from the prevailing wisdom of Pennsylvanians and the wisdom of men and women outside of the beltway. 
   But I think a tax bill coming out of the Senate at $500 billion would set the stage for some serious discussions with the White House, and an important aspect of those discussions will be what is going to happen to the appropriations bills. 
   We are now operating under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. Speaking for my subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over three major Departments--the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor--the allocation of $80 billion is totally insufficient when we look at what we had appropriated last year, what the inflation rate has been--however small, it is a factor. Looking at the financing of the National Institutes of Health, which have made such dramatic achievements; the financing for Head Start, Healthy Start, and worker safety; that is a matter which has to be reconciled, has to be negotiated with the White House during September, before we go into October where we have the highly publicized possibility of the so-called train wreck. 
   But those are factors which have to be taken into account. There again, an approach of $500 billion leaves greater flexibility to accommodate other pressing needs of the Government. 
   Later during the consideration of this tax bill, I will have an opportunity to speak about an amendment which I have pending, which is the flat tax. That is a proposal to simplify taxes in America so they could be filed on a single postcard. 
   I regret that this measure has not received greater attention, notwithstanding the fact that it was introduced in the House of Representatives by Majority Leader ARMEY in the fall of 1994, and I introduced it--the first bill in the Senate--in March of 1995, which really provides some very substantial relief on simplicity and breaks for the American people. That is not to be, but I will have an opportunity a little later to explain, in some detail, the flat tax proposal. 
   Mr. President, inquiry as to how much time I have remaining of the 10 minutes allotted.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
   In conclusion--the two most popular words of any speech--I believe that America ought to be governed from the center; America needs to be governed from the center; and America wants to be governed from the center. 
   Where we have the competing proposals--the one which was defeated yesterday, the Democratic proposal at $295 billion; the competing proposal of $792 billion--the $500 billion figure will provide more flexibility for other needs of America, will move to the center, will give better assurances that adequate funding will be available to protect Social Security, to provide Medicare reform, to provide important programs such as prescription drugs, to provide for the kinds of funding necessary for the National Institutes of Health, the other important items yet to be resolved under an arrangement with the White House on the pending appropriations bills. 
   I join my colleagues in urging adoption of the Chafee-Breaux proposal.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chairman. 
   Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about my flat tax amendment which will be voted on by the Senate either this evening or tomorrow. 
   The most dramatic way to show what the flat tax is, is to hold up a postcard which is an income tax return on the flat tax. This postcard will take 15 minutes to fill out. Here is an enlargement of the flat tax which lists the identity of the taxpayer, the total compensation, personal allowance, number of dependents, two deductions allowed, mortgage interest up to $100,000, charitable contributions up to $2,500, and then a flat 20-percent tax. It will take 15 minutes on tax simplification to fill out this return. 
   Contrast that, if you will, with the fact that we have a Tax Code with 7.5 million words; a Pledge of Allegiance which has 31 words; the Gettysburg Address which has 267 words; the Declaration of Independence, about 1,300 words; the Bible with 1,773,000 words; and the U.S. Tax Code with 7.5 million words with the pending legislation, which I have in my hand, which is another thick book of 443 pages to be added. 
   In offering an amendment on the flat tax, I have no illusion about its passing because the train is in operation to have a tax cut. The flat tax would be a total substitute on a comprehensive tax bill which would do great things for America. 
   First of all, the flat tax would eliminate double taxation so there would be no tax on estates. They have already  been taxed; all the money is going into the estate. There would be no tax on dividends; that has all been taxed before it gets into earned surplus. There would be no tax on capital gains; that has already been taxed. 
   This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers the tax burden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For example in the 1998 tax year, the standard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, $6,250 for a head of household and $7,100 for a married couple filing jointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,700. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does not itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over $17,900--that is personal exemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100. By contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax on only income over that amount. 
   A family of four with $35,000 in income would owe $2,569 in taxes under current law, but would only owe $1,500 under this flat tax--that is a savings of $1,065. A family of four with $50,000 would have a saving of $752. 
   Why is this possible? It is possible because the tax loopholes enable write-offs to save some $393 billion a year. What is eliminated under the flat tax are the loopholes, the deductions in this complicated code which can be deciphered, interpreted, and found really only by the $500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to the taxpayers. $120 billion would be saved by the elimination of fraud because of the simplicity of the Tax Code, the taxpayer being able to find out exactly what they owe. 
   This bill is modeled after legislation organized and written by two very distinguished professors of law from Stanford University, Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka. Their model was first introduced in the Congress in the fall of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I introduced the flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, 1995, Senate bill 488. I reintroduced the bill in the 105th Congress, and re-reintroduced the bill in this Congress on April 15, 1999--income tax day--in a bill denominated S. 822. 
   So the bill has been well thought out, has been well documented, as being revenue neutral by Professors Hall and Rabushka at 19 percent. 
   My bill has added two deductions--one for interest on home mortgages for borrowing up to $100,000 for middle-income Americans and a deduction for charitable contributions for up to $2,500. These two deductions have been obtained because of the practical impossibility of having a Tax Code which eliminates those two deductions which is really the mainstay of America. But aside from those two modest deductions, it is a flat tax. 
   One percent has been added on my bill to the Hall-Rabushka formula to accommodate $35 billion in losses due to the home interest deduction and $13 billion in tax losses due to the deduction on interest on charitable contributions. So we have a system which is tax neutral. 
   Another major advantage of the flat tax is that it would vastly increase productivity because people would no longer be looking to what they could save on tax loopholes. Instead, Americans would be devising their affairs on what would be most productive, because it would not do one any good to construct a tax loophole, diverting a lot of energy to try to save taxes, but, instead, the energies of productive Americans would be devoted to what is productive and what can be accomplished. 
   This model, under Hall-Rabushka, projects that these savings --which would be tremendously increased--would far outweigh for the individual taxpayer any of the benefits that they would receive at the present time. 
   Professors Hall and Rabushka project there would be an increase in the gross national product of some $2 trillion within 7 years, which would be an enormous boon to America. 
   As I say, this tax bill is well on the road. The train has left the station; and it is not to be derailed by any substitute measure. But I do ask my colleagues to seriously consider the flat tax and, if nothing more, to cast a protest vote against the existing Tax Code which has 75 million pages, and the current bill which would add 443 pages to that mountainous monstrosity. 
   The flat tax is enormously popular with the American people. The polls show that 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax. 
   I can personally attest to the fact that in my open house town meetings, the reference to the flat tax and the display of this postcard tax return is the only applause item in my speech. You might attribute that to the dull balance of the speech, but the flat tax is an applause producer. 
   When people think about the time they spend on their tax returns, and the regulatory system, and the complexity of the tax returns, the fact that Americans spend 5.4 billion hours filling out tax returns, this is an enormously attractive matter. 
   I do not believe that the Senate has voted on a flat tax proposal yet. We Senators always hear that this group or that 
   group is going to be watching a specific vote, and it is going to be a recorded vote on the scorecard. I suggest that a vote on the flat tax is going to be a vote on the big scorecard for America. 
   People do know what the flat tax is. They do have an idea about it. It is overwhelmingly popular. 61 percent of the public favors it; leaving only 39 percent, most of whom probably do not know about it. Anybody who knows about the flat tax, that they could get their tax return done on a postcard in 15 minutes, would be very proud to have his or her Senator vote in favor of this flat tax. 
   In essence, the flat tax would vastly simplify the code. It would eliminate most of the 117,000 IRS Internal Revenue Service employees, would save most of the $7 billion now spent on the Internal Revenue Service, and would be a very strong signal to the Finance Committee in the Senate to take up the flat tax seriously. That has not been done. 
   It would be a strong signal to the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives to take a good look at the flat tax. 
   Because Americans will see that they could fill out their tax return on a postcard, save the laborious hours and the complications and all those letters from the IRA saying, you owe $19.14 cents--which taxpayers like myself would rather pay but you can't do that; you have to go back through all of your records--the release in productivity, the elimination of the capital gains tax, the estate tax, the tax on dividends, all of which has been paid.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce my flat tax legislation as an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax Reconciliation bill. I had reintroduced this legislation on April 15th, 1999 to provide for a flat 20 percent tax on individuals and businesses. In the 104th Congress, I was the first Senator to introduce flat tax legislation and the first Member of Congress to set forth a deficit-neutral plan for dramatically reforming our nation's tax code and replacing it with a flatter, fairer plan designed to stimulate economic growth. My flat tax legislation was also the first plan to retain limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. 
   As I traveled around the country and held town hall meetings across Pennsylvania and other states, the public support for fundamental tax reform was overwhelming. I would point out in those speeches that I never leave home without two key documents: (1) my copy of the Constitution; and (2) a copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I soon realized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat tax postcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see what life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only take 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer burdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest, capital gains and estates. 
   Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans embrace the simplicity, fairness and growth potential of flat tax reform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current tax code. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat tax preferred my flat tax plan with limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered the 1996 Republican presidential primary, publisher Steve  Forbes opined in a March 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the tremendous appeal and potency of my flat tax plan. 
   Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was appointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform and the Commission soon came out with its report recognizing the value of a fairer, flatter tax code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat tax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the 1996 Republican presidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat tax or a consumption-based tax system. 
   Unfortunately, the politics of that Presidential campaign denied the flat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite Congressional adoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which was introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted. 
   I reintroduced this legislation in the 105th Congress with slight modifications to reflect inflation-adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent allowances. While my flat tax proposal was favorably received at town hall meetings in Pennsylvania, Congress failed to move forward on any tax reform during the 105th Congress. I tried repeatedly to raise the issue with leadership and the Finance Committee to no avail. I think the American people want this debate to move forward and I think the issue of tax reform is ripe for consideration. 
   In this period of opportunity as we commence the 106th Session of Congress, I am optimistic that public support for tax reform will enable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and necessary legislation. 
   My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax code, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This legislation would institute a simple, flat 20% tax rate for all individuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal is based on three key principles which are critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness and economic growth. 
   Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat tax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing our nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the study of the complexities of the tax code 40 years ago as a law student at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some. 
   Before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th Congress, I had discussions with Congressman RICHARD ARMEY, the House Majority Leader, about his flat tax proposal. In fact, I testified with House Majority Leader RICHARD ARMEY before the Senate Finance and House Ways & Means Committees, as well as the Joint Economic Committee and the House Small Business Committee on the tremendous benefits of flat tax reform. Since then, and both before and after introducing my original flat tax bill, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at some length, and have engaged in a host of discussions with economists and tax experts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to evaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax. Based on those discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to us, I have concluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20 percent on all business and personal income can be enacted without reducing federal revenues. 
   A flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow ordinary citizens to have more influence over how their money is spent because they will spend it--not the government. By creating strong incentives for savings and investment, the flat tax will have the beneficial result of making available larger pools of capital for expansion of the private sector of the economy--rather than more tax money for big government. This will mean more jobs and, just as important, more higher-paying jobs. 
   As a matter of federal tax policy, there has been considerable controversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate particular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be neutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely economic point of view. Our current tax code attempts to use tax policy to direct economic activity. Yet actions under that code have demonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis for tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic purposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to promote. Even when the government responds to particular tax shelters with new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax experts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats by changing the structure of their business transactions and then claiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach and the revised IRS regulations and precedents. 
   Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle between $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close loopholes is a battle the government can never win. Under the flat tax bill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through clever manipulations will become a thing of the past. 
   The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by Professors Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no deductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include in the legislation limited deductions for home mortgage interest for up to $100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American families that they should be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also political practicality. With those two deductions maintained, passage of a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, probably impossible. 
   In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a modified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that the revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19% rate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable governmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19% to 20% to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and charitable deductions. A preliminary estimate in the 104th Congress by the Committee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home interest deduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable deduction at $13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated because the Hall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to business taxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis for concluding that the 1 percent increase in rate would pay for the two deductions. Revenue estimates for tax code revisions are difficult to obtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from fact situations with a myriad of assumed variables. It is possible that some modification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue neutrality. 
   This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill introduced in the House by Congressman Armey and in the Senate late in 1995 by Senator Richard Shelby, which were both in turn modeled after the Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for enormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so well by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, gifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code can become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into economic growth and expansion, more and  better jobs, and raising the standard of living for all Americans. 
   In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing the size and cost of government, and this work is ongoing and vitally important. But the work of downsizing government is only one side of the coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and care, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs and government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace those programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of American society through private investment and job creation--which can have the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans as economic expansion adds to federal revenues. Just as Americans need a tax code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws designed to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer today embodies those principles. 
   My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-Rabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan in four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20 percent flat tax rate. Second, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions (which will require a 1 percent higher tax rate than otherwise). Third, my bill would maintain the automatic withholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Lastly, my bill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine our vital efforts to balance the nation's budget. 
   The key advantages of this flat tax plan are three-fold: First, it will dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove much of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and corporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their energies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which rewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth in all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and savings accounts, and as interest rates drop. 
   Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20 percent on all income they earn from wages, pensions and salaries. Individuals would not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on savings, or dividends--since those items will have already been taxed as part of the flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also eliminate all but two of the deductions and exemptions currently contained within the tax code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to ``personal allowances'' for themselves and their children. The personal allowances are: $10,000 for a single taxpayer; $15,000 for a single head of household; $17,500 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,000 per child or dependent. These personal allowances would be adjusted annually for inflation after 1999. 
   In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low income families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are much higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed under the current tax code. For example in the 1998 tax year, the standard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, $6,250 for a head of household and $7,100 for a married couple filing jointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,700. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does not itemize deductions would pay tax on all income over $17,900 (personal exemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100). By contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that amount. 
   My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of charitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key deductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this legislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a decision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could be used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20 percent. 
   With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of 20 percent. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of complicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and other complexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-simplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, direct expenses and purchases--a system with much less potential for fraud, ``creative accounting'' and tax avoidance. 
   Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of capital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures and land, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. The business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company in the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing revenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to re-tax the same monies when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains. 
   Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of the flat tax legislation I am reintroducing today. 
   The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours each year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations which fill 17,000 pages and have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1995. 
   Whenever the government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it can convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of complexity, frustration and inefficiency. By way of example, most Americans have become familiar with the absurdities of the government's military procurement programs. If these programs have taught us anything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet seat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and restrictions when the government gets involved. The Internal Revenue Service is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a distressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized print-outs claiming that additional taxes are due, which require repeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is determined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first place. 
   The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations and instructions and delete most of the five million words in the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of tens of millions of hours of non-productive time spent in compliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would spend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more time with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules and regulations. 
   The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a small postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy questions. Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers. 
   Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax bill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary government regulation, bureaucracy and red tape from our everyday lives. The heavy hand of government bureaucracy is particularly onerous in the case of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to extend its influence into so many aspects of our lives. 
   In 1995, the IRS employed 117,000 people, spread out over countless offices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $7 billion, with over $4 billion spent merely on enforcement. By simplifying the tax code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of rules and regulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a significant portion of the IRS budget, including the bulk of the funding now needed for enforcement and administration. 
   In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, energies and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. According to the Tax Foundation, in 1996, the private sector spent over $150 billion complying with federal tax laws. According to a Tax Foundation study, adoption of  flat tax reform would cut pre-filing compliance costs by over 90 percent. 
   Monies spent by businesses and investors in creating tax shelters and finding loopholes could be instead directed to productive and job-creating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, the opportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, allowing the government to collect, according to some estimates, over $120 billion annually. 
   The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a tremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson estimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would increase future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value terms, over a seven year period. This translates into over $7,500 in increased wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth also means that there will be more jobs--it is estimated that the $2 trillion increase in wealth would lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs. 
   The economic principles are fairly straightforward. Our current tax system is inefficient; it is biased toward too little savings and too much consumption. The flat tax creates substantial incentives for savings and investment by eliminating taxation on interest, dividends and capital gains--and tax policies which promote capital formation and investment are the best vehicle for creation of new and high paying jobs, and for a greater prosperity for all Americans. 
   It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need not only to eliminate the federal government's reliance on deficits and borrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings and investment that has been the real engine driving American prosperity throughout our history. These concepts are related--the federal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving less for businesses to borrow for investments. 
   It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy that represents the pool of all capital available for investment--in training, education, research, machinery, physical plant, etc.--and that constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics here are daunting. In the 1960s, the net U.S. national savings rate was 8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. Americans save at only one-tenth the rate of the Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate of the Germans. This is unacceptable and we must do something to reverse the trend. 
   An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that although the federal budget deficit is the largest cause of ``dissavings,'' both personal and business savings rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool of capital stock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, we have to do more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very materially raise our levels of private savings and investment. And we have to do so in a way that will not cause additional deficits. 
   The less money people save, the less money is available for business investment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and investment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings accounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and the capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and the financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for saving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since gains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in value, are taxed as if they were profits to the taxpayer. 
   With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax free municipal bonds, our current tax code does virtually nothing to encourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over consumption. This bill will change this system, and address this problem. The proposed legislation reverses the current skewed incentives by promoting savings and investment by individuals and by businesses. Individuals would be able to invest and save their money tax-free and reap the benefits of the accumulated value of those investments without paying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these investments. Businesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed them to expense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology in the year the expense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax benefits for these investments through complicated depreciation schedules. With greater investment and a larger pool of savings available, interest rates and the costs of investment would also drop, spurring even greater economic growth. 
   Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue losses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives the bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are wrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, but historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues actually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of their take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in pursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes. 
   As one example, under President Kennedy when individual tax rates were lowered, investment incentives including the investment tax credit were created and then expanded and depreciation rates were accelerated. Yet, between 1962 and 1967, gross annual federal tax receipts grew from $99.7 billion to $148 billion--an increase of nearly 50 percent. More recently after President Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980's, government tax revenues rose from just under $600 billion in 1981 to nearly $1 trillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut program helped to bring about one of the longest peacetime expansion of the U.S. economy in history. There is every reason to believe that the flat tax proposed here can do the same--and by maintaining revenue neutrality in this flat tax proposal, as we have, we can avoid any increases in annual deficits and the national debt. 
   In addition to increasing federal revenues by fostering economic growth, the flat tax can also add to federal revenues without increasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research Service estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals sheltered more than $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and corporations sheltered an additional $60 billion. There may well be additional monies hidden in quasi-legal or even illegal ``tax shelters.'' 
   Under a flat tax system, all tax shelters will disappear and all income will be subject to taxation. 
   The growth case for a flat tax is compelling. It is even more compelling in the case of a tax revision that is simple and demonstrably fair. 
   By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and their dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers will pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and middle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of tax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to shelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also ensure that all Americans pay their fair share. 
   The flat tax legislation that I am offering will retain the element of progressivity that Americans view as essential to fairness in an income tax system. Because of the lower end income exclusions, and the capped deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the effective tax rates under my bill will range from 0% for families with incomes under about $30,000 to roughly 20% for the highest income groups. 
   My proposed legislation demonstrably retains the fairness that must be an essential component of the American tax system. 
   The proposal that I make today is dramatic, but so are its advantages: a taxation system that is simple, fair and designed to maximize prosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages are: 
   Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms and attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.3 billion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance. 
   Cuts government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS rules, regulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words and 12,000 pages currently. It would also allow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 117,000 employees.  
   Promotes economic growth: Economists estimate a growth of over $2 trillion in national wealth over seven years, representing an increase of approximately $7,500 in personal wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth would also lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs. 
   Increases efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis of productivity rather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to even greater economic expansion. 
   Reduces interest rates: Economic forecasts indicate that interest rates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, as the flat tax removes many of the current disincentives to savings. 
   Lowers compliance costs: Americans would be able to save up to $224 billion they currently spend every year in tax compliance. 
   Decreases fraud: as tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue annually. 
   Reduces IRS costs: Simplification of the tax code will allow us to save significantly on the $7 billion annual budget currently allocated to the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years of enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent increase in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and increased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 increase in the personal income of all Americans. 
   No one likes to pay taxes. But Americans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under a system that they believe is fair, a system that they can understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather than prevents growth and prosperity. The legislation I introduce today will afford Americans such a tax system.

   Mr. SPECTER. In the balance of my allotted time, I will speak briefly about another amendment which will be voted on, probably tomorrow. That is an investment tax credit for the biotechnology equipment industry. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, my distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, and I have the job of allocating funds for the National Institutes of Health. They are the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government. 
   We are facing an extraordinarily difficult time in allocating funding because of the allocation for the subcommittee which is far under what is necessary to provide the $2 billion which we allocated in increase last year. 
   In consulting with the biotechnology industry, the one item which could bridge the gap would be a 10 percent investment tax credit which would stimulate Biotech and would do a tremendous amount for the health of Americans. 
   In the course of the past few months, stem cells have been discovered by Biotech which is a veritable fountain of youth, holding a promise for a cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. 
   So I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the investment tax credit for the Biotech industry when it comes up. 
   I thank the Chair and thank the chairman for yielding me this time from the bill and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. I address the Chair on a subject that is critical to the veterans of the armed forces of our nation, and to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I am privileged to chair: the budget for the health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Mr. President, I come to the floor of the United States Senate today to draw attention to a sure crisis in VA health care. Congress and the Administration must ask ourselves: what is the crisis, and what may be the acceptable remedy? It seems that the Department of Veterans Affairs must choose among difficult options of providing care for fewer veterans--that is, ``disenroll'' veterans already expecting care from a VA provider or plan; increase waiting times; cut VA staff; lower quality of care; close and consolidate numerous facilities, or Congress must increase VA's budget. For my money, Mr. President, the choice is clear and simple: we must act to increase VA's appropriation, and we must do so now.

   Mr. SPECTER. OMB postures--implausibly--that much has changed since January 1999, but veterans organizations in their Independent Budget have been warning Congress and the Administration for the past three years running that VA health care is in dire straits. On April 30 of this year, 50 of my colleagues joined Senator ROCKEFELLER and me in signing a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, requesting that VA health care be supplemented with $1.7 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. My discussions with VA officials lead me to believe that, while such a supplement will not eliminate VA's problems, these funds will go a long way to easing its crisis and will back-fill gaps that we have permitted to occur based solely on resource shortages. In his July 26 letter, Director Lew refers to the need for $100 million in new health-related construction; as Chairman of the authorizing committee for VA major construction, I cannot reply, not having seen a proposal for sites or specific justifications. He also admits that so-called ``category 7'' veterans cannot continue to be enrolled in VA care for fear that quality of care for higher priority poor and service-disabled veterans will suffer. While I concur with Director Lew's premise that we do no harm to those already enrolled in VA health care, I must reserve judgment until I see the basis for this conclusion about the middle class veteran. The Administration is proposing $1 billion is emergency funding, but I believe, as I have since last year, that this level still would be insufficient overall. 
   Mr. President, as to more recent developments even than OMB's late-coming realization of need, I appreciate the work of the House Appropriations Sub-Committee last evening to add $1 billion in additional spending to the VA health care appropriation for the new year. Like my counterparts in the House, I want to help the system help veterans, as we all do. I want to do so with great care, as we all do. However, as I said earlier about the Administration's $1 billion, I say that the House's $1 billion is only enough to push the problem down the road a little further. We need to solve the problem, not push it down the road. We can do that with a substantial increase of $1.7 billion in the Medical Care appropriation for Fiscal Year 2000--a supplement that would take VA health care funding to the unprecedented level of $19 billion--and let us join together to see what kind of sustained funding level VA truly needs to carry out its important and vital mission for America's veterans. I proposed then, and remind the Senate now, that $1.7 billion is needed to keep VA's head above water. 
   America's veterans put a human face on freedom. Veterans agreed to put their lives on the line, or certainly they were prepared to do so, to defend the very freedoms all of us enjoy. Most of them sought nothing in return. They served honorably, then returned to civilian life. However, some of these veterans whom we turned to for assistance in our time of need have now turned to the nation in their time of need. I am referring specifically to those who were disabled during their service to the nation and those who for one reason or another have been left behind in this competitive economy and cannot sustain themselves. For these people in particular we 
   established the Department of Veterans Affairs and its many programs for veterans and their families. 
   We have given VA a mission, one most astutely described by President Abraham Lincoln during his second inaugural address when the President said, the Nation's mission was ``..... to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' Lincoln's eloquent words describe VA's success for most of its existence. It is a system whose sole purpose is to recognize that veterans make a special contribution to society, and therefore deserve special status and attention by a grateful nation. It saddens me to report to the Senate that this Administration is failing our veterans. But I do not intend to sit idly by and allow veterans' needs to go unnoticed and unmet. 
   In Fiscal Year 1999, Congress appropriated $17.3 billion to fund the health care activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I know that many of my colleagues have heard while traveling throughout your respective states that this amount was barely enough to allow VA to provide decent care for veterans. Earlier this year, the President sent Congress a budget that requested precisely the same amount for next year. Mr. President, that request is completely unacceptable to me, and I know it is for all my colleagues here. 
   The VA, under the leadership of the most recent Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, made remarkable changes in the way health care is provided to eligible and enrolled veterans. The VA launched a veritable revolution in its delivery system by changing the basic structure of care delivery from one that treated patients in a so-called ``sickness model,'' a mostly reactive stance that was premised on a veteran seeking care for a specific ailment, to one of a functioning health care system that offers a basic benefits package of services to enrolled veterans, including preventive medical treatment, primary care, alternatives to institutionalization, pharmaceuticals and limited long term care programs, all premised on maintining a veteran's health. Further, according to testimony given before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, VA has opened hundreds of local community-based outpatient clinics, reduced the number of days patients must spend in hospitals and, according to testimony by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, still treats any veteran who arrives at VA's doorstep. Unfortunately, both the Secretary and the President of the United States have failed to recognize that this system, like any health care system, needs sufficient funding to function properly. It is impossible to increase the quality of care provided, increase the number of places at which care can be obtained and increase the number of people who can receive care without providing any additional resources. This is impossible on its face, Mr. President--impossible. 
   The budget the President sent to Congress would not even permit the VA to maintain the current services it provides to veterans today. In fact, in order to maintain today's level of service, the budget admits that VA must ``streamline'' itself to the tune of $1.14 billion in FY 2000. But we already know that VA cannot maintain the status quo. There are so many challenges facing the system and the veterans it treats that we as a Congress, and the President as Chief Executive, must address. For example, the package of benefits available to our veterans today does not include basic emergency care services. Today, if a veteran must visit a private hospital emergency room for treatment, in most cases payment is out-of-pocket, or through a third party insurance claim, Medicare or Medicaid, that may cover this care. The only exception to this policy is for service connected conditions in limited emergency situations, for which VA will reimburse expenses. A bill recently reported out of my Committee would correct this injustice and mandate that any veteran enrolled in VA care be provided basic, covered emergency services if they are needed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this provision will cost $80 million in the first year and approximately $400 million over five years. 
   Emergency care is just the tip of the VA's health care ``iceberg.'' For example, another very important issue is one that dramatically affects Vietnam veterans. According to a recent VA survey, nearly 18% of veterans in VA care could be afflicted with the disease hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a serious disease that has been associated with battlefield injuries, blood transfusions and intravenous drug use. Hepatitis C causes liver damage and, as one can imagine, ultimately hepatitis C can be fatal. Fortunately, there are a number of new drug therapies 
    available that will help control or arrest the progress of hepatitis C. However, treatment is expensive. VA estimates that they need  approximately $135 million in FY 2000 to screen, test and car for veterans suffering from hepatitis C, and much more in the future. This special funding for hepatitis C would be in addition to the amount needed to maintain the status quo in VA health care that the President has otherwise proposed. 
   Frankly, Mr. President and colleagues, the most difficult challenge facing the Department into the foreseeable future is its ability to care for our aging veteran population. Many World War II and Korean War veterans are nearing the end of life. But hundreds of thousands of them need long term care services, and the numbers grow dramatically while the overall veteran population declines. VA maintains over 120 nursing homes now, and has thousands of contracts with private nursing facilities and other long term care providers. If the VA is going to do more than simply maintain these programs--which I argue may be exceedingly difficult to do, given other challenges--rather than expand them to fit the changing demographic face of VA's patient population, additional resources will be needed. There is no question about this fact, Mr. President, and no real choice but to do it, in my view. 
   Until yesterday, in response to all of these challenges, the Administration proposed to make one major move to address the crisis situation: cut health care off. As incredible as it may seem, VA is proposing employee ``buyout'' authority for the Veterans Health Administration. Based on my analysis of this request and its implications, I concluded that buyout legislation was really a sell out, offering a golden handshake to those whom really needed to stay. It is the wrong move, and I am most pleased to say so. 
   VA proposes to buy out--that means reduce--its current workforce by about 15,000 staff over a five-year period, by use of a voluntary separation incentive payment of up to $25,000 to each such employee who leaves by retiring. I think most of you would agree that health care is an enterprise that needs, above all else, trained staff. So, as I mentioned earlier, VA says it strives to increase quality, access and the number of patients enrolled, but would do so without additional financial resources and with a greatly reduced work force. I cannot foresee how these kinds of results are at all possible. How could it be so? A retirement bonus is a fine gesture, but how does it help veterans? 
   The VA buyout proposal was accompanied by a weak ``strategic plan.'' VA cannot say with any degree of confidence how it could continue to provide care to all of the veterans the Secretary has admitted to the system with his ``open door'' policies, if the staff were so severely reduced. In fact, it appeared to me that what VA intended to do in its ``real'' strategic plan--a plan that is yet to be revealed to us--was simply to increase waiting time which already is at unacceptably high levels in many places across the country. As but one small example, Mr. President, let me review for you the most recent facts on VA waiting times from VA medical centers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These statistics deal only with primary care appointments, not specialty care: 34 days of waiting in Altoona; 31-60 days in Lebanon; up to 54 days in Pittsburgh; up to 64 days at the Sayre clinic; and up to 94 days of waiting in Wilkes-Barre. Looking at a medical specialty that is crucial for aging veterans, let me report to my colleagues waiting times for VA urology clinics in Pennsylvania: 85 days in Altoona; 90 days in Philadelphia; up to 95 days in Pittsburgh. 
   I know that the distinguished Ranking Member of my Committee, Senator ROCKEFELLER, has been very concerned about waiting times at VA hospitals in West Virginia; Senator CAMPBELL is alarmed about the situation at the Medical Center in Fort Lyon, Colorado and has said so; and Senator MURRAY has relayed her concerns about the status of VA facilities in the state of Washington. But these problems are everywhere, Mr. President. These kinds of delays in care are not acceptable for our veterans. In fact, I would argue that a waiting time of 60 days for an outpatient primary care appointment or an enrolled veteran constitutes nothing; such a patient is not really receiving care from VA. 
   I ask my colleagues: is this a situation that you are comfortable in defending? I am not, and I am not willing to remain silent while veterans receive nothing from a grateful nation. VA needs these funds, and this need is clear. Let the United States Senate not shrink from its duty. Let us do the right thing for America's veterans by providing an emergency supplement of $1.7 billion in funding in Fiscal Year 2000 to help VA help our veterans.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are faced today with the unique challenges brought by the extraordinary biological, technological, and medical advances of this decade. We have seen miraculous breakthroughs in the fight  against communicable diseases: the complete eradication of small pox, the near global eradication of polio, vaccines for ailments such as measles, rubella, and even the flu. Revolutionary new drugs and improved surgical techniques allow us all to lead longer, more productive lives. But past success is not a guarantee of future progress and science does not bear fruit overnight. Breaking the code for complex problems takes a steady and sustained commitment of people and money. As we enter the next century, we have a responsibility to perpetuate and improve upon our enormous capacity to prevent, detect, treat, and cure diseases of all types. 
   The Congress continues to be gravely concerned with rising health care costs, as demonstrated by contentious debate as recently as last week during consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights. According to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), health care spending in this country had risen to $1.1 trillion in 1997, or an average of just under $4,000 per person. Private sources paid for a little over half of that, about $585 billion, with the remainder coming from public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. HCFA further predicts that public spending on health will nearly double over the next decade, reaching $2.1 trillion in 2007. 
   I disagree with the premise that this is simply a dollars and cents problem. I believe science holds our best chance for both combating disease and controlling the ever-spiraling costs it imposes on society. For victims of cancer and heart disease, scientific research represents their only hope for new drugs and medical treatments that can add years to life. Research can produce miracle vaccines that save the lives of children stricken with deadly diseases like leukemia. And for growing numbers of elderly, research holds the key to stopping the ruinous effects of Alzheimer's disease, stroke and arthritis--all very expensive ailments to treat. To me, the equation is a simple one: less disease and illness mean less human suffering and lower health care costs. 
   Over the next three decades, the number of Americans over age 65 will double. My state of Pennsylvania houses the second highest elderly population, currently totaling nearly 2 million citizens. Mr. President, unless science finds cures and effective treatments for disease and illness, our society will face even higher costs and our hospitals and nursing facilities will be strained to the breaking point. 
   As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I have said many times that I firmly believe that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the crown jewel of the Federal government, and substantial investment is crucial to allow the continuation of the breakthrough research into the next decade. In 1981, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion. For the past three years, NIH funding has increased by 6.8 percent in fiscal year 1997, 7.1 percent in fiscal year 1998, and 15 percent in fiscal year 1999, for a total of $15.7 billion. I am continuing to fight to double the NIH budget, a sentiment which was unanimously supported in the United States Senate during the 105th Congress. Further, on January 19th of this year, I joined my colleagues, Senators MACK, FRIST and HARKIN in introducing S. Res. 19, a Sense of the Senate resolution to increase biomedical research funding by $2 billion for fiscal year 2000. 
   Mr. President, I cite continued efforts to increase the Federal investment in biomedical research in order to highlight the public policy importance of scientific investment. I believe that the Federal government also has the responsibility to provide an economic environment that promotes Research and Development in biomedical research in the private sector as well. To make good business decisions, particularly relating to investment in R&D, biomedical and ``biotech'' firms need to have reliable and well defined tax laws. Today I am introducing legislation that would establish a 10 percent tax credit for investment in biomedical research, and would extend the R & D tax credit to 10 years. 
   The purpose of the investment tax credit is to encourage biomedical research and to stimulate the economy, as well as to enhance our long-term competitiveness in the global biomedical arena. The investment tax credit would provide a 10 percent tax credit for purchases of capital equipment, instruments and supplies used in a laboratory setting by a biotechnology company. Without this tax credit, American companies will be competing with one hand tied behind their backs. 
   The R & D tax credit has proven to be critical to the U.S. biomedical research industry. The credit has allowed for many successes in U.S. scientific research and innovation, such as rapid progress in finding cures for life threatening diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. My Subcommittee has held hearings on the state of affairs in biomedical research, and I understand from many scientists that we are on the cusp of breakthroughs many of today's most complex diseases--Alzheimer's, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, to name a few. But, the scientists caution, it will only be through sustained investment, both public and private, that we will reap the rewards of biomedical research. If we cut investment in medical progress today, the consequence may be irrevocable and society may rue that decision for years to come. 
   As we prepare for the 21st century, we must remain committed to providing an environment that fosters technological investment, scientific exploration, and global competitiveness. Future economic growth and the prosperity of all Americans depends on continued R&D in all sectors of our nation. 
   Mr. President, we must act now to extend the R&D credit and send the right signal to our nation's researchers. Failure to act will not only jeopardize our research efforts, but it will also threaten the United States's world leadership in R&D and perpetuate the rising health care costs we so desperately have tried to contain. It should be noted that everything that is good and desirable is not necessarily worthy of a tax credit, but targeted tax credits are particularly appropriate where an activity engaged in by one company or individual provides such considerable benefits to society at large. 
   We must constantly remind ourselves that medical innovation is the most via ble, long-term solution for cost-effective quality care. Our task in Congress should be to assure that the path of innovation remains open, unobstructed and attractive to both public and private investors. 
   For me, creating a better atmosphere for investment in medical research is more than a symbolic goal. It is a recognition that expanding our base of scientific knowledge inevitably leads to better health, lower health care costs, and an improved quality of life for all Americans. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and urge its swift adoption. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, our subcommittee has the responsibility for funding the National Institutes of Health. The Senate passed a resolution targeting a doubling of National Institutes of Health funding over a 5-year period. That requires an enormous increase. 
   Last year, with the cooperation of my distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, we increased NIH funding by $2 billion. The year before the Senate voted an increase of some $950 million, which was conferenced out at $907 million. 
   This year the subcommittee faces a 302(b) allocation--if anyone is listening on C-Span II, that's how much money the subcommittee is allotted under the budget--that is some $12 billion under the President's request, about $12 billion under any logical sum of money to fund those three departments: The Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. We are struggling to try to find the funds to match last year's $2 billion increase. If we were to reach the goal set by the sense-of-the-Senate resolution we would have to come up with $2.3 billion. 
   In talking to the people in the biotech industry, they are very much interested in having an investment tax credit. An investment tax credit of 10 percent would provide a real tax incentive to induce biotech companies to do  research. We are on the brink of some phenomenal advances as a result of what happened with stem cell research late last year. Stem cell research has the potential to be a veritable fountain of youth, to tackle ailments like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or perhaps heart disease or cancer. 
   There is a controversy on that question, as to whether embryos may appropriately be used for research. So far the Department of Health and Human Services and their legal counsel concluded that the current limitation on research would not apply to research on stem cells after they are extracted from embryos. Realistically, there ought to be no limitation at all, because in dealing with embryos we are not dealing with an entity which could produce life. These are discarded embryos from in vitro fertilization. 
   This controversy is very similar to the controversy which existed with respect to fetal tissue, where arguments were made that using fetal tissue would lead to induced abortions where the fact of the matter was the fetal tissue was discarded fetal tissue, did not induce abortions. 
   But the opportunities for phenomenal advances in medical research are virtually unlimited. In the absence of the ability of the Congress, given budget limitations, to meet the doubling goal within 5 years, an investment tax credit would be an enormous help in stimulating investments by the biotech companies. 
   The research and development tax credit has been extended year by year, and a firm statement by Congress extending it for 10 years again would be an inducement for biotech.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition in this special order to introduce legislation, on behalf of Senator HELMS, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Senator BIDEN, the ranking Democrat; Senator DORGAN and Senator SCHUMER, which would provide for electronic filing of Shippers' Export Declarations. This legislation takes up a recommendation of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction and is directed to assist in our export control to stop those who would acquire the material for weapons of mass destruction from accumulating those weapons. At the present time, there are very sophisticated ways of ordering the component parts of weapons of mass destruction which are not known and cannot be readily ascertained because of the voluminous paper filings. 
   This legislation would call for electronic filing and would enable our Government to be able to regulate in a desirable fashion, without undue burden on exporters, materials which can be used for nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. This is a recommendation of the Commission on Weapons of  Mass Destruction which filed its report yesterday with copies to the President and to the legislative leaders. 
   This Commission was established by legislation under the Intelligence Authorization Act signed into law in October of 1996 when I chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. This legislation was designed to deal with the enormous threat posed to the United States by weapons of mass destruction. 
   When I chaired the Intelligence Committee in 1995 and 1996, I was aghast at the kinds of problems which I saw with respect to rogue nations having ballistic capabilities for the delivery of nuclear weapons. Since that time, it has been publicly commented that North Korea has nuclear capability; that they have trajectory and ballistic capability to reach parts of the United States; that they pose an enormous threat. It is well known that other rogue nations seek ballistic capability as well. We now find that a nuclear device can be carried across national borders in a suitcase. We have seen in the experience of the Tokyo subway catastrophe the potential for biological and chemical warfare. 
   Those capabilities are so important that there needs to be preventive action to deal with them in advance of a catastrophe. Regrettably, our Government customarily reacts, instead of acting in anticipation. 
   The Commission was formed because there are now some 96 separate agencies dealing with weapons of mass destruction, and the Commission filed in its report a recommendation urging Presidential action with the suggestion that the authority be concentrated in the hands of the Vice President. There have been jurisdictional disputes, turf battles, but the Vice President would have the clout to adjudicate disputes and to coordinate the efforts on this matter of such enormous national and international importance. 
   The Commission recommended providing staffing, with a director to the National Security Council, a top level position, to preside over a council of representatives from the various Departments--State, Energy, Defense, Commerce, et cetera--with ranking officials who have been confirmed by the Senate. 
   One of the key recommendations of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction was to mandate electronic filing on export items which are in the category that they could provide component parts for weapons of mass destruction. 
   My staff, Dobie McArthur, has already taken the lead in circulating this legislation among a number of Senators. We have had a favorable response from Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN, chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. There is an excellent opportunity that this provision could be included in a markup of Foreign Relations this month. As noted earlier, Senator DORGAN and Senator SCHUMER have also joined as cosponsors. 
   What this legislation does is to provide for the electronic filing of what is known and currently required as a shipper's export declaration. In 1995, the Customs Service and the Census Bureau created the automated export system, but that system has been utilized by only about 10 percent of the filers. 
   This legislation provides that the electronic filing requirement would come into operation 180 days after the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Treasury certify that a secure Internet-based filing system is up and running. The requirements would be directed toward components which could be used in the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. 
   The problem is illustrated by action taken by Iraq in the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. In a very sophisticated way, when Iraq was purchasing its component parts, instead of buying them all at one time and all from a single supplier, or quite a number of items from a single supplier a few times, the Iraqis would buy an item here, an item there, an item somewhere else, from a wide variety of suppliers, so it was impossible, without some tracking system, to find out exactly what Iraq was doing as they were acquiring these components for weapons of mass destruction. 
   As we all know, there is dual use on many of these items; that is to say, they can be used for peaceful purposes or they can be used for putting together weapons of mass destruction. In this way, with a sophisticated system, a purchaser may acquire the ingredients to produce weapons of mass destruction. 
   Electronic filing will put the matter all under one umbrella. Without undue burden on shippers, there can be a determination as to what is being purchased which has the potential for being turned into a nuclear weapon, a biological weapon, or a chemical weapon of mass destruction. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains on my allotment of 15 minutes?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the War Crimes Tribunal, which was created by United Nations resolution for prosecuting crimes against humanity arising in the former Yugoslavia, has brought very significant indictments out of the events in Bosnia. There have been indictments; there have been some convictions. The work of the War Crimes Tribunal has taken on even greater significance as a result of what has happened in the war with Kosovo, with the very noteworthy and important indictment against President Milosevic of Yugoslavia. 
   The Tribunal is now in the process of gathering evidence in Kosovo. Justice Louise Arbour, who is head of the War Crimes Tribunal and has given notice of her intention to leave to become a justice in the Canadian judicial system, visited the Senate back on April 30, 1999. She met with a group of Senators, including myself, and pointed out the need for the acquisition of evidence. 
   There had been a preliminary allocation of some $5 million. That was supplemented in the emergency appropriations bill with the direction for an additional $13 million, for a total of $18 million to go towards the Tribunal. 
   The FBI dispatched a group of investigators to acquire evidence in Kosovo, but they have run out of money. Those funds, I believe, are available in the Department of State. I have discussed this matter with the FBI Director Louis Freeh. I compliment the FBI and Director Freeh for their very prompt action in going to Kosovo to gather evidence. 
   From my own experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, I can personally attest to the fact that evidence has to be acquired when it is fresh. If you do not get it with immediacy, it disappears. 
   A part of the evidence acquisition has been to question women who were subjected to rape. In conversations with officials of the State Department yesterday, I found that the $50 million which has been appropriated for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees has not been released. So there is an urgency in making those funds available for a variety of purposes, including a substantial part of the $50 million to give attention to the women who have been rape victims--in part to counsel them for their own mental health and in significant part to acquire their testimony in the prosecution of those violent perpetrators of the rapes. 
   So I make these comments and urge that we move ahead with this funding which has been authorized by the Congress, $50 million to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees, and also urge that funding be provided in accordance with the direction of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill so the FBI can have the funding to proceed immediately to Kosovo to gather this very important evidence.

   In response, I am advised by officials of the State Department that early on were some problems in the United Nations agency. There is chaos, as one might expect, in Kosovo. The Kosovars are returning to their homes. Some have raised a point that the money was not being officially utilized. I have been advised by the State Department that the issue has now been corrected; so when I made inquiries of the State Department yesterday to liberate $2 million for the FBI, I was told that they had this collateral problem and have begun discussions on the matter with our appropriate colleagues to get the funds released.

I made the same point by saying that there were obstacles to getting the funds released. But I think it is a matter of enormous importance. I am glad to hear the bipartisan group of women were meeting yesterday to exercise their leadership. This business about crimes against humanity and rape is just horrendous. We have to act, and act promptly.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation that will help the United States achieve important non-proliferation and counter-proliferation goals by improving the process through which export data on shipments of proliferation concern is collected and analyzed. By requiring that export data related to shipments of proliferation concern be filed electronically, this legislation will make it possible for agencies with export control responsibilities to do their job more efficiently and effectively. 
   To minimize the administrative burden on exporters, my legislation phases in the electronic filing requirement 180 days after the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury certify that a secure, Internet-based filing system is up and running. There is already an electronic filing system available, but the existing system is being replaced with an Internet-based system that will be easier to access and use. When the new Internet-based system is in place, and that is expected to happen by early next year, my legislation will require that shipments of proliferation concern be reported electronically. The net result of enacting this legislation will be enhanced export control monitoring and enforcement, with minimal burden to shippers and exporters. 
   Let me take a moment to provide some background information for my colleagues, to make it clear what my legislation does and why. Current law requires shippers, forwarders and exporters to file what is known as a Shipper's Export Declaration, or SED. The SED indicates what is being shipped, where it is going, who it is being shipped to. Most of these are now filed on paper, and it is a time consuming and difficult process to sort through all these paper SEDs to identify shipments of proliferation concern, to track them down and check them out. In 1995, the Customs Service and the Census Bureau created the Automated Export System, or AES, which makes it possible to submit SEDs electronically. With the SED information in electronic form, it is much easier to sort through the data and identify shipments of concern. 
   About ten percent of SEDs are currently filed in electronic form through AES, and almost ninety percent of the forms are filed on paper. The data from the ninety percent of SEDs that are filed on paper is not as easy to review as it could be, and it is not possible to do the type of cross-checking and analysis that is necessary to zero in on the shipments that export officials need to monitor closely, and in some cases, prevent from being shipped. For example, before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Iraqis had a very sophisticated procurement strategy for acquiring weapons of mass destruction. They broke down their purchase requests and instead of asking for everything they wanted from one or two companies, asked for a few items from a large number of suppliers. If the Iraqis had grouped their requests, their orders would have raised eyebrows. Someone would have become suspicious, either the suppliers or export enforcement officers who reviewed the export data. As it was, the Iraqis ordered relatively small quantities of dual use commodities, items that can be used to create weapons of mass destruction but also have perfectly ordinary commercial uses, and combined them with shipments from other suppliers, sometimes from other countries, to make weapons of mass destruction. If all SEDs on items of proliferation concern had been filed electronically, as they will be when my legislation is enacted, it would have been much easier to detect what the Iraqis were up to and take preventive action. 
   Not all of the shipments that are being reported on paper rather than electronically are of proliferation concern. Shippers in the United States export literally hundreds of thousands of items each month that do not raise proliferation concerns; agricultural products, toasters, automobiles, and all sorts of completely harmless goods. But there are other items that we have to watch more carefully; items that are on the Department of State's Munitions List or the Commerce Control List. My legislation will make it easier to track shipments of these items by requiring that SEDs be filed electronically for any item that is on the United  States Munitions List or the Commerce Control List. With this information available in electronic format, agencies with export control responsibilities will be able to enforce our export control laws more effectively and prevent proliferation of WMD. By limiting mandatory electronic filing to items that raise genuine concerns about proliferation, my legislation will maximize the benefit to our national security without unduly burdening shippers and exporters.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, it is extraordinarily complex to work your way through the various provisions. Representations are being made on both sides of the aisle which are contradictory. 
   The Senator from New York has just made a contention that the independent reviewer is not independent at all. My reading of the provisions in S. 326 at page 177 set forth the qualified entities as the reviewers and the designation of independent and external reviewer by the external appeals entity which specifies independence. 
   I will not take the time now to read it. But that reference, I think, would establish the true independence of the reviewer. 
   My principal purpose in seeking recognition was to deal with the comparison of the standards for ``medical necessity,'' which is the core of the argument at the present time. 
   The pending amendment seeks to strike the language of the Kennedy amendment, which defines medical necessity as ``medical necessity or appropriate means with respect to a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' 
   The language of the pending amendment, which would be substituted, provides for a standard of review as follows, at pages 179 and 180:

   Mr. SPECTER. No, I will not, but I will yield in a minute. I will not now because I am right in the middle of my train of thought. I will be glad to yield in a moment and respond to whatever question the Senator from New York may have. 
   I supported the Robb amendment, the last vote, because the Robb amendment had provided a standard for medical necessity, generally accepted medical principles, important operative procedures. At this stage of the record, without that definition of the requirement, as articulated in the Robb amendment, I thought that was improvement. 
   Now we are fencing. To say that the air is filled with politics in this Chamber today would be a vast understatement. But in at least my effort to try to understand what is going on and to make an informed judgment, I am prepared to make a judgment for the Robb amendment or the Kennedy amendment or the Schumer amendment contrasted with the Nickles amendment or the Jeffords amendment. It requires a lot of analysis. 
   But as I read these plans, I believe that Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FRIST, and Senator NICKLES are correct, that when you take a look at the language they are substituting, it places a higher standard on the HMO, the managed care operation, than does the provision in the Kennedy amendment which they are striking. 
   Now I would be glad to yield to the Senator from New York on his time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. The fact that the insurer pays the reviewer does not impugn or impinge upon the reviewer's objectivity when there are specific standards for the selection of the reviewer and specific standards that the reviewer has to follow. 
   If I could use an analogy from a practice that I engaged in for a long time as district attorney of Philadelphia, the State paid the fee for the defendant in first-degree murder cases. But there was no doubt that notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania paid defense counsel, the defense counsel worked in the interests of the defendant. 
   When you have a determination as to what the HMO ought to be doing, that is something they ought to pay for. But there ought to be a structure to guarantee objectivity by the decisionmaker. 
   Similarly, if I can amplify, if you have a Federal judge paid by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government is a party to the process, nobody would say that Federal judge is going to be biased toward the Federal Government simply because the Federal Government pays his salary.

The language which the Senator from North Carolina cited takes care of one category of potential conflict of interest, that they will not have any material, professional, familial, or financial affiliation with the case under review, the participant or beneficiary involved, the treating health care professional, the institution where the treatment would take place, or the manufacturer of any drug, device, procedure, or other therapy proposed for the participant or beneficiary whose treatment is under review. 
   If your question is, Would there be a triple firewall if you also specify the HMO? I would be inclined to have all the firewalls I could, as I do when I draft documents, as my distinguished colleague did when he practiced law.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had asked for a reservation of some 30 minutes to speak on the pending nomination of Mr. Larry Summers for the position of Secretary of the Treasury. 
   In considering the nomination of Mr. Summers for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, I have reviewed the many facets of the work of that particular office and have focused with particularity, at this time, on the administration's policy on nonenforcement of the antidumping laws. I had met with Mr. Summers on Friday, June 18th, and told him at that time that I was giving consideration to a protest vote against his nomination because of the administration's failure to enforce the antidumping laws after having discussed with him his own views. 
   Since that time I have decided to direct my efforts, instead, to try to put together a coalition of Members of Congress, both in the House and the Senate, to find a remedy where a private right of action could be used to enforce the antidumping laws. 
   This is a subject that has been of great concern to me during my entire tenure in the Senate, having introduced a variety of bills--which I shall discuss in due course--going back as early as 1982. 
   In the course of a number of legislative proposals, I have had cosponsorship from a wide variety of my Senate colleagues, including then-Senator GORE, Senators THURMOND, BYRD, HELMS, COCHRAN, HATCH, INOUYE, MURKOWSKI, KENNEDY, LEVIN, SANTORUM, MIKULSKI, and SESSIONS. 
   The problem of dumping is an extraordinarily acute problem in America today. It has come into very sharp focus with what has been happening in the steel industry, which has been decimated over the past two decades. 
   Steel, two decades ago--in 1979--had employees numbering approximately 500,000. Today, we have about a third of that number. In the course of the past several months, some 10,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs because of dumping from many foreign importers. But in reviewing the issue of dumping, I have found that it is extraordinarily widespread. 
   Here is a partial list of the products which are dumped in the United States, in addition to steel: wheat, hogs, lamb, cotton, sugar, orange juice, raspberries, flowers, salmon, mushrooms, paper clips, pencils, garlic, brake rotors, telephone systems, brass, pasta, picture tubes, rubber, industrial belts. And the series goes on and on. 
   I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the antidumping duty orders in effect as of March 1, 1999, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. This list contains, I am advised, some 280 products which are dumped in the United States where our dumping laws, simply stated, are not enforced. 
   There is a groundswell in America today protesting the failure to enforce the antidumping laws. Dumping is a situation where, for example, steel coming from Russia will be sold cheaper in the United States than it is being sold in Russia. That is flatly against the laws of the United States. It is flatly against international trade laws. The United States has laws against that kind of dumping. But they are, simply stated, ignored. 
   The groundswell of opposition to dumping is reflected in the very strong vote in the House of Representatives on the so-called steel quota bill; 289 Members of the House voting in favor of it, 141 in opposition, more than enough votes to override a veto. 
   When the issue came to the Senate last week, there was considerable speculation as to whether there would be 67 votes to override a veto and whether there would be an excess of 60 votes for cloture. Then, as a result of some very intense, last-minute lobbying by the administration, a great many Senators changed their votes, reversed their announced intentions, and we had 42 votes in favor of the steel quota bill. 
   Even so, it was a large vote in the Senate--considering all the circumstances--because of the very strong public policy against quotas, remembering the problems in the Smoot-Hawley era. I think the effort at the quota bill was really to attract the attention of the administration, to show how serious the problem was. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the steel caucus, I have convened a number of meetings of our caucus. I have met with Treasury Secretary Rubin and Commerce Secretary Daley and Trade Representative Barshefsky. We have made the case of the need for enforcement of our trade laws. While not exactly a deaf ear, there was certainly little by way of any positive response. 
   I had an opportunity to talk personally with the President during a long plane ride from Andrews to Tel Aviv last December. The plane ride was more than 10 hours, an opportunity to talk about a great many subjects. I discussed with the President the very serious problems with the steel industry. He was sympathetic but nothing really has come from the administration to deal effectively with the problem of dumping. 
   The fact of life is, where it comes to considerations of foreign policy or defense policy, American industry is traditionally sacrificed and the antidumping laws are not enforced. 
   This is an issue which has concerned me, as a Pennsylvania Senator, since 1981 when I took my oath of office. In 1984, there was a favorable ruling by  the International Trade Commission supporting the steel industry. It was then up to the President, President Ronald Reagan, to determine whether or not that International Trade Commission ruling would stand. My then colleague, Senator John Heinz--the late Senator Heinz, who we all miss so very much--and I made the rounds of key administration officials. Then-Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige was in favor of upholding the International Trade Commission order. Then-Trade Representative Bill Brock was in favor of upholding the International Trade Commission order. Then-Senator Heinz and I met with Secretary of State George Shultz, separately with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, and were told in no uncertain terms by the Secretary of State that our foreign policy was such that the ITC decision had to be reversed by the President. That was Secretary Shultz' recommendation. Secretary of Defense Weinberger said about the same thing, that defense policy required the ITC ruling be overturned, which the President had the right to do. So, in fact, in September of 1984, President Reagan did overturn the International Trade Commission ruling. That was just symptomatic and characteristic of what had happened with respect to dumping and the harm of lost jobs to the industry. 
   Since the early 1980s, the steel industry has poured $50 billion of capital into modernization efforts and has pared the payrolls, as I noted earlier, from about 500,000 to about a third of that. There is no way that the American steel industry can compete with dumped steel; where Russians or Brazilians or others are prepared to steal--dumping is a form of stealing, spelled different from steel--the product. There is no way the American steel industry can compete with dumping.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Connecticut for those comments. I dare say that if we polled all of our colleagues, the other 98, there would not be a Senator who would not have problems in his own State on dumping. Some may object saying that they do not want to have anything to impede the flow of commerce, but there are some limits. 
   When it comes to the law, I know my colleague from Connecticut is as concerned about the rule of law as I am. If we want to eliminate the antidumping provisions, I will keep quiet. But when the law prohibits dumping and there is so much of it to the prejudice of so many people--talk about victims' rights--this is an injustice that is being perpetrated day in and day out. If it goes to court, justice will be done.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just one further comment. Some 
   of our most worthwhile floor discussions is when there is an exchange of ideas. So often comments go from protection of speech out into a vacuum. Like the old saying about college lectures in classes, it goes from the notes of the professor to the notes of the student without passing through the head of either. But when you have a discussion, it may be a little more informative. The executive branch is where it ought to start. But if there is not relief from the executive branch, then I look to the judicial branch. 
   The one conclusive item that I will note, because I don't want to take more than another 45 seconds, is in the enforcement of the civil rights laws. We could never have gotten desegregation in America if it was left up to the Congress or to the State legislatures or to the Presidents and the Governors nibbling at the edges a little bit. But when the case went to court, justice was done.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought this recognition to compliment Rabbi Sherer, who has just delivered the Senate prayer. 
   We are recognizing the outstanding work of Rabbi Sherer's father, also Rabbi Sherer, who died a little more than a year ago. Present today in the Senate gallery are some 200 representatives of a national convocation to recognize the outstanding work of the departed Rabbi Sherer. 
   I must say that Rabbi Sherer's comments this morning about freedom of religion and the impact on everyone in America, but with special reference to Jewish Americans, is of great significance to me because both of my parents came from foreign lands to the United States and were pleased and honored to pledge their allegiance to the United States of America. 
   My father left a shtetl, a small community, Batchkurina, in Ukraine, to come to the United States in 1911 at the age of 18, barely a ruble in his pocket, literally walked across Europe, took steerage in the bottom of a boat to come to America to seek his fortune, as did my mother who came with her parents when she was 5 years old in 1905 from a small town on the Russian-Polish border. They settled in America. They raised their family in America. My father fought in the American Expeditionary Force to help make the  world safe for democracy and, in his allegiance to his new-found country, rose to the rank of buck private. Next to his family, the greatest honor he had was serving in the U.S. Army. 
   Freedom of religion is fundamental Americana, and the Rabbi's prayer today brings it home to us. And I wanted to express my own views of thanks for this country, what it has done for my parents and what it has done for my brother, two sisters and me, and my sons and our granddaughters. 
   I thank the Chair, I thank Senator MOYNIHAN, and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to join my colleagues Senators LEVIN, LIEBERMAN, and COLLINS in introducing the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. Our bill would accomplish two important goals. First, it would reauthorize the institution of the independent counsel for another 5 years. Second, our bill would make significant changes to the existing independent counsel statute to correct a number of problems which have become clear to all of us during the course of the past few years. 
   Tomorrow, the independent counsel statute will sunset. The law is dying because there appears to be a consensus that it created more problems than it solved. Many of us have forgotten the very serious problems and conflicts that led us to pass the statute in the first place. Any problems with the law can be fixed, and our bill addresses the issues that have caused the most serious complaints. But it would be a serious error to eliminate the institution of the independent counsel. 
   Many years have passed since President Nixon's infamous Saturday Night Massacre. Yet it is important that we remember this episode because it is such a powerful reminder of why we  passed the independent counsel statute and why the statute is still needed today. 
   Before there was an independent counsel, the Attorney General appointed special prosecutors under his control to conduct investigations of Presidents and other high ranking officials. After the Watergate break-in, Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed Archibald Cox to serve as the Watergate Special Prosecutor. When President Nixon decided that Cox's investigation was getting too close to the truth, he sought to have Cox fired. The President was legally entitled to fire Cox, of course, since Cox was a Justice Department employee like any other. When Attorney General Elliot Richardson refused to fire Cox, Richardson was fired. When Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus refused to fire Cox, Ruckelshaus was also fired. Finally, Solicitor General Robert Bork agreed to fire Cox. 
   After Archibald Cox was fired, the White House announced that the office of the Watergate special prosecutor was to be closed and the President's chief of staff sent the FBI to surround Cox's offices and seize the records he had compiled. Henry Ruth, an old friend of mine who was working at the time as Archibald Cox's top deputy, described the following scene in his testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee on March 3 of this year:  
   In anticipation of adverse action, we had secured copies of key documents in secret locations around Washington, D.C. and even removed some key items from the office that Saturday night hidden in underwear and other unlikely locations. We did not know whether the military would raid our homes looking for documents. Unanimously, the staff of the Watergate prosecutor's office just refused to leave or to change anything we were doing unless someone physically removed us. And if an unprecedented 450,000 telegrams of spontaneous protest had not descended upon Washington, D.C. in the few days after that Saturday night, no one really knows if President Nixon would have succeeded in aborting the investigation. In other words, we do not feel that the Department of Justice was an adequate instrument for investigating the President and other high officials of government.  
   Eventually, as a result of these telegrams and enormous public pressure, Leon Jaworski was appointed as a special prosecutor and the Watergate investigation was continued. But this positive outcome was far from guaranteed. As Mr. Ruth reminded the committee, ``it is impossible to describe how thin a thread existed at that time, and for three weeks, for the continuation of what was going on.'' 
   It was this dark episode, perhaps more than any other, which convinced the nation that the individual investigating the President must be truly independent of the President. This is a lesson we should have to learn only once. While recent independent counsels have made some mistakes, none of these mistakes are on the scale of a Saturday Night Massacre. With this history as our guide, let us move to fix the statute, not eliminate it. 
   Senators LEVIN, LIEBERMAN, COLLINS and I have all attended 5 very comprehensive hearings before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee from February to April of this year. During these hearings, we heard from former independent counsels, former targets of independent counsels, judges on the special division of the court which appoints independent counsels, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and Attorney General Reno. The four of us have also met repeatedly to discuss what is wrong with the current law and how to fix it. The bill we introduce today incorporates many of the suggestions made during these hearings and corrects provisions in the bill which lead to the most serious complaints. 
   First of all, we all agreed that too many independent counsels have been appointed for matters which simply do not warrant this high level of review. For example, I believe that Attorney General Reno made a mistake when she asked for appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. In Secretary Herman's case, there was really insufficient corroboration to justify the allegations made against her. To address this issue, we have raised the evidentiary standard which must be met before the Attorney General is required to appoint an independent counsel. The statute currently requires that an independent counsel be appointed when there are ``reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.'' Our bill provides that an independent counsel must be appointed only when there are ``substantial grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted.'' This change will give an Attorney General the discretion to decide that evidence she receives is not sufficiently strong to justify an independent counsel investigation. 
   As a further step to control the number of independent counsel investigations, our legislation limits the number of ``covered persons'' under the statute to the President, Vice President, members of the President's Cabinet, and the President's chief of staff. Accordingly, it would no longer be possible to appoint an independent counsel to investigate lower officials and staff whom an Attorney General could properly investigate on his or her own. 
   The four of us also agreed that it is a mistake to give an independent counsel jurisdiction 
   over more than one investigation. For instance, Kenneth Starr started as the independent counsel for Whitewater. Attorney General Reno later expanded his jurisdiction to cover Travelgate, Filegate, the death of Vince Foster, and, or course, Monica Lewinsky. Unfortunately, the Attorney General's repeated expansion of Mr. Starr's jurisdiction created the mistaken impression that Mr. Starr was on a personal crusade against President Clinton, opening new lines of inquiry when prior ones failed to bear fruit. After Attorney General Reno expanded Mr. Starr's jurisdiction to include Monica Lewinsky, I publicly commented that this was a mistake, not because Kenneth Starr was not competent to handle the investigation, but because I was afraid that the public would see this as yet further proof that Starr was on a vendetta. I'm afraid this is exactly what came to pass. 
   Our bill would eliminate this problem by deleting the provision which allows the Attorney General to expand the jurisdiction of an independent counsel beyond his or her original mandate. Our bill further provides that the independent counsel can investigate only topics in his original jurisdiction or those ``directly related'' thereto. 
   The four of us also agreed that some independent counsel investigations drag on too long. Lawrence Walsh's Iran/Contra investigation lasted 6 years. Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton has been going on for almost 5 years. Investigations of this length are really an anomaly in our criminal justice system. Federal grand juries are empaneled for a period of 18 months. As district attorney of Philadelphia, I had a series of grand juries on complex topics such as municipal corruption, police corruption and drugs all of which lasted 18 months. If you can't find certain facts in 18 months, I think the odds are pretty good that you will never find them. 
   Our bill sets a 2-year time limit for independent counsel investigations. Since there are some who would try to take advantage of this time limit and ``run out the clock'' on an investigation, our bill also empowers the special division of the court to extend this original 2-year period for as long as necessary to make up for dilatory tactics. Our bill also provides that the special division can extend the original time period for good cause. Finally, the bill requires the Federal courts to conduct an expedited review of all matters relating to an investigation and a prosecution by an independent counsel. 
   Another complaint about the Starr investigation was that his report to Congress was a partisan document making an argument for impeachment rather than providing an impartial recitation of evidence. While I believe that Mr. Starr was merely doing his job when he submitted this report, I do agree that requiring such a report inserts an independent counsel into a process--impeachment--which should be left entirely to Congress. Accordingly, our bill deletes the requirement that the independent counsel submit a report to Congress of any substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds for an impeachment. 
   While Kenneth Starr was blamed for many things that were not his fault, I do believe he made a mistake when he decided to continue his private law practice while he was serving as an independent counsel. The job of being an independent counsel is a privilege and an enormous responsibility--it deserves someone's full time attention.  Accordingly, our bill requires that an independent counsel serve on a full-time basis for the duration of his or her investigation. 
   It appears that a majority of our colleagues believe that it is better to let independent counsel statute die and return to the old days when special prosecutors appointed and controlled by the Attorney General will investigate the President and his Cabinet. I am confident, however, that after the dust settles and tempers abate, our colleagues will realize that the independent counsel statute provides a better way to handle investigations of the President and his cabinet than any of the alternatives. 
   We must all remember that the independent counsel statute was passed to address a serious problem inherent in our system of government--the potential for abuse and conflicts of interest when the Attorney General investigates the President and other high-level executive branch officials. After all, it is the President who appoints the Attorney General and is the Attorney General's boss. Often the Attorney General and the President are close friends. Accordingly, there is an inherent conflict of interest in having the Attorney General control an investigation of the President or the President's closest associates. Even if an Attorney General were capable of conducting an impartial investigation, the appearance of a conflict of interest is serious enough to discredit the Attorney General's findings, especially a finding of innocence. 
   The independent counsel statute is the only way to address this inherent conflict of interest. As memories of the Saturday Night Massacre have been supplanted by memories of Kenneth Starr, the pendulum of public opinion has swung too far against the statute. I am confident that as soon as the Attorney General begins to investigate his or her colleagues in the White House, the pendulum will swing back in the opposite direction. When this occurs, I believe that our colleagues will see that our approach is the best approach--to fix the problems in the statute, not abandon it. 
   To reiterate, the existing independent counsel statute is set to expire by sunset provisions tomorrow, June 30. There have been a series of five extensive hearings held in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by our distinguished colleague, Senator THOMPSON. During the course of those hearings, attended by all four of the cosponsors of this legislation, we have heard extensive testimony. The four of us have met on a number of occasions to craft the legislation which we are introducing today. 
   Our fundamental conclusion is that the Attorney General, acting through the Department of Justice, has an irreconcilable conflict of interest when it comes to investigating top officials of the administration. This is a judgment which we come to from our various points of view. My own perspective is molded significantly by my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, knowing in detail the work of a prosecuting attorney, and the backdrop of the independent counsel statute was the ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' where President Nixon was under investigation and fired two Attorneys General until he found one who would fire the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox. 
   What is not recollected, but was testified to at our hearings by Henry Ruth, later the special prosecutor succeeding Leon Jaworski, was that at a critical moment, when President Nixon decided to eliminate the special prosecutor, the President's Chief of Staff sent the FBI to surround the office of the special prosecutor and to seize the special prosecutor's papers. As Henry Ruth outlined it, those in the office took key documents hidden under their clothing, not knowing what would happen next. It was only the public outrage, and some 450,000 telegrams which descended on Washington, which led President Nixon to change his position. 
   But the importance of independence in the prosecutor's office cannot be overly emphasized. We have seen experiences with independent counsels, two to be specific, that by Judge Walsh, former Judge Walsh, who investigated President Reagan's administration in Iran-contra, and Judge Starr, former Judge Starr, who investigated President Clinton, where those two investigations have drawn the wrath on both sides of the political aisle. There does appear to be a consensus at the moment that there ought not be a renewal of the independent counsel statute. I personally believe, and Senators LIEBERMAN, LEVIN, and COLLINS concur, that this is a fundamental mistake. So we have worked from the mistakes of the past to craft a reform bill, and we have targeted the errors. 
   Sooner or later a crisis will arise in Washington. It happens all the time. The crisis will be about the need to investigate the President or the Vice President or some ranking official. 
   The question will present itself about the inherent conflict of interest of the Attorney General, and this statute will be available to deal with the problem. 
   We have dealt with the mistakes of Walsh-Starr investigations by limiting the subjects. Only the President, Vice President, Attorney General, and Cabinet members will be subject to investigation. There will not be an expansion of jurisdiction unless directly related to the central charge, which would eliminate the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
   The independent counsel would have to be full time. I know from my days as district attorney it was impossible to do the job full time, but that ought to be a minimal requirement. We have imposed a time limit of some 2 years to be extended for cause, or to be extended automatically for delaying tactics, or by priority given by appellate courts on any legal issues raised. The independent counsel would have to submit an annual budget. 
   My colleagues are on the floor awaiting recognition. I inquire of the Chair how much of the 30 minutes has elapsed.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for 2 additional minutes to comment about an amendment which I will seek to add when this statute is considered. It is one where I am proceeding by myself. That is a provision to have a mandamus action to compel the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel where there is an abuse of discretion. It is my view that independent counsel should have been appointed on campaign finance reform, as recommended by FBI Director Louis Freeh and special counsel Charles LaBella. 
   I will ask consent that at the conclusion of the remarks which I am now making, there be included a draft complaint which I had prepared to compel the appointment of independent counsel. 
   This draft complaint was never filed because at each stage where it appeared warranted to pursue mandamus, the Attorney General would take some action on extension of investigation, and then it became interwoven with the impeachment proceedings so the time was never quite right. There was a complex issue on standing, although at one time we almost had an agreement by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to have their sponsorship, perhaps if not all of the Republicans in each committee, a majority of the Republicans, which would have provided standing for a report and, by analogy, perhaps, standing for such a lawsuit. 
   I do believe that when independent counsel is again considered and this statute sponsored by the four of us will be ready, willing, and able to proceed, the issue of a mandamus action ought to be considered.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the Memorial Day recess, I spent two days in Havana, Cuba, from June 1 to 3. I met with numerous Cuban officials, including a marathon six-and-a-half hour session with President Fidel Castro, with Cuban human rights dissidents, with religious leaders, with several foreign ambassadors and with our U.S. team. I am convinced there are a number of steps we can take, pursuant to our existing U.S. policy, to create closer people-to-people relations with Cuba. Sharing medical research, especially on immunizations, would be appropriate, between the National Institutes of Health and the Cuban Ministry of Health. Former Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of U.S. drug policy, had suggested to me that we should work closer with the Cuban government on drug interdiction, and I think he is right. 
   Relations between our two countries, only 90 miles apart, are almost non-existent. We have an embargo and a boycott. We have no exchange of ambassadors, and the limited coordination between our governments does not extend beyond very limited cooperation on drug interdiction. 
   I believe it is worthwhile to share with my colleagues some of my findings and impressions from my trip. The issue of the embargo is complex, and I am not yet ready to advocate a position. But there are other issues, such as the benefits of increasing contact and cooperation, which merit comment at this time. 
   Upon arrival in Havana about 2 pm June 1, we were met by Jorge Lexcano Perez, President of the Commission on International Relation, and Jose Manuel Barrios, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' U.S. Department. Primarily, all parties agreed that both nations would profit from better relations between the two. 
   I met next for more than an hour with our country team at the U.S. Embassy. We discussed the steps needed to normalize relations between our two nations and the dynamics of Cuba's government and economy, including the booming black market. We discussed the social climate, including religious freedom and human rights concerns. 
   I met next with Dr. Jose Miller, President of Casa de la Comunidad Hebrea de Cuba (The Jewish Community House of Cuba) and leader of Cuba's Jewish community, and with Adela Dworin, Dr. Miller's Vice President. Dr. Miller maintained that freedom of religion has been ``no problem'' in Cuba for both Jews and Christians since the fall of the Berlin Wall eight years ago. Cardinal Jaime Ortega, in a later meeting, also stressed that Cuba has seen an improvement in religious freedom during the past decade. Both said the greater openness came from a recognition on President Castro's part that a religious reconciliation was necessary. President Castro, Dr. Miller noted, has attended Hanukkah services at his synagogue. Dr. Miller and Ms. Dworin estimated that Cuba's Jewish population has shrunk to 1,500 from about 15,000 in 1959, and that they must bring in a rabbi to hold high holiday services. 
   We held our final meeting June 1 with Dr. Pedro Lopez Saura at The Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, an impressive biotech  facility that has apparently pioneered a vaccination for Meningitis B. Meningitis B, which also plagues the United States, is a severe infectious disease that may lead to permanent neurological damage and even to death in acute cases. Meningitis strikes about 2,600 people annually, more than half under five years old. Meningitis B accounts for 50-55 percent of all U.S. cases. While NIH, our federal medical research arm, has a budget 1,000 times the size of The Cuban center's, the Cuban facility has apparently outstripped American efforts in a couple of narrow areas, including Meningitis B vaccine and interferon work. I found Dr. Lopez, who has trained in Cuba, Belgium, East Germany and Finland, very impressive. I suggested that Dr. Lopez visit NIH Director Dr. Harold Varmus, who has already visited the Cuban facility, for an exchange that could benefit both nations. 
   We began our meetings the next morning, June 2, with the Cuban Minister of Health, Dr. Carlos Dotres Martinez, at one of Cuba's largest medical teaching facilities on the outskirts of Havana. Dr. Martinez touted the Cuban health system and presented charts and statistics to suggest that Cuba's aggressive research and vaccination program has eradicated polio, diphtheria and other pestilences and improved its citizens' health and longevity. In a common Cuban refrain, Dr. Martinez argued that the U.S. blockade has forced Cubans to spend more for medical imports from Europe and China. He estimated Cuba has spent an estimated $20 million more for freight and other incidental costs on top of the fixed costs of $50 million to $100 million. 
   I suggested that Dr. Martinez meet with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala. 
   We met next with Concepcion de la Campa, President and General Director of the Finlay Institute, which manufactures vaccines, including the Meningitis B vaccine pioneered by the Cuban research labs. I had a particular interest in this biotechnology effort because a company with a substantial base in my state of Pennsylvania is negotiating a license to work with Cubans to produce the Meningitis B vaccine. Under their proposed arrangement, the Pennsylvania company would produce the vaccine in quantity for distribution in the United States and elsewhere in the First World and the Cubans would manufacture the vaccine for the rest of the world. 
   Mrs. Campa, like her Cuban medical colleagues, agreed that medical research would be boosted by closer relations between the United States and Cuba, and by such joint ventures. 
   We met next at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence with ambassadors from several nations: Charge Josef Marsicek of the Czech Republic, Ambassador Reinhold Huber of 
   Germany, Ambassador Eduardo Junco Bonet of Spain, Ambassador David Ridgway of Britain, and Ambassador Keith Christie of Canada. The ambassadors gave me a frank assessment of President Castro and the Cuban realities. Like the US team, the European diplomats also saw a thawing in the Castro regime's stridency, as demonstrated by Cuban overtures for dialog. 
   After my talk with the ambassadors, I met at the US residence with five Cuban dissidents and human rights activists: A member of the Christian Liberation Movement; a former Batista-era soldier, an environmental and peace activist; a medical doctor removed from his post for criticizing the Cuban medical establishment; and a member of the Pro-Human Rights Party. We discussed human rights and repression generally and specifically, with a focus on ``The Four,'' four jailed Cuban dissidents whose plight has stirred international human rights complaints. I have omitted their names and limited comments on their statements to protect their identities. 
   The dissidents told us passionately of the Cuban government's intolerance for any dissent, demonstrated by frequent jailings and loss of jobs and travel opportunities for those who speak out. The dissidents disagreed on remedies for accomplishing change, differing, for example, on whether the United States should lift its embargo. 
   At 8 pm Wednesday evening, we arrived at the President's complex for a dinner meeting with President Castro. The President arrived 10 minutes later, apologized for his tardiness, and proceeded to host us for a six hour and 37 minute session, ending at nearly 3 am. We had been advised that President Castro enjoyed lengthy talks. We knew we were in for a long night when President Castro said he had worked until 5:45 am the night before and then slept eight hours, waking at 2 pm--just six hours before our meeting. We did not even move from the President's conference room to his dining room until midnight. 
   I found President Castro, at 73, robust and engaging. Always cordial, he was at times jocular and at other times guarded. He wore his trademark green military uniform with modest insignia and took notes throughout much of our meeting. During our talk, we covered the gamut of subjects. 
   I asked about the possibility of parole for the four celebrated dissidents. President Castro told me, ``I think they should fulfill their sentences because they have done great damage to this country,'' He insisted that charges against Cuba of human rights abuses ``were totally unfair,'' arguing that Cuba did not torture prisoners, employ death squads or practice assassination. 
   On the issue of drug trafficking, President Castro said his country has been cracking down, including establishing the death penalty for international drug trafficking. ``We are willing to cooperate'' with the United States, he said. ``We don't ask the Americans for anything in return. We do it as a matter of ethics.'' He noted that Cuba would not, however, allow the United States to violate its territorial waters or air space. 
   I asked President Castro about the assassination of President Kennedy, an area of particular interest for me because of my work as a lawyer on the Warren commission. President Castro maintained that the Cuban government played no role in the assassination, and that it would have been insane for it to have become involved, given that the United States, by his reckoning, was looking for provocation or pretense to invade Cuba. Castro said Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin, wanted to go to Cuba--a request the Cubans denied--simply to transit to the Soviet Union. President Castro said he was relieved that the Warren Commission concluded that Cuba was not involved with Oswald. 
   I asked President Castro if he was concerned that people might think Cuba had been involved with Oswald. He said, ``Yes, we were concerned.'' 
   President Castro gave an elaborate description of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He described how Cuba initially bought its weapons from Belgium, a NATO country, to avoid inciting the United States. But the second Belgian shipment was sabotaged and blown up on Havana's docks, Castro said, and he eventually arranged to buy Soviet arms. President Castro said former Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev made a mistake in not describing the missiles as defensive weapons and in ``getting into a game of definitions'' instead of simply maintaining his right to install weapons without question. President Castro noted the United States had weapons at the time in Turkey and Italy. He described his hunting trip in Russia with Kruschev, and how Kruschev had pulled out and read from a letter to Kennedy. When Kruschev read a passage about Kennedy promising to pull U.S. missiles out of Turkey and Italy, President Castro said, Kruschev realized he had made a mistake in revealing that Kruschev was going to breach his deal with Castro and remove the Cuban missiles. That would leave Cuba vulnerable to U.S. invasion, in President Castro's view. 
   In the end, President Castro said, the Russian withdrawal also served Cuba's purpose. ``We preferred the risk of invasion to the presence of Soviet troops, because it would have established an image [of Cuba] as a Soviet base.'' 
   President Castro told us about various assassination attempts against him by the United States since 1959, some documented by the U.S. Senate's Church Committee. Plans were launched to poison President Castro's milk shake, to plant an exploding cigar and to blow him up. ``Some of them were childish,'' he said. President Castro said he had survived largely ``as a matter of luck.'' 
   I asked him how he felt about being the target of so many assassination attempts.  
   President Castro replied, ``Do you play any sports?'' 
   I said, ``I play squash every day.'' 
   He said, ``That is my sport.'' 
   Throughout the evening, the Cuban President frequently dispatched an aide or minister in the wee hours to produce a document or find an official's name. The aides performed their research in short order. In one case, President Castro wanted the name of a U.S. Senator who had visited Cuba in 1977, which turned out to be former Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. 
   The next morning--or, more accurately, later Thursday morning--we met with Cardinal Ortega. Like Dr. Miller of the Havana synagogue, Cardinal Ortega also said the Cuban regime had adopted a more open attitude toward religion, from the previous ``climate of fear.'' He attributed the thaw in the government's position to a recognition that it was not easy to erase religious faith. He noted there have always been diplomatic relations between Havana and the Vatican. 
   As for living conditions in Cuba under Castro, the Cardinal said the obvious in noting widespread poverty. On human rights, he said the Castro regime always equates human rights as the right to health, study and education, a low threshold. 
   Our visit was facilitated by the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. team and the Cuban government.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to compliment the prompt action of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in sending a forensic team to gather evidence in Kosovo for the prosecution of those indicted under the War Crimes Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia, which would include President Milosevic. 
   Earlier this morning, FBI Director Louis Freeh announced that some 59 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, have been dispatched to Macedonia--will be in Kosovo--and will be, starting tomorrow, preserving evidence for the prosecution of those under indictment by the War Crimes Tribunal. 
   This is a very important step because we have already had a series of reports about tampering with evidence, about the removal of massive grave sites. The prompt action by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, moving to the scene of the crimes to gather evidence for use in court, is of the utmost importance. 
   For some 12 years, as an assistant district attorney and later as district attorney in Philadelphia, I had experience in the gathering of evidence for use in the criminal prosecution process. I can personally attest to the importance of prompt action. 
   If you do not get the evidence while it is fresh, it may disappear; its quality may change unless it is preserved. So the very prompt action of the FBI in moving on this is very important. It is especially important as the evidence is unfolding of the crimes against humanity by the Serbian Armed Forces under the direction of President Milosevic. 
   President Milosevic has already been indicted. The acquisition of this evidence will be key in preparing for the trial of the case. The long arm of the law extends very far. It is my prediction that one day President Milosevic will be in the dock at the Hague in the criminal court there, as will be Radovan Karadzic, the former head of Bosnia, General Mladic, and the others who are under indictment. 
   As I have noted before on the floor of the Senate, I believe that a condition of the cease-fire should have been having Milosevic turned over to the NATO forces. We learned from the bitter experience in Iraq--20/20 hindsight--we would have been wiser to have taken the steps necessary to take Saddam Hussein into custody. Our failure to do so has caused enormous problems. We have seen with Milosevic that he has started some three wars, and if he is at liberty, who knows what he may do in the future. That action has already been taken. 
   It is vitally important that the evidence be preserved so that when--and I do not say if--but when Milosevic and the other indictees are taken into custody, we will be in a position to have the prosecutors at the War Crimes Tribunal present that evidence. 
   I have had the honor to visit the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague on a number of occasions. The prosecutors there are a very fine team. They have received support from a variety of Federal agencies. The CIA has been helpful with the overhead satellites. The Department of State has been of continuing assistance. The Department of Defense has been of assistance. Now the action by the FBI, with the approval of the Attorney General, is very important. 
   This is unprecedented for the FBI to undertake this kind of acquisition of evidence. There are precedents in the field where the FBI has worked overseas on the Khobar Tower bombing in Saudi Arabia and with the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The FBI was deployed to El Salvador for the investigations of murders that occurred in 1983. The FBI was involved in the investigation of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia in 1993, and involved in a polygraph examination in a murder case in Guatemala in 1995, and supported the investigation of a murder in Haiti in 1995.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak relatively briefly on the steel import limitation bill. 
   Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 289-141. While this quota legislation is a very  strong measure, it reflects the necessity that strong action be taken to enforce U.S. trade laws to stop an avalanche of dumping by foreign countries. 
   We have seen the decimation and disintegration of the American steel industry by unfair foreign imports. Twenty years ago, in 1979, approximately 453,000 steelworkers were employed. Today that figure is about 160,000. Some $50 billion has been invested by the American steel industry to modernize, but there is no way that the American steel industry can compete with dumped goods, the sale of goods in the United States at prices lower than the price at which such goods are being sold by the producing companies in their own country or in some other country. These goods come into the United States from a number of countries--from Russia, from Brazil, from Ukraine, from South Africa and from China--at prices less than the cost of production. This is the antithesis of fair trade. 
   This situation requires a change. Twelve executives from American steel companies sent a letter to the Secretary of Commerce Daley in response to his comment last week that the steel crisis is over--said Secretary Daley. This letter, dated June 18, 1999, says, in pertinent part, the following:  
   The steel industry started some seven actions for antidumping, and six of those were subjected to suspension agreements by the Department of Commerce, to the detriment of the steel companies.

   Mr. SPECTER. Steel import limitations, or quotas, provide for a drastic remedy. Along with the steel industry, other industries in the United States have been victimized by the failure to enforce U.S. trade laws. 
   I have, for the past 15 years, proposed legislation which would authorize equitable relief to provide for enforcement of the U.S. trade laws. At the present time, if complaints are filed with the International Trade Commission, it takes up to a year--or more--to have those matters resolved. An equitable action, a court of equity, would result in having these matters resolved in the course of a few weeks. 
   Until that is done, it appears to be necessary for some very decisive action. This is why I cosponsored the steel import limitation bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against tabling both competing versions of the Patient's Bill of Rights because I believe both should be considered by the Senate. I oppose any proposal to limit amendments on either bill and then have just an up or down vote on each Bill. 
   I believe a bill should be considered in regular order in the usual manner subject to the Senate rules which would permit amendments and debate under our rules without a unanimous consent agreement limiting amendments or debate. 
   My own preference for the Patient's Bill of Rights is the bipartisan proposal S. 374 sponsored by Senators CHAFEE, GRAHAM, LIEBERMAN, BAUCUS, and myself. 
   If any bill is called up subject to regular order, the various provisions could be considered and voted upon and the Senate would work its will on the competing provisions.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak relatively briefly on the steel import limitation bill; a cloture vote on the motion to proceed is scheduled tomorrow at 12:15. I will be engaged in committee hearings at that time, so I have sought a few minutes this afternoon to express my support to impose cloture on the steel import limitation bill. 
   Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 289-141. While this is a strong measure, a so-called quota bill, I believe it reflects the necessity that strong action be taken to enforce U.S. trade laws to stop an avalanche of dumping by foreign countries. 
   We have seen the disintegration of the American steel industry, the decimation of the American steel industry by unfair foreign imports. Twenty years ago, in 1979, approximately 453,000 steelworkers were employed. Today that figure is about 160,000. Some $50 billion has been invested by the American steel industry to modernize, but there is no way that the American steel industry can compete with dumped goods. When I say ``dumped goods'' I mean goods which come into the United States from a number of countries--from Russia, from Brazil, from Ukraine, from South Africa, from China--where they are sold for less than they are sold for in the exporting country; that is, sold for less than the United States and sold for less than Russia, which is sending them to the United States, and sold for less than the cost of production. 
   The situation requires a change. I will quote extensively from a letter sent by 12 executives from American steel companies to the Secretary of Commerce, responding to a comment by the Secretary of Commerce last week that the steel crisis is over--so said Secretary Daley. This letter, dated June 18, 1999, from the executives of 12 American steel companies, says, in pertinent part, the following: 
   The steel crisis is still very much with us. Imports volumes are down from the disastrous levels of 1998 but are still very high by historic standards. The surge of imports in 1998 caused inventories to balloon to extremely high levels. These inventories have seriously depressed prices up until the present and will continue to do so until these stocks have been worked down. Moreover, cold-rolled imports are up dramatically through April of this year, 24% above the level of the first four months of last year. Imports of cut-to-length plate are up dramatically--25% year-to-year for this period. 
   Prices remain extremely depressed. The producer price index for all steel mill products is down 9% (1999:Q2/1998/Q2). This is the largest decline in nearly 20 years. Prices for hot-rolled sheet, cold-rolled sheet and plate are down 11% and 15% respectively. 
   Operating rates have plunged from 93% to 80% between January and December 1998 and have remained at that depressed level through the first half of 1999. The decline in operating rates equates to about $2 billion in lost revenue in the second half of last year. On an annualized basis, a 10% change in operating rate equals about $5 billion in revenue. 
   The depressed prices and operating rates caused most American steel companies to post losses in the most recent quarter. Several steel companies have been forced into bankruptcy. Thousands of those who were laid off due to unfairly traded imports are still out of work. Many thousands have seen their workweeks shortened and are still not back to full time. 
   For our industry, therefore, this crisis is very real. 
   The steel industry started some seven actions for antidumping, and six of those were subjected to suspension agreements by the Department of Commerce, to the detriment of the steel companies. 
   I ask unanimous consent this chart on steel imports and suspension agreements be printed at the conclusion of my statement.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I have sought recognition to support this bill, because I believe that a real need has been shown for these loan guarantees, certainly for the steel industry, and I believe for the oil and gas industry as well. 
   Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI have outlined the procedures which were followed in the Appropriations Committee, and I was part of that conference. The conference worked one night until past midnight, and this provision was the subject of debate. 
   Coming in the Senate bill, the House of Representatives accepted it after some substantial consideration, and then, as has been specified, some votes were changed. The Speaker of the House of Representatives was not pleased with this provision. The House of Representatives then changed its position after having agreed to this amendment. Then we were faced with a very difficult problem of a stalemate as to what would happen with the Senate insisting on this provision and the House opposing it. We were faced with the need to get this emergency supplemental appropriations bill to finance the military operations in Kosovo. 
   The meeting finally eventuated in a very small session in S-128 downstairs where Senator STEVENS was present, Senator BYRD was present, and I was present representing the Senate. There were a few of the House Members. It was a very tough bargaining session. 
   Senator BYRD finally agreed, in the interest of moving the bill, and we all agreed, to take this particular amendment off in order that the provisions as to financing the military operation in Kosovo could go forward. The arrangement was made that this other legislative vehicle would be available to bring the bill back up for consideration by the Senate. 
   Senator DOMENICI has just outlined the absence of a commitment on the vote, and I think that is, candidly, a generous position. There is a basis for contending that this amendment should be placed in the same position where it was prior to being taken off the earlier bill. If that is to be so, then this amendment will be agreed to and it will go back as the Senate's position for a conference with the House, with the House having first accepted it and then having rejected it. 
   Whatever may eventuate in this Chamber today obviously remains to be seen in accordance with our rules. 
   On the merits, I believe that is a sound proposal. The steel industry has been very hard hit over the past several decades with dumped and subsidized steel coming into the United States. The dumped steel ought not be tolerated. It is against our trade laws. It is against international trade laws. But, the dumping continues in great volume. 
   That dumping has, in the immediate past, cost the jobs of thousands of steelworkers and caused tremendous lawsuits to the steel industry, which is a threat not only to the economy and to jobs and to profits, but also a threat to national security. 
   It is one thing to have dumped steel coming from Russia at the present time where the Russian economic situation leads them to sell at virtually any price to get dollars, but if a national emergency arises, are we going to get steel from Russia? 
   We have dumped steel from Brazil, from Korea, from Japan, and other countries. In times of national emergency, are we going to rely on those other countries as a source of supply? 
   The steel industry once had some 500,000 workers and was an enormous industry in the United States. Over a period of time, that number has dwindled down to about a third--less than a third, actually--about 150,000 workers. The steel industry has capitalized with some $50 billion to be very competitive. But you cannot compete against dumping. You cannot compete against a seller who will sell at any price. That is why the steel industry is in the very serious condition it is today.

   Mr. SPECTER. I only got to be a district attorney. Senator BYRD and I have a long, unguarded border with southern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. We intend to keep it that way, especially if we can keep the steelworkers employed. 
   I will be relatively brief, and I know the Senator from Indiana is waiting to speak and the Senator from New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico has spoken. If I know his practice, he may speak again. There may be some additional occasion. 
   We have had a very grave time in the steel industry with the loss of jobs. This is a relatively modest proposal. It is a loan guarantee proposal, and the borrowers have to provide collateral. The borrowers have to pay the fees. 
   I believe this program can be administered in a way that the loan guarantees will not be called into play. That, of course, is a speculative matter. The reality of the situation is, if the companies cannot borrow commercially and have to have a loan guarantee, there is some element of risk. But I believe that is a fair proposition. 
   The loan guarantee has been structured in a way to provide for collateral; that is, assets will have to be put up by the borrowing companies. Collateral means to fall back on if the borrower defaults; the collateral can be used to satisfy the loan. 
   The payment of fees is another provision to save the Government of the United States costs. The situation has been recognized by the House of Representatives when it voted in overwhelming numbers, close to 290 votes, in favor of the steel quota bill; less than half of that in opposition. 
   I have pressed legislation over the years which would provide for an equitable remedy to stop dumped goods from coming into the United States. In the early 1980s I had a legislative proposal to provide for injunctive relief, where the injured party could go into court and get relief within the course of a few weeks instead of many months or even years, which we now have under the procedures of the International Trade Commission. That legislation is pending now. It has been revised to provide for duties instead of injunctive relief to be GATT consistent. 
   I believe the companion provision here offered by Senator DOMENICI on loan guarantees for the oil and gas industry is solid, especially for the small producers who have had a very difficult time. 
   Years ago, my father had a used oil field supply business in Russell, KS. It really was a junkyard. At that time I had some experience with the small producers in the oil patch. I know that they have difficult times, too, and that this loan guarantee program makes sense there as well. 
   I thank my colleague from Indiana for awaiting my recognition here. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak briefly on the emergency steel and emergency oil and gasoline guarantee program. 
   Before discussing the merits of the pending issue--which I believe is a very meritorious bill--I think it appropriate to comment on the very unique procedural status of this measure, and it is this: 
   This provision was in the emergency appropriations bill passed by the Senate, which went to conference with the House last month, on the so-called ``Kosovo emergency'' where we provided funding for the military action in Kosovo. The House of Representatives during the conference receded to the Senate position, so this bill was accepted by both the Senate--where it passed--and by the House on the rescission. 
   On the next day, since the conference did not end that day, where the House receded, the House of Representatives changed its position, because the Speaker of the House took up the matter where two of the three key voters in the House changed their vote. The House then changed its position to be opposed to this guarantee loan program. 
   Then we had the controversy continuing, with the Senate including the program in its bill. The House, having first receded and adopting the program, then said it would oppose the program. 
   There was very considerable debate. One of our sessions lasted past midnight. The conferees, of which I was one on the Appropriations Committee, were trying to get this bill concluded so we could fund the Kosovo military operations. 
   There were very considerable discussions. Finally, a small group went to Senate Room 128, the appropriations room. Senator BYRD was present, Senator STEVENS was present, and I was present, all representing the Senate. There were just a few of the House Members present at that time. 
   We finally agreed upon an approach where the sponsors of this measure--the principal sponsors being Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI, and I was a sponsor as well--agreed to have it removed from the emergency supplemental to be attached to another supplemental, which was available. 
   The understanding was reached that the provision would be on the Senate bill going back to the House in an identical position, that the provision was on the Senate bill, the emergency supplemental passed by the Senate, and then up for consideration by the House. Senator STEVENS, as the chairman of the committee, made a commitment on behalf of the Senate that that would happen. 
   In order to comply with that arrangement, it would be necessary for this bill to pass the Senate and then to go back to conference with the House--where, candidly, its fate is uncertain--because the House Members, after the position taken by the Speaker of the House, appeared during our conference as being unlikely to accept the bill. Presumptively, that position would continue. That, of course, would await the events of the conference. But, that arrangement was made. 
   I think that is a strong point that ought to be considered by the Senate to put this provision in the same position it was in when approved by the Senate, with disagreement by the House after they had earlier agreed, so there would not be a procedural loss. 
   That was the essence that finally persuaded Senator BYRD to agree to take it off of the earlier bill. So much for the procedure, which I think speaks very strongly for having this measure enacted by the Senate. 
   On the merits, I submit there are very sound reasons for this loan guarantee program. We have seen the steel industry really decimate in the recent past by dumped steel imports from many countries including Japan, Brazil, Korea, and Russia. In Russia there is a very great demand for the dollar so the Russians are selling steel for any price they can get for it. 
   The International Trade Commission, backed by the Commerce Department, recently confirmed the very high level of dumping. 
   We have had a very serious problem with thousands of layoffs in an industry which had slipped down from some 500,000 steelworkers to about 150,000 even while some $50 billion in capital had been put into the steel industry. There is no way to compete with dumping. Dumping is when foreign exporters bring imports into the United States below the cost of production--below the cost they are selling it in other places. Dumping is in violation of U.S. trade laws and is in violation of GATT. 
   Over the years, I have urged the adoption of legislation which would provide for a private right of action. That was introduced early in the 1980s to have injunctive relief granted to stop dumped and subsidized steel coming into the country in violation of U.S. trade laws. 
   I introduced legislation, which is pending at the present time, which would modify the injunctive relief but would provide for equitable relief with duties imposed. This would be GATT consistent. Anybody who dumped steel in the United States would have a duty imposed equal to the legitimate price minus the dumped price. With this legislation, there would be no advantage to dumping steel in the United States. 
   The House of Representatives passed a very strong bill on quotas, by 289 to about 141. It is veto proof, at least on that state of the record. That matter may be headed for debate on the Senate floor--but in the interim--I think this program for emergency steel and loan guarantees is very appropriate. It provides for a $1 billion revolving fund for steel companies, and a two-year, $500 million revolving fund for oil and gas companies. 
   The bill would require commitment of collateral, which would be a guarantee that the loan would be repaid  and have a fee to be paid by the borrower to cover the cost of administering the program with all loans to be paid in full within 6 years. 
   The package has been estimated to cost $270 million which is offset by the executive travel budget. On the merits, it is a solid program and it does have an appropriate offset. 
   I speak with grave concern about the issue of steel--from the point of view of our Nation--because steel is essential for national security purposes. If an emergency were to arise, we would not be able to buy steel presumptively from the Russians or probably from the Japanese, or who knows, from the Brazilians. We ought to be independent and have a strong steel industry. 
   In my capacity as chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I have grave concern about the loss of jobs, which have been very heavy in my State, Pennsylvania, but very heavy in other States as well. Three medium-sized companies have recently gone into bankruptcy: Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel. Others may be in the offing with the tremendous impact of the dumping of steel. 
   With respect to the problems in the so-called ``oil patch,'' Senator DOMENICI has spoken at some length. We are not talking about the big oil companies. From my background years ago when my family owned a used oil field equipment company--really, a junkyard in Russell, KS--I became familiar with the problems of the small oil dealers in the so-called ``oil patch.'' Senator DOMENICI will address that issue in somewhat greater detail. 
   My familiarity at the moment is more intensive and extensive on steel, but I do believe that the problems which have been faced by the small oil producers are extensive and warrant this kind of a loan guarantee program. With the provisions of collateral security, safeguards, fees to be paid and with the offset present, this program is one which is structurally sound to have the loans repaid. 
   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can consider this matter on the merits, both because of the understanding--really, commitment--reached as I earlier described and the merits of the substantive program.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss with the managers of this bill a matter relating to the 1992 Water Resources Development Act which authorizes the construction of flood protection facilities along the Lackawanna River in Olyphant and Scranton. 
   I can personally attest to the serious situation, because when the flooding occurred, I went there one Saturday night late to see the ravage of that water problem and have been there on quite a number of occasions, to know firsthand the very severe problem which is involved there. 
   The appropriated account has $42 million, and this bill removes some $25 million from that account. I know that the $17 million remaining will be sufficient to take care of the expenditures for the next fiscal year which amount to some $6 million, leaving $11 million in the account. 
   I want to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee a couple of factors. 
   One is if my representation is correct that the $17 million left in the account will be more than enough to take care of the expenditure line for the next fiscal year. 
   The second question I want to be sure about is that there will be adequate funding to complete this project so that when the schedule arises that we need all of the $42 million, or whatever the amount is, that we will have the cooperation of the Appropriations Subcommittee, the distinguished chairman, and the distinguished ranking member in providing that funding, up to $42 million, which it has now. I understand the plight the chairman is under because 302(b) allocations are not sufficient. I have seen that firsthand. I chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and we are unable to go to a markup with the figure we have because of the very tight restrictions. 
   The second aspect is, I am looking for the assurance that the remainder of the $42 million will be appropriated when the need arises to meet the ensuing fiscal year requirements of the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   The third factor that I want to be sure about on the record is that there could be an analysis which will segregate this flood control into three projects. 
   There you start, again, to get into the complexities of the cost-benefit ratio. But as it has been structured very carefully, the arrangement, in its present form, as a unit, satisfies the cost-benefit relationship. There are a lot of concerns and a lot of battles about that. But we are, as a unit, covered under that cost-benefit ratio. 
   I want to be cooperative, obviously, with the chairman as he is moving through this bill. I understand, as I say, the need for taking some of these funds for other projects, but if the chairman would respond to those three inquiries to be sure my constituents will have the adequacy of the funding. I know Senator SANTORUM, who could not be here at the moment, has a similar concern. Congressman SHERWOOD has a similar concern. We have all been very close to this issue and the very important constituent interest involved here. 
   I direct those questions to my colleague from New Mexico.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in discussing the issue related to the 1992 Water Resources Development Act on the Lackawanna River in Olyphant and Scranton, it is obvious that my first preference, the delegation's first preference, is to have the $25 million restored. 
   We have a second program in south-central Pennsylvania, the Environmental Improvements Program, where $20 million has been rescinded. This is  in line with a large sequence of rescissions which have been put into effect by the subcommittee under the same problem where there is simply insufficient money on 302(b) allocations. Again, I understand that, because I have the problem on the appropriations subcommittee which I chair. 
   I am advised that the $20 million rescission as to south-central Pennsylvania can be worked out in the House, and all of this is subject to compromise in the House, where we may have a larger figure for this subcommittee. So it is possible that the $25 million for the Scranton-Olyphant projects may be restored fully as well as the $20 million for south-central Pennsylvania. 
   Before this bill is closed out, I want to be absolutely sure that we are protecting these projects so that whatever funding they need for the next fiscal year will be provided. That is the context in which I have made the request to the distinguished manager. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague for those assurances. I am glad to hear, with respect to these three projects joined together, that they are being viewed as one integrated whole so that they do satisfy the requirements of the cost-benefit ratio, and further, that the rescissions on the two Pennsylvania projects, as to the Lackawanna River in Olyphant and Scranton and also the south-central Pennsylvania rescission, that those projects will move forward with sufficient funding, as Senator DOMENICI has pointed out, $17 million being left in the Lackawanna River project for Olyphant and Scranton and only $6 million needed in the next fiscal year. If it is possible, as Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID work through the bill, to increase the funding, to eliminate the rescissions, that certainly would be appreciated. 
   I think on this state of the record, these projects are protected. I will await further developments as we move through the bill to see if some of those funds might be restored and even the $25 million not rescinded. 
   I thank Senator DOMENICI and I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for waiting until we finish this item of business.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to pay tribute to two distinguished Pennsylvanians, Leonard and Madlyn Abramson, upon the establishment of the Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. The $100 million commitment from The Abramson Family Foundation--the largest single contribution for cancer research to a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center--supports the unprecedented expansion of cancer research, education and patient care at Penn's Cancer Center. 
   The Abramson Family Foundation is a trust fund directed by Leonard and Madlyn Abramson. Mr. Abramson is the founder and former chairman and CEO of U.S. Healthcare, Inc. Best known for his accurate predictions in the changing world of health care over the past two decades, Mr. Abramson believed in HMOs as the best health care alternative in the early 1970s. He went on to build one of the nation's largest and most successful managed care organizations before selling it to Aetna in 1996. Madlyn Abramson is a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a member of the Health System's Board of Trustees and the Graduate School of Education's Board of Overseers. 
   The Abramsons have been supporters of cancer research, as well as numerous other causes, for more than a decade. The family's long and generous history with the University of Pennsylvania Health System includes gifts to endow two professorships and a multi-year grant through the former U.S.  Healthcare to the Cancer Center's Bone Marrow Transplant Program. 
   The Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute has created a revolutionary framework for facilitating innovation in cancer research, enabling the Penn Cancer Center to bring together the best scientists, physicians, and staff and to develop new approaches in an effort to make current treatments for cancer obsolete. John H. Glick, M.D., the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Professor of Clinical Oncology and Director of Penn's Cancer Center for more than a decade, serves as Director and President of the Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute. 
   The gift of The Abramson Family Foundation will significantly increase our opportunities to break new ground in the war on cancer--especially in the areas of cancer genetics and molecular diagnosis, from which future research and patient care advances will occur. 
   The Institute supports leading-edge cancer research through the recruitment of outstanding scientists and physicians from around the world and the design of innovative patient care paradigms. The Abramson pledge propels the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center--already one of the nation's top cancer centers--to the next level of research and patient-focused care.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in anticipation of Memorial Day this coming Monday, I wish to honor the memories of the 1.1 million Americans who gave their lives in defense of America and American ideals. Americans have fought and died in various wars spanning over two centuries. Her fallen soldiers have left indelible marks on the annals of history in conflicts notable for the good attained over the evil vanquished: independence over monarchial tyranny; freedom over slavery; and democracy over fascism and communism. Indeed, in this century alone, American servicemembers can be hailed for turning the tide of history's two world wars. As we head towards the dawn of a new millennium, I ask my colleagues to join with me to give homage to America's patriots, in deed as well as word. 
   I believe the best way to commemorate the spirit of those who gave their lives is to honor, respect, and care for the 26 million American veterans living today. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have striven to accomplish this goal through a number of legislative measures and processes. After a successful battle over the budget resolution, I and 52 of my Senate colleagues signed on to a letter urging the Appropriation's Committee to match the budget resolution's recommendation of an additional $1.66 billion for veterans' health care. This funding is vital to ensure that our nation's veterans get the highest quality of health care available. I have also pushed for enactment of legislation which would increase veterans' education benefits; allow for a Medicare Subvention demonstration project; require additional national cemeteries to be built in areas with high veteran populations; and ensure that construction of the World War II Memorial begins next year. 
   The Athenian leader Pericles had these words to say about those who lost their lives in the Peloponnesian War over 24 centuries ago: ``Not only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions, but there dwells also an unwritten memorial of them, graven not on stone but in the hearts of men.'' This Memorial Day, I challenge my colleagues to make a commitment to engrave the memory of 1.1 million Americans not only in our hearts, but in the legislation we enact for veterans and servicemembers during the remainder of the 106th Congress.

   I support this amendment. I believe a woman should have a right to choose, and under the circumstances involved here, if the woman is going to seek an abortion, she should not be compelled to come back to the United States. Having an abortion in many foreign spots poses very material risks. This is a common sense abortion amendment which ought to be adopted.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to comment about another matter very relevant to the pending legislation, that is the dispatch from Reuters within the hour that the War Crimes Tribunal has issued an indictment for President Milosevic and that an arrest warrant has already been signed. I think that is very important news, because it not only puts Milosevic on notice but also all of his subordinates, that the War Crimes Tribunal means business, that those who are responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes will be prosecuted. 
   I compliment Justice Louise Arbour who was in Washington on April 30, asking a bipartisan group of Senators, including this Senator, for assistance; and we appropriated some $18 million in the emergency supplemental last week. 
   The next important point is to be sure that we do not permit a plea bargain to be entered into which will exonerate Milosevic as part of any peace settlement. 
   We ought to be sure this prosecution is carried forward. There is an abundance of evidence apparent to the naked eye from the television reports on atrocities, of mass murders, which can only be carried out with the direction of or at least concurrence or acquiescence of President Milosevic. Those crimes should not go unpunished. There should not be a compromise or a plea bargain which would give Milosevic immunity.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides that:  
   None of the funds authorized or otherwise available to the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for the deployment of ground troops from the United States Armed Forces in Kosovo, except for peacekeeping personnel, unless authorized by declaration of war or a joint resolution authorizing the use of military force.  
   The purpose of this amendment, obvious on its face, is to avoid having the United States drawn into a full-fledged war without authorization of the Congress. This authorization is required by the constitutional provision which states that only the Congress of the United States has the authority to declare war, and the implicit consequence from that constitutional provision that only the Congress of the United States has the authority to involve the United States in a war. The Founding Fathers entrusted that grave responsibility to the Congress because of the obvious factor that a war could not be successfully prosecuted unless it was backed by the American people. The first line of determination in a representative democracy, in a republic, is to have that determination made by the Congress of the United States. 
   We have seen the bitter lesson of Vietnam where a war could not be successfully prosecuted by the United States, where the public was not behind the war. 
   This amendment is being pressed today because there has been such a consistent erosion of the congressional authority to declare war. Korea was a war without congressional declaration. Vietnam was a war without a congressional declaration. There was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which some said justified the involvement of the United States in Vietnam--military involvement, the waging of a war. But on its face, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was not really sufficient. 
   The Gulf War, authorized by a resolution of both Houses of Congress, broke that chain of the erosion of congressional authority. In January of 1991, the Senate and the House of Representatives took up the issue on the use of force. After a spirited debate on this floor, characterized by the media as historic, in a 52-47 vote, the Senate authorized the use of force. Similarly, the House of Representatives authorized the use of force so that we had the appropriate congressional declaration on that important matter. 
   We have seen the erosion of congressional authority on many, many instances. I shall comment this afternoon on only a few. 
   We have seen the missile strikes at Iraq really being acts of war. In February of 1998, I argued on the floor of the Senate that there ought not to be missile strikes without authorization by the Congress of the United States. There may be justification for the President to exercise his authority as Commander in Chief, if there is an emergency situation, but where there is time for deliberation and debate and congressional action, that ought to be undertaken. 
   As the circumstances worked out, missile strikes did not occur in early 1998, after the indication that the President might authorize or undertake those missile strikes. 
   When that again became an apparent likelihood in November of 1998, I once more urged on the Senate floor that the President not undertake acts of war with missile strikes because there was ample time for consideration. There had been considerable talk about it, and that really should have been a congressional declaration. The President then did order missile strikes in December of 1998. 
   As we have seen with the events in Kosovo, the President of the United States made it plain in mid-March, at a news conference which he held on March 19 and at a meeting earlier that day with Members of Congress, that he intended to proceed with airstrikes. At a meeting with Members of Congress on March 23, the President was asked by a number of Members to come to Congress, and he did. The President sent a letter to Senator DASCHLE asking for authorization by the Senate. In a context where it was apparent that the airstrikes were going to be pursued with or without congressional authorization, and with the prestige of NATO on the line and with the prestige of the United States on the line, the Senate did authorize airstrikes, specifically excluding any use of ground troops. That authorization was by a vote of 58 to 41. 
   The House of Representatives had, on a prior vote, authorized U.S. forces as peacekeepers, but that was not really relevant to the issue of the airstrikes. Subsequently, the House of Representatives took up the issue of airstrikes, and by a tie vote of 213-213, the House of Representatives declined to authorize the airstrikes. That was at a time when the airstrikes were already underway.  
   I supported the Senate vote for the authorization of airstrikes. I talked to General Wesley Clark, the Supreme NATO Commander. One of the points which he made, which was telling on this Senator, was the morale of the troops. The airstrikes were an inevitability, as the President had determined, and it seemed to me that in that context we ought to give the authorization, again, as I say, expressly reserving the issue not to have ground forces used. 
   So on this state of the record, with the vote by the Senate and with the tie vote by the House of Representatives, you have airstrikes which may well, under international law, be concluded to be at variance with the Constitution of the United States, to put it politely and not to articulate any doctrine of illegality, at a time when my country is involved in those airstrikes. 
   But when we come to the issue of ground troops, which would be a major expansion and would constitute, beyond any question, the involvement of the United States in a war--although my own view is that the United States is conducting acts of war at the present time--the President ought to come to the Congress. 
   When the President met with a large group of Members on Wednesday, April 28, the issue of ground forces came up and the President made a commitment to those in attendance--and I was present--that he would not order ground troops into Kosovo without prior congressional authorization. He said he would honor that congressional authorization, reserving his prerogative as President to say that he didn't feel it indispensable constitutionally that he do so. However, he said that he would make that commitment, and he did make that commitment to a large number of Members of the House and Senate on April 28 of this year. He said, as a matter of good faith, that he would come to the Congress before authorizing the use of ground troops. 
   So, in a sense, it could be said that this amendment is duplicative. But I do believe, as a matter of adherence to the rule of law, that the commitment the President made ought to be memorialized in this defense authorization bill. I have, therefore, offered this amendment. 
   It is a complicated question as to the use of ground forces, whether they will ever be requested, because unanimity has to be obtained under the rules that govern NATO. Germany has already said they are opposed to the use of ground forces. But this is a matter that really ought to come back to the Congress. I am prepared--speaking for myself--to consider a Presidential request for authorization for the use of ground forces. However, before I would vote on the matter, or give my consent or vote in the affirmative, there are a great many questions I will want to have answered--questions that go to intelligence, questions that go to the specialty of the military planners. I would want to know what the likely resistance would be from the army of the former Yugoslavia. How much have our airstrikes degraded the capability of the Serbian army to defend? How many U.S. troops would be involved? I would like to know, to the extent possible, what the assessment of risk is. 
   When we talked about invading Japan before the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we had estimates as to how many would be wounded and how many fatalities there would be. So while not easy to pass judgment on something that could be at least estimated or approximated, I would want to know, very importantly, how many ground troops would be supplied by others in NATO. I would want to know what the projection was for the duration of the military engagement, and what the projection was after the military engagement was over. 
   These are only some of the questions that ought to be addressed. In 16 minutes, at 4 o'clock, members of the administration, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are scheduled to give another congressional briefing. Before we have a vote on a matter of this importance and this magnitude, those are some of the questions I think ought to be answered. That, in a very brief statement, constitutes the essence of the reasons why I have offered this amendment.

   Mr. SPECTER. I respond to my colleague from Illinois by saying that with a declaration of war where the Senate has to join under the Constitution and there could be a filibuster requiring 60 votes, the same rule applies. To get that authorization, either by declaration of war or resolution for the use of force, we have to comply with the rules to get an affirmative vote out of the Senate. Under those rules, if somebody filibusters, it requires 60 votes. So be it. That is the rule of the Senate and that is the way you have to proceed to get the authorization from the Senate.

   Mr. SPECTER. If it took hours and hours, I think those hours and hours would be well spent, at least by comparison to what the Senate does on so many matters. And we might convene a little earlier. We might adjourn a little later. We might work on Mondays and Fridays and maybe even on Saturdays. I would not be concerned about the hours which we would spend. 
   I think this Senator, after the 18 years and 5 months that I have been here, has given proper attention to the constitutional authority of the Congress to declare and/or involve the United States in war, or to the War Powers Act. This is a matter which first came to my attention in 1983 on the Lebanon matter when Senator Percy was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I had a debate, a colloquy, about whether Korea was a war, and Senator Percy said it was. Vietnam was a war. 
   At that time, I undertook to draft a complex complaint trying to get the acquiescence of the President--President Reagan was in the White House at that time--which Senator Baker undertook to see if we could have a judicial determination as to the constitutionality of the War Powers Act. 
   It is true, as the Senator from Virginia says, that Presidents have always denied it. They have denied it in complying with it. They send over the notice called for under the act, and then they put in a disclaimer. 
   But I think the War Powers Act has had a profoundly beneficial effect, because Presidents have complied with it even while denying it. 
   But I think it is high time that Congress stood up on its hind legs and said we are not going to be involved in wars unless Congress authorizes them.

   Mr. SPECTER. The arguments which you have made stem from your stated position that the President really ought to have congressional authorization to use force. If the legislative approach is not to require him to come to Congress before the use of force, but to await his using force, then are we not really in a situation where we face the impossible predicament of seeking to cut off funds from the middle of a military operation which is untenable? Or to articulate the question more precisely: What would you suggest as a way to accomplish the constitutional principle you agree with, that only the Congress has the authority to authorize the use of force, with the current circumstances?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would disagree with the statement of my colleague from Delaware that we say, ``we do not trust you, Mr. President,'' by noting that the President might change his mind. He has been known to do that. Other Presidents have, and even the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Pennsylvania have been known to change their minds. 
   The other concern is that if you have it on a personal basis, in a letter, it really does not have the force of law. And we are consistently moving in the Congress to where there has been an executive order, which is a good bit more formal than the letter that the Senator from Delaware refers to, to make sure that it is governed by law as opposed to a personal commitment or what might be said. 
   But let me articulate a question in a different context. 
   Aside, hypothetically, absent a letter, what would the legislative approach be to limit a President from exercising his powers as Commander in Chief short of cutting off funds once he has already done so? It seems to me that we have a choice. We can either say in advance: You may not do it unless you have our prior approval; or say nothing once the President uses force, and then cut off the funds, which appears to me to be untenable. 
   Is there a third alternative?

   Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Delaware has mentioned a third option to the two I suggested. 
   The third option is for us to send a resolution saying don't do it unless we authorize it, but not binding him. Saying that would certainly impose a political restraint on the President--not doing it, in the face of our requesting him not to without our prior authorization. I understand his third alternative, but I do not draw much solace from it, just as a matter of my own response.

   Mr. SPECTER. My time is running out. Let me finish my statement. Then you have quite a bit of time left. Let me just finish the thought. 
   I do not think it goes far enough to say: We request that you not do it unless we give you prior authorization. Because that kind of a gentle suggestion--and I can understand the gentility of my colleague from Delaware--would not go very far, I think, with this President or might not go very far with the Senator from Delaware or would not predetermine what the Senator from Pennsylvania would do. 
   When the Senator from Delaware talks about the President flying in the face of a cutoff of funds, I think that the President would be loath to do that. I think there he might really get into the Boland amendment or challenging the Congress on the power of the purse. 
   The Presidents have gotten away with disregarding the congressional mandate that only Congress can declare war. They have gotten away with it for a long time. It has been eroded. Presidents feel comfortable in doing that. But if the Congress said: No funds may be used, as this amendment does--maybe it needs to be a little tighter here or there--I think the President would proceed at his peril to violate that expressed constitutional authority in Congress to control the power of the purse. 
   I am very much interested in my colleague's response, but I hope it will be on his time.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for those comments. I think it all boils down to whether the President would feel compelled by a political situation, a statement by Congress, to not send in ground troops. 
   I acknowledged in my opening comments that he had made that commitment, which I heard and spoke about, on April 28. But I believe we ought to be bound by the rule of law, not be dependent upon a change of mind by the President, and memorialize it in this statute. Congress ought to assert its authority to declare war and have the United States engaged in war and to do it with the force of law with this kind of an amendment, perhaps somewhat modified. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to the comments of the Senator from Michigan, every single objection and argument he has raised applies equally to the President's commitment by letter to come to the Congress before he would use ground forces. 
   When he says it would be the worst signal to Milosevic, the President gave that signal personally when he said it gives Milosevic advance notice. That is exactly what the President would be doing in coming to Congress. When he says there could be no intelligence or reconnaissance, that is exactly what would happen by the President's commitment. When he says it would preclude a preemptive strike, that is exactly what the President has done. When he says it puts at risk U.S. military personnel, that is precisely what the President has done. 
   When they talk about a veto, it is the same old threat--senior advisers threatening to veto. I think this may be a better amendment than I had originally contemplated. 
   I yield the floor.

It goes far short of the kind of commitment that has been represented--honestly represented. But the letter says in pertinent part: ``I can assure you  that I will fully consult with the Congress'', which doesn't amount to a whole lot. And then another line, ``I would ask for congressional support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo into a nonpermissive environment''. 
   The language of support here again goes far short of committing to congressional authorization such as is contained in this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides, simply stated, that there shall be no funds expended for ground forces in Yugoslavia, in Kosovo, unless specifically authorized by the Congress. 
   This amendment is designed to uphold the Constitution of the United States, which grants the exclusive authority to declare war 
   to the Congress of the United States. Regrettably, there has been a significant erosion of this constitutional authority, as Presidents have taken over this power without having the Congress stand up. The one place where the Congress clearly has authority to determine military action is by controlling the purse strings. This amendment goes to the heart of that issue by prohibiting that spending. 
   It has been a lively and spirited debate. Now we will have an opportunity to say whether the Senate will seek to uphold the Constitution and whether the Senate will seek to uphold its own institutional authority--the institutional authority of the Congress to determine whether the United States should be involved in war. 
   A few of the problems which have been raised have been clarified. The amendment has been modified, and I ask that it formally be approved with the concurrence of the managers.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the main argument against this amendment has been that the President has said that he would come to Congress in advance of deploying ground troops. He made that commitment in a meeting at the White House on April 28. Then he sent a letter, which is substantially equivocal, saying that he will fully consult with the Congress, and that he would ask for congressional support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo, into a nonpermissive environment. 
   That doesn't go far enough. 
   The distinguished chairman has reported that the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have confirmed that there would be congressional authorization. 
   That doesn't go far enough. 
   We are a government of laws--not a government of men. And minds may be changed. We ought to be sure we have this nailed down. 
   This amendment is entirely consistent with what the Senate has heretofore done--58 to 41 to authorize air strikes but no ground forces. Seventy-seven Senators voted not to grant the President authority to use whatever force he chose. To remain consistent, those 77 Senators would have to say, we are not going to allow you to use ground forces unless you come to us for approval, just as we said we will not allow you to use whatever force you choose, in effect, without coming to us for prior approval. Consistency may be the hobgoblin of small minds, but consistency and the institutional prerogatives of the Congress and the Senate call for an affirmative vote, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   It is a bad signal to America to tell the Country that the Congress is delegating its authority to involve this Nation in war to the President. We don't have the authority to delegate our constitutional authority. Our job is to analyze the facts and let the President come to us to state a case for the use of ground forces. I am prepared to listen. But, on this record, we ought to maintain the institutional authority of Congress and uphold the Constitution.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which will direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a national cemetery in the Pittsburgh area of Western Pennsylvania. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' affairs, I make it my responsibility to see that our nation's veterans are cared for after serving honorably in the Armed Forces. Part of this care involves honoring the memory of their service upon death. Our nation's veterans are an aging population. At present, 46% of the area's veterans population is over age 65. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has estimated that by the year 2008, the number of veterans' deaths will peak and remain at a high level for years afterward. To anticipate the increased demand for burial space and to accommodate family and friends wanting nearby cemeteries at which to honor and remember their loved ones, the Congress and VA must act now. 
   The legislation that I introduce today will alleviate the long overdue wait for a national cemetery which the veterans in the western Pennsylvania area have had to endure. Such a cemetery is necessary due to the over 750,000 veterans who reside in the area, including veterans in parts of the neighboring states of Ohio, Maryland, and West Virginia. I should also point out that Pennsylvania, a state with the fifth highest veteran population in the country, has only one national cemetery within its borders open for new burials. This cemetery, at Indiantown Gap, serves veterans in the eastern portion of the Commonwealth and is more than 225 miles from Pittsburgh.  
   In 1987, VA ranked the Pittsburgh-area among the top ten population centers most in need of a national cemetery. In 1991, VA began the process of cemetery site-selection and Congress appropriated $250,000 for an Environmental Impact Statement. Four potential sites were identified in the Pittsburgh area. Despite this headway, construction on a national cemetery never commenced. 
   The high veteran population of this region has waited far too long to see the creation of this national cemetery. Our nation's veterans, having given so much for us, deserve a proper burial site in the proximity of their homes. Veterans elsewhere around this country take for granted the availability of a nearby national cemetery. If passed, this legislation will ensure that what began over a decade ago will now become reality.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I submit a concurrent resolution which would express the Sense of the Congress that the third Monday in April be designated ``In Memory Day.'' In Memory Day will be a time for family and friends to gather and commemorate the supreme sacrifice made by their loved ones as their names are read from the In Memory Honor Roll at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as was done most recently on April 19, 1999. I feel this to be a small yet fitting tribute to those whose lives were ultimately claimed by the war in Vietnam. 
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a solemn reminder that the defense of liberty is not without loss. The 58,214 servicemembers who gave their lives in Vietnam will forever be memorialized in a most fitting manner. Their names, inscribed in granite walls, symbolize the reality that our nation's military personnel protects America behind walls built with the blood of patriots. We must keep them in our memory always. 
   Not all of those who died, however, are commemorated on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Unaccounted for are those succumbed to the ravages of psychological wounds upon their return home. Unaccounted for are all those who died after war's end, yet whose deaths were intrinsically linked to wartime service. Their family members and loved ones have no wall to go to; no names to touch; no memorial to share. 
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund (VVMF) runs an ``In Memory Program'' to honor these silent fallen. As part of this program, the VVMF keeps an ``In Memory Honor Roll'' to commemorate those who served and  died prematurely, but whose deaths do not fit the parameters for inclusion upon the Wall. It it time for Congress to do its part in honoring these brave soldiers and their families.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which has been submitted provides for the prosecution of war criminals in Kosovo, arising out of the atrocities and war crimes which have been so blatantly committed in Kosovo. 
   The somewhat polite term of ``ethnic cleansing'' has been used to describe these atrocities. But they are, in effect, mass murders and executions committed by the Serbian forces against the people of Kosovo. We have, to the credit of the civilized world, established a War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The establishment of this War Crimes Tribunal to prosecute crimes in the former Yugoslavia has already returned 84 indictments and the resulting conviction of some 8 criminals there. 
   The importance of establishing the rule of law is something that may be the most important legacy that will come out of the Bosnian war and the war in Kosovo, and hopefully will be embodied in a permanent international criminal court--which will remain for another day. Those resolutions have been introduced and pressed by a number of Senators, including Senator DODD and myself and others. But in Bosnia, we saw the war crimes and we have seen very strenuous activity by the War Crimes Tribunal in the 84 indictments and in the 8 convictions. 
   Now we have seen ethnic cleansing at a high level. We have seen acts of violence which go to the very top of the Serbian-Yugoslavian Government, right to the doorstep of President Milosevic himself. Although he is not named in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it is plain that the kind of atrocities which have been carried out could only be carried out by his order, at least with his knowledge and, at the very minimum, with his acquiescence--any of which is sufficient to establish criminal culpability for those war crimes. 
   Recently, Justice Louise Arbour visited the United States. On April 30, she met with Senator LANDRIEU, other Senators, and myself, and expressed the need for adequate financing for the investigations. The administration had requested funding of some $5 million. On the emergency supplemental which passed both Houses of Congress last week, up to an additional $13 million was added, for a total of $18 million, which was the sum requested by Justice Arbour. 
   At that time, she made a plea that the NATO forces or the IFOR forces undertake activity to arrest high-level indictees who are at large, referring specifically to Karadzic, whose whereabouts has been identified in the French Quarter, and who could be taken into custody. 
   Mladic, the other principal indictee, is said to be in Belgrade and it might require an invasion to apprehend and take him into custody. But at least as to the arrest of Karadzic, that could be accomplished. 
   Justice Arbour also stated there were other high-ranking officials for whom sealed indictments had been obtained. Those sealed indictments were in the hands of military authorities, and those individuals, too, could be taken into custody. 
   Justice Arbour expressed the judgment that if these war criminals, alleged war criminals--these individuals indicted on charges of war crimes, to be specific--were taken into custody, then she believed it could have a profound effect on the 
   subordinates, on perhaps Milosevic himself or certainly on the subordinates immediately under Milosevic. 
   It is our hope this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will impel the authorities to apprehend those individuals. 
   I shall not go through the whereas clauses, setting forth the foundation for the U.N. action on establishing the War Crimes Tribunal or the atrocities themselves, but focusing for just a minute on the five clauses following the resolution: 
   First, that the United States, in coordination with the United Nations, supply sufficient funds for the investigation of the allegations of the atrocities and war crimes committed in Kosovo. 
   That can be accomplished with the $18 million appropriated by the United States and appropriations by other responsible nations. 
   Second, that the United States, through its intelligence services, should provide all cooperation in the gathering of evidence to secure the indictments of those responsible for war crimes. 
   Third, that where the evidence warrants indictment, those indictments will be brought for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, regardless of the position of the indictees within the Serbian leadership. 
   This is directed at President Milosevic himself.  
   Fourth, that the United Nations and all nations have an obligation to honor the warrants issued by the War Crimes Tribunal, and the United States and other responsible nations should use all appropriate means to apprehend the war criminals already under indictments. 
   That refers to Karadzic, Mladic, and the others under sealed indictments as previously mentioned, having been identified by Justice Arbour. 
   Fifth, NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals for crimes committed during operations in Kosovo. 
   If there is any inclination, as part of a plea bargain on any of the negotiations, to spare President Milosevic or other high-ranking officials, that should be rejected as part of the diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Kosovo if such a diplomatic resolution should be obtained. 
   Last Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testified before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations, a committee of which I am a member. She was questioned at that time and stated that the United States was not negotiating with Milosevic. 
   Well, in effect, an indirect negotiation is not a whole lot different. But it may be--and I made this statement at the time of the hearing--that the line could be drawn so that the United States would maintain its position that it would not be a party to any settlement which, by way of a plea bargain, gave immunity or absolved Milosevic or any other high-ranking diplomatic official or anyone from responsibility for the war crimes warranted by indictments and warranted by the evidence. 
   I commend Senator LANDRIEU for her leadership on this important resolution, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding me the time. 
   I support the waiver on the point of order. The conference committee labored extensively and diligently to come up with the bill that is on the floor at the present time. It was a tough, contentious, argumentative conference. While not perfect, we conferees did the very best we could. At some points on Wednesday night of last week, it looked a little like ``Saturday Night Live,'' except it was Wednesday. C-SPAN was in the conference room recording and videocasting across the country to the few who might have been inclined to watch. 
   Having been a party to that conference and having struggled through the issues of the necessity for military spending and the emergency programs that are involved in Hurricane Mitch and the tragedies in Oklahoma and Kansas--Kansas being my native State --the conference committee did the very best it could. 
   This bill ought to be enacted in toto. Since that requires a waiver initially, that ought to be undertaken. 
   We are really looking at broader, complex issues as we face the appropriations process for fiscal year 2000. 
   We have recently seen the allocations in the House of Representatives. The allocations in the Senate are portending for very, very severe cuts. 
   I chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services. The President's budget is slightly in excess of $90 billion. The allocation preliminarily marked up for my subcommittee is $80 billion. If that is to happen, we are going to have some really drastic, drastic cuts, cuts which the American people are going to have to evaluate as they are making their wishes known in our representative democracy to the Members of the House and Senate. 
   We have budget caps. I would like to live within those budget caps. But to do that, we are going to be looking at these kinds of reductions in spending: 
   On Safe and Drug-Free Schools, there would be a cut of $66 million from the Drug and Violence Prevention Program. 
   Here we are today on a juvenile crime bill where we are trying to deal with the problems of juvenile crime, and at the same time we are looking at a budget which is going to cut funding of $66 million from the guts of that kind of a program--drug and violence prevention. 
   We are looking at cuts on the Job Corps of $150 million from a $1.3 billion program. 
   When we talk about the Job Corps, here again we are talking about dealing with juveniles who may have gone astray. 
   If you have a juvenile offender without a trade or a skill, a functional illiterate who leaves prison, that individual is going to go back to a life of crime, and is going to get the first gun he can put his hands on. And here we are talking about an enormous cut in the JOBS Program, which is designed specifically against that problem. 
   We have enormous cuts in child care--$131 million in our efforts to whip the welfare program and send welfare mothers to work. Child care is indispensable. 
   Special education--a favorite of all Senators--would be cut by $480 million. 
   The National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal Government, perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government--instead of having a $2 billion increase, which the Senate said we ought to have in the sense of the Senate, the National Institutes of Health would be reduced by $1.8 billion, which would result in approximately 6000 fewer grants at a time when medical research is on the verge of solving enormous problems of Parkinson's with the new stem cells estimated within the 5- to 10-year range.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Some of those who were called to order may be the ones who ought to be listening to what needs to happen in our appropriations process if we are to achieve the goals of our lofty rhetoric. 
   But interrupting, the juvenile violence bill on the culture of violence  we have programs which are designed to deal with that. The way we are heading, we are going to be cutting the heart out of the precise programs intended to deal with that culture of violence. 
   These are issues which I hope the American people will understand so that their views may be felt in our representative democracy. 
   We would all like to stay within the caps. We would all like to economize. But when we take a look at a $10 billion cut which hits labor, safety programs, and health and education, those are matters which have to be decided by this body reflecting the views of our constituency. 
   I again thank the chairman for yielding the time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding me the time and for submitting this amendment, which I have cosponsored. I believe that police on the street constitute a very significant deterrent effect--and that the 95,000 or 100,000 police who have been added across America have been a factor in reducing the crime rate--which we have noted in the past several years. I think that is one factor. 
   The additional prison space, the fact that more men and women are incarcerated--regrettably, but necessarily--I think has been a contributing factor. The armed career criminal bill, which provides for a sentence for 15 years to life for those found in possession of a gun and have committed three or more serious offenses has been a significant contributing factor. 
   I would like to offer a comment or two about the bill. I compliment Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY, the managers of the bill, for the work they have done. I am hopeful that within the authorized portions of this bill comes to the appropriations process, there will be an even 50/50 split on measures designed for prosecution and incarceration, contrasted with measures for rehabilitation, job training, and education. 
   When we deal with juvenile offenders, we deal with a category of offenders who will one day get out. I believe--based on the experience I had being district attorney of Philadelphia for 8 years where the principal job was prosecution, tough sentences for tough criminals, and dealing with career criminals--that when we deal with offenders who are going to be released, we ought to have rehabilitation. It is no surprise when a functional illiterate, without a trade or a skill, leaves incarceration will go back to a life of crime. It is not only in the interest of the individual to have rehabilitation, but also in the interest of law-abiding citizens to avoid having that individual become a repeater. 
   The same thing, candidly, applies to first and second offenders. Where we have a career criminal--somebody who has three or more major offenses--then I think life imprisonment and throwing away the key is the appropriate consequence. When we deal with juveniles, we ought to be aware of the so-called seamless web, to apply 50 percent of the funding which, of course, comes to the attention of the appropriators. I considered submitting an amendment which would have called for a 50/50 split between the tough aspect of prosecution and incarceration contrasted with rehabilitation, literacy training, and job training. I decided not to do that since it really is within the function of the appropriators. 
   I have a comment on the vote in the Senate to defeat the provision that was offered as an amendment yesterday. This would have imposed, in this bill, a mandatory requirement on the States that all those 14 years and older be tried as adults on a category of serious offenses. That was defeated soundly. A majority of Republicans voted against it, and I voted against it, and I was glad to see that amendment rejected on a number of grounds. One is that we ought not to be dictating to the States how they construct their juvenile justice system. And we ought not to condition Federal funding, which would be the stick to dictate the States as to how they operate. 
   The other concern I had was that being tough on crime is very, very important, but there are a lot of variations on juveniles. The theory of the juvenile court was to treat an adjudication of delinquency as those under 18. There is ample discretion in the juvenile court to have a juvenile tried as an adult for a serious offense. That flexibility ought to be left to the juvenile courts, and that flexibility and that determination ought to be left to the States. 
   Overall, I think this bill will be a step forward. The legislation that has been enacted with respect to guns, I think, has to be viewed as only a part of the picture. My own reluctance on the restrictions on guns has come from the fact that there has 
   not been an appropriate response by the courts on tough sentences for tough criminals. 
   There are three layers that we have to attack on this line. I have discussed two. One is the life sentences and the long periods of incarceration for career criminals. Second, is realistic rehabilitation for juveniles and other offenders  who will be released from jail. Third, is the violence that has gripped America--juvenile violence especially. 
   After Littleton, CO, I called Dr. Koop, former Surgeon General, who commented to me that he had--as early as 1982--filed a report identifying juvenile violence as a medical problem. I conferred with Surgeon General Satcher on the issue. We are trying to structure hearings on the Appropriations subcommittee I chair on health and human services which funds the Office of Surgeon General. Those three lines, I think, have to be studied very closely--the sentencing for career criminals and rehabilitation for those who will be released and an effort to understand and try to deal with the culture of violence we have in our society today. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Delaware. I yield the floor, releasing the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I have introduced a major piece of veterans legislation, the proposed Veterans Benefits Act of 1999. This bill is a so-called omnibus measure which will serve as the basis, and the platform, for much of the legislative work to be accomplished this year by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   In the past, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has considered bills on a more piecemeal basis than is reflected in the larger bill that I have introduced today. 
   In times past, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has come to the Senate floor with numerous, separate bills to address the various matters that the committee typically faces: annual cost-of-living adjustments, reauthorizations of ``sunsetting'' programs and  authorities, medical care reforms, non-medical benefits programs improvements, and the like. With the bill I have introduced today, I propose that such matters be folded into a single bill. That bill, then, will be the central focus of a major hearing. 
   At that hearing, the committee will have the opportunity to hear the views of the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and the Army; other senior VA officials, including the VA Under Secretaries who are responsible for VA's major operating entities; the major veterans service organizations (The American Legion, the VFW, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS); unions representing the rank and file of VA employees; and, finally, associations representing VA's professional cadre of physicians, dentists, and nurses. 
   By bringing all of the major issues to the fore at one time, and by bringing all of the interested parties together into one room at one time, I believe that the committee will be better positioned to advance this year's legislative agenda in an organized and systematic manner. Such an approach will not necessarily ease the work of the committee, or this body. It will, however, facilitate the placing of issues and initiatives into some order of priority. 
   The need to recognize priorities has characterized the committee's approach to its work this year. During the first half of this year, the committee has devoted its attention almost entirely on the proposed fiscal year 2000 budget. As this body recognized when it ordered an increase in spending caps on veterans account spending in the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution, the Administration's proposal to keep the VA's health care budget flat for the fourth straight year was clearly unacceptable. Congress ordered an increase of approximately 10 percent in that budget--an action that I, and the committee's ranking minority member, Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER, were urging as early as last fall. We now must proceed through the appropriations process--a process that the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the veterans service organizations, will watch very closely. 
   Having heretofore focused principally on the budget, the committee will now turn to its authorizing business. The bill I introduced today opens, at title I, with the committee's first priority: the granting of cost-of-living adjustments to the cash benefits paid monthly by VA in the form of compensation to the 2.3 million veterans who have suffered service-connected disabilities, and benefits for 320,000 surviving spouses and children of veterans who have died in military service or due to service-related injuries and illnesses. Those who are disabled due to 
   service rely on these benefits. They surely merit cost-of-living adjustments. 
   My bill, secondly, proposes to increase by 13.6% the most valuable ``readjustment'' benefit that is enjoyed--and earned--by the Nation's young veterans: their Montgomery GI bill educational assistance benefits. The ``blue ribbon'' Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance made a number of recommendations on this point. Most notably, it cited the fact that, unlike times past, veterans' educational assistance benefits no longer come close to affording the veteran an opportunity to return to school on a full time basis after service. The Commission has recommended that, for new enlistees, VA pay full tuition benefits and, in addition, pay an allowance for books and fees and, finally, a monthly living stipend. The committee will consider this proposal further. In the meantime, however, it is appropriate for the committee to address what it might do to make higher education and other training opportunities available to persons who are in the service today. My bill would increase their benefits in recognition of the increased costs of education. 
   In addition, this bill would make needed changes in statutory authorities under which VA health care is provided. At the outset, I note that the single largest unmet medical need faced by the World War II/Korea generation of veterans is quality long-term care. In addition to providing hospital care and, increasingly, outpatient-based clinical care, VA provides some nursing home care and other types of long term care. But VA hardly scratches the surface of demand for such care. The solution, of course, is funding--funding that has been surely deficient. 
   VA funding problems must be addressed by the Appropriate Committee, a committee on which I am proud to serve. However, the authorizing committee, which I am proud to chair, has its role to play too. The authorizing committee can free VA from unnecessary legal strictures which impede its efficient delivery of care. Many such impediments were eliminated by recent ``eligibility reform'' legislation. Some, however, remain. 
   For example, VA is now authorized to provide adult day health care services, services which help the veteran--and the taxpayer--by keeping potential patients out of hospitals and nursing homes. It can do so, however, only if the veteran in question was, first, a hospital or nursing home patient. Thus, VA caregivers have an incentive to hospitalize people so that they will be authorized to provide the type of care that will allow the patient to avoid hospitalization. To my way of thinking, this makes no sense. 
   Similarly, VA is authorized to provide ``respite care,'' that is, short term care which frees the day-to-day care giver, typically an aging spouse, to attend to his or her needs. But VA can do so only within the four walls of a VA medical facility. Often, it is more effieient--and surely it is more convenient from the patient's and spouse's standpoint--for a respite care provider to go to the home of the patient, as opposed to requiring the patient to be brought into the hospital or long term care center. But VA is precluded by statute from providing respite care in the veteran's home, even when it is clearly in VA's and the patient's interests for it to do so. This, too, makes no sense to me. The bill I have introduced today would clear away these two impediments to the efficient delivery of VA care. Further, it would reauthorize current programs which have proved their worth. 
   In the veterans benefits arena, one sensitive matter is now ripe for action. It is time, I think, for clear standards to be established for eligibility for burial in Arlington National Cemetery. And they should be set by Congress. 
   Remarkably, standards governing eligibility for burial in Arlington have never been put into place by statute. Rather, they are purely a product of administrative fiat. Indeed, in one of the most highly sensitive areas--the granting of ``waivers'' to allow the burial of distinguished persons who are not otherwise eligible for burial in Arlington--there has never even been a formal rulemaking to guide cemetery officials. Rather, the granting of waivers has evolved on a purely customary, and ad hoc, basis. 
   Dealing with waiver requests on an ad hoc basis gives rise, at best, to suspicion of improper influence. At worst, if fans fears of outright abuse of power. Now, I will not rehash a recent case where it was alleged--I think inaccurately--that Arlington burial rights were ``sold'' to a political contributor. Suffice it to say, however, that when it comes to the most sacred of grounds, Arlington National Cemetery, there can be no suggestion whatsoever of improper influence. Surely, there are some honors that no amount of money or level of influence can buy. Perpetual rest in Arlington is clearly one of those honors. 
   Mr. President, I could go on at considerable length, but many provisions of this bill speak for themselves. As I have noted, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has not yet had hearings on these specific legislative proposals. Accordingly, they are still works in progress. But they are works in progress that I intend to advance sooner rather than later, by this summer at the latest. The Nation's veterans deserve that kind of attention, and they are getting it from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment the Palestinian Authority for not acting unilaterally to declare statehood. Chairman Yasser Arafat visited me on March 23, and I urged him at that time not to make a unilateral declaration of statehood. He then said to me that when the Palestinian Authority had changed its charter, as it was urged to do so by an amendment introduced by Senator SHELBY and myself some years ago, that there was no credit given for that. I said there should have been credit given. And Chairman Arafat asked if they did not make the unilateral declaration if there would be some acknowledgment of that move. I said I would take the floor when May 4 came, which was the date targeted--that is today--and there was no unilateral declaration of statehood. And there has been none. 
   I congratulate the Palestinian Authority for its restraint. That is a matter which ought to be negotiated under the terms of the Oslo agreement. Chairman Arafat asked me if I would put it in writing that I would make the statement. And I said I would; and I did.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation, the Stadium Financing and Franchise Relocation Act of 1999, which is designed to respond to the need for stabilizing major league baseball and football franchises located in metropolitan areas of the United States. 
   I have long been concerned with the pressure put upon communities by baseball and football clubs seeking new playing facilities, where, with the gun to their heads of the team's overt or tacit threat to move to another city, government leaders feel compelled to have taxpayers finance a lion's share of ballpark and stadium construction costs. As those costs rise--a present state-of-the-art new facility goes for close to $300 million--those pressures have intensified. 
   Professional sports teams are entrusted with a public interest. The movement of the Dodgers from Brooklyn, which broke the hearts of millions of their Flatbush followers, was the start of pirating of sports franchises in America, and should never have been allowed. It was accompanied, of course, by the flight of the Giants from New York to San Francisco. 
   Since then, the matter has proliferated to an almost absurd degree. It is hard to understand why the taxpayers of Maryland and Baltimore had to be in a bidding contest for the Cleveland Browns, when Baltimore should have had its own team, the Colts, instead of the Colts moving out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to go to Indianapolis. 
   I have participated in America's love affair with sports since I was a youngster in Wichita, Kansas, reading the box scores in the Wichita Eagle every morning because of my love and passion for baseball. I have been attending Phillies and Eagles games, and, when I can, Pirates and Steelers games, because of my love for each of these sports. They are tremendously exciting. 
   Basically, it was unfair for the old Browns to have been taken out of Cleveland, but now I am glad to hail the arrival of the new Browns, even though it was at great cost to the taxpayers, and deprived the Eagles of a well-earned first overall draft pick. 
   The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned in recent years. Jeffrey Lurie bought the Philadelphia Eagles in 1995 for a then-high price of $185 million. Last year, the successful bidder for an expansion NFL franchise in Cleveland paid $530 million. The bidding for the Washington Redskins franchise (including Cooke Stadium) has surpassed $800 million. There also seems to be no limit to the amount of money available to club owners when it comes to paying players--witness Mike Piazza's signing last year of a $91 million ten-year contract with the New York Mets. 
   New ballparks and stadiums clearly provide an enhancement to the culture and tax base of communities. That said, however, there is also no doubt that having a new ballpark or stadium significantly increases the value of a sports franchise for its owner. In December, 1998, Forbes Magazine estimated the net worth of the nation's professional sports teams. Seven of the top ten valued baseball franchises and eight of the top ten valued football franchises were in cities with ballparks and stadiums built or approved to be built since 1990. 
   In January, 1999, the Philadelphia Inquirer quoted Jeffrey Stein, managing director of McDonald Investments, a Cleveland brokerage house, who said: ``New stadiums, in and of themselves, significantly enhance the value of a team.'' He cited the Cleveland Indians Baseball Club as an example. In the December, 1998, Forbes article, the value of that team, which now plays in beautiful new Jacobs Field, was listed as $322 million, the third highest in baseball. In 
   1986, the Indians had been purchased for $35 million. In 1993, the last year the Indians played at Cleveland Stadium, the team had revenues of $54.1 million. Its 1997 revenues were $140 million. 
   The value of these sports franchises to a community is reflected in the astronomical broadcast rights fees the sports leagues command in the U.S. marketplace. Ten years ago, the National Football League received $970 million a year for its network television rights. The NFL now receives three times that amount, through contracts with TV and cable networks that pay the League $17.6 billion for its TV rights over an 8-year period commencing with the 1998 season, an average of $2.2 billion per year, while Major  League Baseball annually derives more than $400 million from this source. These revenues are shared by the clubs and their players. 
   One would think some of that giant revenue windfall might trickle down and be used to help finance new ballparks and stadiums, which produce greatly enhanced revenues for team owners, yet it seems the more TV money a league makes, the more its clubs demand from local taxpayers to fund the construction of new playing facilities. The irony of this is that none of these huge TV revenues would accrue to the clubs and their players if the leagues did not have the benefit of an antitrust exemption permitting clubs to pool their TV rights. 
   In the interest of fairness, I believe the leagues should, with a small portion of these TV revenues, assist local communities in the financing of new playing facilities for the leagues' clubs, as a condition of their continuing to receive the antitrust exemption which permits pooling of TV rights. 
   I also believe the leagues should have an antitrust exemption which permits them to deny a club's request to move, thus minimizing the implied threat to move which has characteristically accompanied demands upon local government for a new ballpark or stadium. 
   Both these objectives are met by the legislation I am offering today. It will clarify the broadcast antitrust exemption given to sports leagues and give the National Football League and Major League Baseball an opportunity to continue to receive it by agreeing to place 10% of their network TV revenues into a trust fund to be used to help finance construction or renovation of ballparks and stadiums for use by their teams. Trust fund revenues will be restricted to such use and will be excluded from the league's gross receipts which are distributed to clubs and players. 
   Money from the trust fund will be provided to finance up to one-half the cost of construction or renovation of ballparks and stadiums on a matching fund basis, conditioned upon the local government's agreement to provide at least one dollar of financing for every two dollars to be provided from the trust fund. 
   Thus, for example, if the cost of constructing a new stadium for the Philadelphia Eagles, or for the Pittsburgh Steelers, were $280 million, the National Football League would be obliged to provide $140 million to each such project, on condition that the city and state, combined, provided at least $70 million. Ideally, the League would pay one-half the cost out of the trust fund and the other half would be financed by the club owner and the local government. 
   The legislation will also enlarge the antitrust exemption given to baseball, basketball, football, and hockey leagues to permit those leagues to deny a member club's request to move its franchise to a different city. 
   My bill will take effect on the date of its passage, and will apply to all network TV revenues thereafter received by the leagues, and to all new ballpark and stadium facilities not yet constructed, such as the construction now underway in Cleveland and Pittsburgh. 
   I have sought recognition today to introduce the Stadium Financing and Franchise Relocation Act of 1999. This legislation would require that the National Football League and Major League Baseball act to provide financing for 50 percent of new stadium construction costs, and that the National Football League be given a limited antitrust exemption to regulate franchise moves. 
   This legislation is necessary because baseball and football have for too long had a public-be-damned attitude. At the present time, major league sports is out of control on franchise moves for football teams and the demands upon cities and states for exorbitant construction costs is a form of legalized extortion in major league sports. 
   The National Football League has a multi-year television contract for $17.6 billion which it enjoys by virtue of a special status and antitrust exemption which they have for revenue sharing or else they could not collect television receipts of $17 billion. But, at the same time, when they are asked to step forward and help with stadium construction costs, which are minimal compared to their television receipts, they put one community in competition with another community. A franchise, being what it is, leaves a city like Hartford and a state like Connecticut to offer $375 million to lure the Patriots from Massachusetts to Connecticut. 
   This is a problem which is particularly acute for my State, Pennsylvania, which is now looking at the construction of four new stadiums. Two are now under construction in western Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh for the Pirates and the Steelers--and two more are being sought in eastern Pennsylvania for the Phillies and for the Eagles. It is a $1 billion price tag which we are looking at now, which is significant for public funding, especially in a context where our schools are under funded, where our housing is in need of assistance, where we need funds for child assistance, where we need funds for transition from welfare to work, where we need funds for highways, and for so many other important matters. But, understandably, a NFL franchise is a very major matter for the prestige of a city and also for the economy of a city. And a major league baseball franchise, similarly, is a major matter for the economy and the prestige of a city. 
   You have a situation, for example, where the Colts left Baltimore in the middle of the night for Indianapolis. Then there was a bidding war for the Browns, which left Cleveland to go to Baltimore at an enormous cost to the taxpayers of Maryland and Baltimore. Indianapolis ought to have a football team, but they ought not to have Baltimore's football team. Similarly, Cleveland ought to be able to retain the Browns. It has been a matter of great pride for Cleveland for many, many years. 
   The start occurred in 1958 when the Dodgers left Brooklyn to go to Los Angeles. Brooklyn had no more precious possession than ``Dem Bums,'' the Dodgers. And I recall as a youngster the 1941 World Series, Mickey Owens' famous fumble, dropping of the third strike, and the tremendous tradition that the Dodgers had with Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese in the Pennant races. And off they went to Los Angeles. Los Angeles should have had a baseball team, but not Brooklyn's baseball team. And they had a twofer, they took the Giants out of New York and put them in San Francisco at the same time. 
   Baseball has had an opportunity, to some extent, to control franchise moves because baseball has an unlimited antitrust exemption. And they have it in a very curious, illogical way. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes ruled in the 1920s that baseball was a sport and not involved in interstate commerce and therefore exempt. That has been an item which has been out of touch with reality for a long time. Justice Blackmun said baseball was a big business, in a Supreme Court decision, and involved in interstate commerce. But since it had been unregulated with the antitrust exemption for so long, it has been left to Congress to make a change. 
   It may be that we ought to make a change and take away the antitrust exemption from baseball generally. Baseball fiercely resists any contribution to stadium construction costs--fiercely resists with a lobbying campaign, which is now underway, of great intensity. I will not list the cosponsors who have prospectively dropped off this bill because of that lobbying. 
   I am introducing this bill on behalf of Senator HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator BIDEN, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and myself. We had a hearing in the Antitrust Subcommittee of Judiciary where I serve, and I asked the head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to take a look at revoking baseball's antitrust exemption totally. Baseball has not been responsible in dealing with salary caps and with revenue sharing. So there would be some equality and some parity for cities like Pittsburgh, small cities, where you have the financial power of the New York Yankees dominating the league, buying up all the players; where you have Mr. Murdoch acquiring the Dodgers for a giant price in connection with his satellite ideas and with television revenues and the superstation which Atlanta now has. 
   Here you have a goose which is laying a golden egg and baseball has not  faced up to fairness in changing its approach to 
   dealing with the realities of the market and has not undertaken the salary caps and the revenue sharing necessary to stabilize baseball. 
   So this bill goes, to a limited extent, on conditioning baseball's continuation of its antitrust exemption to helping with stadium construction costs. I want them to help build a stadium for the Philadelphia Phillies. I want them to help on the construction costs for the Pittsburgh Pirates. I went them to help on construction costs for new teams, where cities are facing the reality of either spending hundreds of millions of dollars for these new stadiums, or having the teams flee to other cities. That is something baseball ought to face up to, even though it is true that baseball has a different situation from football, because baseball's television revenues are lesser. But there has to be some equality and there has to be some parity. Or if baseball wants to function like any other business, let them do so, but without the antitrust exemption, and let's see what will happen to those giant salaries for the baseball players and those tremendous rates and the way baseball operates, if it does not have an antitrust exemption which is very special and unique. 
   Football has an antitrust exemption as to revenue sharing. Without that exemption they could not have the $17 billion multi-year television contract. They have plenty of funds to face up to stadium construction costs for the Pittsburgh Steelers and for the Philadelphia Eagles and for other teams. The facts are not yet before the public, but I hear the rumors that football is putting up a very substantial sum to have the Patriots remain in Massachusetts to top the bid of Connecticut. Connecticut is a television market, according to the media, about 24th. Boston, MA, is a media market about 6th. And the National Football League wants to protect its media market so they will put up a substantial sum of money to accomplish that. 
   It ought to be regularized and they ought to have a specific obligation. And 50 percent is not too much for the leagues to contribute. That would leave the owners with 25 percent and would still leave the public with 25 percent. One of the prospective cosponsors dropped off the bill because he does not want to be associated with even 25 percent for the public. But I suggest when the raiders--I am not talking about the Oakland Raiders; I am talking about the sports franchise raiders coming to his State, which I shall not name--go after his baseball team and go after his football team, watch the scurrying around to pay a lot more than 25 percent unless there is some leveraging and some compulsion. 
   Baseball and football are not going to face up to a fair allocation of funds if they are left to their own devices. But the Congress of the United States does have control of the antitrust exemption and we can take it away from baseball or we can limit it for baseball. And we can take away, if we choose, the football antitrust exemption on revenue sharing. So I do believe this is a matter which is of significant public interest. When a city like Hartford and a State like Connecticut bids $375 million of funds which could obviously be used better; where Pennsylvania is looking at more than $1 billion in four new stadiums at a time when $17 billion comes to the NFL, and the salaries are astronomical. If the leagues are to have this exemption, if they are to have this special break, they ought to face up to some public responsibility. 
   The second part of this legislation would grant football a limited antitrust exemption so they could regulate franchise moves. When the Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles, there was a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which the NFL had to pay. So they are reluctant to take a stand on exercising their league rules which require three-fourths approval. But, if they had an antitrust exemption to this limited extent, then they would be in a position to ameliorate the larceny. Maybe it would be petit larceny instead of grand larceny. But I think that kind of antitrust exemption would be worthwhile. 
   As you can tell, I feel very strongly about this subject. I have been a sports fan since I was 8 years old--perhaps 5 years old when my family, living in Wichita, KS, made a trip to Chicago for the World's Fair and I became a Cubs fan. And I became a Phillies fan when I moved to Philadelphia more than a half century ago. And I am a Pirates fan, too, except when they are playing the Phillies. 
   If you lived in Wichita, KS, when the morning paper came, the major item of interest would be the sports page and the box scores. And I am an Eagles fan and a Steelers fan and held season tickets as early as 1958. When the Dodgers and Giants moved away from Brooklyn and New York City, I thought that was really a very serious breach. Such moves have a great impact on the public, and we ought to stop this legalized extortion, and we ought to get a fair share for the tremendous antitrust break which baseball and football enjoy.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Indiana. I passed a note to the Senator because I did not want to interrupt the chain of thought. 
   I think there is no one in this Chamber who carries greater respect than Senator LUGAR on issues of foreign policy. I noted your comments earlier calling for Presidential leadership and referring to your op-ed piece which appeared in the Washington Post. I think it not inappropriate to comment at this time that the President noted your op-ed piece in the Washington Post at a meeting with you, Senator WARNER, and myself in attendance. We were the last three to meet with the President in a very extraordinary meeting that lasted a little over 2 hours. At the very end of the meeting, Senator WARNER, Senator LUGAR, and myself stayed and he commented about your op-ed piece. 
   The Senator made a comment, again referring to your op-ed piece, that the President has a dubious strategy to meet a limited goal. 
   The problem that I have, which leads to my question, is the President's leadership. He has initiated the airstrikes along with NATO without a clear-cut strategy, and an overused word, the so-called end game. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Advisor speculated that Milosevic might relent after the first wave; that there might be a pause; that they might have a different attitude after there was some substantial damage done. 
   Absent a relenting on the part of Milosevic, where do we go from here? In lengthy meetings--the President has now had four with Members--the President has not asked for troops nor has he asked for the authority which is present in the pending resolution to allow him to use whatever force is necessary. 
   The question I have for my distinguished colleague: In light of the absence of any request by the President and in the absence of any showing of leadership by the President and acknowledging the correctness of Senator LUGAR's assertion that the situation calls for Presidential leadership, why is it sensible to, in effect, give the President a blank check when he has not asked for the resources and has not demonstrated any capability to exercise leadership to effectively carry out that broad guarantee of authority?

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona. 
   I am opposed to the pending resolution for constitutional policy reasons and for pragmatic reasons. 
   With respect to the constitutional issue, we have seen a significant erosion of congressional authority, as mandated in the Constitution, to declare war--the President having assumed the authority to declare war under his powers as Commander in Chief. Korea was a war without a declaration by the Congress. Vietnam was a war without a declaration by the Congress, except for the ill-advised Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The missile strikes against Iraq in December constitute acts of war without authorization by Congress. The airstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia constitute acts of war without congressional authorization. There was a resolution authorizing airstrikes which passed the Senate 58-41, but under our bicameral form of Government, the House of Representatives did not concur in authorizing that use of force. 
   The broad sweeping authority contained within the pending resolution really is, in effect, tantamount to a delegation of Congress' authority. 
   The President has had a series of four meetings with Members of Congress which I believe have been very constructive and are very much to the President's credit. When he met with Members of Congress last Wednesday, on April 28, he publicly acknowledged this. The President said that he would not order ground troops 
   without prior authorization by the Congress of the United States. He wanted to reserve his constitutional authority to do so without prior congressional approval, but he said as a practical matter, he would get congressional authorization as a good-faith matter because of the sequence of events which have transpired and which he anticipates will transpire before any such move. 
   If we are to authorize the President, in the language of this resolution, ``to use all necessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),'' the Congress of the United States would be taking itself out of the picture with respect to being a party to whatever action the executive branch, the President, our Armed Forces might take. 
   I suggest, Madam President, that there is substantial collective wisdom in the House and in the Senate which ought to be consulted, which ought to be a party to the takeoff, as well as the landing, which ought to be a party to advising what our rules should be, reserving, of course, the military function to the generals and to the admirals and to the executive branch. But the Congress has a very, very significant role to play in deciding what course we ought to take. As a matter of policy, it seems to me important that the Congress reserve its rights and not become involved in such a broad delegation of congressional authority. 
   As a pragmatic matter, we have seen the ill-advised Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, and I quote from that resolution in part:  
   .....The United States is therefore prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member..... of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty.....  
   The language, ``to take all necessary steps including the use of armed force,'' is strikingly similar to the language of the present resolution to authorize the use of all necessary force. I suggest that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was very, very ill-advised. 
   Madam President, I supported the resolution passed by the Senate 58-41 to authorize airstrikes, expressly reserving that there should be no ground forces. I am prepared to consider whatever the President may request, providing that very, very important questions are answered. 
   I believe we need to know to what extent the airstrikes have degraded the military forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We need to know what the prospective resistance would be, what the plan of attack would be, what resources would be necessary to implement the plan, what of those resources would come from the United States, what of those resources would come from our NATO allies, and what would be the cost to be borne by our NATO allies as well as the United States? 
   We are currently looking at a request from the President for some $6 billion, and we are looking at an add-on from the House of Representatives which may bring the total bill to $12 billion, or to $13 billion. Before any such appropriation is authorized, it seems to me that we are going to have to take a very hard look at precisely what is involved and what our obligations are and what our NATO allies have contributed. 
   Now that there is a surplus and there has been a public declaration backed by consensus that the surplus ought to be used for Social Security, it has been noted that these appropriations are going to come out of the Social Security fund. That puts a political coloration on the matter which is going to require a lot of analysis to be sure that we are doing absolutely the right thing before we deplete funds which might be directed toward Social Security. 
   There is another aspect in the consideration of this resolution, and that is the high improbability, really impossibility, of an acceptance of this resolution by the House of Representatives, in light of their votes last Wednesday, April 28. 
   The House of Representatives turned down a resolution on a tie vote, 213-213, for the President to conduct air operations, so that the House is saying, by that tie vote, that they do not approve of what the President is doing at the present time. And in not approving even the limited air operations, with the specific reservation prohibiting the use of ground forces, what is there to support the belief that the House of  Representatives will be prepared to grant even broader authority to the President? 
   The vote by the House of Representatives on another resolution appears directly inconsistent with their refusal to authorize the President to continue the air operations. The House of Representatives rejected a resolution, 290-139, directing the President, under the War Powers Resolution, to withdraw troops from operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now, there may be some ambiguity or difference between the withdrawal of troops compared to a cessation of air operations, but they amount to about the same thing. 
   So here you have the House of Representatives saying, ``We will not authorize the President to carry out the air operations,'' and at the same time, ``We do not call for the withdrawal of troops,'' or, realistically viewed, whatever it is that the United States is doing in a military context at the present time. 
   I believe it is important to consider negotiations, as has been urged by some Members, although I would not suspend the bombing operations. 
   The return of the three U.S. soldiers by President Milosevic was, indeed, welcome news yesterday. I congratulate Reverend Jackson for his initiatives and his courage in undertaking that daring mission, and in succeeding at it. But I would not reward President Milosevic for doing something, in returning the three GIs, which he should have done weeks ago. I do think that we need to stay the course on the authorization of the resolution that the Senate passed on airstrikes. But I do also believe we ought to be cooperative with the efforts of Russia, and with any other efforts to have a negotiated settlement, providing we do not give up the standing to prosecute President Milosevic as a war criminal if the evidence so bears out. 
   We know that as long ago as late 1992 then-Secretary of State Eagleburger, in effect, declared Milosevic a war criminal. And I believe that it is very important that the War Crimes Tribunal proceed to gather evidence. I think you will have a very salutary, a very deterrent effect if the evidence is present to proceed with an indictment against Milosevic. 
   A bipartisan group of Senators met with Justice Louise Arbour last Friday, and she made a very strong plea for the IFOR, for the allied forces, to take Karadzic into custody. And that would be an occasion to take many other high ranking military and political figures into custody: war criminals, for the violation of human rights in Bosnia. And that could have a very, very profound effect on Milosevic's immediate subordinates. 
   So we ought to be working in a number of directions--at a negotiated settlement, if it can be obtained, consistent with the NATO conditions, to pursue the issue of treating Milosevic and his subordinates as war criminals, and to continue with our airstrikes. 
   But I do believe that at opposite ends of the poles, it is unsatisfactory, really counterproductive, for the House to reject the current military operations and the airstrikes by the tie vote; and I think it would be counterproductive at the other end of the spectrum to have a broad sweeping authorization of authority for the President to take whatever action he deems appropriate as a blank check. 
   And in taking that position, I acknowledge the leadership of 
   the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, who speaks with great authority on military matters, and the leadership of his principal cosponsor, Senator BIDEN, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But for constitutional policy and pragmatic reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the pending resolution. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Department of Veterans Affairs, S. 940, the proposed Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Reduction Assistance Act of 1999. The Department of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the President of the Senate by an undated letter received by the President of the Senate on April 13, 1999. 
   My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I have adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific bills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and comments--all Administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Thus, I reserve the right to support or oppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on Monday, in the afternoon, the distinguished majority leader has scheduled a vote, so far denominated as a tabling motion on the pending S.J. Res. 20, concerning the deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   Since Monday afternoon is likely to be crowded with debate on this subject and there is free time in the Senate Chamber today, I have decided to speak about this issue because I believe it is a matter of overwhelming importance for the United States, for NATO, for Europe and, for that matter, for the world. 
   The resolution provides in a short statement worth reading in its entirety:  
   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the President is authorized to use all necessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  
   Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to this resolution because it gives a total blank check to the President to involve the United States in any type of military action which he deems appropriate when it is the Congress of the United States that has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war. In my view, the Congress ought not to give such a blank check, but instead ought to ask the President to come before the Congress, specifying what the President seeks to accomplish and what the means are for accomplishing that objective. 
   I supported the resolution for airstrikes with a specific limitation that there would not be a deployment of ground forces. We have a great many very, very important questions, the answers to which ought to be provided, in my judgment, by the executive branch, by the President, to the Congress before the Congress exercises its authority to, in effect, declare war. 
   Bear in mind at the outset, that the President has asked for no such authority, and that is a very important point and a threshold matter. But  these are some of the questions which ought to be examined. I know that the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator ROBERTS from Kansas, who is on the Armed Services Committee, has participated in offering legislation which conditions funding and conditions congressional authority on a number of similar issues. 
   These questions are of such vital importance that they bear repetition and they bear analysis and understanding by the American people, at least the relatively few who are watching on C-SPAN2 today. 
   But these are monumental matters. These are some of the issues which I think have to be answered before the Congress is in a position to decide what authorization is to be given to the President: 
   First, to what extent have the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia been degraded by the air attacks? 
   Second, what would the projected resistance be of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? 
   Third, what is the President's plan? So far we do not know what the President would like to do. There is not agreement among the alliance. The President has stated that he wishes to proceed with the support of the alliance, just as he has had the support of the alliance up to date. 
   Once we know what the plan is, the fourth question would be, what resources are necessary to implement a specific plan? 
   Fifth, what would the risks be to U.S. military personnel in carrying out the plan? 
   Next, what contributions would be made by others of the alliance? 
   And an additional question: What other pressures are available to use against the forces of President Milosevic, such as the pressure of the War Crimes Tribunal? 
   These are all vital questions which ought to be answered before the Congress of the United States plunges into this field precipitously, without a request by the President, without a request by NATO, without any plan for us to consider on issues which can be answered only by the President of the United States. 
   What we are being asked for on this resolution is a blank check, and it is really an unusual form of a blank check because the check is not only blank as to amount, but the check is also blank as to the identity of the payee; that is, who receives the funds. 
   A check has a number of ingredients. There is the party who writes the check. That would be the Congress of the United States in the case of this resolution. A check has the identification of the party who receives the check, the payee. And the check has the amount of the check. And this check is blank in both material aspects. What is the amount of the check and who is to receive the check? 
   I think the Congress of the United States would be most unwise to enact such a resolution on the state of the record which exists at the present time. 
   What we have in Kosovo, what we have with NATO, what we have in our military action against the Republic of Yugoslavia is really a constitutional crisis. It is a constitutional crisis of major import, if anybody would pay attention to the Constitution. Only by ignoring the Constitution are we able to ignore the constitutional crisis. 
   But the Constitution is explicit that only the Congress of the United States has the authority to declare war. Only the Congress of the United States has the power, responsibility and authority to engage the U.S. Armed Forces in war. But what we have going on at the present time in Kosovo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a war. 
   The military actions there are clear-cut acts of war. We have this war in process without the authority of the Congress of the United States. 
   As of Wednesday of this week, we have the war in process with a specific action of the House of Representatives in rejecting the use of airstrikes by a tie vote of 213-213. 
   It is true that the Senate authorized the use of airstrikes with the reservation against ground forces by a vote of 58-41. But we have, as we all know, a bicameral legislature. You cannot have a declaration of war by the Senate. You could only have a declaration of war by the Congress; and that means joint action of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
   And now we have the House of Representatives rejecting the President's authority to conduct air operations by a vote of 213-213. And that is as forceful a rejection as had it been 426-0. Unless it passes, albeit by as little as a single vote, it is a rejection. 
   The House of Representatives had a curious legislative day on Wednesday, April 28, taking up a series of resolutions by Congressman TOM CAMPBELL of California. And I compliment Congressman CAMPBELL for bringing the issues to a head--or trying to bring the issues to a head. 
   The House of Representatives rejected a resolution calling for a state of war by a vote of 2 in favor, 427 against. 
   The House of Representatives then voted on a resolution directing the President, under the War Powers Resolution, to withdraw troops from the operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That, too, was rejected by a vote of 139-290. 
   Then there was the resolution authorizing the President to conduct air operations similar to the one passed by the Senate on March 23. As previously noted, that was rejected 213-213. 
   Then, the House passed a resolution 249-180, placing limitations on the funding of the President to use ground troops in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without prior congressional authority. 
   When we read through the War Powers Act, the legislation which was passed to try to limit the erosion of Congress' authority to declare war with the taking on of that authority by the President under his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief, the provisions of 5c specify that ``at any time the United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories, without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if a Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'' 
   So here we have the anomalous situation that the House turns down a declaration of war, the House turns down the use of airstrikes, the Senate has authorized airstrikes with the reservation prohibiting the use of ground forces, and you do not have the Congress--even the House--directing the withdrawal of forces. So it is a quagmire, to say the least. 
   And it is a constitutional confrontation and a constitutional crisis to identify it squarely, when you have the Constitution requiring action by the Congress to declare war to involve the United States in war, and you have one House of the Congress, the House of Representatives, failing to authorize the airstrikes which are currently underway. 
   The resolution which is going to be voted on on Monday, Mr. President, bears a striking similarity to the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was used to justify United States participation in the Vietnam war without a declaration of war.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues from Vermont, Senators JEFFORDS and LEAHY, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact and to authorize a Southern Dairy Compact. 
   This legislation will create a much needed safety net for dairy farmers and will bring greater stability to the prices paid monthly to these farmers. The fill authorizes an Interstate Compact Commission to take such steps as necessary to assure consumers of an adequate local supply of fresh fluid milk and to assure the continued viability of dairy farming within the compact region. Specifically, states that choose to join the compact would enter into a voluntary agreement to create a minimum price for milk within the compact region. This price would take into account the regional differences in the costs of production for milk, thereby providing dairy farmers with a fair and equitable price for their product. 
   This bill would authorize Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Maryland, and Ohio to join the existing Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. New York, New Jersey, and Maryland have already agreed to join and the Pennsylvania State Legislature is currently considering compact legislation. Further, it would authorize states in the southern part of the country to form a similar compact to provide price stability in this region. 
   In order to ensure that this legislation does not provide a negative impact to low-income nutrition programs that use a large quantity of dairy products each year, the bill ensures that the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program and the School Lunch program will not be required to pay higher prices for milk as a result of any action taken by the Compact Commission. 
   Over the past several years, I have worked closely with my colleagues in the Senate in order to provide a more equitable price for our nation's milk producers. I supported amendments to the Farm Bills of 1981 and 1985, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 1991, the Budget Resolution of 1995 and the most recent Farm Bill in 1996 in an effort to insure that dairy farmers receive a fair price. As a member of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to ensure that dairy programs have received the maximum possible funding. In the past four years alone, I have worked to obtain almost $1.1 million for dairy research conducted at Penn State University. I have also been a leading supporter of the Dairy Export Incentive Program which facilitates the development of an international market for United States dairy products. 
   In recent years, however, dairy farmers have faced the dual problems of a record high cost of feed grain and a record drop in the Basic Formula Price paid for dairy products. Prices have fluctuated greatly over the past several years, setting new record highs and lows, thereby making any long-term planning impossible for farmers. Most recently, after reaching an all time high in December of 1998, the Basic Formula Price for milk dropped $5.72 per hundredweight to a price of $11.62 for March 1999. These economic conditions have placed our nation's dairy farmers in an all but impossible position. In order to hear the problems that dairy farmers are facing first hand, I asked Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman to accompany me to northeastern Pennsylvania on February 10, 1997. We met a crowd of approximately 750 angry farmers who  rightfully complained about the dramatic fluctuations in the price of milk. 
   Upon our return to Washington, in an attempt to bring greater stability to the dairy market, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution on February 13, 1997 which passed by a vote of 83-15. The Resolution stated that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately to replace the National Cheese Exchange as a factor to be considered in setting the Basic Formula Price for Dairy. I successfully attached an amendment to the 1997 Supplemental Appropriations Act which required the Department of Agriculture to replace the National Cheese Exchange, which had proven to be an unreliable source of price information, with a systematic national survey of cheese producers. As a result of this legislation, the Basic Formula Price increased from $12.46 in February of 1997 to $13.32 in February of 1998, which represented an increase of .86 per hundredweight over the course of the year. 
   Unfortunately, this action alone was not sufficient to bring long-term stability to the dairy market. Consequently, on April 17, 1997, I introduced legislation to require the Secretary of Agriculture to use the price of feed grains and other cash expenses in determining the basic formula price for milk. Further, on September 9, 1997, I joined with Senator FEINGOLD of Wisconsin in introducing S. Res. 119, which urged the Secretary of Agriculture to set a temporary minimum milk price that was equitable to all milk procedures nationwide and provided price relief to economically stressed milk producers. 
   When we began to see some momentum on the national level to reform the current milk pricing system, we were stopped by a Federal District Court, which in December of 1997 ordered the USDA to scrap the price differentials in the current milk pricing formula. This change would have had a major negative impact on the dairy farmers in Pennsylvania. In reaction to this decision, on December 4, 1997, I wrote to the federal judge, asking him to stay his decision striking down the current Class I dairy pricing formula pending appellate review. Sixty-five Congressman and twenty other Senators signed onto my letter and on December 5, 1997, the Judge granted the requested stay. 
   After this short victory, we received further bad news earlier this year, when Secretary Glickman released a new rule for setting the Basic Formula Price for dairy. While better than the proposed rule released last year, this new pricing formula will compound the already dire economic position of dairy farmers by removing an additional $196 million each year from the dairy industry nationwide. 
   Our nation's farmers are some of the hardest working and most dedicated individuals in America. In the past several years, I have visited numerous small dairy farms in Pennsylvania. I have seen these hard working men and women who have dedicated their lives to their farms. The recent drop in dairy prices is an issue that directly affects all of us. We have a duty to ensure that our nation's dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk. If we do nothing, many small dairy farmers will be forced to sell their farms and leave the agriculture industry. This will not only impact the lives of these farmers, but will also have a significant negative impact on the rural economies that depend on the dairy industry for support. Further, the large-scale departure of small dairy farmers from agriculture could place our nation's steady supply of fresh fluid milk in jeopardy, thereby affecting every American. 
   We must recognize the importance of this problem and take prompt action. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation as we continue to work in Congress to bring greater stability to our nation's dairy industry.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Chair doubly for the double acknowledgment of representation, the distinguished Presiding Officer being the Senator from Kansas and this Senator having been born and raised in Kansas. If the sitting Senator from Kansas acknowledges representation of that State, I second the motion. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for up to 15 minutes in morning business.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, now that NATO has celebrated its 50th anniversary with unity, I believe it is important that the Congress of the United States should now carefully assess what action is next to be taken by NATO involving the United States against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   It is critical that Congress discharge its constitutional responsibility where the Constitution specifies that only the Congress of the United States has the authority to declare war and to involve the United States in war. The black-letter pronouncement of the Constitution is sufficient reason in and of itself for meticulous observance, but the public policy reasons behind that constitutional provision are very sound. Unless there is public support for war, shown first through the action of the Congress of the United States, it is not realistic or possible to successfully prosecute the war. We learned that from the bitter experience of Vietnam. 
   When the Congress of the United States makes a declaration, either formally or through a resolution, it happens after deliberation, after analysis, after an interchange of ideas and after a debate. In so many instances now, we have seen erosion of the congressional authority to declare war. Korea was a war without a declaration by Congress. Vietnam was a war without a declaration by Congress. Only the Gulf of Tonkin resolution has been held up by some as a thinly veiled authorization for the military action taken by the United States in Vietnam. 
   I believe that we must be very, very cautious not to repeat the mistake of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and not to endorse hastily a resolution proposed by some of our colleagues in the United States Senate to authorize the President to use whatever force the President may determine to be necessary in the military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   I am not prepared to give the President a blank check. I believe that the constitutional responsibility of a Senator and the entire Senate, both Houses of Congress of the United States, involves a deliberate judgment as to what ought to be undertaken before we involve the United States in war and before we, in effect, have a declaration of war. And there are many, many very important questions which have to be answered before this Senator is prepared to authorize the executive branch--the President--to use whatever force the President deems necessary. 
   First of all, we need to know what the U.S. commitment will be. We need to know what the plan is. We need to know the strength of the Serbian Army, the military forces of the Republic of Yugoslavia. We need to know to what extent the airstrikes so far have degraded or weakened the military forces of the Serbs or the Republic of Yugoslavia. We need to know what the other commitments will be from the other NATO nations. We need to know how long our commitment will be, or at least some reasonable estimate as to how long we may be expected to be in Kosovo. 
   We know that the initial deployment in Bosnia was accompanied by a Presidential promise to be out within a year. That was extended by a period of time. That extension was re-extended, and now we don't even have an outer limit as to how long we are to be in Bosnia. 
   We know that the President has come forward with a request for $5.9 billion in additional funding. I believe the Congress of the United States will support our fighting men and women. But that is a large bill; about $5.5 billion is for military machinery, operations and equipment. It was a surprise to many that in the course of that military operation, we were on the verge of running out of missiles; that our munitions supply was questionable; that our supply of spare parts was questionable. Many of us on this floor, including this Senator, have argued that our military has been reduced too  much. And now there is a debate underway as to whether the President's request for $5.9 billion ought to be supplemented to take care of many items that have been overlooked in the past--issues of military pay, issues of munitions, the overall readiness of the United States. 
   When the distinguished Prime Minister Tony Blair was in the United States last week, I had occasion to talk to him personally and get his views as to what ought to be done in our military 
   action, the NATO military action, against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Blair talks about ground forces. I asked the obvious questions as to how many the United Kingdom is prepared to commit, how many the U.S. will be called upon to undertake, and what we have done by way of degrading the Yugoslav forces by air attacks. To his credit, Prime Minister Blair responded that those were all unanswered questions. 
   Well, before I am prepared to vote for the use of force, I think there ought to be some very concrete answers to those questions. The President of the United States was quoted as saying that he was prepared to reevaluate the question of the use of ground troops because that request had been made by the Secretary General of NATO. Frankly, I am just a little bit surprised that the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military forces is looking to the leadership of the Secretary General of NATO when the United States is playing the dominant role and supplying the overwhelming majority of air power and materiel in our military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   It seems to me the leadership ought to be coming from the President. The leadership ought to be coming from the United States. We certainly are footing the bill, and we certainly are the major actor. So if, in fact, there is a justification for a greater authorization by the Congress, that word ought to come from the President, through the leadership of the President, telling us in a very concrete way the answers to the important questions that I have enumerated. 
   This Senator understands there are no absolute answers to the questions, but we ought to have best estimates, and we ought to have a very candid assessment from the United States military, who, so far, have been less than unequivocal in their responses as to whether the airstrikes alone can bring President Milosevic to his knees. The answer that is given by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, is that the military will be degraded. But there is a more fundamental question which needs to be answered--whether the airstrikes will be successful, or whether the airstrikes will sufficiently weaken the Republic of Yugoslavia so that we at least have an idea, if there are to be ground forces, what the results will be. 
   But I believe very strongly that we should not pass a resolution analogous to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, authorizing the President to use whatever force the President deems necessary. I believe there should be no blank check for this President, or for any President. But I am prepared to listen to a concrete, specific plan that evaluates the risks, that evaluates the costs in terms of potential U.S. lives. I am not prepared to commit ground forces without having a specific idea as to what the realistic prognosis will be. 
   The Senate of the United States passed a resolution on March 23 authorizing airstrikes, but strictly guarding against ground forces. The airstrikes constitute a clear-cut act of war, and the resolution of the Senate of the United States is not sufficient under the Constitution. There has to be a joinder with the House of Representatives. So it is my thought that before any further action is taken, before there is any suggestion of a commitment of ground forces, that matter ought to come before the Congress and ought to receive prior congressional authorization before any such force is used, and that the entire Congress of the United States ought to review the military action that is undertaken at the present time, 
   and that it is in fact beyond the prerogative of the President under his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, but it is realistically a matter that is decided by the Congress. 
   Make no mistake. There are very vital interests involved in the action now being undertaken against the Republic of Yugoslavia. NATO's credibility is squarely on the line. The credibility of the United States is squarely on the line. The activities of the Serbs, the Republic of Yugoslavia, in what is called ethnic cleansing, which is a polite name for ``barbaric massacres,'' is unparalleled since World War II. And there are very major humanitarian interests which are currently being served. 
   This body has never come to grips, in my opinion, with the square determination as to whether vital U.S. national security interests are involved, and that is the traditional test of the use of force. But we are on the line; our country is on the line. NATO, a very important international organization, has its credibility on the line. And we must act in a very thoughtful, very careful way after important information is presented to the Congress by the President, because only the President is in a position to answer the critical questions. Then the deliberation of the Congress ought to take shape, and we ought to make a determination in accordance with the Constitution whether the Congress will authorize the executive branch to use force, to send in ground troops, or what the parameters of that declaration would be. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge the Palestinian Authority not to take unilateral action on May 4 to declare a Palestinian state. That date, May 4, 1999, marks a period where significant speculation has been undertaken as to whether the Palestinian Authority would make such a unilateral declaration of statehood because of their dissatisfaction with the progress of the negotiations under the Oslo accords. I urge the Palestinian Authority not to take any such action on the grounds that is a matter for negotiation under the Oslo accords, and that it is something that ought to be decided between the parties to those accords--the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
   I had occasion to discuss this matter personally with Chairman Yasser Arafat when he was in the United States a little over a month ago when I was scheduled to visit him in his hotel in Virginia, but I had the opportunity to confer with Chairman Arafat in my hideaway. 
   For those who don't know what a hideaway is, it is a small room in the Capitol downstairs 2 minutes away from the Senate floor; small, but accommodating. 
   On that occasion, Chairman Arafat and I discussed a variety of topics, including the question of whether the Palestinian Authority would undertake a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   I might say to the Chair in passing just a small personal note that when I accompanied President Clinton to Bethlehem in December of last year, I was struck by a large poster which had the overtones of a political poster. It had a picture of the President on one side with his thumb up, and it had a picture of Chairman Arafat on the other side. It was a political poster. The picture had not been taken with President Clinton and Chairman Arafat together, but it had that symbolism for the occasion of the President's visit to Bethlehem. 
   I took one as a souvenir. As we Senators sometimes do, I had 
   it framed and it is hanging in my hideaway so that when Chairman Arafat came into the hideaway and saw the picture of himself and President Clinton, he was very pleased to see it on display and insisted on having a picture of himself taken in front of the picture of himself, which is not an unusual occurrence, whether you are a Palestinian with the Palestinian Authority, or from even the State of Kansas, or the State of Pennsylvania. 
   In the course of our discussions, I urged Chairman Arafat not to make the unilateral declaration of statehood.  He said to me that it was not up to himself alone, but it was up to the council. 
   Then he made a comment that he questioned whether the Palestinian Authority had received sufficient credit for the change of its Charter eliminating the provisions in the PLO Charter calling for the destruction of Israel. 
   In 1995, Senator SHELBY and I proposed legislation, which was enacted, that conditioned U.S. payments to the Palestinian Authority on changing the Charter and on making the maximum effort against terrorists, so that when Chairman Arafat raised the question about whether there had been sufficient recognition given to the Palestinian Authority for changing the Charter, I told him that I thought he was probably right and that there had not been sufficient recognition given to the Palestinian Authority for that change. 
   He then asked me if there would be recognition given to the Palestinian Authority if it resisted a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   I said to Chairman Arafat that I personally would go to the Senate floor on May 5 if a unilateral declaration of statehood was not made on May 4.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an issue of great importance, and an issue on which I believe we can all agree. Regardless of health insurance type, payer, or scope, it is critical that women have direct access to caregivers who are trained to address their unique health needs. To help us ensure that all women have direct access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care within their health plans, I am joined by Senator BOB GRAHAM in introducing the ``Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1999.'' This legislation will allow women direct access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care, without requiring them to secure a time-consuming and cumbersome referral from a separate primary care physician. Senator GRAHAM and I are also pleased to have Senators COCHRAN and ROBB as original cosponsors of this vital legislation. I would like to extend thanks to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose members have worked diligently with Senator GRAHAM and myself in crafting this bill. 
   While many managed care plans provide some form of direct access to women's health specialists, some plans limit this access. Other plans deny direct access altogether, and require a referral from a primary care physician. Under the ``Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1999,'' women would be permitted to see a provider of obstetric and gynecological care without prior authorization. This approach is prudent and effective because it ensures that women have access to the benefits they pay for, without mandating a structural change in the plan's particular ``gatekeeper'' system.  
   It is important to note that 37 states have enacted laws promoting women's access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care. However, women in other states or in ERISA-regulated health plans are not protected from access restrictions or limitations. For many women, direct access to providers of obstetric and gynecological care is crucial because they are often the only providers that women see regularly during their reproductive years. These providers are often a woman's only point of entry into the health care system, and are caregivers who maintain a woman's medical record for much of her lifetime. 
   I believe it is clear that access to women's health care cuts across the intricacies of the complicated and often divisive managed care debate. During the past few years, Congress has debated many proposals which attempt to address growing problems in managed health care insurance. These proposals have been diverse, not only in their approach to the problems, but in the scope of the problems they seek to address. Most recently, during the 105th Congress, the House of Representatives passed a managed care reform proposal which, among many other reforms, included provisions requiring health plans to allow women direct access to obstetrician/gynecologists which participate in the plan. I would also note that this direct access provision has been included, in varying forms, in all of the major managed care reform proposals introduced in the Senate this year, including the bipartisan managed care reform bill, the ``Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1999'' (S. 374), which I cosponsored. It is for these reasons that I offer this legislation today. 
   Only through bipartisanship and consensus-building can we come to an agreement on the difficult issue of addressing managed care reform. I believe that cutting through the cumbersome gatekeeper system to ensure women have access to the care they need is a good place to start, and I urge swift adoption of this legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, President Clinton has just signified his intention to ask Congress for additional appropriations of some $5.45 billion for military costs involved in the war in Kosovo and some $491 million to pay for humanitarian assistance. It is my thought that Congress will be receptive to humanitarian aid for the thousands of refugees who have been driven from their homes in Kosovo. These requests will give us an opportunity to ask some very important questions and get some very important information to assess our military preparedness and to make the determination as to how much our allies are contributing to this effort, which ought to be a joint effort. 
   We have seen the U.S. military preparedness decline very markedly in the past decade and a half. During the Reagan years, in the mid-1980s, the defense budget exceeded $300 billion. In 1999 dollars, that would be well over $400 billion, might even by close to the $500 million mark. But our budget for this year, fiscal year 1999, was $271 billion, and according to the President's request, is projected to be slightly over $280 billion for fiscal year 2000. 
   That raises some very, very important questions as to the adequacy of our defense and our ability to deal with a crisis in Kosovo, where we are at war, notwithstanding the fact that a declaration has not been filed. The Senate of the United States has authorized air strikes in our vote of 58 to 41 on March 23, but the House of Representatives has not had a correlating move. Constitutionally this is a very, very dangerous situation, because only the Congress under our Constitution has the authority to declare war. We have seen a constant erosion of congressional authority, which is a dangerous sign, in terms of the requirements of constitutional law--this is bedrock constitutional law--and also in terms of having congressional support, which reflects public support, for the military action. 
   We have seen this war in Kosovo move ahead. We have seen missile strikes, air strikes. The authorization of the Senate was limited in the air strikes because of our concern about not putting too many U.S. fighting men and women in so-called harm's way. It is rather a surprising consequence to find we are in short supply of missiles. We have seen the activity in Iraq reduced, according to military reports. We know of our commitments around the globe, including South Korea. I believe this is an occasion to take a very close look as to the adequacy of our military preparations. At this time, we have some 10 divisions, 20 wings active in reserve, some 13 active wings and some 256 naval service combatants. This is very limited, compared to the power of the United States during the mid-1980s in the Reagan years. 
   Of course, it is a different world. It is a world without the potential clash of the superpowers--the United States and the Soviet Union--but it is still a world with major, major problems. 
   When the President comes to Capitol Hill, comes to the Appropriations Committee on which I serve, comes to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on which I serve, then I think we need to ask some very, very hard questions. Those questions turn on whether the United States is, realistically, capable of carrying on the kind of a war in which we have become engaged in Kosovo. Do we even have sufficient air power to carry out our objectives? Do we have sufficient missiles to carry out our objectives? 
   So far, we have bypassed the issue of ground forces. Some of our colleagues have advocated a resolution which would authorize the President to use whatever force is needed. I am categorically opposed to such a resolution. I do not believe that the Senate and the Congress of the United States ought to give the President a blank check, but I am prepared to hear whatever it is that the President requests, to consider that in the context of our vital national security interests and in the context of what we ought to do. But at a time when the Congress and the country has been put on notice that the President is considering calling up Reserves, we find ourselves in a military entanglement, a foreign entanglement and, by all appearances, we are ill-equipped to carry out the objectives and the course which the President has set out for us. 
   We need to know on an updated basis what is happening in Iraq and what our commitments are there and what our potential commitments are around the world. 
   Similarly, we need to know, Madam President, our allies' contributions. At a time when the Congress of the United States is being called upon to authorize $5.450 billion for the Pentagon, it is fair to ask what the contribution is from Great Britain. What is the contribution from France? What is the contribution from Germany? What is the contribution from the other NATO countries? 
   The morning news reports carried the comment that the French are opposed to a naval blockade to cut off Yugoslavian oil reserves. That is sort of a surprising matter. As General Wesley Clark has noted, why are we putting U.S. pilots at risk in bombing Yugoslavian oil production at oil refineries if we are not willing to take on a less drastic matter of a naval blockade? Certainly a naval blockade is an act of war, as the French have been reported to have said, but so are missile and air strikes. As we are being asked for almost $6 billion, I would be especially interested to know the French contribution, besides their naysaying of a naval blockade to stop petroleum from reaching Yugoslavia. 
   The issue of the relative contribution of the United States and the NATO countries has been a longstanding controversy for the 50 years that NATO has been in existence. I recall attending my first North Atlantic Assembly meeting in Venice shortly after I was elected. It was the spring of 1981. The chief topic was burden sharing. 
   On the occasions when I have had an opportunity to return to North Atlantic Assembly meetings, burden sharing has always been a big question. I think it is a fair question for the Congress to ask: What is the proportion of burden sharing now in Kosovo, especially when we are being asked to ante up an additional $6 billion. 
   There is another aspect to our activity in Kosovo which requires an answer, and that is, what are we doing with respect to prosecution of crimes against humanity in the War Crimes Tribunal, looking toward the prospective indictment of President Milosevic. There is an active effort at the present time to gather evidence against President Milosevic. There is a question as to why it has taken so long. In late 1992, then-Secretary of State Eagleburger, pretty much branded Milosevic a war criminal. There has been constant speculation over the course of the past 7 years about why Milosevic was not indicted, along with others in the Bosnia and 
   Croatia crimes against humanity. 
   We need an answer, Madam President, as to what has happened with outstanding key indictments against Mladic and Karadzic with respect to what has happened in Bosnia. When a group of Members of the House and Senate were briefed by the President last Tuesday, a distinction was made between our military activity and collateral ways to have an impact on the war in Kosovo, such as through the War Crimes Tribunal. 
   There have been major efforts to locate Karadzic. There have also been major efforts to locate Mladic who is supposed to be in hiding near Belgrade. 
   The activities of the War Crimes Tribunal could have a very profound effect  on those committing atrocities as we speak in Kosovo--that that kind of conduct is going to be treated in a very severe and tough manner by the War Crimes Tribunal. This involves having the War Crimes Tribunal follow up on those who have been indicted, like Mladic and Karadzic, and it also involves the War Crimes Tribunal acting aggressively to gather evidence about Milosevic and any others who may be perpetrating crimes against humanity. 
   At a time when we are looking for a supplemental appropriation, we ought to be as certain as we can be that the War Crimes Tribunal is adequately funded. I have had occasion to visit the War Crimes Tribunal three times in The Hague and have noted a very serious group of dedicated prosecutors, headed by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour. But that contingent has been laboring with insufficient resources. Only recently their courtrooms have increased from one to three, and a substantial increase in their budget was achieved when the 1999 budget was increased from the 1998 level of $68.8 million to slightly more than $100 million to take care of the prosecutions in Bosnia and Croatia. 
   That leaves open the question about what is going to happen with respect to the prosecutions in Kosovo. It is vital that efforts be ongoing contemporaneously with these atrocities to gather evidence while it is fresh. From my own experience as a prosecuting attorney, I can say firsthand--gather the evidence while the eyewitnesses are available, while the recollections are fresh and while the tangible physical evidence is present. 
   There may be a necessity--and it is a very unpleasant subject but one of the facts of life in Bosnia, Croatia and now Kosovo--that mass graves be uncovered for tangible evidence of these atrocities. An inquiry today gave me the preliminary bit of advice that there is a request for some $5 million for documentation support for the War Crimes Tribunal. I have made the request that further information be forthcoming so that when the Appropriations Committee considers these supplemental matters, that we have in hand the needs of the War Crimes Tribunal. This will put all would-be war criminals on notice that these matters are going to be very, very vigorously pursued. It would be a very, very strong blow for international law and international justice to have a War Crimes Tribunal indictment at the earliest possible time branding Milosevic a war criminal for all to see. I think that would inevitably have a profound effect everywhere, including in Belgrade, including in Serbia, including in the Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   So, these are questions which I hope we can have answers to in the forthcoming days when I do believe my colleagues will be willing to share my sense that the fighting men and women need to be supported on this $5.45 billion request from the Pentagon and on the almost $500 million for humanitarian aid. But we need to use this as an occasion to find out if we have adequate military strength to carry on the war which we have undertaken and to discharge the kind of commitments that we have made worldwide. We also need to take a close look at the burden sharing with our allies and to make sure that the important work of the War Crimes Tribunal is adequately funded. 
   In the absence of anyone else on the floor seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation on a flat tax. This, of course, is a famous day, April 15, the day when Federal income tax returns are due. Across this land for many days, many weeks, some months, Americans have been struggling with their tax returns. As we speak, some may have on C-SPAN2 quietly while they are working on their returns at this very moment. 
   I recall seeing long lines at the Philadelphia post office near midnight on income tax day when cars were lined up and people were dropping off their tax returns at the post office to beat the filing deadline. 
   This is a good occasion to talk about the flat tax which permits taxpayers to report their income on a postcard. It can actually be done in the course of some 15 minutes. I filed my tax return and sent it off yesterday. It is very complicated. They say it takes a Philadelphia lawyer to fill out a tax return. I think it takes more than a Philadelphia lawyer to fill out a Federal income tax return, and we have labored under the complexities of the Internal Revenue Code for far too long. 
   I first introduced this legislation in March of 1995. I was the second one in the Congress of the United States to introduce flat-tax legislation. The majority leader, DICK ARMEY, had introduced the flat tax in the House of Representatives the preceding fall. I studied it. I studied the model of Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka, two distinguished professors of economics and tax law at Stanford University, and concluded that America ought to have a flat tax and that we could, in fact, have a flat tax if the American people really understood what a flat tax was all about. 
   The Hall-Rabushka model was revenue neutral at 19 percent. I have added 1 percent in order to allow for two deductions: one on charitable contributions up to $2,500 a year and a second on interest on home mortgages of  borrowings up to $100,000 to take care of middle-class Americans, because I think without those two deductions, it would be a political impossibility to have a flat tax enacted. 
   The advantage of the flat tax is that it does have the flatness with only those two deductions, so it is a very simple matter to return the tax return. 
   Here is a sample tax return. You fill in your name and your address. You list your total wage, salary, or pension. There is a personal allowance, for a family of four. Up to $27,500 pays no tax at all. That constitutes about 53 percent of Americans. It has the two deductions for mortgage interest on debt up to $100,000 for an owner-occupied home and charitable contributions up to $2,500; total compensation multiplied by 20 percent, and that is that. 
   The tax burden costs Americans about $224 billion a year of our gross national product, which is mired in complexity and unnecessary regulation. 
   The flat tax seeks to bring equity into the tax payment by taxing only once so that the flat tax eliminates tax on net dividends, capital gains or estates because all of those items have already been taxed. 
   It would enable Americans to accumulate a great deal more in capital which would help business expansion which would help the economy. And it is projected that the gross national product would be increased by some $2 trillion over 7 years by virtue of this flat tax proposal. 
   The flat tax is a win-win situation all up and down the line because, by eliminating the loopholes, it eliminates the opportunities of very wealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes at all. When you take a look at the returns of the very, very rich, with the practices of deductions and tax shelters, all of which is legal, the very, very wealthy avoid paying any tax at all. 
   But this flat tax would have the advantages of capital accumulation, would have the advantage of increasing the gross national product, but most of all would have the simplicity of being able to file a tax return on a postcard. 
   I think that as I speak--it is always problematic as to how many people are watching C-SPAN2--but I think as I speak there are many Americans across the land tonight who would like to be able to fill out a tax return in 15 minutes. And my view is that if it were better understood, that there would be a great public clamor to have a flat tax enacted. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation to provide for a flat 20% tax on individuals and businesses. In the 104th Congress, I was the first Senator to introduce flat tax legislation and the first Member of Congress to set forth a deficit-neutral plan for dramatically reforming our nation's tax code and replacing it with a flatter, fairer plan designed to stimulate economic growth. My flat tax legislation was also the first plan to retain limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. 
   As I traveled around the country and held town hall meetings across Pennsylvania and other states, the public support for fundamental tax reform was overwhelming. I would point out in those speeches that I never leave home without two key documents: (1) my copy of the Constitution; and (2) a copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I soon realized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat tax postcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see what life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only take 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer burdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest, capital gains and estates. 
   Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans embrace the simplicity, fairness and growth potential of flat tax reform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current tax code. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat tax preferred my flat tax plan with limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered the 1996 Republican presidential primary, publisher Steve Forbes opined in a March 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the tremendous appeal and potency of my flat tax plan. 
   Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was appointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform and the Commission soon came out with its report recognizing the value of a fairer, flatter tax code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat tax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the 1996 Republican presidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat tax or a consumption-based tax system. 
   Unfortunately, the politics of that Presidential campaign denied the flat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite Congressional adoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which was introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted. 
   I reintroduced this legislation in the 105th Congress with slight modifications to reflect inflation-adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent allowances. While my flat tax proposal was favorably received at town hall meetings in Pennsylvania, Congress failed to move forward on any tax reform during the 105th Congress. I tried repeatedly to raise the issue with leadership and the Finance Committee to no avail. I think the American people want this debate to move forward and I think the issue of tax reform is ripe for consideration. 
   In this period of opportunity as we commence the 106th Session of Congress, I am optimistic that public support for tax reform will enable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and necessary legislation. That is why today I am again introducing my Flat Tax Act of 1999. 
   My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax code, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This legislation would institute a simple, flat 20% tax rate for all individuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal is not cast in stone, but is intended to move the debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles which are critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness and economic growth. 
   Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat tax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing our nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the study of the complexities of the tax code 40 years ago as a law student at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some. 
   Before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th Congress, I had discussions with Congressman RICHARD ARMEY, the House Majority Leader, about his flat tax proposal. In fact, I testified with House Majority Leader RICHARD ARMEY before the Senate Finance and House Ways & Means Committees, as well as the Joint Economic Committee and the House Small Business Committee on the tremendous benefits of flat tax reform. Since then, and both before and after introducing my original flat tax bill, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at some length, and have engaged in a host of discussions with economists and tax experts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to evaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax. Based on those discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to us, I have concluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20% on all business and personal income can be enacted without reducing 
   federal revenues. 
   A flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow ordinary citizens to have more influence over how their money is spent because they will spend it--not the government. By creating strong incentives for savings and investment, the flat tax will have the  beneficial result of making available larger pools of capital for expansion of the private sector of the economy--rather than more tax money for big government. This will mean more jobs and, just as important, more higher-paying jobs. 
   As a matter of federal tax policy, there has been considerable controversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate particular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be neutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely economic point of view. Our current tax code attempts to use tax policy to direct economic activity. Yet actions under that code have demonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis for tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic purposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to promote. Even when the government responds to particular tax shelters with new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax experts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats by changing the structure of their business transactions and then claiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach and the revised IRS regulations and precedents. 
   Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle between $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close loopholes is a battle the government can never win. Under the flat tax bill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through clever manipulations will become a thing of the past. 
   The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by Professors Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no deductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include in the legislation limited deductions for home mortgage interest for up to $100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American families that they should be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also political practicality. With those two deductions maintained, passage of a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, probably impossible. 
   In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a modified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that the revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19% rate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable governmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19% to 20% to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and charitable deductions. A preliminary estimate in the 104th Congress by the Committee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home interest deduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable deduction at $13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated because the Hall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to business taxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis for concluding that the 1% increase in rate would pay for the two deductions. Revenue estimates for tax code revisions are difficult to obtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from fact situations with myriad assumed variables. It is possible that some modification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue neutrality. 
   This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill introduced in the House by Congressman ARMEY and in the Senate late in 1995 by Senator RICHARD SHELBY, which were both in turn modeled after the Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for enormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so well by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, gifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code can become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into economic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard of living for all Americans. 
   In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing the size and cost of government, and this work is ongoing and vitally important. But the work of downsizing government is only one side of the coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and care, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs and government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace those programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of American society through private investment and job creation--which can have the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans as economic expansion adds to federal revenues. Just as Americans need a tax code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws designed to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer today embodies those principles. 
   My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-Rabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan in four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20% flat tax rate. Second, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions (which will require a 1% higher tax rate than otherwise). Third, my bill would maintain the automatic withholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Lastly, my bill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine our vital efforts to balance the 
   nation's budget. 
   The key advantages of this flat tax plan are three-fold: First, it will dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove much of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and corporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their energies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which rewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth in all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and savings accounts, and as interest rates drop. 
   Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20% on all income they earn from wages, pensions and salaries. Individuals would not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on savings, or dividends--since those items will have already been taxed as part of the flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also eliminate all but two of the deductions and exemptions currently contained within the tax code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to ``personal allowances'' for themselves and their children. The personal allowances are: $10,000 for a single taxpayer; $15,000 for a single head of household; $17,500 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,000 per child or dependent. These personal allowances would be adjusted annually for inflation after 1999. 
   In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low income families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are much higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed under the current tax code. For example in the 1998 tax year, the standard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, $6,250 for a head of household and $7,100 for a married couple filing jointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,700. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does not itemize deductions would pay tax on all income over $17,900 (personal exemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100). By contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that amount. 
   My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of charitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key deductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this legislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a decision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could be used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20%. 
   With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of 20%. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of complicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and  other complexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-simplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, direct expenses and purchases--a system with much less potential for fraud, ``creative accounting'' and tax avoidance. 
   Businesses would be allowed to expense 100% of the cost of capital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures and land, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. The business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company in the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing revenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to re-tax the same monies when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains. 
   Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of the flat tax legislation I am introducing today. 
   The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours each year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations which fill 17,000 pages and have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1995. 
   Whenever the government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it can convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of complexity, frustration and inefficiency. By way of example, most Americans have become familiar with the absurdities of the government's military procurement programs. If these programs have taught us anything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet seat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and restrictions when the government gets involved. The Internal Revenue Service is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a distressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized print-outs claiming that additional taxes are due, which require repeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is determined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first place. 
   The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations and instructions and delete most of the five million words in the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of tens of millions of hours of non-productive time spent in compliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would spend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more time with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules and regulations. 
   The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a small postcard which 
   would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy questions. Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers. 
   Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax bill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary government regulation, bureaucracy and red tape from our everyday lives. The heavy hand of government bureaucracy is particularly onerous in the case of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to extend its influence into so many aspects of our lives. 
   In 1995, the IRS employed 117,000 people, spread out over countless offices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $7 billion, with over $4 billion spent merely on enforcement. By simplifying the tax code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of rules and regulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a significant portion of the IRS budget, including the bulk of the funding now needed for enforcement and administration. 
   In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, energies and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. According to the Tax Foundation, in 1996, the private sector spent over $150 billion complying with federal tax laws. According to a Tax Foundation study, adoption of flat tax reform would cut pre-filing compliance costs by over 90 percent. 
   Monies spent by businesses and investors in creating tax shelters and finding loopholes could be instead directed to productive and job-creating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, the opportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, allowing the government to collect, according to some estimates, over $120 billion annually. 
   The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a tremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson estimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would increase future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value terms, over a seven year period. This translates into over $7,500 in increased wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth also means that there will be more jobs--it is estimated that the $2 trillion increase in wealth would lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs. 
   The economic principles are fairly straightforward. Our current tax system is inefficient; it is biased toward too little savings and too much consumption. The flat tax creates substantial incentives for savings and investment by eliminating taxation on interest, dividends and capital gains--and tax policies which promote capital formation and investment are the best vehicle for creation of new and high paying jobs, and for a greater prosperity for all Americans. 
   It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need not only to eliminate the federal government's reliance on deficits and borrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings and investment that has been the real engine driving American prosperity throughout our history. These concepts are related--the federal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving less for businesses to borrow for investments. 
   It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy that represents the pool of all capital available for investment--in training, education, research, machinery, physical plant, etc.--and that constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics here are daunting. In the 1960s, the net U.S. national savings rate was 8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. Americans save at only one-tenth the rate of the Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate of the Germans. This is unacceptable and we must do something to reverse the trend. 
   An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that although the federal budget deficit is the largest cause of ``dissavings,'' both personal and business savings rates have declined significantly over the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool of capital stock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, we have to do more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very materially raise our levels of private savings and investment. And we have to do so in a way that will not cause additional deficits. 
   The less money people save, the less money is available for business investment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and investment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings accounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and the capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and the financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for saving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since gains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in value, are taxed as if they were profits to the taxpayer. 
   With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax free municipal bonds, our current tax code does virtually nothing to encourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over consumption. This bill will change this system, and address this problem. The proposed legislation reverses the current skewed incentives by promoting savings and investment by individuals and by businesses. Individuals would be able to invest and save their money tax-free and reap the benefits of the accumulated value of those investments without paying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these investments. Businesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed them to expense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology in the year the  expense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax benefits for these investments through complicated depreciation schedules. With greater investment and a larger pool of savings available, interest rates and the costs of investment would also drop, spurring even greater 
   economic growth. 
   Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue losses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives the bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are wrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, but historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues actually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of their take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in pursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes. 
   As one example, under President Kennedy when individual tax rates were lowered, investment incentives including the investment tax credit were created and then expanded and depreciation rates were accelerated. Yet, between 1962 and 1967, gross annual federal tax receipts grew from $99.7 billion to $148 billion--an increase of nearly 50%. More recently after President Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980's, government tax revenues rose from just under $600 billion in 1981 to nearly $1 trillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut program helped to bring about one of the longest peacetime expansion of the U.S. economy in history. There is every reason to believe that the flat tax proposed here can do the same--and by maintaining revenue neutrality in this flat tax proposal, as we have, we can avoid any increases in annual deficits and the national debt. 
   In addition to increasing federal revenues by fostering economic growth, the flat tax can also add to federal revenues without increasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research Service estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals sheltered more than $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and corporations sheltered an additional $60 billion. There may well be additional monies hidden in quasi-legal or even illegal ``tax shelters.'' Under a flat tax system, all tax shelters will disappear and all income will be subject to taxation. 
   The growth case for a flat tax is compelling. It is even more compelling in the case of a tax revision that is simple and demonstrably fair. 
   By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and their dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers will pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and middle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of tax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to shelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also ensure that all Americans pay their fair share. 
   The flat tax legislation that I am offering will retain the element of progressivity that Americans view as essential to fairness in an income tax system. Because of the lower end income exclusions, and the capped deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the effective tax rates under my bill will range from 0% for families with incomes under about $30,000 to roughly 20% for the highest income groups. 
   My proposed legislation demonstrably retains the fairness that must be an essential component of the American tax system. 
   The proposal that I make today is dramatic, but so are its advantages: a taxation system that is simple, fair and designed to maximize prosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages are: 
   Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms and attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.3 billion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance. 
   Cuts Government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS rules, regulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words and 12,000 pages currently. It would also allow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 117,000 employees. 
   Promotes Economic Growth: Economists estimate a growth of over $2 trillion in national wealth over seven years, representing an increase of approximately $7,500 in personal wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth would also lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs. 
   Increases Efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis of productivity rather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to even greater economic expansion. 
   Reduces Interest Rates: Economic forecasts indicate that interest rates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, as the flat tax removes many of the current disincentives to savings. 
   Lowers Compliance Costs: Americans would be able to save up to $224 billion they currently spend every year in tax compliance. 
   Decreases Fraud: As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue annually. 
   Reduces IRS Costs: Simplification of the tax code will allow us to save significantly on the $7 billion annual budget currently allocated to the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years of enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent increase in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and increased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 increase in the personal income of all Americans. 
   No one likes to pay taxes. But Americans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under a system that they believe is fair, a system that they can understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather than prevents growth and prosperity. The legislation I introduce today will afford Americans such a tax system.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, to briefly recapitulate, this amendment seeks to add $1.4 billion to the allocation for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is the crown jewel of the Federal Government, having made really phenomenal advances on medical research in its drive to conquer so many of the maladies confronting mankind today. 
   Last year the budget for NIH was increased by $2 billion and, in the view of the Members, at least the chairman and the ranking, on the appropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services, $2 billion are absolutely necessary by way of increase of the existing budget for NIH, which now is $15.6 billion. There have been really remarkable advances in so many lines, with the research on stem cells having been completed, posing the opportunity for curing so many of the very, very serious ailments. 
   Testimony was given before the appropriations subcommittee that with diseases like Parkinson's, the cure may be in the range of 5 to 10 years. Great strides have been made on Alzheimer's, on cancer, and so many very other serious matters. We have an offset to cover the $1.4 billion by changing the rules on deductibility from the tobacco settlement. 
   Madam President, after consulting with the managers on the second slot, which had been reserved, it is my intention to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on behalf of Senator THURMOND, Senator HATCH, Senator SESSIONS, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator SCHUMER, and myself which would increase the funding to the Department of Justice on the prosecution of gun cases from $5 to $50 million. We have seen examples, in Richmond, VA, in Philadelphia, PA, and in Boston, MA, where gun cases have been handled with great success. This follows the passage in 1984 of the armed career criminal bill which provided that any career criminal, someone with three or four major convictions, found in possession of a firearm, would receive a sentence up to life imprisonment. 
   In 1988, there was an experiment with a program called Trigger Lock in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania which produced extraordinary results, again, focusing on guns. It was a national model. More recently, in Richmond, VA, there has been experience with prosecutions as to guns and also a special program again in 
   the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, coordinated with New Jersey across the river, with $1.5 million going to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and $800,000 to New Jersey--again, very remarkable results. 
   In this year's budget, the Department of Justice has allocated only $5 million to this important function. An important hearing was held on Monday of this week, presided over jointly by Senator THURMOND and Senator SESSIONS, on two Judiciary Committee subcommittees. And there the evidence was very forceful about the effectiveness of this gun program. 
   Madam President, I am not going to offer this amendment at this time, but I did want to utilize just a few moments, as I have, this morning to explain the purpose of the amendment. It will be offered in due course. 
   How much time remains, Madam President?

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I wonder if I might make an inquiry of the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, if I might have the attention of Senator DOMENICI. 
   The second slot was reserved, Mr. Chairman, and has been used for a sense of the Senate on guns, as I have just explained. I wonder if it would be acceptable to the managers if the amendment was sent to the desk and offered at this time, or would it be preferable to wait until a later point to make the submission for the Record?

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been accorded the opportunity to offer this amendment slightly out of turn, and I had already asked my distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, to come to the floor. The amendment is with Senator HARKIN as the principal cosponsor. 
   The thrust of this amendment is to provide the financial base to increase funding in the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion this year. The budget resolution had increased the  budget authority by $600 million. This amendment seeks to increase that budget authority by another $1.4 billion and applies as an offset to the provision to disallow tax deductions from the settlement of cigarettes, which would yield in excess of $1.4 billion, the amount which is covered in this amendment. 
   In November 1998, 46 States agreed to a settlement with the tobacco industry requiring the tobacco companies to pay the States some $206 billion over 25 years. Four other States had settled separate lawsuits with the tobacco companies. The Internal Revenue Service considers those settlement payments as tax deductible business expenses, and this deduction effectively reduces the amount tobacco companies pay by 25 to 30 percent. Obviously, the tobacco companies will write off these payments as business expenses on their Federal tax returns. The amount of funding for next year, the year 2000, is $1.8 billion. 
   When we look for offsets to fund matters like increased funding for the National Institutes of Health, it is obviously a very difficult matter with the type of budget constraints that we are under. And in searching the nooks and crannies of the potential offsets, a very diligent staff came up with the idea that the deductibility of these payments was of lesser public policy importance than to increase the funding for the National Institutes of Health. 
   Now, public policy obviously depends upon someone's vantage point, and to have a change in law that would deny a tax deduction is not easy for anyone concerned. But where you have the kinds of funds that are involved in the tobacco settlement, and where you had a much larger figure being talked about for the Federal settlement, and where you have all of the money going to the States, and the Federal Government doesn't get any of the funds as determined by the emergency appropriations bill that we voted on last week on an amendment that Senator HARKIN and I offered, I think that all factors considered, it is a fair and just and equitable consideration. That is especially true in a context where you have tobacco being the cause of so many major health ailments in the United States. So in searching for a way to find an offset, we have come up with the idea of disallowing this as a tax deduction, which would provide the full funding in fiscal year 2000 for this $1.4 billion. 
   Now, with respect to the justification for increasing NIH funding, Mr. President, I think that is a matter which virtually speaks for itself. The National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. The advances that have been made in the National Institutes of Health covering a range of ailments is just nothing short of marvelous. 
   It is worth just a moment to run through the list of ailments that NIH is studying where such magnificent progress has been made: Alcoholism; Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease; AIDS; arthritis; asthma; autism; cancers of so many different classifications, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers; cystic fibrosis; deafness and communications disorders; dental diseases; diabetes; digestive disease; epilepsy; heart disease; hemophilia; hepatitis; Huntington's disease; kidney ailments; liver disorders; lung disease; macular degeneration; osteoporosis; Parkinson's disease; schizophrenia; scleroderma; stroke; sudden infant death syndrome. That is not even a complete list. 
   I might comment, Mr. President, that the efforts made by various interest groups, where people suffer from a variety of ailments, is really overwhelming as those groups come to Washington 
   to lobby for an increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health. We had a resolution introduced by the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator MACK, several years ago calling for the doubling of NIH over the course of 5 years, and it passed 98-0. 
   Two years ago, when Senator HARKIN and I sought to increase the budget resolution by $1.1 billion, we found it was defeated by 63-37. Last year, when we offered an increase in the budget resolution by $2 billion, it was defeated, my recollection is, by a vote of 57-41. When it comes to translating druthers to dollars, we have not seen the kind of support for NIH funding that I think is really warranted, given all the facts of the case. 
   We have some 19 cosponsors on the resolution to increase funding by some $2 billion. But, in the course of soliciting our colleagues for cosponsorship on this amendment, we found substantially less than that number stepping forward. When it comes to illness, when you have a loved one with Parkinson's, or a parent with Alzheimer's, or a family member with cancer, or one of the ailments yourself such as heart disease, no sum of money within conception is too much, and is really not enough to really move to conquer that disease. At the National Institutes of Health they do perform miracles. 
   In the course of last November, NIH came out with disclosures on research on stem cells, which has the potential to be a veritable fountain of youth. The estimate has been given on Parkinson's disease, to be within the range of conquering Parkinson's within 5 years, perhaps 10 years at the outside. As these stem cells replace other disease cells in the body, the sky is the limit as to what can be accomplished. But all of this takes money. 
   There are still a limited number of research grants which are awarded by the National Institutes of Health, and an increase of $2 billion will be the best spent money which the Federal Government could allocate. 
   We all know we have a budget in excess of $1.7 trillion, a staggering sum of money. And it is a question of priorities. This, I suggest, is at the top of the line. 
   Mr. President, if I may, I see my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN, has come to the floor. But recognition is determined by the Chair, so I simply yield the floor. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I congratulate the Department of Veterans Affairs on its 10th anniversary of becoming a cabinet level department of the federal government. On March 15, 1989, the new Department of Veterans Affairs was established, headed by a Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
   Over the past ten years, VA has worked hard to fulfill its commitments to our nation's veterans by providing benefits and health care to millions of Americans who have given so much to protect and defend our country and its liberties. Among VA's many contributions: VA research scientists and practitioners have led in the advancement of medical research and health care delivery; VA benefits such as home loans, life insurance and educational support have been immensely helpful in transitioning active duty military members back into civilian life; and VA disability payments aid veterans injured in the line of duty as partial compensation by a grateful nation for their many sacrifices. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I will help ensure that VA sustains these many programs to meet the myriad needs of an aging veteran population. I am certain my colleagues share that commitment as well. 
   The mission of the VA, as enunciated by President Abraham Lincoln, is ``To care for him who shall have borne the  battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' Congratulations to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and may it continue to serve our nation well for years to come.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have remained after the conclusion of the vote to comment about the vote and about a very significant historical precedent which was established tonight. The Senate of the United States took up its constitutional responsibility to make a decision as to whether Congressional authority would be given for the United States to commit an act of war in Kosovo following a request by the President of the United States for such a vote. 
   In modern times, we have seen the erosion of the congressional authority to declare war. Tonight in the Senate, we reaffirmed the basic constitutional responsibility and authority of the Congress on that very subject, after the President had made a significant request for authorization to use force. 
   This action tonight follows the situation in January of 1991 when the Congress of the United States authorized the use of force in the Persian Gulf following a similar request by President Bush. I believe that this is of great importance historically as a precedent, to guide the future Presidents, that their authority as Commander in Chief does not extend to involving the United States in war. Where acts of war are involved, it is a matter for the Congress of the United States and not the unilateral action of the President of the United States. 
   On the merits of this evening's vote, it was a very difficult vote. It was the choice of two very undesirable alternatives. In voting aye and supporting the use of force, I chose what I considered to be the lesser of the undesirable alternatives. 
   The President in his letter today said that the United States national interests are clear and significant. I disagree with that conclusion by the President. 
   The President then went on in his letter to amplify those national interests. Yet the absence of a very strong purpose and reason underscores my conclusion that this is an extremely difficult question on U.S. national interests. The President's letter continues, the first line of the second paragraph says, ``The United States national interests are clear and significant.'' The second line says, ``The ongoing effort by President Milosevic to attack and repress the people of Kosovo could ignite a wider European war with dangerous consequences to the United States. This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. If it continues it will push refugees across borders and draw into neighboring countries.'' 
   That is a statement of possibility, but we know that this is intervention by NATO, including the United States, in what is essentially a civil war. The President then went on in the second paragraph to say, ``NATO has authorized airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and to address the threat to peace and security of the Balkan region and Europe.'' 
   The President relies quite substantially upon the ``humanitarian catastrophe'', he may really be saying the use of force for humanitarian purposes, and it may be that this standard is a one which ought to be adopted. But I do suggest that this may be a departure from what has previously been recognized as U.S. policy to use force where there is a vital United States national security interest. If we look for humanitarian catastrophes, we can find them all around the world, and we have been criticized for not doing more at an earlier stage in Bosnia. We have been criticized for not doing more in Rwanda. There have been many criticisms leveled against the United States and the civilized world for not intervening on prior occasions. It may be that with such a thin statement of vital national interests, the authorization to use force in Kosovo really reflects a shifting standard. As the President articulates, ``to prevent a human catastrophe.''

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I filed a resolution for the use of airstrikes in Kosovo. This was essentially a vehicle to move the Senate of the United States to take up the issue of the use of force, to debate it and to decide the question. It has always been my view, as expressed in 1991 in the debate on the use of force in the Persian Gulf and, before that in 1983, where we debated the War Powers Act with respect to deployment of marines in Lebanon, that the constitutional issue of Congress' sole authority to declare war is of paramount importance. 
   I congratulate our leadership today for moving through a procedural morass, where we had a cloture vote--that is, a vote to cut off debate--on the resolution pending by the Senator from  New Hampshire, Senator SMITH. Afterwards, in consultation, this resolution was crafted so the Senate could vote yes or no on this important issue. As noted by others, we did have a bipartisan vote of 58-41 in favor of the use of force, with some 17 Republicans joining 41 Democrats, making a total of 58, and 38 Republicans and 4 Democrats voting in the negative. There is a strong bipartisan showing by these figures. 
   It would have been vastly preferable, Mr. President, had President Clinton taken this issue to the American people at a much earlier stage so the American people could be aware of the consequences of this very, very important decision. The President did address the matter in the opening remarks on his press conference on Friday. 
   I concurred with what the Senator from Delaware said yesterday--when he and I debated or discussed the subject for about a half hour--this was most appropriately a subject for a 30-minute Presidential speech. The president should lay out the issue in great detail. There is a large concern on my part, and on the part of many others, that the American people are not really prepared for the consequences as to what may occur in Kosovo. There have been forceful statements that the risks are very, very high, and that the air defenses in Serbia are very strong. 
   It is important that the American people understand the substantial risks involved so we do not retreat as we did in Somalia. The way to guard against that is to build up a public understanding as to what the scenario is in Kosovo with as forceful an articulation as possible, and I repeat, much more forceful than the President's letter today. The President should articulate in great detail about the savagery of the assaults on people and the brutality and the ethnic cleansing which has gone on in Kosovo. Those details, I think, are a concern to the American people but they have not been stated in a way which really brings forth the magnitude of the human catastrophe in Kosovo so the American people would be willing to accept and undertake the risks that are involved in this matter. 
   But all of that is prologue. Now we have the authorization by the Senate for the use of force. On a very difficult question, I think it is the lesser of the undesirable alternatives, and featuring prominently is the desire of keeping NATO intact. We seem to have more support from our European allies on this matter than at any time in the past. Our precarious position on NATO has occurred because the administration has moved us into a position without congressional authorization to an executive commitment really, in effect, to support the NATO decision to use force in Kosovo. 
   To that extent, so that we do not have a breach of making NATO look bad and do not have a breach of making the United States look bad, which would in effect be a backdown, we are in a sense backing into the issue. But the more important aspect is the fact that the President did come to the Senate. 
   I was interested in the discussion with our distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and to hear his comment where he had expressed to the President today the view that the President should not lean so heavily on Presidential prerogatives but should ask the Congress of the United States for authority to use force. The President has done so. 
   Now we have a very significant precedent which should be a clarion call to future Presidents not to exercise their authority as Commander in Chief and unilaterally engage the United States in war. The President should take this issue to the Congress of the United States and to the American people. The President should do this at an early time so the issue can be fully debated, not on a short time limit, as we had this evening. 
   It must be a source of some wonderment to people who were watching on C-SPAN II to see such an important issue debated in such a brief period of time with 2 minutes allotted to Senators to speak on the subject and 1 minute taken by the manager, the Senator from Delaware. There had been extensive debate yesterday, but we could have used even more time. Unfortunately, we were caught in the press with the budget resolution, which is first on the docket for tomorrow. 
   I thank the Chair for setting this extra overtime. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I broach this subject gingerly, as we have shared many hours together on the train ride from Washington to Wilmington, where he departs. He should go to Philadelphia, but he gets off at Wilmington. I sent the Senator a note, as he was in the middle of his discourse and I would not want to interrupt him if he chose to proceed with the line he had. However, there are a number of subjects that I think would be useful to discuss with the distinguished Senator from Delaware because he and I have discussed foreign policy, as well as many other subjects, on many occasions. We have agreed on many subjects--not always--and on many of our judgments. 
   The first subject that is on my mind is on the use of force in Kosovo. Specifically, the level of public understanding and support which is present at the moment. Senator BIDEN and I, along with 29 others, attended a meeting in the Oval Office on Friday to discuss the situation in Kosovo. The general concern uniformly present, was the level of public understanding of this issue and the level of public support, and the question of how much public support we needed in order to undertake these airstrikes. That would be the first subject on which I would be very interested in the views of the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield for a follow-up question, when the Senator from Delaware spoke at the meeting last Friday, he referred to the issue of the likelihood of casualties. When I had an opportunity to speak, I did, too. We both made the same point, although you made yours with more emphasis, which is not uncharacteristic. 
   I suggested to the President----

   Mr. SPECTER. It is a compliment. 
   I suggested to the President that he be very direct on the problems and the risks, because if there is to be public understanding, the public ought to be informed about the risks. 
   When the Senator from Delaware spoke, and he has repeated it today so it is not something I am telling out of  a quasi-private meeting, he used the word ``probably,'' as opposed to the word ``possibly.'' The Senator and others including myself all emphasized the point that there had to be public awareness as to what was going on in Kosovo. 
   The President has made a start. He led off his news conference with the topic, but he did not give a 30-minute speech in detail. That would be a short speech considering the complexity of this subject. This which raises the question as to what is the level of public understanding, which I think is a very important factor in letting me go to a second subject, if I may. 
   The first part of this is hypothetical. If the President knew he would get an affirmative vote in a resolution from Congress on the use of force in Kosovo would he be wise to seek it? Would it strengthen his hand to have an affirmative vote? I, as the Senator from Delaware, do not like to deal with hypotheticals, but we have to on some occasions. So I ask my colleague about his view as to whether the President would welcome an affirmative vote if he knew he would get one, and would his hand be strengthened if he had congressional authorization before he took military action.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield again, first, I can confirm the contentious meeting. In fact, I can confirm that the Senator from Delaware was present in many contentious meetings, not only with President Bush but others. Those were the meetings where some light was shed. 
   I was interested to note the generational difference by the Senator from Delaware, and he indeed associated himself with the Vietnam war. I would choose to associate myself with the Persian Gulf war.

   Mr. SPECTER. I don't want to move to a generation older. I would like to move to a generation younger. 
   When my colleague talked about submitting a resolution, he was very artful, as he always is. He said it will be constitutionally wise and politically necessary. Then he moved on to say that he believes the President has a constitutional duty, although an 
   argument could be made on the other side. As usual, the Senator from Delaware anticipated the next line of inquiry as to whether this military action is an act of war. I believe this is a subject which really could use some elaboration and some discussion between not only the Senator from Delaware and myself but others in this not totally filled Chamber. 
   When the Senator from Delaware refers to the pending amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, and the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator SMITH, I believe the Senator from Delaware will be interested to know that the majority leader had looked for an approach where a substitute might be offered by the leader of the Democrats and where a substitute might be offered by Senator LOTT. 
   It may well be that Senator LOTT would be interested and perhaps agreeable--obviously, I cannot speak for Senator LOTT --to having the Biden amendment proposed as he has articulated. There might be an agreement by the majority leader, which I would certainly endorse, to have an up-down vote without a two-stage procedure and without having to go to a cloture vote. 
   For the people who are watching on C-SPAN II, a cloture vote means that there would be a vote to try and limit the debate. It requires a supermajority of 60. This would enable us to vote on the resolution, however it is articulated. 
   There are three items on which I would like the response of the Senator from Delaware. Let me name them and then come back to the one. Let me name them in inverse order. 
   Should we have the vote strictly on a resolution without a two-step procedure, as the Senator from Delaware articulates it? 
   Question No. 2: What are the considerations? 
   What is the argument that he doesn't have to come to Congress, that we are not implicating a constitutional requirement for congressional authorization to undertake this military action, if it is an act of war? 
   Let me deal with the most immediate question; that is this business of a cloture vote. I am, frankly, a little surprised to see the necessity to go to a cloture vote, although I do not question anybody who seeks to. I really do question this particular cloture vote. It might be something that is worth discussing, whether it is appropriate to have a filibuster over the issue of the use of force. A matter of this magnitude which involves a Constitutional authority, separation of powers, a provision of the Constitution of which there is none any more important. 
   So let me specify the question for the consideration of the Senator. Is it appropriate for a filibuster to be staged to bar the Senate from voting on whether to authorize or deny the President authority to use force?

   Mr. SPECTER. It may be we can move ahead and structure a freestanding resolution which has been discussed, maybe two resolutions, one by Senator DASCHLE on behalf of the Democrats, one by Senator LOTT on behalf of the Republicans, and vote. 
   But let me come to the question that I think is by far the most important, which the Senator from Delaware had broached. That is the question about whether there is a constitutional requirement for congressional authorization. 
   As I look at the proposed military action, what has been described constitutes an act of war. The Constitution gives the President extensive authority, as Commander in Chief, but gives the Congress the sole authority to involve the United States of America in war--to have a declaration of war. That constitutional authority by Congress has been very, very significantly eroded. 
   Korea is perhaps the best example. I had occasion recently to pick up Margaret Truman's biography on President Truman and, seeing at least her version as to what President Truman faced in 1950, I wondered if the positions I have taken have been correct. But I stand by them, that there ought not to be the use of force without congressional authorization. The use of force was authorized prior to the Gulf war in a historic debate which occurred on this floor back on January 10, 11 and 12 of 1991. 
   I agree with the distinguished Senator from Delaware when he says the Members of Congress like to avoid votes on these issues. 
   We faced an imminent airstrike last February in Iraq, February of 1998, and we chose not to decide the issue. At that time airstrikes were not made. In December of 1998, the Congress had ample opportunity to decide the question about airstrikes which did occur in mid-December over Iraq. Again, the Congress decided not to take up the issue. When we took up the issue of use of force in 1991, it came in a very unusual procedure, where the Senator from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, raised a procedural point the day we swore in Senators who were elected or reelected in November of 1990, so we took up the question. 
   So my view--and I have expressed it a number of times on this subject--is that however the matter is resolved, it ought to be resolved by the Congress. This subject has not really had the appropriate kind of discussion and debate. 
   So, I now ask the question in a specific form to the Senator from Delaware. What are the arguments in favor of the President's position not to require congressional authority? Does the Senator from Delaware agree with the proposition that I have articulated, that the Constitution does require Congressional authority before military force is used in bombing in Kosovo?

   Mr. SPECTER. Which is one of the grave difficulties of having a resolution which prohibits Presidential action, but tries to accommodate to some special circumstance. In the articulation of the circumstances, it renders it absolutely meaningless and gives such latitude to the President, which may well be more latitude than he has under the Constitution. 
   I come back for purposes of a question, which I am about to ask, what the Senator from Delaware has had to say about the many occasions where force has been used, where acts of war have been undertaken. I agree totally that simply a recitation of those occasions does not establish a constitutional norm. One of the grave difficulties is that as the Congress sits silent, the Senate sits silent again and again and again. There has been such a total erosion of the constitutional requirement that the Congress has the authority to declare war. The situation as to emergency, which is used so frequently to justify Presidential action, is totally absent here. 
   This may be the clearest kind of case which we have seen where there has been time for a Congress to deliberate, to consider, and to act. I believe that the missile strikes in December of 1998 against Iraq should have required prior congressional authorization. But an argument can be made, tenuous as it is, that we are still operating under the resolution for the use of force from January of 1991. I think it is wrong, but one can make that argument. 
   When you talk about Libya, you may talk about the element of surprise, injecting some element of emergency. I do not want to get involved as to whether that is justifiable or not. But if you take the present circumstance, where the situation of Kosovo has been building up for days, weeks, and months, and where there has been ample opportunity for the issue to be considered by the Congress and where the President has not taken the case to the American people, and where debate in the Senate only draws three Senators--we are honored the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has joined us. 
   I join what the Senator from Delaware has had to say about the debate we had on the War Powers Act in 1983, where I asked then-chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Percy, a series of questions as to whether Korea was an act of war, or Vietnam was an act of war, developing at that time a requirement for constitutional authorization. 
   We then had a very spirited debate with the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Delaware, the then-Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, and many others on January 10 and 11 in 1991. That is the kind of consideration we ought to have now. 
   I believe it is possible we can articulate a resolution like the resolution of the distinguished Senator from Delaware so you do not have the prohibition and all these exceptions clauses where we do not know what we are talking about. If you have a resolution denying the use of funds and then exceptions, it is totally unintelligible. 
   If we have to delay the budget resolution, this matter is of sufficient importance that we can do the budget resolution next week. We might impede upon the recess. We can get that done and have the kind of debate we need. 
   I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding and for the erudition which he has brought to this subject, as he teaches constitutional law and talks about this substantive matter to acquaint the American people as to what the constitutional law requires. I yield back to him so he can go on with his speech. I want to hear the substance as to why he thinks we ought to be undertaking these military strikes as a matter of national security, as a matter of national policy, as a matter of vital national interest, especially in the context where he says that the American people are not really informed, they are not really in a position to be supportive of this matter at this time.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we face a matter of utmost seriousness as events are evolving with respect to Kosovo and the massing of a large amount of Serbian troops about to strike imminently, according to all reports. Ethnic cleansing is already being undertaken in the form of brutal attacks on people in Kosovo. Large numbers of people--according to media reports; and since confirmed--were lined up, asked to kneel, pistols placed behind their heads, and executed in cold-blooded murder. This follows a pattern of ethnic cleansing which has gone on for many years in Bosnia. 
   The United States is considering, in conjunction with NATO forces, air attacks. In the context of what is likely to go on in Kosovo, these are in fact, acts of war which call for authorization by the Congress of the United States under the U.S. Constitution. 
   We have seen in modern times this constitutional mandate violated by unilateral action by the President, arguably under his authority as Commander in Chief. It is true that he has substantial authority as Commander in Chief to act in times of emergency, but when Congress has an opportunity to deliberate and to consider the issue, it  is the congressional authority and congressional responsibility to act if the United States is to be engaged in war. 
   Presidents are traditionally reluctant--unwilling really--to come to the Congress to ask for authorization because they do not want to make any concessions about what they consider to be their unilateral authority as Commander in Chief. That, in fact, was the tact taken by President Bush when he declined to come to Congress to ask for a resolution authorizing the use of force in 1991. 
   However, debate was undertaken. We had historic debates on this floor on January 10, 11, and 12. Finally, a resolution was passed in the House and passed in the Senate. The resolution which passed here was by a very narrow margin of 52-47. But the hand of the President was strengthened immeasurably by the congressional action. 
   We have seen the brutal historical fact of life that a war cannot be maintained--such as the Vietnam war--without public and congressional support. There was a Senate briefing yesterday by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Adviser, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outlining a number of the issues relating to possible military action in Kosovo. This morning, President Clinton met with a large group of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in a session which lasted approximately 2 hours, going over a great many of these issues. 
   I believe it is fair to say that although there has been some dissent, most of those in attendance stated that they believe that acting against Serbia, a sovereign nation, in the context of this case does constitute an act of war and should require congressional authorization. I commend our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, for taking steps today after that meeting occurred to try to bring this issue to a vote. 
   There is an amendment pending on the supplemental appropriations bill stating that there should not be airstrikes taken by the administration without prior congressional authority. I believe this is a very sound proposition. 
   In my view, it is very important that there be a national debate, and that there be an understanding by the American people of precisely what is involved if we undertake airstrikes in Kosovo. This is not a matter where the airstrikes can be limited to missile strikes which do not put Americans in harm's way. If there are airstrikes with aircraft, considering all of the factors at play here, there is a very, very serious risk of casualties. That is something which none of us takes lightly. Certainly the 
   American people are very reluctant, as the American people should be, to see those kinds of risks undertaken; and the Congress is very reluctant--really, unwilling--to take those risks unless there is a clear statement of what our national interests are. And if they warrant that kind of military action. 
   The Constitution gives the sole authority to involve the U.S. Military in war to the Congress of the United States. One of the problems with this issue is that too often when confronted, there is a tendency on the part of the Congress--candidly--to duck. In February of 1998 when missile strikes were imminent against Iraq, they never came to pass. The Congress had an opportunity to debate and act on the issue and decided not to act. 
   Last fall, and again this past December, we had missile strikes against Iraq and, again, the Congress of the United States had an opportunity and authority to face up to that issue and decided not to act. Now, with the imminence of military action in Kosovo, in my view, it is imperative that this issue be debated by the Senate. It has been debated by the House of Representatives and they had a narrow, but favorable vote--a close vote--supporting peacekeepers, conditioned on a peace agreement being entered into. The agreement has not since happened, so that resolution is really irrelevant at this point. 
   But it is my hope that when the President addresses the Nation this afternoon at 4 o'clock, as he is scheduled to do, that will trigger a very extensive national debate. That is not the kind of debate that is going to be triggered by one Senator in an empty Senate Chamber speaking on C-SPAN 2, but the American people need to know what is involved. They need to know that there are risks involved, and there has to be the formulation of a national judgment to undertake this risk if we are, in fact, to move forward. 
   I have found in my contacts with people from my State of Pennsylvania that the people do not yet understand Bosnia, do not understand why we are there. We have the bitter experience of Somalia, when we saw the television picture of American soldiers being dragged through the streets, and we beat a hasty retreat. 
   We ought not to undertake military action in Kosovo unless we are prepared for the eventualities. I think it is a very useful matter to have the issue formulated in the Senate, to have debate on Monday and Tuesday, to follow up on the President's presentation, and to make a determination as to what our national policy should be. While bearing in mind that it is the role of the Congress to authorize the use of force if, in fact, it is to be undertaken. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I found on my desk this morning a ``Dear Colleague'' letter entitled, ``Oppose the Specter-Harkin Amendment That Seizes $123 Billion in State Funds.'' 
   Instead of outlining the provisions of the Specter-Harkin amendment, I would just refer my colleagues to this ``Dear Colleague'' letter signed by the opponents, and tell them that the amendment is exactly contrary to what is in this ``Dear Colleague'' letter, so that by reading the letter, they can just conclude the opposite, and they will have a statement of what the pending amendment is. 
   Before dealing in detail with the ``Dear Colleague'' letter, or this misstatement, permit me to outline in very general terms that the pending amendment has been offered by the chairmen and ranking members of the two Senate committees which are charged with authorization of appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. Senator JEFFORDS, the chairman of the authorizing committee, and Senator KENNEDY, the ranking member, are cosponsors of the amendment which has been offered by Senator HARKIN, the ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee which has the responsibility for appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, and the subcommittee which I have the honor to Chair. 
   We must survey--the four of us in our positions as chairmen and ranking members--the health needs of America in a very, very constrained budget. We have seen the budget resolution, which  has come out of Budget Committee, and the limitations on discretionary funding. Our subcommittee has the responsibility for funding not only the Department of Health and Human Services, but also the Department of Education and the Department of Labor, where so many vital programs for worker safety are involved. 
   So our responsibility is a very heavy one. As we have observed, the settlement with the States is in excess of some $200 billion over a 25-year period. The thought immediately came to mind that these funds, which have been obtained from settlements on tobacco issues, could be used and should be used in very large part, frankly, if not entirely, for health purposes. 
   In the Appropriations Committee meeting, an amendment was offered by the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, to have the Federal Government relinquish all claims to these funds, and have these funds paid entirely to the State governments. 
   I can understand the popularity of this kind of an amendment. 
   It is backed by all 50 Governors; it would be shocking if it weren't. It is backed by all 50 State legislatures; it would be shocking if it weren't. It is backed by all State attorneys general; again, it would be shocking if it were not. 
   I support the proposition that there ought to be minimal strings, minimal requirements mandated by the Federal Government, especially in the context where we mandate requirements and do not fund them. 
   Last week, we passed the Ed-Flex bill to give flexibility to the States. But I submit to you that it is fundamentally different to say that where there are Federal appropriations for a specific purpose, there ought to be latitude for State governments and local governments to figure out how to spend those funds, contrasted with saying that all of $200 billion-plus ought to go to the States to spend as they choose, when some States have already made an announcement that they intend to use these funds, at least in part, for highway construction or for debt retirement. 
   When a settlement is reached on matters of this sort by State governments and officials representing the States, those funds realistically are impressed with the trust, where the claims are brought because of damages due to public health, due to tobacco. There is a specific purpose that the lawsuits were started, and that was to redress public claims on these important areas. Even without a Federal direction limiting, in some way, or articulating a portion of these funds to go for medical purposes, it is my legal judgment that those funds are impressed with the trust. I would not be surprised to see that, if the State governments undertake spending on items far afield, they may face a class action or taxpayer suits or people who have been injured by tobacco seeking to impress that trust. 
   We had a hearing in the appropriations subcommittee this Monday. Our subcommittee took up the issue on an emergency basis to try to see if we could find some area for resolution. We heard testimony from the Governor of Kentucky and the attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Texas, and Iowa. Those four witnesses all emphasized the desirability of having some resolution of this issue so that they could make plans for their budgets. 
   I agree with that proposition. A very forceful letter was filed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, strenuously objecting to having the money paid over to the States, because the Federal law gives her the authority to make an allocation as to how much of those funds should be deducted from the Federal obligation to the States on Medicaid. 
   The States have the obligation under Federal law to sue to collect on claims that Medicaid has. And the States have the authority--and exercise the authority--to release the tobacco companies from liability to the Federal Government. That is provided for under existing Federal law. So for those who say that the Federal Government can bring lawsuits, it simply is not so, because those claims have all been released. 
   It may be, Mr. President, that we are in an area where largely, if not entirely, the States will recognize the duty to use these settlement proceeds for tobacco-related purposes. The distinguished attorney general of Pennsylvania, Mike Fisher, who testified on Monday, outlined a program for the use by Pennsylvania of $11.3 billion. I believe that, in conjunction with our distinguished Governor Tom Ridge, there will be a program to use these funds for tobacco-related purposes. But it is not sufficient to say that States may recognize this obligation, because States may not recognize the obligation, as we have already seen from preliminary indications of spending these funds on unrelated purposes--debt reduction and highway construction. 
   In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that has been circulated today, which I referred to earlier, the statement is made:  
   The Specter-Harkin amendment will require every Governor--each year--for the next 25 years to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend fifty percent of the State's own money.  
   That is flatly wrong. 
   It is true that there is a 20-percent requirement for smoking cessation education to try to dissuade youngsters from smoking and a 30-percent requirement on medical plans. But there is no need for Governors to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend that money, that 50 percent. That is a matter where the Governors only have to tell the Department of Health and Human Services how the money was spent after in fact it is spent. They don't have to submit a plan, and they don't have to ask for prior authorization. 
   The ``Dear Colleague'' letter further says:  
   This is a classic ``Washington Knows Best'' policy, an unprecedented Federal power grab.  
   In a sense, it is complimentary to call it an ``unprecedented Federal power grab.'' Considering all the Federal power grabs that have been recorded historically, this is really a gentle nudge to the States, saying that here we have funds realized from a tobacco settlement with a statement of policy that 50 percent ought to be used for a specific purpose. 
   On the 50 percent, it is actually on the low side. The facts show that some 50 percent of the funds involved here come from Medicaid, so that the percentage could have been substantially higher. 
   So, Mr. President, it is my hope that we will have a statement of congressional policy on this vote today which will, in a very gentle way, without regulations, without the requirement of submitting the plan to Washington, simply say to the Governors that at least 50 percent ought to be used for tobacco-related purposes, such as education to discourage children from smoking, where we see a very high rate of juvenile smoking and overwhelming statistics of deaths resulting from juvenile smoking--where we have a reasonable amount allocated for that educational purpose, and a reasonable amount--some 30 percent--allocated not only for public health measures but also for aiding smoking cessation.

   Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. President, in response to the comments by the distinguished majority leader on the obligation under this amendment to submit a plan, it is simply not so; States do not have to submit the plan to the Federal Government. All the States have to do is submit a ``report'' which shows how the funds ``have been spent.'' So there is no obligation to submit a plan. 
   When the distinguished majority leader talks about the temerity of the Federal Government, there is enough temerity on all sides to go around. But that is not the issue here. The States brought the lawsuits, because that is what the law requires, and the States have an obligation to abide by the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who makes the allocation. 
   Here we have litigation which has brought a settlement on tobacco-related causes. This is a modest approach on spending, indicating broad standards for State compliance, and only 50 percent related to tobacco. If no legislation were enacted on specifics, these funds would certainly be impressed with the trust. 
   When the majority leader talks about spending the funds for juvenile detention, that is very important. But that is simply not related to tobacco. When there is talk about using it for debt reduction of the States, that is very important. But it is not related to tobacco causes. These are funds produced from a tobacco settlement, and if the States do not use these funds in this way, my legal judgment is that these funds are impressed with a trust enforceable by any citizen of the State. But this is an accommodation which will allow a reasonable amount of the moneys to be used for tobacco-related purposes. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in conclusion--the most popular words of any speech--this proposal is a very modest approach on a multibillion-dollar--$200 billion--settlement that has been brought by the chairmen and ranking members of the committees in the Senate charged with allocating funds for Health and Human Services. There is no plan which has to be submitted by the Governors. That is repeated again and again. All the Governors have to do is say how they will spend the money. I agree with the principle of leaving maximum flexibility to the States when we make allocations. But this is for a generalized purpose, and that is all we are asking for here. In light of the very substantial budgetary shortfalls, this money ought to be used, at least in part, 50 percent for the purposes of solving the problems caused by tobacco. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chairman. I will participate. I want to make just a couple of comments. 
   Mr. President, the Kosovo matter again raises the issue about the respective power of Congress under the Constitution, the sole authority to declare war, and the authority of the President as Commander in Chief. This is a recurrent theme of consideration. 
   Within the course of the past year, we faced the issue of airstrikes, which were anticipated against Iraq in February of 1998. At that time, I wrote the President, and spoke on the floor of the Senate calling on the President to seek congressional authority, if action was contemplated there, because an airstrike was an act of war and only the Congress of the United States has the authority to involve the Nation in war. 
   There are circumstances where the President has to act in emergency situations, where as Commander in Chief he must act in the absence of an opportunity for congressional consideration. At that time, there was adequate opportunity for congressional consideration. However, it was not undertaken, and that incident passed without any military action. We then had the events of this past mid-December where airstrikes were launched on Iraq. Again, on that occasion, I had written to the President of the United States urging that he make a presentation to the Congress as to what he wanted to do. Again, airstrikes constitute an act of war, and we have learned from the bitter experience of Vietnam that we cannot successfully undertake a war without the support of the American people. And the first action to obtain that support is from the Congress of the United States. 
   We have now been in Bosnia for a protracted period of time. Originally, this was supposed to be a limited engagement. That has been extended. Congress enacted legislation to cut off funds under certain contingencies. That has all lapsed, and we remain in Bosnia with very substantial expenditures. Fortunately, there has not been military action. So although there have been some casualties, it has not been as a result of a conflict. 
   We are looking at a situation in Kosovo which is enormously serious. I, again, urge the President of the United States to make a presentation to the Congress as to what he would like to undertake. The House of Representatives, by a fairly narrow vote, authorized some limited use of force in Kosovo. The headline featured was ``President Gets Support That He Had Not Asked For''. Presidents are very reluctant to come to the Congress with a request for authorization, because that may be interpreted to dilute their authority to act as Commander in Chief unilaterally without congressional authority.  
   I had filed a resolution on the use of force with missile and airstrikes, which would involve minimal risk and strike where there are no U.S. personnel placed in harm's way. I did that really to stimulate debate by Congress on what authorization there should be. But it is more than a matter of notification. The administration talks of notification, and very frequently even notification is a virtual nullity coming at a time when Congress has no opportunity to really be involved in the decision making process. 
   I can recall back in mid-April of 1986 when President Reagan ordered the airstrike on Libya. The consultation was had--really notification, not consultation, the difference being that if you notify, you are simply telling Congress what has happened. If you consult, that has the implication that there may be some response from the administration depending on the congressional reaction. Both are vastly short of authorization, which is what the Constitution requires on a declaration of war. 
   But, in any event, in mid-April of 1986, congressional leaders were summoned to be told that the planes were in flight. There was a meeting with many Senators shortly after the attack occurred, there was quite an interesting debate between the Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, and Secretary of State Schultz as to whether Congress could have had any effect, or whether congressional leaders could have had any effect, if they wanted to have an impact on that situation. 
   But when we take a look at what is happening now in Kosovo with a massing of forces, and we take a look at the terrain, we take a look at the air defense, we may be involved in more than missile strikes. And it is one thing to support missile strikes. It is quite another thing to support airstrikes. It all depends upon the facts and the circumstances in situations where the Congress needs to know more, and the American people need to know a great deal more. 
   So it is my hope that the President will address this issue, will tell the Congress of the United States what he would like to do in Kosovo, seek authorization from the Congress, and tell the American people what he has in mind. 
   I know from my contacts in my State of 12 million people that Pennsylvanians do not have much of an idea about what is involved in Kosovo. And there are very, very serious ramifications and questions as to what our posture would be with NATO, if we do not join NATO forces on something which is agreed to there. But, when nations of NATO act, they do not have our Constitution. They are aware of our Constitution. They are aware of the provisions of our Constitution, that only the Congress can declare war. 
   So if there is not congressional support, if there is not congressional action, they are on notice that they do not have a commitment in the Congress of the United States, a Constitutional commitment in the United States, to act. What the President may do unilaterally, of course, is a matter which has always been a little ahead of the process. It is a fact that frequently Congress sits by and awaits Presidential action. 
   If it is a success, fine. If it is a failure, then there may be someone to blame--the President, not the Congress. 
   But it is my hope the President will come to the Congress, tell the Congress what it is he wants, tell the American people what it is the President thinks ought to be done so we can have an understanding as to what is involved here. So we can have an understanding as to what the risks are, what the objectives are, what the end game is, and what the exit strategy is. Then we can make a rational decision. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a bill that would allow states to pass laws limiting the import of waste from other states. Addressing the interstate shipment of solid waste is a top environmental priority for millions of Americans, millions of Pennsylvanians and for me. As you are aware, Congress came very close to enacting legislation to address this issue in 1994, and the Senate passed interstate waste and flow control legislation in May, 1995 by an overwhelming 94-6 margin, only to see it die in the House of Representatives. I am confident that with the strong leadership of my colleagues Chairman CHAFEE and Senator SMITH, we can get quick action on a strong waste bill and pressure the House to conclude this effort once and for all. 
   As you are aware, the Supreme Court has put us in the position of having to intervene in the issue of trash shipments. In recent years, the Court has struck down State laws restricting the importation of solid waste from other jurisdictions under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The only solution is for Congress to enact legislation conferring such authority on the States, which would then be Constitutional. 
   It is time that the largest trash exporting States bite the bullet and take substantial steps towards self-sufficiency for waste disposal. The legislation passed by the Senate in the 103rd and 104th Congresses would have provided much-needed relief to Pennsylvania, which is by far the largest importer of out-of-State waste in the nation. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 3.9 million tons of out-of-State municipal solid waste entered Pennsylvania in 1993, rising to 4.3 million tons in 1994, 5.2 million in 1995, and a record 6.3 million tons from out-of-State in 1996 and 1997, which are the most recent statistics available. Most of this trash came from New York and New Jersey, with New York responsible for 2.7 million tons and New Jersey responsible for 2.4 million tons in 1997, representing 82 percent of the municipal solid waste imported into Pennsylvania. 
   This is not a problem limited to one small corner of my State. Millions of tons of trash generated in other States find their final resting place in more than 50 landfills throughout Pennsylvania. 
   Now, more than ever, we need legislation which will go a long way toward resolving the landfill problems facing Pennsylvania, Indiana, and similar waste importing States. I am particularly concerned by the developments in New York, where Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani have announced the closure of the City's one remaining landfill, Fresh Kills, in 2001. I am advised that 13,200 tons per day of New York City trash are sent there and that Pennsylvania is a likely destination once Fresh Kills begins its shut-down. 
   On several occasions, I have met with country officials, environmental groups, and other Pennsylvanians to discuss the solid waste issue specifically, and it often comes up in the public open house town meetings I conduct in all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. I came away from those meetings impressed by the deep concerns expressed by the residents of communities which host a landfill rapidly filing up with the refuse of millions of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans whose States have failed to adequately manage the waste they generate. 
   Recognizing the recurrent problem of landfill capacity in Pennsylvania, since 1989 I have pushed to resolve the interstate waste crisis. I have introduced legislation with my late colleague, Senator JOHN HEINZ, and then with former Senator Dan Coats along with cosponsors from both sides of the aisle which would have authorized States to restrict the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in any landfill or incinerator within its jurisdiction. I was pleased when 
   many of the concepts in our legislation were incorporated in the Environment and Public Works Committee's reported bills in the 103rd and 104th Congresses, and I supported these measures during floor consideration. 
   During the 103rd Congress, we encountered a new issue with respect to municipal solid waste--the issue of waste flow control authority. On May 16, 1994, the Supreme Court held (6-3) in Carbone versus Clarkstown that a flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated waste management facility, violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In striking down the Clarkstown ordinance, the Court stated that the ordinance discriminated against interstate commerce by allowing only the favored operator to process waste that is within the town's limits. As a result of the Court's decision, flow control ordinances in Pennsylvania and other States are considered unconstitutional. 
   I have met with county commissioners who have made clear that this issue is vitally important to the local governments in Pennsylvania and my office has, over the past years received numerous phone calls and letters from individual Pennsylvania counties and municipal solid waste authorities that support waste flow control legislation. Since 1988, flow control has been the primary tool used by Pennsylvania counties to enforce solid waste plans and meet waste reduction and recycling goals or mandates. Many Pennsylvania jurisdictions have spent a considerable amount of public funds on disposal facilities, including upgraded sanitary landfills, state-of-the-art resource recovery facilities, and co-composting facilities. In the absence of flow control authority, I am advised that many of these worthwhile projects could be jeopardized and that there has been a fiscal impact on some communities where there are debt service obligations. 
   In order to fix these problems, my legislation would provide a presumptive ban on all out-of-state municipal solid waste, including construction and demolition debris, unless a landfill obtains the agreement of the local government to allow for the importation of waste. It would provide a freeze authority to allow a State to place a limit on the amount of out-of-state waste received annually at each facility. It would also provide a ratchet authority to allow a State to gradually  reduce the amount of out-of-state municipal waste that may be received at facilities. These provisions will provide a concrete incentive for the largest states to get a handle on their solid waste management immediately. To address the problem of flow control my bill would provide authority to allow local governments to designate where privately collected waste must be disposed. This would be a narrow fix for only those localities that constructed facilities before the 1994 Supreme Court ruling and who relied on their ability to regulate the flow of garbage to pay for their municipal bonds. 
   This is an issue that affects numerous states, and I urge my colleagues to support this very important legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to require that the States allocate a portion of the funds recovered under the tobacco settlement for purposes relating to tobacco--smoking cessation education for children, 20 percent; and some 30 percent to be allocated for public health matters. 
   The origin of this issue arose when there was a settlement in November of last year where 46 States agreed to accept $206 billion over 25 years. The settlement grew out of lawsuits that primarily sought the recovery of Medicaid costs, although there is a contention that there were some other allegations in the cause of action. The current law requires the States to share Medicaid recoveries from third parties with the Federal Government. The Federal Government's share of Medicaid costs is generally 57 percent, but varies from State to State. 
   Under the existing law, only the States have the authority to bring suits for the recoveries. During the course of the litigation, the States, as I understand the legal documents, released all of the claims which the Federal Government would have for these Medicaid funds. An amendment to the appropriations bill was offered by the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, to provide that all of the funds would be paid over to the States, specifically prohibiting the Federal Government's recoupment of funds recovered by States from the tobacco companies. 
   At the appropriations markup, some concerns were expressed by this Senator and by others. On Monday of this week, March 15, we held a hearing, participated in by Senator HUTCHISON and myself, where we heard from the Governor of Kentucky and the attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Texas, and Iowa. At that time, the assertion was made by the Governor and the three attorneys general that all of these funds should be retained by the States, and a representation made that there were other claims involved in the settlement besides Medicaid funds. 
   Senator HARKIN and I worked together to craft the amendment which is now before the Senate, joined, as I noted, by Senator JEFFORDS and Senator KENNEDY; Senator HARKIN and I taking the lead because of our positions as chairman and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   It is a fact that we are very limited in the funding which is available for health care. Our subcommittee has a budget which has to be divided among education matters and also the Department of Labor, which implicates many issues of worker safety, so that every dollar is of vital importance and we must make an application to purposes of health care. 
   The problem of tobacco in America is well recognized and the statistics are really very, very stark. Some 400,000 people die each year from tobacco-related illnesses. Approximately 5 million Americans under 18 are projected to die from smoking if the current trend continues. Some $72 billion a year constitute the health care expenditures in the United States on tobacco-related illnesses; some $7.3 billion annually total Medicaid payments directly related to tobacco, and between $1.4 and $4 billion constitute expenditures for infant health and developmental problems caused by mothers who smoke. It is a matter of overwhelming importance. 
   There is a very pervasive mantra in America today that the Federal Government should not dictate to the States how the funds are to be used. In accordance with the principles of federalism, I believe in leaving as much control as is possible to the State governments and also to local governments, as they carry out their responsibilities. 
   But when you have a very major settlement involving $206 billion and where the Federal Government has a very strong claim to 57 percent of those monies and the existing law provides that an allocation shall be determined by the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it is my view that it is preeminently reasonable to ask States to make a commitment to spend at least a portion of these funds--50 percent, I think, would be a reasonable sum--on matters which are related to tobacco. The cause of the damages involves tobacco, and that is why we are asking that 50 percent be allocated, as we have said--20 percent for smokers cessation and education; and 30 percent for public health programs. 
   We do not propose an elaborate series of regulations, we do not propose micromanaging in any way what the States will be doing, but require only a certification from the States. We have already seen announcements from officials in a number of States on plans to spend these monies for other purposes; for example, for highways. Highways are very important. States would have latitude to spend part of the money for highways, but certainly should not have unfettered discretion to spend the total sum of the money on highways. Other funds are proposed to be spent for mental health services--here again, a very, very important item. Perhaps some of the mental health services are reasonably related to tobacco causes. That contention can be made and may well be honored. 
   Another State official is talking about eliminating the State debt, which is certainly a worthwhile matter. Again, 100 percent of the funds ought not be used for that purpose, nonrelated to tobacco. Other proposals are to increase teacher pay. Perhaps some of that is allocable for drug education. In another State, the officials propose using the funds to finance tax relief. That, 
   again, is a worthwhile objective, but there ought to be some assurance that on a matter like this, some of the funds ought to be used for tobacco-related purposes.  
   Other States propose scholarships, which may be related, if the educational portion is to be assigned to tobacco-related education. We see that in the very short term, there are a great many purposes where the States have a need for funds where they would like to have unfettered discretion. In a perfect world, we would like to see them have $206 billion. But with a very, very substantial Federal claim, there ought to be at least some allocation for public health, which we are proposing in this amendment. 
   If this legislation is not enacted, it is possible that there could be very bitter, protracted, and expensive litigation, with the Federal Government asserting its claim under existing law, which could take a great deal of time. The Governor of Kentucky and three attorneys general who testified on Monday at the hearing and I agreed that we ought to try to resolve the matter so they would know what is going to happen and their planning would be firm. This, we think, is a preeminently reasonable approach to a very, very difficult issue. 
   I am joining with my colleagues, Senator TOM HARKIN, Senator JIM JEFFORDS, and Senator KENNEDY in introducing an amendment to the fiscal year 1999 supplemental appropriations bill concerning the State tobacco settlements. In November 1998, 46 States agreed to a settlement with the tobacco industry that totals $206 billion over 25 years. If focused in the right direction, these settlement funds could serve as a significant resource for improving the quality of life in the 21st century. 
   Each year, the total health care expenditures in the USA directly related to smoking is $72 billion. $7.3 billion is spent by Medicaid for smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases claim an estimated 430,700 American lives each year. Despite all of what we know about the consequences of smoking, it is estimated that every day 3,000 young people become regular smokers and it is believed that approximately 89 percent of smokers begin to smoke by or at the age of 18. And finally, it is reported that cigarette smoking kills more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, violence, illegal drug use, and fires combined. 
   On March 15, 1999, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing to discuss the State tobacco settlements. We heard from the National Governors' Association, States' Attorneys General, a teen smoking prevention advocacy group, and the Deputy Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration to review the policy implications of how the tobacco settlement funds will be used and whether the Federal Government should receive a share of these funds for programs to reduce the use of tobacco products as well as programs for the public health. 
   Michael Hash, Deputy Director of the HCFA, testified that the comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products and States, and the individual State settlements reached with these manufacturers, included claims arising out of the Medicaid program. Mr. Hash explained that as a matter of law, the Federal Government is not permitted to act as a plaintiff in Medicaid recoupment cases. 42 U.S.C. section 1396a provides that ``the State or local agency administering such plan will take all responsible measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties ..... to pay for care and services available under the plan. .....'' The statute further gives the State the authority to ``pursue claims against such third parties.'' The Department of Justice, in interpreting this statute, has determined that the State has the sole power to take action against third parties, and that the Federal Government has no authority to take this action. During his testimony, Deputy Director Hash further explained that Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act specifically requires that the State reimburse the Federal Government for its pro rata share of Medicaid-related expenses that is recovered from liability cases involving third parties. 
   In a letter addressed to me dated March 15, 1999, Secretary Shalala expressed the Administration's strong opposition to the provision approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the FY 1999 supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit the Federal Government from recouping its share of the Medicaid funds from the settlement with the 
   tobacco companies. She noted that ``by releasing the tobacco companies from all relevant claims that can be made against them subsequently by the states, the settlement effectively precludes the federal government from recovering its share of Medicaid claims in the future through the established statutory mechanism.'' Specifically, in section XII of the Master Settlement Agreement, the States and tobacco companies agreed to the following:  
   Under the occurrence of State-Specific Finality in a Settling State, such Settling State shall absolutely and unconditionally release and forever discharge all Released Parties from all Released Claims that the Releasing Parties directly, indirectly, derivatively or in any other capacity ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall or may have.  
   During the hearing, we also heard from representatives of the states. Governor Paul Patton of Kentucky and Attorney Generals' Mike Fisher of Pennsylvania, John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Miller of Iowa argued that because the states took the risk and burden of the tobacco lawsuits on their own, they are entitled to all of the tobacco funds. 
   While I agree with the Governor and Attorney Generals' that the Federal Government should not micromanage the use of the funds, I am not prepared to turn all of this money over to the states carte blanche to use on matters unrelated to tobacco. Several of my colleagues have proposed creating a bureaucratic system that would strictly dictate how the states must spend the tobacco funds. I do not think this is a wise approach. However, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Federal Government to set general standards to ensure that the federal share of the tobacco funds is spent to advance the public health. 
   Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership designed to provide health care to citizens with low-income. On average, the Federal Government pays 57 percent of the costs of the Medicaid program, and no State must pay more than 50 percent of the cost of the program in that State. The Federal government has both the right and the responsibility to ensure that the federal share of the comprehensive tobacco settlement is used to reduce youth smoking, to improve the public health and to assist in the economic diversification of tobacco farming communities. 
   The amendment that I am introducing today would require states to use at least 20% of the total funds received in the settlement for tobacco reduction and education programs. Further, my amendment would require states to use at least 30% of the total funds received in the settlement for public health programs or to assist tobacco farmers. The amendment contains a provision that these funds must supplement and not supplant funds already being spent on similar activities in the State. Finally, in order to ensure that we do not create an unnecessary bureaucracy to implement this program, each Governor would merely have to certify to the Secretary of HHS each year how the funds have been used. 
   It is vital that we act now to ensure that these funds are used to protect public health. During the discussion which is currently occurring in the states on how to use the tobacco funds, a wide variety of uses have been proposed. Specifically, I understand that states have plans to spend funds on roads, mental health services, to assist tobacco farmers, and to eliminate the State debt, increase teacher pay, other proposed uses include financing tax relief, and using these revenues to fund a new Merit Award Trust Fund. While all of these goals may be noble, I am convinced that states, who sued tobacco companies to reimburse state health costs as a result of smoking, have a fiduciary duty to use these funds to reduce smoking and to support public health. 
   The Federal Government has both the right and the responsibility to ensure that the federal share of the comprehensive tobacco settlement is used to reduce youth smoking, to improve the public health and to assist in the economic diversification of tobacco farming communities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  
   I ask unanimous consent to print a March 15, 1999, letter from Secretary Shalala.

   Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to support the pending legislation. I am listed as a cosponsor, and I believe that it is an important statement of U.S. policy which we ought to adopt. This is one of the most direct bills that I have seen in my tenure in the Senate, providing:  
   It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as is technologically possible, an effective national missile defense system, capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, unauthorized or deliberate.  
   The most basic purpose of government is to protect its citizenry. The most basic purpose of the Government of the United States of America is to protect the people of the United States from foreign and domestic dangers. We have focused a great deal of attention on the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and the top of the list involves the issue of ballistic missile attack. 
   Beyond ballistic missile attack, we know that there are many other concerns of biological warfare and chemical warfare. Right now a commission is working to try to streamline the Federal Government to try to make some organizational sense, organizational improvements out of the 96 separate agencies which now deal with weapons of mass destruction. 
   During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, working collaboratively at that time with CIA Director John Deutch, a provision was inserted in the Intelligence Authorization bill in 1996 to provide a commission to take a look at the 96 separate agencies dealing with weapons of mass destruction. We find that the Department of Health and Human Services is involved in this venture, as is the Department of Defense, as is the Department of Justice. Tomorrow we are holding a hearing on some aspects of the domestic problem. 
   Internationally, the strategic defense initiative has been a hotly contested subject for debate for more than a decade, going into the early administration of President Reagan when he articulated the idea of a strategic defense initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. At that time many people debunked the idea that there could be a shield to protect the United States from a ballistic missile attack, and we have relied upon the theory of mutual assured destruction--accurately labeled, in shorthand, MAD, for mutual assured destruction--with our basic defense posture being that the Soviet Union, our principal adversary, would not fire ballistic missiles at the United States because of fear of retaliation, so that the balance of power was maintained. 
   More than a decade ago, we had some very lively debates on the Senate floor as to whether the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty should have a narrow or a broad interpretation, going back to the origin of the treaty, the history. The debate then was whether we might be able to deploy some sort of strategic defense initiative under a broad interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That treaty, entered into in 1972, has been a subject of very extended debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate and beyond. It may well be that with the enactment of this policy, there will have to be some negotiations with Russia, with other parties to the ABM Treaty. It was entered into by the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. There have been many modifications of the policy with the former Soviet Union, with Russia, where the United States, under the Nunn-LUGAR program, has appropriated very substantial sums of money to acquire and destroy Russian missiles, missiles formerly housed by the U.S.S.R. I do believe that with the changing relationship between the United States and the former Soviet Union, and with the expansion of NATO, a move that many thought Russia would never tolerate but now has become acclimated to,  there are signs of a maturation process, a changing relationship between the United States and Russia. 
   I do believe that it is important to have talks with Russia about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, but I do think that the treaty is subject to modification. There are provisions for revocation of the treaty on notice by the United States, but we now face a very different kind of a threat. We now face a threat, perhaps, from North Korea, perhaps soon from rogue nations like Iran or Iraq. It is none too soon to look toward the deployment of a national missile defense system which is intended to deal with the threat posed by the rogue nations. 
   The technology is very hard to calculate as to what can be achieved. 
   When President Reagan articulated the principle, or the idea of a strategic defense initiative, people said it was impossible. I recall reading a commentary more than a decade ago about Vannevar Bush's comment back in the mid-forties, about 1945, when Vannevar Bush said it would be an impossibility to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. Now look at what has happened; we have them by the thousands. 
   In 1965, then Secretary of Defense McNamara said that the United States was so far ahead of the Soviet Union that they could never catch up. They did. For a time, they passed the United States, until we rearmed America, leading, in effect, to the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
   There is a story many people believe to be apocryphal, but it is a true story, about a man who worked for the Patent Office shortly after the turn of the 19th century who resigned his post because everything that could be discovered or invented had been discovered or invented. We see how modern science has produced discoveries, inventions unthought of, uncontemplated. So, too, we may be able to find an effective system to protect the United States from missiles from rogue countries. 
   I believe this is an important bill. We could not bring it to the floor in the 105th Congress because we were one vote short of cloture. There are some 54 cosponsors on this bill, and I believe it articulates a very important principle, to defend America, to defend Americans and to find a national missile defense system which would protect our country against rogue nations, against accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate attacks. 
   We will have other considerations to deal with regarding Russia, other considerations to deal with in relation to China where recent events have shown advances in China's missile technology, in part, according to reliable reports, as a result of China having gained access to United States technology through espionage. But this principle--of having a national missile defense policy--is something which ought to be adopted. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my expectation--and really prediction--that this resolution will pass the U.S. Senate by overwhelming numbers and that it should be heeded by any of those who wish to have a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. My colleagues have already articulated the point that Chairman Arafat has made a commitment to determine issues such as the Palestinian state by negotiations, and we would expect that commitment to be preserved. There are very delicate matters involving Israel and the Palestinian Authority with respect to withdrawals, and there are major risks in ceding as much real estate, as much ground, as much territory as Israel has ceded to the Palestinians. 
   There is an element of great emotionalism, over and above the issue of security. I recall the famous handshake on the White House lawn on September 13, 1993, with the expectation of working out a permanent peace in the Middle East. 
   In December of 1993 I had occasion to travel with a congressional delegation and visited Egypt. President Mubarak arranged a meeting with Chairman Arafat at that time, where he renewed his pledges to live by the Oslo accord. 
   A few weeks later I was in Israel, in Jericho, and found for sale at the roadside stands, flags of the Palestinian state. The ink was barely dry on the Oslo accords and the handshakes were barely unclasped on the White House lawn before people were talking about a Palestinian state and there was, in fact, the Palestinian flag. 
   I recall visiting in Amman, Jordan, in the mid-1980s, awaiting a meeting with King Hussein and looking at a map of the Mideast. Where I expected to see the designation of ``Israel,'' there was the designation of ``Palestine.'' I mentioned that to 
   King Hussein, the leader of Jordan, and had the comment that ``it was an old map.'' Well, maps can be redrawn. But for years the State of Israel was not recognized in the Arab world. Instead of having ``Israel,'' which had control of the land and was the sovereign controlling that land, ``Palestine'' was still noted on the maps. 
   There is also the issue of a very substantial appropriation which is being sought from the Congress of the United States. I am not saying that appropriation would be conditioned on the Palestinian Authority abiding by the terms of the Oslo accord with respect to settling the declaration of a Palestinian state by negotiations, but certainly it would be in mind, it would be a factor to be considered, with many, many others. 
   So, in sum total, there is much to recommend restraint by the Palestinian Authority and to leave this issue, as to whether there will be a declaration or not, to final status negotiations in accordance with the terms of the Oslo accord. 
   I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding the time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the important education bill which we passed on its substantive merits, and also to speak briefly on the politics, where the bill might have appeared at some points to be partisan, with three votes on amendments being cast along party lines. I am convinced that we had a very strong bipartisan vote on final passage. At the same time that the Senate will pass this Education Flexibility Partnership Act, the House of Representatives is working on similar legislation, so it will be presented to the President for his signature, which we are optimistic of obtaining. 
   I think it is important to note that there were important provisions in amendments offered by Members on the other side of the aisle, where there were good programs which can be taken up in due course. The program for new teachers I think is a good idea. The program for dropout prevention is another good idea. The program for afterschool provisions I think, again, is sound and can be taken up at a later time. But had they been pressed on this bill, we would have had gridlock and this bill would not have been enacted. 
   Last year, the President proposed $1.2 billion as a starter for 100,000 new teachers. That was accepted by the Congress. Before the President came forward with that proposal, in the subcommittee of Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education which I have the privilege to chair, we had put provisions in for some $300 million which would have provided for as many new teachers as could have been hired during fiscal year 1999. The President came in with a bigger figure at a later date. That was ultimately accepted by the Congress. 
   But I do think the idea for new teachers is a good idea. The question of how to fund it is always the tough issue. Similarly, the proposals for dropout prevention and afterschool programs again are sound and it is a question of finding the adequate funding for these kinds of important programs. 
   I believe the Senate spoke very loudly and very emphatically on the question of giving local school districts the choice as to whether to use the money for special education, or whether to use the money for new teachers, or what to use the money for. The local education agencies were given that discretion on a vote of 61 to 38, where 6 Democrats voted with 55 Republicans on that choice issue. Funding special education is a very major problem in America today. The Federal Government has imposed a mandate on the States, and the Supreme Court in a recent decision has broadened the terms of that mandate. 
   In the subcommittee that I chair, which funds education, we have provided very substantial increases for special education, but the Federal Government has made a commitment for 40 percent funding and we are nowhere near that. So when you talk about the priorities of more new teachers or money for special education, that matter was put to the Senate for a vote and, not strictly along party lines, the Senate voted to have the option with  the local education agencies; with the vote being 61 to 38, some 6 Democrats joined the 55 Republicans. 
   When the choice issue was articulated along a slightly different line, the vote was 78 to 21, with some 23 Democrats joining 55 Republicans. That amendment also had provisions to keep the guns out of schools, which was doubtless an incentive to make that a stronger bipartisan vote than on some of the others. 
   Two of the other amendments were 59 to 40, with 4 Democrats joining the Republicans and, 57 to 42, 2 Democrats joining--and although we did have 3 votes along party lines, 55 to 44, there was a very definite bipartisan flavor to the votes on this matter. 
   It is always difficult when we have votes which are 55 to 44, strictly along party lines, with the question being raised: Isn't there any independence among 55 Republicans or the 44 Democrats? But the party line was adhered to in order to get the bill passed, even though, as I say, in voting against new teachers, against dropout prevention programs, and against afterschool programs--those are good ideas, and on another day we will be able to take them up. But if we were to maintain these programs, I think this bill could not have been passed; if we had not drawn the line to focus on Ed-Flex in this bill. 
   The flexibility I think is a very good idea. The Federal Government funds some 7 to 8 percent of the total funding. Last year, again in the subcommittee, we increased the funding by about $3.5 billion, about 10 percent, bringing the total Federal share to about $34.5 billion. But the principle of federalism continues to be sound, and that is that we ought to leave as much to the States as we can and we ought to leave as much to the local education agencies as we can, with the people at the local level knowing best what their needs are. So if there is a limited amount of funding, let them make the choice among special education or new teachers or dropout prevention programs or afterschool programs; leave it to the people who are closest to the problems. 
   So, all in all, there was a bit of partisanship here but I think it was justified to get the bill passed--not too much, with only three votes being along party lines--and deferring to another day the important programs which were not enacted today, but maintaining a very important point of flexibility to allow local education agencies to have the dominant voice in meeting their needs as they see them, being closest to them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to once again join my colleagues in introducing the Caring for Children Act, which will ease the financial burden of child care for American families--for those parents who work, and for those who choose to stay home to raise their children for a period of time. This legislation is identical to the child care proposal my colleagues and I introduced during the 105th Congress, on January 28, 1998. I believe it is vital that the Congress recognize the importance of affordable, quality child care to the successful development of our children. 
   The Caring for Children Act is a middle-ground, targeted response to the growing child care needs facing American families. Our bill includes tax incentives for employers and parents, and an increase in funding for programs that assist the most needy families. Most importantly, our bill proposes prudent adjustments to discretionary programs rather than implementing new mandatory spending. 
   Our bill would expand the Dependent Care tax credit to make it more accessible to families who need it, double the authorization for the Child Care Development Block Grant, and provide grants to small businesses to create or enhance child care facilities for their employees. This bill also includes provisions from the proposal I introduced during the 105th Congress with my colleagues, Congressman JON FOX, The Affordable Child Care Act, which provides a tax credit for employers who provide on-site or site-adjacent child care to their employees in order to reduce the child care expenses of the employee. 
   Not all families choose the same option for child care. Many families rely on relatives, centers operated by churches and other religious organizations, centers at or near their workplace, or make other arrangements to provide care for their children while they work. In light of the diverse 
   needs for child care in America, this bill represents a good start toward expanding the choices for American parents. And, any such legislation must recognize that there is a need to provide some relief to families where one parent stays at home. 
   The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the increasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the United States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 percent of married mothers with a child younger than age one participated in the labor force. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 percent. Almost 64 percent of married mothers and 53 percent of single mothers with children younger than age six participated in the labor force in 1995.  
   The cost of child care for families is also significant. Licensed day care centers in some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, and the disparity in costs and availability of child care between urban and rural grows greater every day. For families which need or choose to have both parents work outside the home, the burden of making child care decisions is great. These figures serve to underscore the need for action on the part of the Federal Government to provide the necessary assistance to our Nation's working families. 
   As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that this legislation would build on an existing Federal child care program by authorizing an additional $5 billion over 5 years to the Child Care Development Block Grant program, bringing total spending for this program to nearly $2.5 billion annually by fiscal year 2003. The child care block grant works well to assist low-income families acquire child care, and helped over 93,000 Pennsylvania families last year. Fiscal year 1999 funding for this vital assistance program totaled $1.182 billion, $182 billion, $182 million above the currently authorized level. By increasing the authorization, we can help even more families without creating a new entitlement program. 
   Our legislation will also require States to create and enforce safety and health standards in child care facilities, and provide money for the Department of Health and Human Services to disseminate information to parents and providers about quality child care, through brochures, toll-free hotlines, the Internet, and other technological assistance. 
   The Caring for Children Act complements my recent efforts to assist working families in the context of welfare reform and children's health insurance. When Congress debated welfare reform in 1995 and 1996, I worked to ensure that adequate funds were provided for child care, a critical component for welfare mothers who would be required to work to receive new limited welfare benefits. I am pleased that the welfare reform bill that became law provided $20 billion in child care funding over a 6-year period. Similarly, I was pleased to participate in the bipartisan effort in 1997 to enact legislation to provide $24 billion over the next 5 years for States to establish or broaden children's health insurance programs. Utilizing these new Federal funds, over 10,000 previously uninsured children in Pennsylvania have been enrolled in this program since May of 1998. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that it is critical that the 106th Congress not adjourn without enacting legislation to assist families in their ability to afford safe, quality child care for their children, either at home with a parent or another arrangement. Our legislation will provide peace of mind to millions of American families struggling to balance career and child raising. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its swift adoption.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce the Pennsylvania Battlefields Protection Act, legislation which will protect two important Revolutionary War sites in Pennsylvania and authorize the construction and operation of a new museum and visitor center dedicated to the American Revolution at Valley Forge National Historical Park. Representative CURT WELDON has introduced similar legislation in the House, with the remaining twenty Members of the Pennsylvania House delegation joining him in this effort. 
   The first part of this legislation authorizes $3 million for the acquisition of the 472-acre area generally known as the Meetinghouse Road Corridor, where the largest engagement of the American Revolution, the Battle of Brandywine, took place from September 10-11,  1777. During the 1777 British campaign to capture Philadelphia, British General William Howe defeated but proved unable to demoralize General George Washington's Continental Army of 12,500 men at the Battle of Brandywine. 
   While George Washington's and the Marquis de Lafayette's headquarters are preserved as part of the Brandywine Battlefield Park, the area where the actual fighting took place is not. The land is privately held and is in immediate danger of being sold and developed. The battlefield was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and local officials, preservation groups, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been working together to protect the battlefield. This legislation will provide half of the $6 million needed to purchase the land from willing buyers, with the remaining $3 million to be raised from non-federal sources on a dollar for dollar basis. As with all aspects of this legislation, I have worked closely with the National Park Service, and they are supportive of federal assistance to protect this important Revolutionary War site. 
   This legislation will also protect the Paoli Battlefield, in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where at least fifty-three Americans were killed. Shortly after the Battle of Brandywine, General Washington ordered General ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne and 2,000 of his men to move to the rear and contain the British army. The British learned of General Wayne's move and attacked and bayoneted Wayne's men on September 20, 1777 in what has infamously become known as the Paoli massacre. 
   While the Senate passed legislation which I introduced late in the 105th Congress to authorize the addition of the Paoli Battlefield site to Valley Forge National Historical Park, at that time the bill did not enjoy the support of the National Park Service and eventually died in the House of Representatives. I have worked with Congressman WELDON on this legislation, and we believe that the federal government should provide assistance to acquire the 40-acre Paoli Battlefield, an unprotected Revolutionary War site that is privately owned by the Malvern Preparatory School. The School intends to sell the land in order to strengthen its endowment, but officials have agreed to give the community a first chance to purchase the land for historical preservation purposes. Thus, the Paoli Battlefield will become open to residential or commercial development if $2.5 million is not raised by September 1999 to purchase the land. This bill envisions a combination of public and private financing to purchase the battlefield by authorizing a purchase price of $2.5 million with not less than $1 million in nonfederal funds. After much consultation with the National Park Service, I am now informed that they are supportive of this approach to protecting Paoli Battlefield. 
   The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Borough of Malvern, which has agreed to manage the 45-acre Paoli Battlefield site in perpetuity. A similar provision authorizes the Secretary of Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Brandywine Conservancy to manage the Meetinghouse Road Corridor area of the Brandywine Battlefield. Moreover, the bill directs the Secretary of Interior to undertake a resource study of Paoli and Brandywine Battlefields to identify the full range of their resources and historic themes and alternatives for National Park Service involvement at these two sites. 
   Finally, the last section of the bill authorizes the Secretary of Interior to enter into an agreement with the private, non-profit Valley Forge Historical Society to construct and operate a museum and visitor center within the boundaries of Valley Forge National Historical Park. After the Battles of Brandywine, the Clouds, Paoli, Germantown, and Whitemarsh, the Continental Army made Valley Forge its camp from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778, when it emerged as a new, better equipped, and well trained American army. Currently, there is no museum in the United States dedicated to the American Revolution. I believe it is important that Congress provide the authorization to bring this worthwhile project to fruition, which will not only tell the story of the Philadelphia campaign, but the story of the entire American Revolution as well. 
   This museum will combine the holdings of the Valley Forge National Historical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society, making it the largest collection of Revolutionary War era artifacts in the world. The Valley Forge Historical Society, established in 1918, has a long history of service to the park, and has amassed one of the best collections of artifacts, art, books, and documents relating to the 1777-1778 encampment of the Continental Army at Valley Forge, the American Revolution, and the American colonial era. Their collection is currently housed in a facility that is inadequate to properly maintain, preserve, and display the Society's ever-growing collection. Construction of a new facility will rectify this situation. 
   This project is supported by local officials, and a new facility is part of the Valley Forge National Historical Park's General Management Plan, which has identified inadequacies in the park's current visitor center and calls for the development of a new or significantly renovated museum and visitor center. The museum will educate an estimated 500,000 visitors a year about the critical events surrounding the birth of our nation. 
   This legislation authorizes the Valley Forge Historical Society to operate the museum in cooperation with the Secretary of Interior. This project will directly support the historical, educational, and interpretive activities and needs of Valley Forge National Historical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society while combining two outstanding museum collections. 
   Mr. President, too many important historical sites, especially Revolutionary War battlefields, have already been lost to residential and commercial development. The 105th Congress made a commitment to protecting battlefield sites. I have been pleased to support these efforts as well as the successful effort to obtain funding in the FY99 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to begin conducting the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation Study. I hope the 106th Congress will continue that commitment by protecting the Brandywine and Paoli Battlefields. In addition, this legislation holds enormous potential for all Americans to learn about our country's rich history by establishing a new visitor center and museum at Valley Forge National Historical Park, which will then be better able to tell the story of the American Revolution. I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to reintroduce legislation to authorize the operation of the Gateway Visitor Center in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Similar legislation has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives ROBERT BORSKI, CURT WELDON, and ROBERT BRADY. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, Independence National Historical Park is one of the National Park Service's crown jewels, home to the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall and the birthplace of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. In the Spring of 1997, the Final General Management Plan for Independence Park was released, which spells out the vision for the Park for the next fifteen years. The first block of Independence Mall will contain a new home for the Liberty Bell, the second block the Gateway Visitor Center, and the third block the National Constitution Center. The revitalization of Independence Mall is well underway, but legislation is needed to fully implement the General Management Plan with regards to the Gateway Visitor Center. 
   The National Park Service is aware that this type of site-specific legislation is necessary for the Gateway Visitor Center. I have worked closely with the National Park Service and the Gateway Visitor Center Corporation in  developing this legislation, and the National Park Service expressed its full support for this legislation during hearings held in the 105th Congress. 
   I would note that the $24 million needed to construct the Gateway Visitor Center has already been committed, with the City of Philadelphia contributing $5 million, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania $10 million, and various Foundations $15 million, of which $6 million will fund an endowment. The legislation I am introducing today merely provides the authorization for the operation of the Center. The Gateway Visitor Center will be financially self-sustaining, with only a modest contribution coming from the National Park Service for operations and maintenance. 
   While the Gateway Visitor Center will provide the traditional services to visitors to the Park, the Center will also provide some services which are somewhat beyond the scope of existing National Park Service legislation. In addition to its role as the Park's primary visitor center, providing visitor orientation to the Park, the city, and the region as a whole, the Gateway Visitor Center will be permitted to charge fees, conduct events, and sell merchandise, tickets, and food to visitors to the Center. These activities will allow the Gateway Visitor Center to meet its parkwide, citywide and regional missions while defraying the operating and management expenses of the Center. 
   The current visitor center in Independence National Historical Park is poorly located, making it underutilized and inconvenient to the millions of people who visit the Park each year. The Gateway Visitor Center will serve far more people than ever possible with the current facility by providing information, interpretation, facilities, and services to visitors to the Park, its surrounding historic areas, the City of Philadelphia, and the region in order to assist visitors in their enjoyment of the historical, cultural, educational, and recreational resources of the area. The Gateway Visitor Center will be a major asset for the Park and critical to the central management goal addressed in the General Management Plan of creating an outstanding visitor experience. The Gateway Visitor Center holds enormous potential for Independence National Historical Park and the greater Philadelphia region as a whole, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to honor the memory of our distinguished colleague, Morris K. Udall, who tirelessly infused into American politics his eloquent humor, grace, and dignity during his thirty year career in the U.S. House of Representatives. His death from Parkinson's Disease on December 12, 1998, was a great loss for the American people, and I am honored to have served with Mo and to preserve his legacy in our continued efforts to cure Parkinson's Disease. 
   I must point out that over one million Americans suffer from Parkinson's Disease symptoms, and 60,000 more are diagnosed each year; one every nine minutes. About forty percent of those patients are under age 60, and advanced symptoms leave people unable to complete their working careers. The disease is estimated to cost our nation about $25 billion annually. To help ease this suffering and remove the economic burden of Parkinson's Disease, I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act, signed into law on November 13, 1997 and sponsored by our distinguished colleagues Senators MCCAIN and WELLSTONE. The Udall bill authorized a comprehensive Parkinson's Disease research and education program within the National Institutes of Health, and improved the coordination of all Parkinson's initiatives across the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   On a personal note, I agree with the conventional wisdom that Mo had a marvelous sense of humor, as exemplified in his book, ``Too Funny to be President.'' One of my favorite anecdotes originates during his bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1976. Dutifully campaigning for the New Hampshire primary, he introduced himself to a barber as ``Mo Udall, running for President.'' The man chuckled and proceeded to respond, ``I know. We were laughing about that just this morning.'' 
   Mo's accomplishments during his distinguished career are innumerable, from his tireless promotion of environmental conservation to his efforts to preserve the rights of our country's most vulnerable populations. I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this resolution to honor one of the most civil, respected, and effective legislators of our time, Mr. Morris King Udall, and I extend my sincere condolences to the Udall family for their loss.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose of introducing the Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1999. This legislation is in response to a crisis facing the steel industry in the United States as a result of subsidized and dumped goods coming into the United States from a variety of countries--from Russia, from Brazil, from Japan, from Indonesia--where steel is being sold in the United States at far under cost of production and far under the price steel is being sold for in those countries. 
   We know the financial problems which are present now in Russia where they are very anxious to have dollars and are selling steel in America for anything, virtually, that they can get for it. A similar problem has arisen with respect to other countries. 
   The steel industry has modernized, spending some $50 billion, and simply cannot compete with this kind of subsidy on dumped goods. Thousands of steelworkers are losing their jobs. A few years back there were 500,000 steelworkers in the United States; now that number is down to about 160,000, and more are going daily and weekly as a result of this dumped steel coming into the United States. 
   The existing laws are totally insufficient. When the administrative procedures are taken under existing law, it takes months. For example, complaints filed in September of 1998 will not be heard, adjudicated, decided, until May. Then there will be some retroactive duty imposition. Meanwhile, thousands of steelworkers will be losing their jobs. The steel industry will be suffering tremendous losses from which it cannot recover. 
   Beyond the issue of the industry itself and the workers, we have the paramount issue on national defense, the industrial base for the United States. 
   My legislation would provide a private right of action so that injured parties could go into a Federal court, into a court of equity, and get immediate relief. This legislation is similar to legislation which I have introduced as far back as 1982 where I sought injunctive relief. It now appears that injunctive relief is not consistent with GATT, although GATT international trade laws are consistent with U.S. trade laws which prohibit subsidized or dumped goods from coming into the United States. 
   The remedy which is provided in this bill would be that tariffs would be imposed at the direction of the Federal court as the form of equitable relief, and these tariffs would then be paid over to the damaged parties--to the steelworkers who had sustained damages as a result of losing their jobs and to the steel companies which had sustained damages from loss of sales as a result of this illegal steel coming into the United States which is dumped or subsidized. 
   There have been rallies held across the United States and on the west end of the Capitol not too long ago. The Senate Steel Caucus, which I have the privilege to chair, has had a series of hearings, including one in Pittsburgh on February 18. 
   There are a variety of legislative proposals now pending before the Congress: Tariffs, changing the U.S. law to conform to international laws to make it easier to get relief under 201 and 301. But there is nothing on the books which would be as effective as the kind of equitable relief which would be provided by this private right of action. There is litigation pending now in the Federal court in Ohio brought by Wheeling-Pittsburgh where, after I conferred with the officials of that company, they brought an equity action in the State courts seeking equitable relief, and it has since been transferred to the Federal courts. I believe that cause of action, that claim for relief in the Federal court, is well founded. 
   This legislation would remove any doubt that the injured parties--the  workers, the companies, injured parties--would have a right to go into Federal court to get this relief on a prompt basis. 
   In a court of equity, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, having litigated extensively himself, it is possible to get a temporary restraining order, a TRO, on an ex parte basis by the filing of affidavits. When that is done, then there has to be a hearing within 5 days where the moving party then seeks a preliminary injunction. Then the court hears the evidence and makes a determination as to a preliminary injunction, and then further hearings to make a determination as to a permanent injunction. I outline that very, very briefly to signify the speed that you can have action if you go into the Federal court. 
   A court of equity is designed to provide prompt relief upon 
   the showing of the requisite proofs. The difficulty with waiting for administrative action, action by the executive branch, is that we know as a matter of experience that the executive branch defers to foreign policy or defense policy. 
   There is grave concern in the administration, expressed by a variety of administration officials, about what will happen to the Russian economy. Of course, there are grounds for concern about the Russian economy but not sufficient concerns so as to override what will happen to the American steel industry. What happens to the Russians is important but, frankly, not as important to this Senator as what happens to Pennsylvanians or to people in West Virginia or to people in Indiana, Ohio, or Illinois--to mention only a few of the States which are impacted by these subsidized and dumped goods. 
   I am reminded, Mr. President, about an event back in 1984 when there was a favorable ruling for the steel industry from the International Trade Commission. The President had the authority to override that determination. My then colleague Senator Heinz and I made the rounds of the International Trade Representative, William Brock, and of the Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, and we found great sympathy with having the laws of the United States and the international trade laws enforced. When we talked to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, they were more concerned about their problems--foreign policy and defense policy. Ultimately, the President overruled the International Trade Commission to the detriment of the American steel industry. Regrettably, that is what happens. 
   We have had meetings of the Steel Caucus with the key officials of the executive branch. When it comes to the Secretary of Commerce or the Trade Representative, there has been a certain amount of sympathy for the position of the steel industry. 
   What we need to do is to take this issue out of international politics--politics at the highest level, where there are concerns for foreign policy or defense policy--and move it into court, where the rule of law will govern and where, on a showing that there is a violation of U.S. trade laws, a showing of a violation of international trade laws, and there is a remedy which is GATT consistent, which is to impose tariffs. The approach of having the tariffs then paid over to the damaged parties is an idea which was originated by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DEWINE, on legislation which he has introduced. 
   When we had sought injunctive relief, it had been sufficient just to stop the steel from coming into the United States immediately, and then there would have been no further damage. That is not GATT consistent. It is GATT consistent to have duties imposed, and then if any steel comes in, those duties ought to be a deterrent to stop dumped and subsidized steel from coming into the United States. But to the extent any further steel comes in, those duties would be collected by the Treasury and then paid over to the injured parties--the steelworkers who have lost wages or lost their jobs, or the industry which has been damaged by this illegal dumping and this illegal subsidy. 
   Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reintroduce legislation to provide for a private right of action for an injured party to sue in Federal court to stop goods from coming into this country which are subsidized, dumped or otherwise sold in violation of our trade laws. My legislation, the Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1999, is based on legislation I have introduced since 1982 and most recently during the 103rd Congress in 1993. 
   I have revised the legislation so that at the conclusion of the case and upon the finding of liability, the court will direct the Customs Service to assess an antidumping duty on the dumped or subsidized product. Duties collected will be distributed to steelworkers for damages sustained from loss of wages resulting from loss of jobs due to illegal imports, and the affected domestic producers of the product for qualifying expenditures which may include equipment, research and development, personnel training, acquisition of technology, health care benefits, pension benefits, environmental equipment, training or technology, acquisition of raw materials, or borrowed working capital. 
   I am introducing this legislation to respond to the substantial dumping of foreign goods on the U.S. market, particularly steel. As Hank Barnette, chief executive officer of Bethlehem Steel, wrote as early as in an August 6, 1998 op-ed in the Washington Times, the United States has become ``The Dumping Ground'' for foreign steel. He noted that Russia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and that China is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, while enormous subsidies to foreign steel. As one example, Mr. Barnette cited the Commerce Department's revelation that Russia, one of the world's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the United States at more than 50 percent or $110 per ton below the constructed cost to make this product, which ultimately costs our steel companies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for American workers. 
   As chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I am well aware that the current financial crisis in Asia and elsewhere has generated surges in U.S. imports of steel. Recently released statistics by the Department of Commerce note that the year-to-date final statistics through November of 1998 show steel imports of 35.1 million metric tons, an increase of 8.7 million metric tons over the 26.4 million metric tons through November 1997. While the preliminary data on steel imports for December 1998 shows a decrease in imports of hot-rolled steel products, one month is not a trend. In fact, overall steel imports in 1998 were considerably higher than in 1997, and total imports of hot-rolled steel were up 73 percent from 1997 to 1998. The flooding of steel on the U.S. market from Asian countries, as well as countries of the former Soviet Union and Brazil, have led the Senate and House Steel Caucuses to hold joint hearings and receive testimony from steel company executives and union representatives on the growing problems of steel imports and their troubling effect on our economy and our ability to retain high-paying jobs. 
   I believe in free trade. But the essence of free trade is selling goods at a price equal to the cost of production and a reasonable profit. Where you have dumping--the sale of goods in the United States at prices lower than the price at which such goods are being sold by the producing companies in their own country or in some other country--it is the antithesis of free trade. We have too long sacrificed American industry and American jobs in the name of foreign policy or defense policy, without having the proper enforcement of the laws because the executive branch, whether it is a Democratic administration or a Republican administration, has made concessions for foreign policy and defense interests. 
   For many years, foreign policy and defense policy have superseded basic fairness on trade policy. I received a comprehensive education on this subject back in 1984 when there was a favorable ruling by the ITC for the American steel industry, but it was subject to review by the President. At that time my colleagues, Senator Heinz and I visited every one of the Cabinet officers in an effort to get support to see to it that International Trade Commission ruling in favor of the American steel industry was upheld. Then-Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige was favorable, and International Trade Representative Bill Brock was favorable. We received a favorable hearing in all quarters until we spoke with then-Secretary of State Shultz and  then-Secretary of Defense Weinberger who were absolutely opposed to the ITC ruling. President Reagan decided to overrule the ITC, and U.S. trade policy and workers again took second place to foreign policy concerns. 
   In the current environment, I believe more than ever that it is necessary for an injured industry to have an opportunity to go into federal court and seek enforcement of America's trade laws, which are currently not being enforced adequately by the executive branch. 
   The only way to handle these important issues is to see to it that there is a private right of action, which is a time-honored approach in the context of antitrust law. I believe this is absolutely necessary if the steel industry and other U.S. industries subject to unfair foreign competition are to have fairness and to be able to stop foreign subsidized and dumped products 
   from coming into this country.

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, between the time I made my statement in the closed Senate deliberations on February 11th and the time I cast my vote on February 12th, I consulted with the Parliamentarian and examined the Senate precedents and found that if I voted simply ``not proven,'' that I would be marked on the voting roles as ``present.'' I also found that a response of ``present,'' and inferentially the equivalent of ``present,'' could be challenged and that I could be forced to cast a vote of ``yea'' or ``nay.'' 
   I noted the precedent on June 28, 1951, recorded on pages 7403 and 7404 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, when Senator Benton of Connecticut and Senator Lehman of New York voted ``present'' during a roll call vote. Senator Hickenlooper of Iowa challenged these votes and argued that a senator must vote either ``yea'' or ``nay'' unless the Senate votes to excuse the senator from voting. Senator Hickenlooper's challenge was upheld, and the Senate voted against excusing these Senators from voting by a vote of 39 to 35 in the case of Senator Lehman and a vote of 41 to 34 in the case of Senator Benton. 
   I also noted the precedent on August 3, 1954, on page 13086 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, when Senator Mansfield of Montana voted ``present'' during a roll call vote. Senator Cordon of Oregon objected and asked that the Senate vote on whether Senator Mansfield should be excused from voting. By voice vote, the Senate voted against excusing Senator Mansfield from voting. 
   In order to avoid the possibility that some Senator might challenge my vote, I decided to state on the Senate floor, ``not proven, therefore not guilty,'' when my name was called on the roll call votes on Article I and Article II of the Articles of Impeachment. That avoided the possibility of a challenge and also more accurately recorded my vote as ``not guilty'' since I did not wish to be recorded as merely ``present.''

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on February 18, 1999, Pennsylvania lost one of its finest citizens, with the death of Lauren Albert. 
   I had the pleasure to know Mrs. Albert. She was the mother of three wonderful children, Stuart, Elliot, and Emily and the husband of one of Pennsylvania's finest orthopedic surgeons, Todd J. Albert, M.D. For seventeen years, Lauren had served at the side of Richard I. Rothman at the Rothman Institute and Reconstructive Orthopedic Associates. She was a leader in our community. 
   As fate would have it, Lauren and her husband Todd were traveling with eight other Pennsylvanians, including my son Shanin and his wife Tracey. Also on the trip were Barbara and Richard Barnhart, Leslie and Al Boris and Jaimie and David Field. 
   Lauren was killed when the Land Rover in which she was a passenger was caused to tumble down a mountainside of the High Atlas Mountains. Her husband and the Barnharts were passengers in the same vehicle. 
   I was notified of the accident as soon as the party had access to a telephone. Contemporaneously, the Department of State, our Ambassador in Rabat, Edward Gabriel and our Consul general in Morocco, Evan G. Reade, Casablanca, were notified. 
   Consul Reade, accompanied by other Embassy officials, immediately flew to meet the Americans in nearby Ouerzazate. 
   Although Consul Reade had been in Morocco for only 8 months, he immediately assumed control of the situation and worked to solve complex and pressing problems. 
   First, there was a significant question of the medical stability of the three surviving passengers. Consul Reade and I worked in tandem with the Department of Defense, particularly Colonel Joe Reynes, Executive Secretary to the Secretary of Defense. Over the next several hours, well through the night, local time, Colonel Reynes worked diligently to place a military medical aircraft in Europe on alert to fly to Morocco. An enormous amount of work was undertaken with our military's European command, the State Department, Moroccan officials, Consul Reade in Ouerzazate and Ambassador Gabriel in Rabat. 
   In the final analysis, a medical evacuation was not needed. Nonetheless, it was most reassuring to know that our military could be counted upon to assist. 
   Second, Consul Reade, working in connection with others in the State Department, were instrumental in accomplishing the rapid evacuation of the three injured passengers as well as the remainder of the party from Morocco. This was accomplished through detailed coordination and airport assistance for four commercial flights enabling all to return home safely by 5:30 p.m. on the following day. 
   Third, Consul Reade arranged for the return of the body of Lauren Albert to Pennsylvania. For numerous reasons, this process is highly complicated. Consul Reade arranged, with the assistance of the Morocco officials, to have Mrs. Albert's body returned to Pennsylvania on Sunday, February 21, 1999. This permitted a timely funeral and burial, which was very important to the Albert family. 
   Finally, I wish to recognize the superb assistance of Lt. Colonel Driss Ferar, Commandant of the Morocco Police in the Ouerzazate region. Colonel Ferar was notified of the accident within minutes. He sped to the scene in the High Atlas Mountains, an hour and  a half away from his headquarters. He immediately assumed control and effectuated the safe return of the party to Ouerzazate that night. Colonel Ferar made sure that the entire party was comfortable and led Dr. Albert, the tour director, and my son to his office which served as a center for all the operations that evening and well into the night. Colonel Ferar worked on the matter without interruption and without attending to any of his other important duties until 2:00 a.m. In addition to offering his valuable assistance in all aspects of this tragedy, Colonel Ferar was also unfailingly courteous and helpful. He had his family make dinner for all of the concerned, which was brought into the Police Headquarters. He offered his wisdom and counsel to Dr. Albert. Since the party has returned to the United States, Colonel Ferar has forwarded a gift to the Albert family. I am informed that Colonel Ferar has been of similar assistance to Americans who have suffered grievous injuries in this region of Morocco in the past. Colonel Ferar is to be highly commended for his commitment to duty and to the very personal human needs of all concerned. 
   The tragic death of Lauren Albert leaves an indelible mark on the fabric of our community. Our prayers are with Dr. Albert and his family. We are grateful to the American and Moroccan officials, who accomplished everything possible to help with this tragedy and assure the safe and speedy return of our citizens.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a resolution along with 49 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 1999, as ``Greek Independence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democrary.'' 
   One hundred and seventy-eight years ago, the Greek people bagan a revolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return Greece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient Greeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. Our founding Fathers drew heavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, then, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return to that democratic tradition. 
   The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of the many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient Greeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to the United States of America, in the areas of art, philosphy, science, and law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make valuable contributions to American society, business, and government. It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate will serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with whom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar resolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, with overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from West Virginia for this legislation. I support it enthusiastically. I also commend our colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, for the work which he has done in this field, as referred to by the Senator from West Virginia. 
   This amendment would constitute a win-win-win situation. We frequently hear about win-win, but not too often do we hear about win-win-win. It is a  three-time winner: First, for the veteran who would have an opportunity to have care at the veterans hospital of his choice when reimbursement is made by the Medicare funds; it would be a win for the Veterans' Administration, which is very short of money; and it would be a win for Medicare, because Medicare would get a reduced payment of 95 percent. 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER is ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I chair. We are enormously concerned about the low level of funding which has been proposed. We have a $17.3 billion budget which is totally insufficient. That has led us to look to other sources of funds. 
   For example, the insurance premium payments, where a veteran has insurance which we are trying to get paid to the Veterans' Administration and to the hospital where he is treated: Here you have the anomalous situation where veterans are entitled to Medicare but they are not getting it, and they cannot go to a veterans hospital without paying for at least a portion of the medical care themselves in many cases. This will give them the opportunity to go to the Veterans' Administration hospital of their choice, to be paid for by Medicare. 
   On a personal note, my father was a veteran of World War I and received medical treatment at the veterans hospital in Wichita, KS. I remember as a youngster riding my bicycle to visit my father when I was 7 years old. One of the added attractions was that they had a pinball machine. It cost 5 cents in the drugstore, at a penny arcade in Wichita it was less expensive, but there was a free pinball machine at the veterans hospital. But I always went there to see my father. That was a long bicycle ride. Now Wichita has extended on the east end all the way to the veterans hospital. 
   My father in World War II served in the Argonne Forest. He was an immigrant. He walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket, from a small village in Ukraine. The family lived in a one-room dirt-floor house in a village called Batchkurina. My wife Joan and I visited it in 1982. He had a steerage ticket to the United States. He did not know that he had a round-trip ticket to France--not to Paris and the Folies Bergeres, but to the Argonne Forest. He was a doughboy. He rose to the rank of buck private. Next to his family, his greatest pride was serving in the U.S. Army. I have his plaque, which was the equivalent of the Purple Heart in World War I for wounded veterans. I thought it was the Statue of Liberty knighting my father, but I later learned it was a plaque given to the 100,000 veterans who were wounded. 
   My father was in an accident in 1937 when he was riding in a brand new automobile and the spindle bolt broke. The car rolled over and rolled on to his arm. He was able to receive medical care at the veterans hospital. Had he not had that care, I don't know what would have happened to him because 1937 was a very tough year for Americans generally, but an especially tough year for my immigrant parents who had four young children to support. That experience at the veterans hospital in Wichita has stayed with me as sort of a hallmark of medical care for America's veterans. 
   I think it is generally recognized that we do not do enough for our veterans. After recognizing it, we don't do very much about it. It is a constant budget struggle. Last year, billions of dollars were taken from the Veterans' Administration for the highway fund. Now we are looking at a very, very tight budget. 
   I have the attention of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee who may be coming to the Department of Defense for a small loan here for veterans. This Medicare subvention would give the Veterans' Administration more money. It makes a lot of sense. They now have it for the Department of Defense. Retirees can go to DOD hospitals and have it paid for by Medicare. 
   I hope we do not get into a jurisdictional battle with the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee passed this measure in the 105th Congress. It was dropped in conference, for reasons which we think are now solved, with the House of Representatives. The DOD Medicare subvention passed and has become law. We need to get this matter done now on this bill which is, as we express it in the Senate, a vehicle which is moving. We need to have this funding so that when we plan our financing in the Veterans' Committee we know the kind of money we have and the kind of money we may expect for the future. 
   It is my hope that this matter will move forward with alacrity. We will get it done, provide this funding for the Veterans' Administration which is sorely in need of funds, help out the veterans by giving them the choice of where they may get their care, and assist Medicare by having this 5 percent discount. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a letter from 12 members of the Veterans' Committee, with the lead signators being Senator ROCKEFELLER and myself, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. SPECTER. If the distinguished Senator will yield for a moment, my father has prevailed to support his family and was in the junk business. Many call it the scrap iron business, but it was the junk business. 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER and I had our paths cross a bit a few months ago when we were in the Steel Caucus. A man from Texas came in from the scrap business--and they have been very badly hurt by imports of steel, which I will not go into at this moment. It gave me occasion to reflect for less than a minute on my experience cutting down derricks. 
   The wind would blow through the oil fields in Kansas. We lived in Russell, a small town noted for being the home of  Senator Dole. My brother-in-law Arthur Morgenstern and I would go out and cut down the derricks. We would sell the straight pieces of angled iron for two and three quarter cents a pound--price control--and the balance of the junk we loaded on the truck and we would take it over to the railroad and the boxcar and ship it. 
   When I finished telling the tale of woe--it was a good incentive to become a lawyer--Senator ROCKEFELLER chimed in and said, ``I have had a similar experience to ARLEN SPECTER. My family also was in oil and railroads. We owned the oil companies and we owned the railroads.''

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had intended to offer a joint resolution on the subject of the use of force in Kosovo for this bill, but events have overtaken this issue as the picture is now unfolding. I did want to put this joint resolution in the RECORD. I did want to talk about it for a few minutes. I discussed it with the distinguished chairman of the committee. 
   The concern I have is on the repeated use of force that constitutes acts of war by the President of the United States without authorization by Congress, in violation of the constitutional provision that only the Congress of the United States has the authority to involve the United States in war. 
   We have seen an erosion of the congressional authority in modern times on many, many occasions. Perhaps the strongest, sharpest example is the Korean war, a subject on which I have questioned nominees for the Supreme Court of the United States, trying to get a delineation on the power of the Commander in Chief under the Constitution, contrasted with the authority of Congress. But where we have had the air and missile strikes recently in  Iraq, I raised the same question challenging or questioning the authority of the President. And as it has appeared in the past several days, there has been discussion of using force, air-strikes, perhaps missile strikes, in Kosovo, and it seems to me this is a matter that ought to be decided by the Congress. 
   I do think there is a good bit to be said in support of the United States participating in the air-strikes in light of what has gone on there, and I shall not speak at any length. The issues are submitted in this joint resolution. I would like to engage my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, as to his sentiments on this subject.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for those comments. It was 8 years ago in early January--I believe January 10--where we had a much publicized debate on this floor about the use of force in the gulf war. A number of the people who are on the floor today, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Virginia, and I, participated in that debate with our distinguished then-colleague, Senator Nunn. 
   I do believe, as I have said, there is much to recommend of U.S. participation in Kosovo. But I do not like to see further erosion of the congressional authority. I think too often the Congress stepped aside. 
   About a year ago this time there was a key issue about the use of force against Iraq. We discussed it on the floor to some extent. We had a winter recess. By the time we got back, the issue had not matured. But force was used in Iraq in December. It was not authorized by the Congress. I think that the Congress ought to take a stand one way or another before force is used in accordance with the Constitutional provisions. 
   In the interest of brevity, Mr. President, I send this joint resolution to the desk and ask that it be printed since it makes a fuller statement on this subject.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief supplemental comment, it is true that the President has authority as Commander in Chief. When he exercises his authority in the deployment of some 4,000 U.S. troops, it is another question. He has a stronger claim to do that under his power as Commander in Chief than he does to have air-strikes or missile strikes, in my opinion. Those air-strikes and missile strikes are acts of war. If he deploys U.S. troops, if they go into a hostile situation, that may trigger the War Powers Act, which is a little different consideration with the Constitutional provision which authorizes only the Congress to declare war. But I do think that we in the Congress do need to consider these issues, debate them, and make decisions about them. We  have the authority by restraining spending in the Department of Defense to stop the deployment of troops. I am not saying we should do it, but I think there is too much of a tendency on the part of Congress to sit back and not to make these kind of tough decisions. If things go wrong, there is always the President to blame. If things go right, we haven't impeded Presidential action. 
   But these raise very, very serious Constitutional issues. There is a continuing erosion. Before the President uses force, we have a chance to intervene. If it is an emergency situation, that is different; he has to act as Commander in Chief. 
   But we have had ample opportunity to consider this Kosovo issue. And it is on the back burner now. But if it reappears, I will reactivate my resolution.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, along with all the Members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of a bill, which my colleague and friend, Senator JIM JEFFORDS, is introducing today. Mr. President, this is a most welcome bill. When enacted, it would direct that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) enter into an agreement establishing ten geographically dispersed demonstration projects under which VA would provide health care services to certain Medicare-eligible veterans, who would not have otherwise received care in VA, in exchange for reimbursement from the Medicare trust fund. Thus, VA would be able to occupy the same basic position as other health care providers which furnish care to Medicare-eligible patients: VA would be reimbursed by Medicare for providing this care, just as other providers may be reimbursed. The Department of Defense health care system is already authorized to provide such care for reimbursement on a demonstration project basis, and this authority should be extended to the VA as well. 
   Under the terms of this bill, VA is authorized to establish up to ten subvention sites or health plans, including a site near a closed military base and one that provides care predominately to rural veterans. These sites and plans would provide health care services to Medicare-eligible veterans. Medicare would reimburse VA for such services--similar to the way the Federal Health Care Financing Administration pays other providers in the private sector when they furnish health care services to Medicare-eligible persons--but subject to certain cost-saving conditions. First, while fees paid to VA would be based on those paid to other providers, they would be reduced, across the board, by 5%. Second, reimbursements to VA would be further reduced for subsidies paid by Medicare to private facilities to cover their capital expense and medical education costs, and costs incurred by such providers, if any, in serving a disproportionate number of low-income patients. Thus, Medicare would invariably save funds when care is provided to its patients by VA. In effect, VA would provide care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a discount to the Medicare trust fund. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would not, however, be required to refer Medicare-eligible patients to VA under this bill. Eligible veterans would continue to be free to select their own health care providers. It would be up to the VA ``demonstration program'' sites to entice Medicare-eligible patients to VA by offering services and care which are more attractive than those provided by community-care providers. One of the underlying purposes of this legislation is to test VA's contention that it can provide the kind of care which will attract veteran-patients who have other alternatives and, at the same time, provide care which is cost effective from the reimburser's, and VA's, viewpoints. Another purpose of the legislation will be to test the hypothesis that VA can meet the needs of its priority patients--veterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans who are poor--while, simultaneously positioning itself to attract other veteran-patients who, due to Medicare eligibility, have the wherewithal to go elsewhere for care. 
   Whether VA can succeed in providing cost-effective care which attracts patients without causing it to neglect its primary mission is the essence of the question that this bill is intended to answer. Indeed, time--and these demonstration projects--will tell whether providing such care to non-priority veterans for reimbursement will enhance VA's ability, due to an infusion of new Medicare funds, to provide better care to VA's mandated priority patients. Like the Department of Defense--which, as I have noted, already has authority from Congress to obtain reimbursement from Medicare--VA ought to have an opportunity to see if it can succeed in attracting and keeping patients by providing superior care. I can think of no better way to gauge VA quality than assessing the behavior of veterans who can ``vote with their feet.'' 
   I hope that these VA ``demonstration project'' sites will show that VA can, in fact, fully serve its priority patients--veterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans who are poor--while also serving veteran-patients who are able to bring Medicare funding to the VA system. Budgetary constraints have required that VA operate under a ``flat-line'' medical care appropriation for the past three years even as personnel and other inflationary costs continue to rise from year to year. VA has attempted to increase its collections from private sector, third-party insurers in order to supplement its funding base, but these collections have not been sufficient. I and my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs believe that VA ought to have parallel authority to collect reimbursement from Medicare when it provides non-service-connected care to these patients. I ask that my colleagues give the Department this authority by approving this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I compliment my colleague and friend from Vermont for his  leadership on establishing this innovative and crucial legislation that I believe will be an essential tool in the future for VA's care of veterans, and I urge my colleagues to give this bill high priority attention for early passage this year.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, a great deal has been spoken in the Chamber about separation of powers and tomes have been written on it. And in reading the Constitution, Article I, creating the Congress; and Article II, the Executive branch; and Article III, the Judiciary, we have seen the wisdom of limiting power through the separation of power among the three branches of the Federal government. 
   The one provision of the Constitution--the impeachment provision--reaches across that divide. It is my thinking that before the Congress can exercise the power of removal, especially of an American President, there has to be a very, very heavy burden of proof. 
   I had occasion, fairly recently, to go very deeply into the issue of separation of powers when I argued the Base Closing Commission case regarding the Philadelphia Navy Yard case, which was unfairly closed--a subject that I will not amplify on--and I had an opportunity to appear before the Supreme Court. 
   In my two earlier speeches during the closed session on the motion to dismiss and the issue of depositions, I did end within the allotted time. But I will say that the Chief Justice is a good deal more tolerant here than in the Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court when I argued the Base Closing case, I was cut off in mid-syllable. I didn't know that was possible. But with the forcefulness of the Presiding Officer, he was able to limit the speakers to the precise time allotted. I did not do well in the outcome of that case in the Supreme Court. I had done better on my previous appearances in the Supreme Court when I was representing the district attorney's office on law and order. 
   But that sojourn into that case brought me into 200 years of reflection and analysis on case law on separation of powers, something that is not often done by practicing lawyers, and certainly not Senators. It instilled in me a very, very deep appreciation of separation of power. 
   So when I approached this case--and it has been the toughest case I have ever seen, and I think it has been a very, very intense drain on this body and all of us individually--the focus I had was: what is the burden that you ought to have to show if the Senate is going to remove a President? As I reviewed the evidence, I am not satisfied at all that that burden was met. 
   Perjury is a very tough offense to prove under the standards established by the Supreme Court of the United States in the famous Bronston case. Bronston was giving testimony in a bankruptcy proceeding in New York and was asked about bank accounts in Zurich, and said, ``My company had a bank account for about 6 months,'' leading to the implication that he did not have a personal bank account when in fact he did. His conviction in the District Court was upheld by the Second Circuit, but reversed by a unanimous Supreme Court because the interrogator, the prosecutor, has to go further. You have to ask the last questions to prove perjury. 
   The President was very artful, very careful and full of guile as he wound his way through the grand jury proceedings. We heard the testimony again and again. The President said he told his aides, ``things that were true.'' Well, he didn't comment about the things that he told them that were false. But nobody said, ``Did you tell them things that were false as well?'' to set the stage for a perjury prosecution. 
   When asked about Monica Lewinsky--was he alone with her?, on a series of rambling answers he said he wasn't alone with her in the hallway. But that is not the end of the question. He wasn't alone with her in the hallway. But nobody followed up, and said, ``Were you alone with her somewhere else?'' which he was not asked. Had he been asked whether he was alone with her somewhere else and denied that, there may have been a record to establish perjury. On this record, he did not commit perjury under the Bronston case. 
   The testimony of Betty Currie we heard again and again and again. In late January 1998, Betty Currie testified that when the President gave her that series of questions, she thought the President was trying to lead her, to mold her testimony. Then when she came back to testify in July, she said, well, it was different on that occasion. She testified that the President gave her the option of either agreeing or disagreeing. 
   Betty Currie was not a witness in this proceeding. Her deposition was not even taken because of very, very restrictive rules which the U.S. Senate established for what the House managers could do. The House managers were on very, very sharp notice that if they asked for too many depositions, they might get none at all. They made their selection of witnesses and they left off Betty Currie. 
   But had House managers been able to present their case in the normal course of events, I dare say the proceeding would have been even faster. We heard some 12 days of speeches, 6 days of opening speeches; 3 and 3 on each side. We could have done that in 2 hours. We then spent 2 days propounding questions through the Chief Justice where we learned very, very little. We heard arguments on the motion to dismiss, and on depositions, and arguments on what to do about the witnesses on those videotapes. Again and again, we heard legal arguments, but we did not hear from witnesses. 
   We are bound by this record. It is my view that, on this record, the burden of proof has not been met, the kind of a burden that would have to be sustained, in my judgment, for the Senate to remove an American President. 
   One comment about mindset. The Senate really approached this matter as if it were a waste of time from the outset. There was an early effort to structure a vote to show that more than one-third of the Senators would not be for conviction and, therefore, to end it. Then when we had the vote on the motion to dismiss and 44 Senators voted to dismiss. It confirmed what we all knew; and that is that there would not be a two-thirds vote. I think that put a mindset in this body really not to conduct a trial. 
   The Constitution calls for a trial. The proceeding we had does not measure up in any way, shape or form to a trial. It is true that there are some few cases submitted on a record where judges are going to decide it. But a trial customarily requires witnesses. Had witnesses appeared on the floor of the U.S. Senate with examination and cross-examination, you would have gotten a feel for what happened here. If Betty Currie had appeared on the floor of the U.S. Senate, or even if her deposition had been taken, there could have been a clarification of inconsistencies in her two lines of questioning. 
   A word for the future: It would be my hope that if, as, and when the Senate has to revisit impeachment that it would be done differently. Senator LIEBERMAN made a suggestion on a December 20 television show that there ought not to be party caucuses, that there only ought to be joint caucuses. I have passed that recommendation on. I realized that given the history of the Senate and our party caucuses, that would be a very, very abrupt change. 
   But I came out of some of our party caucuses and walked over and talked to my friends on the other side of the  aisle. The people that I had agreed with on many, many, many issues. We were just irreconcilably opposed, just totally opposed. My only conclusion was that it was the kind of argument and the kind of discussion on what happened in the caucuses--really choosing sides and having teams--as opposed to trying to make an analytical, judicial decision as to what was involved here. 
   So it is my hope that if we ever have to undertake this again we will do it differently. 
   My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved. I have gone back to Scottish law where there are three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proved. I am not prepared to say on this record that President Clinton is not guilty. But I am certainly not prepared to say that he is guilty. There are precedents for a Senator voting present. I hope that I will be accorded the opportunity to vote ``not proved'' in this case. 
   We really end up, colleagues, very much, in my judgment, where at least I started on the matter. I had thought at the outset that this was not an appropriate case for impeachment because the requisite two-thirds would not be present, and had hoped that impeachment would be bypassed, but instead we would allow the President to finish his term of office, which I thought an inevitability, just as it has worked out that way, and that the criminal process would do whatever was appropriate after his term was finished; if indicted, if convicted, whatever a judge would have to say as to sentencing. I am still hopeful that the rule of law will be vindicated in that process. 
   We obviously have learned much from this proceeding. It is my hope that we will leave a mark to guide future Senates if we ever have to repeat this very, very trying sort of an experience.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation to try to deal with a very serious surge of steel imports into the United States, which is threatening to decimate the steel industry and take thousands of jobs from American steelworkers in a way which is patently unfair and in violation of free trade practices. My bill is entitled the ``Trade Fairness Act of 1999'' because it would bring our laws in line with those established by the General Agreement on Tarriffs and provide relief to the flood of foreign steel imports dumped onto the American market. 
   On Monday, November 30, 1998, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I convened a hearing of the Senate Steel Caucus to look further into the continued dumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market and its affect on domestic producers. At that hearing, Hank Barnette, Chairman and CEO of Bethlehem Steel, and George Becker, President of the United Steelworkers of America, testified to the magnitude of the crisis, the continued loss of high-paying jobs and the alarming lack of capital investment by the industry over the last several months. They both expressed frustration at the lack of activity by the Clinton Administration to respond to illegal dumping of foreign steel. 
   On October 7, 1998, Senator JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, Congressman RALPH REGULA and Congressman JIM OBERSTAR, and I met with representatives of the Clinton Administration, specifically Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Commerce Secretary William Daley, United States Trade Representative Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and National Economic Council Advisor Gene Sperling, to discuss the steel import issue. At that meeting, representatives of the Clinton Administration assured us that they were looking into actions that the Administration could take to respond to the illegal dumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market but had yet to make a final decision on their response. 
   The urgency of this crisis and the failure of the Administration to take action was evident from testimony presented on September 10, 1998, where, as Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I joined House Chairman REGULA in convening a joint meeting of the Senate and House Steel Caucuses to hear from members of the United Steelworkers of America and executives from a number of the nation's largest steel manufacturers about the current influx of imported steel into the United States. At that meeting, I expressed my profound concern regarding the impact on our steel companies and steelworkers of the current financial crises in Asia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian and Russian steel. 
   The United States has become the dumping ground for foreign steel. Russia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and China is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, while enormous subsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. In fact, the Commerce Department revealed that Russia, one of the world's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the United States at more than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, below the constructed cost to make steel plate. The dumping of this cheap steel on the American market ultimately costs our steel companies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for American workers. 
   Specifically, the October 1998 import level was the second highest monthly total ever, with 4.1 million net tons--an increase of 56 percent over October 1997 of 2.6 million net tons. Only August 1998 (4.4 million net tons) surpassed it. The October level, if annualized, would exceed 49 million net tons, or 48 percent of expected total U.S. domestic steel shipments for the entire year. Total imports in October were 35 percent of apparent consumption, up from 23 percent a year earlier. 
   Imports of steel from various countries have dramatically increased when the first six months of 1997 are compared to the first six months of 1998. The percent increases from four 
   countries are as follows: Japan, 141 percent; South Africa, 124 percent; South Korea, 96 percent; Russia, 29 percent. 
   The following is an example of the layoffs and plant slowdowns since September, 1998: 
   Geneva Steel has laid off 460 workers; 
   U.S. Steel's Philadelphia operations have been reduced by 70 percent;

    Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the winter recess, I had the opportunity to travel from Dec. 12 through Dec. 31, 1998, to 13 countries in Europe, the Mideast and the Gulf. I flew over with President Clinton on Air Force One, spent the first several days in Israel essentially working with the President's schedule, and then pursued my own agenda when he returned to Washington. I believe it is worthwhile to share with my colleagues some of my impressions from that trip, which I am placing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on Jan. 19, 1999, the first day for statements in the 106th Congress. 
   ISRAEL 
   From December 12 through December 15, I traveled with President Clinton to the Middle East to encourage the advancement of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in the wake of the accords reached in October at Wye Plantation. Although somewhat overshadowed by the pending impeachment process, the President's trip was useful, I believe, in applying pressure to both sides to abide by their commitments toward further progress. 
   SYRIA 
   When President Clinton returned to Washington, I proceeded to Damascus, Syria, where I met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, to examine the possibility of progress on the Israeli-Syrian track of the Mideast peace process. While I believe that progress between Israel and the Palestinians could be made with the resumption of a dialogue between Israel and Syria, the pending Israeli elections have rendered the prospect for that dialogue unlikely in the short run. 
   The big news while I talked with President Assad was the increasing tension between the United States and Iraq over the U.N. inspection of Iraq's weapons program. Because Syria shares a long border and cultural heritage--though certainly no great friendship--with Iraq, even the threat of military conflict between the U.S. and Baghdad produces immediate and tangible emotions among many Syrians. 
   That afternoon in December, the situation in Iraq seemed grave: the U.N. team had evacuated the country, and chief inspector Richard Butler was preparing to address the U.N. Security Council in an emergency session. I did not know that a strike was imminent, but President Assad and I speculated during our meeting on news reports concerning what the immediate future might hold. 
   Past midnight in Damascus, CNN carried live footage of anti-aircraft fire and air-raid sirens in Baghdad, only a few hundred miles away. The President's remarks from the Oval Office followed shortly thereafter, and, after a short night's rest, I was asked to comment on the bombing to an expectant Syrian press corps. 
   I told the press the same thing that I told President Assad in the previous day's meeting: I had written the President on November 12 urging him not to order the use of U.S. force against Iraq without first obtaining Congressional authorization as required by the United States Constitution. I believe that a missile strike is an act of war, and only the Congress of the United States under our Constitution has the authority to declare war. 
   Had the President taken the matter to the Congress, as President Bush did in 1991, I would have supported it. I believe that Saddam Hussein is a menace to the region and to the world. I believe it is true that he is developing weapons of mass destruction, and that he has demonstrated a willingness to employ chemical weapons for the most destructive and terrible purposes. Clearly, some forceful international action has to be taken. 
   I said I did not believe the President acted because of the pending impeachment vote. I indicated that, in my opinion, the President acted because he had put Saddam Hussein on notice in the past, and Ramadan was coming, as the President explained the previous evening. I said that I believe the House of Representatives was right in delaying the vote for a couple of days while we commenced a military strike on Iraq. 
   Constitutional requirements aside, there is a practical benefit to seeking Congressional approval for acts of war. When a President has the backing of Congress confirmed by way of a recorded vote, his hand is immediately strengthened in the eyes of the world. Absent that imprimatur of support, America's enemies or would-be enemies are left to poke and carp at the propriety and the purpose of the military action. And the attendant Congressional debate helps to sharpen the aims and follow-on goals of any action. Winning Congress' approval requires a President to spell out exactly what he hopes to accomplish through military force, and it forces him to keep those goals within the bounds of reality. 
   A recorded vote on military authorization is healthy for the Congress, as well. It puts Senators and Congressmen on the spot, up-or-down, on a matter of pivotal importance in national policy: deciding whether the goals of a military action justify the price in the blood and sweat of our troops. It is simply too easy for Congressional critics to bob and weave around taking a position on a given military action. If a particular campaign takes a difficult  turn, critics emerge from the woodwork. If, on the other hand, our troops achieve dramatic, unforseen successes, prior Congressional critics of the action take to the floor in lavish praise. 
   Insisting on proper Congressional debate and authorization on future military acts would end this charade, while fulfilling a fundamental tenet of our Constitution: ``The Congress ..... shall have power to declare war .....'' 
   EGYPT 
   Following the press conference, I departed Syria for Cairo, Egypt, to meet with President Hosni Mubarak. President Mubarak and I have met numerous times since his ascent to power following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Needless to say, our discussion this time centered around the U.S. military strike on Iraq. I made the same points about Congressional authorization for the use of force, and it was clear from the initial Egyptian reaction to the strike that our motives would have been clarified, and our hand strengthened, had the President sought and received the backing of Congress before attacking. Following my hour-long discussion with President Mubarak, I addressed the Egyptian press corps on the same points at the Presidential palace. 
   MACEDONIA 
   I then departed Egypt for Skopje, Macedonia. Upon arrival, I met with Ambassador Christopher R. Hill to discuss the situation in Kosovo and other issues affecting Bosnian regional stability. 
   Skopje is a beautiful, small city surrounded on all sides by mountains. The city was leveled almost completely by a post-WWII earthquake, as a result of which very little of the original Macedonian architecture remains. In place of the earlier buildings stand poured-concrete, Soviet-style structures that fail to reflect the rich heritage of the Macedonian people. 
   Formerly a sub-entity of Yugoslavia, Macedonia won its independence in the breakup of the former Soviet-bloc country that followed the end of the cold war. Macedonians are clearly 
   hardworking people, and it is probably no surprise that the tiny republic's economy reportedly is doing better than that of most other Yugoslavian republics save Slovenia. 
   Ambassador Hill and I met that afternoon with the country's newly-installed 33-year-old Prime Minister, Ljubco Giorgievski. The youthful Mr. Giorgievski is obviously proud of the emergence of Macedonia as a stable entity in a clearly unstable region. Mindful of the threat that Serbia has posed to Bosnia and Kosovo, he is particularly anxious for his country to develop friendly, close alliances with NATO, the European Community, and the United States. 
   That evening, I met with Ambassador William Walker, the U.N. head of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission. Ambassador Walker described in detail the instability of the region, and his unease about the lack of a protective detail or even airlift assets for his U.N. mission there. He described the situation in Kosovo as very different from Bosnia: Kosovo is a small-scale guerilla war, with no front lines, and with both Serbs and Albanians fighting for public opinion in the region. Ambassador Walker said his chief frustration is the absence of a political settlement for the U.N. to implement in Kosovo, such as the one that was forged in Bosnia. Without such an agreement, he said, providing real stability to the region will remain extremely problematic, as the U.N. will not be able to move forward on training local authorities and local police forces to provide security to the region. 
   NETHERLANDS 
   The next morning, I proceeded to the Netherlands, where I held a working lunch with Ambassador Cynthia P. Schneider and three members of the Dutch Parliament who served as experts in their different parties on Middle East issues. A consensus emerged that the international community needs to work to replace Saddam Hussein as the leader of Iraq, but no one could point to a realistic way for the international community to get that done. 
   We also discussed the benefits to the United States' opening up a dialogue with Iran in the future. Interestingly, one of the Members of Parliament present, Geert Wilders, had traveled to Iran, and expressed frustration that the absence of a real dialogue between the United States and Iran meant that Russia is having a disproportionate influence on the government, especially by way of providing technological expertise for the development of weapons of mass destruction. That said, Mr. Wilders expressed the clear difficulty in developing a productive dialogue with a government that hold such irresponsible positions on regional and international security. 
   I then proceeded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, where I met with Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and President Judge Gabrielle McDonald. In contrast to my previous visits to the tribunal, Justice Arbour expressed a reasonable degree of satisfaction with the Tribunal's U.N. funding, up by $23 million from last year's level of $70 million. Not surprisingly, Justice Arbour views this manifold increase as a real endorsement of the Tribunal's work in bringing justice to the victims of atrocities in Bosnia. In particular, she described the success of the prosecutors' exhumation of mass grave sites in Bosnia as part of their search for evidence to support present trials and further indictments. Justice Arbour expressed her aim of indicting and prosecuting a handful of ``top'' officials in the Bosnian conflict through the prosecution of lower-level criminals at present. 
   Judge Gabrielle McDonald, a former U.S. District Court Judge in Houston, indicated a similar satisfaction with the work of the tribunal, but, for her part, feels somewhat understaffed in her chambers, particularly as the prosecutors and bring more cases to trial. Also, Judge McDonald, as the Tribunal's Chief Judge, would like to publicize the court's work as a way both of letting victims know justice is being served, and of assuring those under indictment that they will receive a truly fair trial in The Hague, should they surrender themselves to the court. 
   As I left the Tribunal, the U.S. Embassy in The Hague was overrun by anti-war activists protesting the U.S. military strike against Iraq. 
   ENGLAND 
   During a stopover in London, I met with the country team headed by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Bradtke, to discuss further fallout from the bombing. The evening of my arrival, the House of Representatives voted out two Articles of Impeachment on President Clinton. The next evening, I appeared on a live broadcast of CBS's Face the Nation from the network's London studio. The show came the day after the House voted to impeach President Clinton, and I discussed procedures and context for the impending Senate trial. 
   BELGIUM/NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY 
   Operation Desert Fox, the US and British missile strikes on Iraq which ran four days during my travels, spurred anti-American demonstrations, attacks on US embassies and flag-burnings throughout Europe and the Mideast, including many of the nations to which I traveled. We had to switch hotels in Brussels upon arrival on Sunday, Dec. 20, because the American-owned Sheraton hotel where we had planned to stay was the site of a demonstration by some 200 Arabs, who seized and burned the hotel's American flag, and a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of the entire hotel. There had also been a demonstration during the day at the hotel where we did stay, but there was no more trouble that night. 
   Upon arrival Sunday evening Dec. 20 in Brussels, I met with U.S. Ambassador to NATO Alexander Vershbow for an informal briefing. On Monday morning at NATO headquarters, I met formally with the ambassador and 11 members of the U.S. team. We discussed ways of activating NATO against Iraq, and I expressed my concern that the recent bombings of Iraq were a strictly US-British operation, with no help from any of our other allies. Our team suggested that it takes too long to line up other nations and gives too much warning to Saddam. I rejected that proposition, given that we had signaled our intentions against Iraq after our near-strike in November. 
   We also discussed the Russian threat to Western Europe, stemming from Russian instability, and our efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. As for NATO and United Nations missions, I commented that many Americans abhor the idea of  putting US troops under a foreign commander. I told our team about the protests I hear on the subject regularly at my open-house town meetings throughout Pennsylvania. Some of our team argued that, ultimately, all NATO troops are under an American supreme commander, even if they happen to also be under a European divisional commander. 
   I met next with the German Ambassador to NATO, Joachim Bitterlich, who had served previously as former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's national security adviser. Ambassador Bitterlich began by assuring me that the US-British strike against Iraq was the right thing to do. I took up the questions of Iraq, Iran and the Middle East with Ambassador Bitterlich, and we agreed that expanded dialog should be part of any strategy. Like many other policy setters, Ambassador Bitterlich said he struggling to find any leverage over Saddam Hussein. 
   I met next with Gen. Klaus Nauman, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee. Gen. Nauman likened Saddam Hussein and his oppressive regime to the Nazis, under whom Gen. Nauman had spent his early childhood. Such a repressive terrorist regime makes it 
   very difficult to foster opposition forces from within, the General warned. As for Russia, Gen. Nauman agreed that western nations would be well advised to spend money to destroy Russia's nuclear and chemical weapons stockpile, as the United States and Germany have. But he cautioned that we must make sure the money goes for the purpose intended, and is not diverted, as past funds have been. 
   GREECE 
   We left Brussels early Monday morning and traveled most of the day, arriving in Athens late in the afternoon. I met with Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns. We discussed a variety of subjects, ranging from Greek-Turkish tension to the situations in Crete and Cyprus to local reaction to the Iraq bombings. 
   BAHRAIN 
   We left Athens early Tuesday morning, Dec. 22, and traveled to Bahrain. At a refueling stop at the Cairo airport, I met with two members of our country team to discuss recent intelligence about anti-American attacks in the region stemming from Operation Desert Fox. They briefed me on a mob attack on the U.S. ambassador's residence in Damascus, in which the residence was destroyed and our ambassador's wife was holed up in a steel-walled safe haven closet until Marines arrived to rescue her. Arriving late in the afternoon in Manama, Bahrain, I was met at the airport by Ambassador Johnny Young and Vice Admiral Charles ``William'' Moore and members of their teams. Admiral Moore, Commander of the Fifth Fleet, was in charge of much of the U.S. effort in Operation Desert Fox. 
   At the US Embassy, Admiral Moore and several of his senior officers briefed me on details of Operation Desert Fox. The operation, as Admiral Moore summarized it, was a success in that our forces executed their objectives with zero allied casualties. 
   I met next with 13 area chiefs of UNSCOM, the United Nations program to check Iraq's weapons of mass destruction through inspections and destruction of materiel. The UNSCOM chiefs, mostly in their 30s, came primarily from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. They looked shell-shocked, and as though they had not slept in weeks. As I told them at the outset, the world owes them a debt of gratitude for the job they have done and for the risks they have taken. 
   UNSCOM's numbers have dwindled from a high of 186 inspectors to 112. Forty-seven of the inspectors had moved their base to Bahrain after evacuating from Iraq hours before the bombing. We discussed their assessments of Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, the various delivery systems Iraq was developing or had built, and the difficulties in conducting inspections and in tracking weapons components and chemical precursors. They told me, for example, that they had found biological agents in far greater quantities than could be justified by legitimate uses. The UNSCOM chiefs all said they were ``keen'' to return to Iraq and continue their work, though that prospect remains in doubt. 
   OMAN 
   Early Wednesday morning, Dec. 23, we flew to Oman. Upon arrival in the capital city of Muscat, we drove for a meeting with Sheik Abdullah bin Ali Al-Qatabi, President of the Majlis As-Shura, or elected lower house of the national council. For the first 40 minutes, the Sheikh deflected my questions about threats to the region and the world by Iraq and Iran, reducing the meeting to small talk and an exchange of views on civics and bicameral legislatures. Then, when we took photographs and stood to leave, the Sheik could contain himself no longer and told me what was really on his mind, for nearly an hour as we stood at the center of his office. 
   The Sheik said Iraq did not pose the grave threat I suggested, arguing that Saddam Hussein had not used weapons of mass destruction during the Persian Gulf War and probably would not again. Further, he argued, our operations would not eliminate Saddam Hussein, but would only hurt the Iraqi people, who depend on the infrastructure we destroy, and inflame passions throughout the region against the United States. 
   The Sheik was concerned that we had embarrassed the Sultan and the government of Oman through publicity about the use of Omani bases by U.S. aircraft during Operation Desert Fox. He used the word ``embarrassment'' four times, noting that such embarrassment made it more difficult for Omani leaders to pursue their genuine desires to continue warm relations with the United States. Oman was not embarrassed about the use of its bases for allied planes during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 because of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, he said. 
   The Sheikh told me that he was being unusually frank out of friendship, and I assured him I appreciated his candor. I addressed his concerns, telling him that collateral damage to civilians is inevitable in any military strike, and that we minimized civilian casualties during Operation Desert Fox and very much regretted any losses. 
   I met next with U.S. Ambassador Frances Cook and members of her team. Ambassador Cook warned that anti-American opinion had been growing in Oman. Two demonstrations were held at the university, she noted; the only two in the school's 10-year history. From this visit and previous contacts, I believe Ambassador Cook has done an outstanding job. 
   I then met with Oman's Minister of Information, Abdulaziz Al-Rawwas, for what would prove another long and direct conversation. Minister Al-Rawwas also did not consider Iraq or Iran threats to the region, and also criticized our military efforts against Iraq as ineffective. He pressed me to consider an overture to Iran to warm US relations with that nation, such as dropping embargoes or allowing a planned Caspian oil pipeline to pass through Iran on a southern route to the Persian Gulf, rather than through a western route through southern Europe to the Black Sea, which the U.S. currently favors. I assured him I would study the matter. 
   Our party arrived at the Muscat airport shortly after 6 am the next morning, Thursday, to fly to Islamabad for a scheduled meeting with Pakistan's Prime Minister and for other meetings in Pakistan and India. I had wanted to discuss the nuclear stand-off in the region, and disarmament measures. But fog and smoke over most of the subcontinent made air travel impossible, for us and for all other commercial and official traffic into and out of the subcontinent. We had no better luck on Friday morning. We then tried to adjust our schedule, but were unable to get necessary clearances and make flight and meeting arrangements on Friday, Dec. 25, which was both Christmas Day and the first Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. We wound up staying in Oman until Saturday morning, Dec. 26, at which point we departed for Amman, Jordan. 
   JORDAN 
   Days before I arrived in Amman, Jordanian Parliamentarians, in a highly unusual move, surprised the Monarchy by convening a conference of Arab Parliamentarians on six days notice, to discuss the US-British missile strikes on Iraq. Parliamentarians from 15 of the 16 countries in the Arab League dispatched representatives to Amman.  Only Kuwait declined to attend. President Assad reportedly ordered the Syrian Speaker to attend personally. 
   After arriving in Amman, I met with Jordan's Foreign 
   Minister, Abdul Illah Al Khatib, for an hour. Minister Khatib, whom I had met several times over the years both in Washington and Jordan, lamented the failure so far to implement the Wye River peace accord between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Both sides, we agreed, were torn by factionalism. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Netanyahu was mired in struggles with hard-liners and fighting to keep his job, while on the Palestinian side, Abu Mazen, the second-ranking official, had his house stoned for his efforts to effect the peace accord, leaving him reportedly so shaken that he wanted nothing more to do with the peace process. In the face of such factionalism, Al Khatib said, the parties and the process needed leadership from the United States. 
   Jordan's other pressing foreign policy problem, Al Khatib said, was Iraq. He noted that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Persian Gulf War, sent 400,000 Kuwaiti refugees to Jordan, swelling Jordan's population by 10 percent and buffeting Jordan's economy as it tries to house and absorb the new residents. The foreign minister said we should have a permanent monitoring system for Iraq's weapons efforts. In the evening, we met with Crown Prince El Hassan bin Talal, heir to the throne and brother of King Hussein, who was at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota undergoing cancer therapy, and several of his ministers. The Crown Prince had been briefed on my meeting with the Foreign Minister, and we proceeded directly to discussing policy. 
   The next morning, Sunday, Dec. 27, I met with our embassy team for a briefing. Based on what they told me, I grew even more concerned that we had so badly misread regional public opinion in launching our strikes against Iraq. 
   Before leaving Washington, I had raised that specific question with an Administration Cabinet officer. He had replied the administration had no day-after plan; but that was not a reason not to launch the strikes. Disagreeing sharply, I said it was. 
   Our policy makers apparently based their assurances to the American public of Arab support on regional leaders who, eager for US aid, told them what they thought the Americans wanted to hear. No longer can the United States talk only to government officials to gauge their nation's reaction. Nor can we count on Arab national leaders to suppress public reaction against our ill-planned acts. 
   In Amman, our experts told me that despite general ennui with Saddam Hussein, Jordanian public opinion about our missile strikes was very strongly pro-Saddam, a feeling exacerbated by the US failure to articulate a post-strike plan. After my discussion with our embassy team, I met Sunday morning with Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who expressed the same criticisms of our recent strikes against Iraq. ``We don't know what the military strike did,'' the Prime Minister said. ``It seems he is better off.'' Our timing was poor, he said, just before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and following what he perceived as Israel putting the Wye River accord ``in the deep freeze.'' 
   As for Iraqi opposition to Saddam, the Prime Minister said, it is there, but it is fictionalized and lacks any acceptable leader. ``It is a complicated matter, and every military strike makes it more complicated,'' he said. 
   When the Jordanian Prime Minister apologized for the Amman Parliamentarians' conference, I surprised him by expressing my view that it was a healthy sign to see Jordan's Parliamentarians expressing an independent view from the Jordanian government, even if it conflicted with US policy. 
   ``We have to do a much better job in the United States of taking into account what the public reaction will be,'' I conceded. 
   When I asked the Prime Minister to explain the Jordanian people's support for Iraq and Saddam, he said, ``The people here do support Saddam. Jordanians do not believe in dictatorship. They are aware of the fact that this is a brutal regime. But this does not negate the fact that the Iraqis are our brothers.'' 
   IZMIR, TURKEY 
   From Amman, we flew to Izmir, Turkey, a city of 4 million that serves as headquarters for a NATO charged with ensuring the security and territory of NATO's southern and eastern flank. I spent much of the day Sunday with Maj. Gen. Reginal Clemmons, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Element of the Allied Land Forces-Southeastern Europe, members of Gen. Clemmons's staff, and U.S. Air Force officers from the 425th Air Base Squadron, based in downtown Izmir. 
   Over the course of several hours, we discussed Greek-Turkish tension, recently inflamed by plans to bring Russian-made S-300 missiles to the Greek island of Crete, and still hot over joint control of Cyprus; plans to create a Kurdish state in northern Iraq; a potential Caspian oil pipeline through Turkey; and realities of working with foreign military officers. Gen. Clemmons serves as deputy commander of the Izmir-based NATO post, under a four-star Turkish general. 
   GEORGIA 
   Before dawn Tuesday morning, we took off for Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, one of the 15 former Soviet Republics. Rugged, mountainous and historically worn-torn, Georgia is famous as the home of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Georgia endured several years of civil war recently, from the Soviet breakup until 1995. President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, survived two assassination attempts, and has led the effort to ally Georgia with the West and to foster democracy and a market economy. Georgia has been looking primarily to the United States for help. 
   I met first with U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz and his team at the embassy for a full briefing on the nation of 5 million. We discussed Georgia's struggle toward democracy and a market economy, frustrated by corruption, civil war, and failure to collect taxes; Georgia's struggle with Russia, which seeks to control its former republic and thwart its efforts toward independence; Georgia's reliance on U.S. aid, which was $85 million this year, compared to the nation's $100 million budget; and advantages and disadvantages of running the Caspian oil pipeline through Georgia to the Black Sea. 
   I then met for an hour with President Shevardnadze. The President looked more somber than he had when I last saw him in Washington, but he still seemed vigorous and intense at not quite 71. Mr. Shevardnadze is largely responsible for the progress Georgia has made toward democratization and a market economy since the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, but he was the first to say much more work remains to be done. Nation building was put off until 1995, after Georgia's post-Soviet civil war ended, he noted. 
   Russian instability poses perhaps the greatest threat to the region, Shevardnadze said. He brushed off my concern that an expanded NATO would give Russian hard-liners an excuse to seize control, saying extremists did not have an adequate base from which to take over. But President Shevardnadze said he did have a major concern: ``The West failed to notice the Soviet Union's disintegration; the West was caught unaware,'' he said. ``Make sure the formation of a new Soviet Union does not catch you similarly unaware.'' 
   In Russia, Shevardnadze warned, people of all political 
   stripes support restoring the Soviet Union. He did not see a reunited Soviet Union as a benign force. ``Gorbachev had a different vision; a vision of a democratic Soviet Union,'' Shevardnadze said. ``But that was an illusion--or a delusion.'' If democracy were an option, he said, the former Soviet republics would opt for independence. 
   On the question of terrorism, Shevardnadze said the United States should pressure Russia to stop selling arms to rogue nations such as Iran, saying we should have leverage over Russia, considering the $18 billion we give them. Shevardnadze, not surprisingly, argued that the Caspian oil pipeline should run through Georgia and Turkey. The pipeline, by all accounts, offers a major strategic and economic plum for any nation through which it runs. 
   We met next with Georgia's Minister of State, the equivalent of the Prime Minister, Vazha Lordkipanidze. We discussed Georgia's economic reform efforts, including privatization, banking,  liberalization of prices, decentralization of management; and the smuggling, shoddy tax collection and Russian meddling that have frustrated these economic reforms. Lordkipanidze also did not believe NATO expansion would provoke and strengthen Russian hard-liners, saying extremists would find another pretext if NATO did not expand. The West must foster democracy in Russia and in other former Soviet republics, he urged. 
   Our final meeting in Tbilisi was with Parliamentary Chairman, or Speaker, Zhurab Zhvania, who had just turned 35, and a 31-year-old Parliamentarian who had studied law at Columbia University. The Parliamentarians' English was fluent, and they were both very impressive, and encouraging for their nation's long-term prospects. We covered the same sweep of issues that I had discussed with President Shevardnadze and with the Prime Minister, and they offered similar views. They spoke passionately about Georgia's Constitution, the only Eastern national charter patterned on the U.S. Constitution; and about the nation's judicial reform, including competitive exams monitored by California Bar examiners that cleared out nearly all the previous political appointees. We differed on the death penalty, which I believe is a deterrent to crime, but which Georgia has abolished, the Speaker said, as a matter of moral philosophy. 
   ANKARA, TURKEY 
   From Tbilisi we flew to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, arriving Tuesday evening, Dec. 29. We met the next morning with U.S. Ambassador Mark Parris, a former foreign affairs adviser to President Clinton, and his team for an hour briefing on the political landscape. Turkey's government is fractionalized, and the Turkish military commands the most popular support, which Parris considered a mixed blessing. The military is honest and conservative, cracking down on threats to the secular state, Parris said, but the military also cracks down on free speech that advocates proscribed positions. National elections and elections in Turkey's three major cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, are all scheduled for April 1999. 
   I was particularly impressed that Turkey had succeeded in getting Syria to evict terrorist camps based near Syria's Turkish border that preyed on Turks. The Kurdish PKK movement, seeking a separate Kurdish state, has killed an estimated 30,000 Turks since the Soviet grip began to loosen around 1989. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was specifically evicted from Syria. 
   In my discussions with Parris and his team, we focused on the Caspian oil pipeline, beginning with the proposition that the Turks have come around to the American way of thinking: That the pipeline ought to run east-west to the Black Sea, through Turkey and Georgia, not south to the Persian Gulf through unstable and potentially hostile areas such as Iran. An east-west pipeline would tie central Asia to the West, and avoid giving Iran strategic leverage, the strategy holds. 
   I also remained impressed by Turkey's strong ties to Israel. The two nations conduct joint military exercises, trade and joint ventures on such items as insurance, leather goods and software. The collaboration began as a Turkish effort to win points with the United States, which was being pressed by Greek and other anti-Turkish lobbies. But the Turkish-Israeli collaboration soon warmed into a genuine symbiotic relationship apart from US politics, Parris said. 
   We met next with Ambassador Faruk Logoglu of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Logoglu had spent 13 years in the United States, attending college at Brandeis and graduate school at Princeton, teaching at Middlebury and serving at the United Nations before taking his post at the Turkish Foreign Ministry in 1971. Pressing for the east-west pipeline, Logoglu said, ``The pipeline is an umbilical cord tying countries to the West.'' 
   My final meeting in Turkey was with President Suleyman Demirel. The President received us in a grand, wood-trimmed chamber in the Presidential palace, finished with red carpet and chandeliers. President Demirel spoke softly in perfect English. 
   I complimented the President on his warm relations with Israel, despite its risks of angering nations hostile to Israel. He replied that the Turkish-Israeli friendship had indeed angered some nations at Turkey. At an Islamic conference in Iran, the President said, he stood and said Turkey was a sovereign nation and could do whatever was necessary to pursue its interests. There was no response from representatives of the 55 nations present, he said. 
   As to Saddam Hussein, President Demirel said he had known him for about 24 years, but it was a ``puzzle'' as to how to deal with him. The United States should enlist allies in its efforts to influence Saddam, he urged. 
   I asked the President if he would accept an invitation to meet at the Oval Office with his Greek counterpart, with whom he does not talk, just as President Clinton had brought together Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. I had no authority to call such a meeting, I noted, but stressed the power of the U.S. Presidency. The President replied that Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, should come to an agreement first, but he did not discount the possibility of an Oval Office meeting. 
   NAPLES, ITALY 
   From Ankara we flew to Naples, where I met with Lt. Gen. Jack Nix, in charge of the Army NATO troops, while we refueled. We spent most of our half hour discussing Bosnia. Gen. Nix cautioned that we can only reduce our troops so far; that we must maintain a baseline to allow both mobility and the ability to rescue other troops. 
   From Naples we flew to London, where we arrived in the evening, stayed overnight at an airport hotel, and flew back to the United States the next day. Our visits were facilitated and generally made pleasant by the assistance and cooperation of U.S. embassies in the various countries.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to comment briefly on the President's State of the Union speech and to introduce legislation, since this is the first day of the 106th Congress when legislation may be introduced. 
   I applaud President Clinton for proceeding with the State of the Union tonight. Some say that Capitol Hill is schizophrenic with impeachment proceedings in the Senate Chamber, and across the Rotunda we will hear the President's State of the Union speech in the House Chamber. But I believe that it is very important that we take care of the Nation's business. I think that can be accomplished at the same time that we move forward with the Senate being constituted as a Court of Impeachment to decide that issue. 
   I have noted the advance text of the President's statement commenting on education and his desire to set up incentives to be a condition for Federal funding. I chair the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Education and we will proceed very promptly with hearings on that subject to make a determination, legislatively, as to whether, at least in the view of our subcommittee, those kinds of standards and those kinds of conceptions are appropriate or whether they may constitute too much Federal interference with education which traditionally has been left to the State and local levels. But we are prepared to move right ahead with that legislation, with that consideration. 
   Noted also from the President's advance text about an intention to deal with the issue of local preparation for responding if--God forbid--there should be weapons of mass destruction unleashed on the American people--again, that is a matter which would come within our Subcommittee on Health. At the same time, there is a commission working on weapons of mass destruction, on legislation which I authored 2 years ago as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. John Deutch, former CIA Director, chairs the commission and I serve as vice chairman of the committee. 
   We are prepared to move ahead with what the President has offered and what the President has to say. I compliment him for moving ahead with that State of the Union speech to take care of the Nation's business. I believe the Congress will cooperate by moving ahead on two tracks--we can have the Court of Impeachment in the Senate Chamber and the State of the Union speech in the House Chamber, and the Rotunda will not be schizophrenic and we can function.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing three legislative matters, including legislation on health care, which has been a focal point of my attention and my tenure in the Senate, and again for my chairmanship of the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Health. I believe that we can move ahead to cover the 43 million Americans who are now not covered within the existing expenditures of $1.100 trillion a year. There are ways to economize. There can be an extension of health care by making it easier for small businesses to pool their resources and buy health insurance, by accelerating the date when there will be full deductibility for health care, and there could be very, very substantial savings possible on matters which are specified in the course of this legislation.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing, along with the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, legislation to deal with America's cities. Some are urgently in need of assistance. Our legislation is not to add new funding through appropriations but, instead, to have the General Services Administration allocate 15 percent of new expenditures to enterprise zones, to distressed areas, to have Federal buildings constructed, with the priority in cities where there are depressed areas to provide jobs in those areas, and to reinstitute certain historical tax breaks which could be of great benefit for the cities.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a third legislative matter is a resolution calling for the Budget Committee to allocate an additional $2 billion to the health account to be used for the National Institutes of Health, being offered on behalf of myself and Senator HARKIN in our continuing effort to see to it that additional funds are allocated for the National Institutes of Health, which is really the crown jewel  of the Federal Government. In fact, Mr. President, it may be the only jewel in the Federal Government. We understand that the allocation in health is to a category, but the funds are very, very limited on our subcommittee. 
   Last year, Senator HARKIN, ranking, and I as chairman, were able to take the lead in some $2 billion to NIH, but it was at the expense of other programs which were very, very important for worker safety, for education programs, for other health programs. We are committing this resolution with that specific request to the Budget Committee.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, tomorrow legislation will be introduced by a coalition of bipartisan Senators--Democrats and Republicans--to bring some relief to the steel industry. The steel industry has been very, very hard hit in America. In the past two decades, steel jobs have declined from some 500,000 to about 150,000. Billions of dollars have been invested in the steel industry, and we have had a surge of dumped steel--that is, steel which is sold in the United States at a lower price than it is sold in the country of origin. Russia, with their economy in great distress, will sell steel at any price in the United States to get dollars. A similar problem has evolved, too, in Japan, Korea, Indonesia and other countries. 
   The Senate Steel Caucus, both on the House side and the Senate side, has held hearings. Senator ROCKEFELLER, vice chairman of the Steel Caucus, and I, in my capacity as chairman, will be introducing the legislation tomorrow with many Senators in support--Senator BYRD, Senator SANTORUM, and many others--as well as representatives of the steelworkers union and the steel industry themselves. On the House side, Representative REGULA of Ohio, who chairs the House Steel Caucus, will be joining us in this legislative introduction. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation that will deal with the plight of our nation's cities and Washington's increasing neglect of them. With 80% of the U.S. population living in metropolitan areas, there is an urgent need to improve our urban economies and the quality of life for the millions of Americans who live and work in cities. By simply making our cities an appealing place to live, work, recreate, and visit, urban areas can rebound to the vibrant economic centers they once were. 
   There is a common perception that urban areas are abandoned and stripped of their resources, burdened with poverty and crime. However, cities have a wealth of resources available to not only the urban dweller but to the world--cultural centers, business hubs, and some of the finest educational and medical institutions. The real problem is that we do not draw upon these riches or strive to better coordinate them to serve people, most especially those in need. 
   My proposal, the ``New Urban Agenda Act of 1999'' is based on legislation which I have endeavored to make law since the 103rd Congress. I am pleased to be introducing it today, in this first Congress of the new millennium, with my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, who also recognizes the potential of both small cities and large metropolitan areas. 
   The bill constitutes an effort to give our cities some much-needed attention, but reflects the federal budgetary constraints which govern all that we in Congress do these days. This bill, based in significant part on suggestions by Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell and the League of Cities, offers aid to the cities while containing federal expenditures and by re-instituting important cost-effective tax breaks which have been discontinued. 
   If we are to really address many of the very serious social issues that we face--unemployment, teenage pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other pressing issues--we cannot give up on our cities. There must be new strategies for dealing with the problems of urban America. The days of creating ``Great Society'' federal aid programs are clearly past, but that is no excuse for the national government to turn a blind eye to the problems of the cities.  
   Urban areas remain integral to America's greatness as centers of commerce, industry, education, health care, and culture. Yet urban areas, particularly the inner cities which tend to have a disproportionate share of our nation's poor, also have special needs which must be recognized. We must develop ways of aiding our cities that do not require either new taxes or more government bureaucracy. 
   As a Philadelphia resident, I have first-hand knowledge of the growing problems that plague our cities. The most recent U.S. Census data collected showed that Philadelphia has over 300,000 individuals in poverty and when federal welfare reform took effect in October 1996, 113,000 adults were receiving some form of cash assistance. Reflecting on my experience as a Philadelphian, I have long supported a variety of programs to assist our cities, such as increased funding for Community Development Block Grants and legislation to establish enterprise and empowerment zones. To encourage similar efforts, in April, 1994, I hosted my Senate Republican colleagues on a visit to explore urban problems in my hometown. We talked with people who wanted to obtain work, but had found few opportunities. We saw a crumbling infrastructure and its impact on residents and businesses. We were reminded of the devastating effect that the loss of inner city businesses and jobs has had on our neighborhoods in America's cities. What my Republican colleagues saw then in Philadelphia is the urban rule across our country and not the exception. 
   There are many who do not know of city life, who are far removed from the cities and would not be expected to have any key interest in what goes on in the big cities of America. I cite my own boyhood experience illustratively: Born in Wichita, Kansas, raised in Russell, a small town of 5,000 people on the plains of Kansas, where there is not much detailed knowledge of what goes on in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or other big cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Detroit or Chicago. 
   Those big cities are alien to people in much of America. But there is a growing understanding that the problems of big cities contribute significantly to the general problems affecting our nation and have an economic impact, at the very least, on our small towns. For rural America to prosper, we need to make sure that urban America prospers and vice-versa. For example, if cities had more economic growth, taxes could be reduced on all Americans at the federal and state level because revenues would increase and social welfare spending would be reduced. 
   There is indeed a domino effect from our cities to rural communities of the country. Lately, we have been witnessing this in the violent behavior of adolescents. School violence and juvenile crime are no longer endemic to urban living. Take the Bloods and the Crips gangs from Los Angeles, California, and similar gangs; that are all over America. They are in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Des Moines, Iowa; Portland, Oregon; Jackson, Mississippi; Racine, Wisconsin; and Martinsburg, West Virginia. They are literally everywhere, big city and small city alike. 
   In the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's 1998 report on the ``State of the Cities,'' findings show that large urban schools still deal with a higher concentration of violence, and the data only represents crimes which were serious enough to report to the police. The School District of Philadelphia's most recent report on school violence shows that in the 1994-1995 academic year, students, teachers and administrators were the victims of 2,147 reported criminal incidents, up by almost 100% from the previous year. These included assault, robbery, rape, and students being stabbed or even shot. The school district also reported troubling news about abysmal attendance rates. On any given day, more than one in every four students are absent. 
   Understandably so, city residents are afraid to continue leading an urban lifestyle. Each day, small business owners question whether they should remain in the city because they fear for the safety of their children, their employees, and ultimately, their businesses. I have personally met and spoken with shop owners in the University City section of Philadelphia who tell me that they look desperately for reasons to stay, but it gets harder and harder. 
   Joblessness and a less skilled work force are additional problems. To facilitate economic development and job creation in the United States, I supported the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which contained such provisions as the Job Training Partnership Act and the Targeted Job Tax Credit. As Congress put the final touches on that legislation, I circulated a joint letter from several Senators to then-Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich recommending spurring job creation and economic growth in our cities through several urban initiatives such as: a targeted capital gains exclusion, commercial revitalization tax credit, historic rehabilitation tax credit, and child care credit. Last year, I introduced the ``Job Preparation and Retention Training Act of 1998,'' which was included in the recently enacted Workforce Development Act of 1998. My legislation authorized funding for States to enroll long-term welfare dependents into a training program which would provide the 
   necessary skills to locate and maintain gainful and unsubsidized employment. 
   The last census taken in 1990, reported that New York City led the way, with 1.3 million individuals in poverty. My home of Philadelphia had 313,374 individuals in poverty at that time. And in HUD's 1998 ``State of the Cities'' report, by 1996, one in every five urban families lived in poverty, compared with fewer than one in ten suburban families. These facts emphasize the need for more efforts to be focused on strengthening our inner city businesses which, in turn, will boost local economies and serve to provide more jobs, reduce poverty and, hopefully, reduce crime. 
   I have long supported efforts to encourage the growth of small business. During the 105th Congress, I once again introduced legislation to provide targeted tax incentives for investing in small minority- or women-owned businesses. Small businesses provide the bulk of the jobs in this country. Many minority entrepreneurs, for instance, have told me that they are dedicated to staying in the cities to employ people there, but continue to confront capital access issues. My legislation, the ``Minority and Women Capital Formation Act'' would help to remove the capital access barriers, thereby enabling these entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and payrolls. 
   Municipal leaders are stressing many of the same concerns that business people are voicing. In a July, 1994 National League of Cities report dealing with poverty and economic development, municipal leaders ranked inadequate skills and education of workers as one of the top three reasons, in addition to shortage of jobs and below-poverty wages, for poverty and joblessness in their cities. They said, according to the survey, that more jobs must be created through local economic development initiatives. 
   This ``skills deficit'' is highlighted in an urban revitalization plan prepared in 1991 by the National Urban League called ``Playing to Win: A Marshall Plan for America's Cities.'' The report cites a statistic by the Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills which showed that 60 percent of all 21-25 year-olds lack the basic reading and writing skills needed for the modern workplace, and only 10 percent of those in that age group have enough mathematical competence for today's jobs. The economic problems our cities are facing are not easy to deal with or answer. In a report by the National League of Cities entitled ``City Fiscal Conditions in 1996,'' municipal officials from 381 cities answered questions on the economic state of their cities. In response to state budgetary problems, 21.7 percent of responding cities reduced municipal employment and 18.5 percent had frozen municipal employment. Nearly six out of ten cities raised or imposed new taxes or user fees during the past twelve months. 
   These numbers are of concern to me and I believe they highlight the need for federal legislation to enhance the ability of cities to achieve competitive economic status. An added concern is that city managers are forced to balance cuts in services or enact higher taxes. Neither choice is easy and it often counteracts municipal efforts to retain residents or businesses.  
   One issue, in particular, that is hurting many cities is the erosion of their tax bases, evidenced particularly by middle-class flight to the suburbs. Mr. Ronald Walters, professor of Political Science at Howard University, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in April 1993, stated that in 1950, 23 percent of the American population lived outside central cities; by 1988, that number was up to 46 percent. The District of Columbia's population loss is among the worst in the nation, with a quarter of its population relocating since the 1970s. This trend of shrinking urban populations gives no sign of ceasing. Middle-class families continue to leave for the suburbs where there are typically better public services. 
   These losses are devastating, not only to the financial stability of the city, but to the social fabric as well. On the financial side, statistics show that those people fleeing cities were earning an average of $30,000 to $75,000 a year. On the social side, roughly half of these are African-American Middle-class families. By losing this critical demographic group, the city loses much of what makes it strong. As America's cities struggle with the exodus of residents, businesses and industry, city residents who remain are faced with problems ranging from increased tax burdens and lesser services to dwindling economic opportunities, leading to welfare dependence and unemployment assistance. In the face of all this, what do we do? 
   The federal government has attempted to revitalize our ailing urban infrastructure by providing federal funding for transit and sewer systems, roads and bridges. I have supported this. For example, as a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee and as co-chair of an informal Senate Transit Coalition, I have been a strong supporter of public transit which provides critically needed transportation services in urban areas. Transit helps cities meet clean air standards, reduce traffic congestion, and allows disadvantaged persons access to jobs. Federal assistance for urban areas, however, has become increasingly scarce as we grapple with the nation's deficit and debt. Therefore, we must find alternatives to reinvigorate our nation's cities so they can once again be economically productive areas providing promising opportunities for residents and neighboring areas. To address the need for reliable transportation systems in our nation's cities and to provide access to jobs for city residents, I introduced reverse commute and jobs access legislation, which was successfully included in last year's highway and transit reauthorization bill. The bill authorizes $400 million over the next five years in access-to-jobs transit grants targeted at low-income individuals. Up to $10 million per year can be used for reverse commute projects to move individuals from cities to suburban job centers. 
   In addition to support for infrastructure, I believe there are ways Congress can assist the cities. In 1994, Mayor Rendell came up with a legislative package which contains many good ideas. I have taken many of these suggestions and have since added and revised provisions to take into account new developments at the federal, state and local levels to create the ``New Urban Agenda Act of 1999.'' 
   First, recognizing that the federal government is the nation's largest purchaser of goods and services, this legislation would require that no less than 15 percent of federal government purchases are made from businesses and industries within designated urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Similarly, my bill would require that not less than 15 percent of foreign aid funds be redeemed through purchases of products manufactured in urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. The General Services Administration will be required to submit to Congress its assessment of the extent to which federal agencies are committed to this policy and in general, economic revitalization in distressed urban areas. 
   The second major provision of this bill would commit the federal government to play an active role in restoring the economic health of our cities by encouraging the location, or relocation, of federal facilities in urban areas. To accomplish this, all federal agencies would be required to prepare and submit to the President an Urban Impact Statement detailing the impact that relocation or downsizing decisions would have on the affected city. Presidential approval would be required to place a federal facility outside an urban area, or to downsize a city-based agency. 
   The third critical component of this bill would revive and 
   expand federal tax incentives that were eliminated or restricted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Until there is passage of legislation on the flat tax, which would provide benefits superior to all targeted tax breaks, I believe America's cities should have the advantages of such tax benefits. These provisions offer meaningful incentives to business to invest in our cities. I am calling for the restoration of the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit which supports inner city revitalization projects. According to information provided by Mayor Rendell, there were 8,640 construction jobs involved in 356 projects in Philadelphia from 1978 to 1985 stimulated by the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit. In Chicago, 302 projects prior to 1985 generated $524 million in investment and created 20,695 jobs. In St. Louis, 849 projects generated $653 million in investment and created 27,735 jobs. 
   Nationally, according to National Park Service estimates for the 16 years before the 1986 Act, the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit stimulated $16 billion in private investment for the rehabilitation of 24,656 buildings and the creation of 125,306 homes which included 23,377 low and moderate income housing units. The 1986 Tax Act dramatically reduced the pool of private investment capital available for rehabilitation projects. In Philadelphia, projects dropped from 356 to 11 by 1988 from 1985 levels. During the same period, investments dropped 46 percent in Illinois and 92 percent in St. Louis. 
   Another tool is to expand the authorization of commercial industrial development bonds. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, authorization for commercial industrial bonds was permitted to expire. Consequently, private investment in cities declined. For instance, according to Mayor Rendell, from 1986--the last year commercial development bonds were permitted--to 1987, the total number of city--supported projects in Philadelphia was reduced by more than half. 
   Industrial development or private activity bonds encourage private investment by allowing, under certain circumstances, tax-exempt status for projects where more than 10 percent of the bond proceeds are used for private business purposes. The availability of tax-exempt commercial industrial development bonds will encourage private investment in cities, particularly the construction of sports, convention and trade show facilities; free standing parking facilities owned and operated by the private sector; air and water pollution facilities owned and operated by the private sector; and, industrial parks. 
   The bill I am introducing would allow this. It would also increase the small issue exemption, which means a way to help finance private activity in the building of manufacturing facilities from $10 million to $50 million to allow increased private investment in our cities. 
   A minor change in the federal tax code related to arbitrage rebates on municipal bond interest earnings could also free additional capital for infrastructure and economic development by cities. Currently, municipalities are required to rebate to the federal government any arbitrage--a financial term meaning interest earned in excess of interest paid on the debt--earned from the issuance of tax-free municipal bonds. I am informed that compliance, or the cost for consultants to perform the complicated rebate calculations, is actually costing municipalities more than the actual rebate owed to the government. This bill would allow cities to keep the arbitrage earned so that they can use it to fund city projects and for other necessary purposes. 
   My legislation also provides important incentives for businesses to invest and locate in our nation's cities. Specifically, the bill includes a provision which I have advocated to provide a 50 percent exclusion for capital gains tax purposes for any gain resulting from targeted investments in small businesses located in urban empowerment zones, enterprise communities, or enterprise zones. I also want to note that the exclusion would extend to any venture funds that invest in those small  businesses, which is critical because venture funds are often the lifeblood of a small business. This is one of the incentives I recommended to Senator Dole in December 1995 for inclusion in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which was later vetoed by President Clinton. A targeted capital gains exclusion will serve as a catalyst for job creation and economic growth in our cities by encouraging additional private investment in our urban areas. 
   A fourth provision of this legislation provides needed reforms to regulations and the financial challenges to obtaining affordable housing. This legislation provides language to study streamlining federal housing program assistance to urban areas into a block grant form so that municipal agencies can better serve local residents. Safe, clean, and affordable housing is not widely available to most low income families. According to the National Housing Law Project, in 1996, only one in four families was eligible to receive HUD assistance, with waits of up to five years. In HUD's most recent annual report, just as many families are still struggling with the lack of affordable housing as they were when a record 5.3 million low-income renters were paying more than 50 percent of their income for rent between 1993 and 1995. This provision of the bill steers the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to take a hard look at these conditions and determine what works and what does not work in federally-subsidized housing and to consider alternatives that will provide suitable homes for America's families. 
   I believe that we as a nation should work toward providing individuals and their families with more opportunities for homeownership which stabilizes a community and would especially restore our cities. Urban homeownership including middle-income homeownership lags behind the suburbs. According to the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, city residents of all income levels are less likely to own a home than suburban residents with similar incomes. I hear time and time again from families starting out that they move out to the suburbs for better schools, because central cities lack the property tax base to provide for quality schools. Homeownership is key to saving our cities, both socially and economically. A 1998 Fannie Mae national housing survey indicated that even though homeownership rates continue to increase in the late 1990s, six in every ten renters said that buying a home is a very important priority, if not their number-one priority in life. Yet for so many families financial barriers make that dream unattainable. That is why my bill includes a tax credit to restore the American dream of homeownership. A tax credit could be used by income-eligible individuals and families to purchase homes in distressed areas. In the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress approved such a tax credit for homebuyers in the District of Columbia. While single family home sales can be attributed to a multitude of factors, such as historically low interest rates and a strong economy, let me just share with you some amazing statistics related to homeownership since enactment of the tax credit in the District of Columbia. The Home Purchase Assistance Program through the District of Columbia's Office of Housing and Community Development helped 410 families purchase homes. Further, 
   a group called the ``Washington Partners for Homeownership,'' a collaboration of realtors, banks, community and faith-based organizations, set a goal last year to create 1,000 new homeowners in the District of Columbia for each of the next three years. Remarkably, the Washington Partners have already reached that goal before the end of the first year. I believe that this country will reap extraordinary benefits if we expand such a credit on a national basis, as I propose in the ``New Urban Agenda Act of 1999.'' 
   I believe that the revitalization of cities will require social and economic facets, but it is also imperative that our cities are safe and clean. This last component of my bill helps urban areas to address their unique environmental challenges and reforms Superfund law. First, the legislation authorizes a federal brownfields program to help clean up idle or underused industrial and commercial facilities and waives federal liability for persons who fully comply with a state cleanup plan to clean sites in urban areas pursuant to state law, provided that the site is not listed or proposed to be listed on the National Priorities List. The Environmental Protection Agency currently operates this pilot program under general authority provided by the Superfund law. 
   My legislation would make this a permanent program and substantially increase the funding levels to a $50 million authorized level for Fiscal Year 2000. The EPA could expend funds to identify and examine potential idle or underused Brownfield sites and to provide grants to States and local governments of up to $200,000 per site to put them back to productive use. One such grant has been used to great success by Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, and I hope this provision will generate additional success stories of redeveloping urban brownfields. 
   The Brownfields Program allows sites with minor levels of toxic waste to be cleaned up by State and local governments with federal and other funding sources. Companies and individuals who are interested in developing land into industrial, commercial, recreational, or residential use are often reluctant to purchase property with any level of toxic waste because of a fear of being saddled with cleanup liability under the Superfund law. Through expanded Brownfields grants, cleanup at such sites will be expedited and will encourage redevelopment of otherwise unusable urban property. 
   My bill would also waive federal liability for persons who fully comply with a state cleanup plan to clean sites in urban areas pursuant to state law, providing that the site is not listed or proposed to be listed on the National Priorities List. Many states, including Pennsylvania, have developed their own toxic waste cleanup programs and have done good work to clean up many of these sites. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge has developed an extensive plan, where contaminated sites are made safe based on sound science by returning the site to productive use through the development of uniform cleanup standards, by creating a set of standardized review procedures, by releasing owners and developers from liability who fully comply with the state cleanup standards and procedures, and by providing financial assistance. However, the efforts of states like Pennsylvania are often stifled because the federal government has not been willing to work with the States to release owners and developers from liability, even when they fully comply with the state plans. 
   This section of my bill only applies to sites that are not on the National Priorities List. These are sites that the state has identified for which the state has created a comprehensive cleanup plan. If the federal government has concerns with the cleanup procedure or the safety of the site, then the government has full authority to place that site on the National Priority List. The plans, like that developed by Governor Ridge, deal with sites not controlled by the Superfund law. By not allowing the individual states to take the initiative to clean up these sites, and by not providing a waiver for federal liability to those who fully comply with the procedures and standards of the state cleanup, the federal government impedes the efforts of the states to work to clean up their own sites. This provision takes a significant step toward encouraging states to take the responsibility for their toxic waste sites and to encourage the effective cleanup of these sites in our nation's urban areas. 
   The final environmental provision calls for the reauthorization of an existing federal program, which has served cities across the nation very well, but has not been authorized since 1995 and has also been unable to meet the demand for an ``urban greening effort.'' The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides financial and technical assistance to urban areas to help establish and maintain community parkland and forests in our nation's 45,000 towns and cities. The number of requests for federal assistance and grants exceeds the capacity of the existing Urban and Community Forestry program by eight times. The number of communities assisted through the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program has grown from 7,548 in Fiscal Year 1992 to 11,675 in Fiscal Year 1997, a 56% increase in five years. An enhanced Urban and Community Forestry Program will enable cities to put vacant  areas and abandoned structures back into use. There are more than 15,000 vacant lots in Pennsylvania, which as we know, pose serious health and safety risks, detract commercial investments, reduce property values, and cost municipalities hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance and lost revenue. The Urban and Community Forestry Program has been very successful due to its flexible design and emphasis on local creativity. In fact, the program has allowed for benefits that go beyond revenue and other economic gains. Many of the formerly broken down concrete lots are now green and welcoming to the community have provided children and their parents with a safe haven for recreation outside the home. Some city public schools have even begun to use these areas as their ``science parks'' for after-school and weekend educational activities. 
   Mr. President, I realize that this is an initial step to reinvesting in our cities. Nevertheless, it is time to take a comprehensive approach to reversing urban decay, which is what I believe my bill can accomplish. It may well be that America has given up on its cities. That is a stark statement, but it is one which I believe may be true--that America has given up on its cities. But this Senator has not done so. And I believe there are others in this body on both sides of the aisle who have not done so and I invite the input and assistance of my colleagues in order to fashion a strong plan of action to help cities to face their pressing problems. 
   As one of a handful of United States Senators who lives in a big city, I understand both the problems and the promise of urban America. This legislation for our cities is good public policy. The plight of our cities must be of extreme concern to America. We can ill-afford for them to wither and die. I am committed to a new urban agenda that relies on market forces, and not a welfare state, for urban revitalization.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress commences, those of us in the Senate and the House have a new opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of the American people. It is a chance for us to learn from the past, determine how best to respond to the challenges that are before us, and forge important alliances which will enable us to pass legislation that is important to this nation. I believe it is clear that one of our first priorities must be additional incremental reforms of our health care system. 
   Mr. President, there is no time to waste. Many of our nation's health care problems are getting worse, not better. In its December 1998 report, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) analyzed the March 1998 Current Population Survey, a document generated yearly by the U.S. Census Bureau. EBRI's analysis tells us that in 1997, about 193 million working-age Americans derived their health insurance coverage as follows: approximately 64.2 percent from employer plans; 13.0 percent from Medicare and Medicaid within a total of 14.8 percent from public sources of coverage; and 6.7 percent from other private insurance. This survey also details another troubling statistic: 43.1 million Americans, or 18.3 percent of Americans aged 18-64, were uninsured. This reflects an increase of 7 percent, or 2.8 million uninsured working-age people, since 1995. Among the elderly, the outlook is a bit brighter, with only 1 percent uninsured, and 96.4 percent deriving coverage from public sources. 
   As I have said many times, we can fix the problems felt by this growing number of uninsured Americans without resorting to big government and without completely overhauling our current system, one that works well for most Americans--serving 81.7 percent of our non-elderly citizens. We must enact reforms that improve upon our current market-based health care system, as it is clearly the best health care system in the world. 
   Accordingly, today I am introducing the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999, which, if enacted, will take us further down the path of the incremental reforms started by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Kassebaum-Kennedy) and various health care provisions enacted during the 105th Congress. I would note that the final version of Kassebaum-Kennedy contained many elements which were in S. 18, the incremental health care reform bill I introduced when the 104th Congress began on January 4, 1995. 
   I would note that the bill I am introducing today is distinct from my recent efforts regarding managed care reform. During the 105th Congress, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998, a balanced proposal which would ensure that patients receive the benefits and services to which they are entitled, without compromising the savings and coordination of care that can be achieved through managed care. I look forward to working again with my colleagues to enact responsible managed care legislation. 
   The Health Care Assurance Act of 1999 is intended to initiate and stimulate new discussion, so we may move the health care reform debate forward. I welcome any suggestions my colleagues may have concerning how this bill can be improved, as long as such suggestions are consistent with the incremental approach to reform that has proven to be the only way to achieve successful health care reform. 
   Given the importance of enacting this type of legislation, it is worth reviewing recent history which has taught us that bipartisanship is crucial in accomplishing these goals for the American people. In particular, the debate over President Clinton's Health Security Act during the 103rd Congress  is replete with lessons concerning the pitfalls and obstacles that inevitably lead to legislative failure. Several times during the 103rd Congress, I spoke on the Senate floor to address what seemed to be the wisest course--to pass incremental health care reforms with which we could all agree. Unfortunately, what seemed obvious to me, based on comments and suggestions by a majority of Senators who favored a moderate approach, was not obvious at the time to the Senate's Democratic leadership. 
   This failure to understand the merits of an incremental approach was demonstrated during April 1993 during my attempts to offer a health care reform amendment based on the text of S. 631, an incremental reform bill I had introduced earlier in the session. This bill incorporated moderate, consensus principles in a reasonable reform package. First, I attempted to offer the bill as an amendment to legislation dealing with debt ceilings. Subsequently, I was informed that the consideration of this bill would be structured in a way that precluded my offering an amendment. Therefore, I prepared to offer my health care bill as an amendment to the fiscal year 1993 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. To my dismay, Senator Mitchell, then Majority Leader, and Senator BYRD, then Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, worked together to ensure that I could not offer my amendment by keeping the Senate in a quorum call, a parliamentary tactic used to delay and obstruct. I was unable to obtain unanimous consent to end the quorum call, and thus could not proceed with my amendment. 
   Three years later, well after the behemoth Clinton health care reform bill was derailed, the Senate once again endured a lengthy political battle concerning the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which I was pleased to cosponsor. We achieved a breakthrough in August 1996, when enough Senators sensed the growing frustration of the American people to finally pass Kassebaum-Kennedy and its vital health insurance market reforms, such as increased portability of health insurance coverage. There is no question that Kassebaum-Kennedy made significant steps forward in addressing troubling issues in health care, although I recognize that there is much more to be done. The bill's incremental approach to health care reform is what allowed it to generate bipartisan, consensus support in the Senate. We knew that it did not address every single problem in the health care delivery system, but it would make life better for millions of American men, women, and children. 
   In retrospect, I urge my colleagues to note a most important fact--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was enacted only after Democrats abandoned their hopes for passing a nationalized, big government health care scheme, and Republicans abandoned their position that access to health care is not really a major problem in the United States which demands Federal action. 
   Perhaps the greatest recent example of the power of bipartisanship took place during the 105th Congress, with the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This historic bipartisan agreement between Congress and the White House to balance the budget by 2002 extended the life of the vital Medicare hospital trust fund by ten years, while expanding needed benefits for seniors. The new law created a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to address the implications of the retirement of the Baby Boom generation, and marked the first balanced Federal budget in thirty years. This landmark accomplishment clearly would not have occurred without all members of Congress and the Administration crossing party lines, compromising, and doing what was right for the American people regardless of political affiliations. 
   We must realize that if we are to continue to be successful in meeting the nation's health care needs, the solutions to the system's problems must come from the political center, not from the extremes. 
   I have advocated health care reform in one form or another throughout my 18 years in the Senate. My strong interest in health care dates back to my first term, when I sponsored S. 811, the Health Care for Displaced Workers Act of 1983, and S. 2051, the 
   Health Care Cost Containment Act of 1983, which would have granted a limited antitrust exemption to health insurers, permitting them to engage in certain joint activities such as acquiring or processing information, and collecting and distributing insurance claims for health care services aimed at curtailing then escalating health care costs. In 1985, I introduced the Community Based Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Projects Act of 1985, S. 1873, directed at reducing the human tragedy of low birth weight babies and infant mortality. Since 1983, I have introduced and cosponsored numerous other bills concerning health care in our country. A complete list of the 26 health care bills that I have sponsored since 1983 is included for the RECORD. 
   During the 102nd Congress, I pressed the Senate to take action on this issue. On July 29, 1992, I offered a health care amendment to legislation then pending on the Senate floor. This amendment included provisions from legislation introduced by Senator CHAFEE, which I cosponsored and which was previously proposed by Senators Bentsen and Durenberger. The amendment included a change from 25 percent to 100 percent deductibility for health insurance purchased by self-employed persons, and small business insurance market reforms to make health coverage more affordable for small businesses. When then-Majority Leader George Mitchell argued that the health care amendment I was proposing did not belong on that bill, I offered to withdraw the amendment if he would set a date certain to take up health care, just as product liability legislation had been placed on the calendar for September 8, 1992. The Majority Leader rejected that suggestion and the Senate did not consider comprehensive health care legislation during the balance of the 102nd Congress. My July 29, 1992 amendment was defeated on a procedural motion by a vote of 35 to 60, along party lines. 
   The substance of that amendment, however, was adopted later by the Senate on September 23, 1992 when it was included in an amendment to broader tax legislation (H.R. 11), offered by Senators Bentsen and Durenberger and which I cosponsored. This amendment, which included essentially the same self-employed tax deductibility and small group reforms that I had proposed on July 29th of that year, passed the Senate by voice vote. Unfortunately, these provisions were later dropped from H.R. 11 in the House-Senate conference. 
   On August 12, 1992, I introduced legislation entitled the Health Care Affordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992, S. 3176, that would have enhanced informed individual choice regarding health care services by providing certain information to health care recipients, would have lowered the cost of health care through use of the most appropriate provider, and would have improved the quality of health care. 
   On January 21, 1993, the first day of the 103rd Congress, I introduced the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993, S. 18. This legislation was comprised of reforms that our health care system could have adopted immediately. These initiatives would have both improved access and affordability of insurance coverage and would have implemented systemic changes to lower the escalating cost of care in this country. S. 18 is the principal basis of the legislation I introduced in the 104th (S. 18) and 105th Congresses (S. 24), and the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999, which I am introducing today. 
   On March 23, 1993, I introduced the Comprehensive Access and Affordability Health Care Act of 1993, S. 631, which was a composite of health care legislation introduced by Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, BOND, and MCCAIN, and included pieces of my bill, S. 18. I introduced this legislation in an attempt to move ahead on the consideration of health care legislation and provide a starting point for debate. As I noted earlier, I was precluded by Majority Leader Mitchell from obtaining Senate consideration of my legislation as a floor amendment on several occasions. Finally, on April 28, 1993, I offered the text of S. 631 as an amendment to the pending Department of Environment Act (S. 171) in an attempt to urge the Senate to act on health care reform. My amendment was defeated 65 to 33 on a procedural motion, but the Senate had finally been forced to contemplate action on health care reform. 
   On the first day of the 104th Congress, January 4, 1995, I introduced a  slightly modified version of S. 18, the Health Care Assurance Act of 1995 (also S. 18), which contained provisions similar to those ultimately enacted in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, including insurance market reforms, an extension of the tax deductibility of health insurance for the self employed, and deductibility of long term care insurance for employers. 
   I continued these efforts in the 105th Congress, with the introduction of Health Care Assurance Act of 1997 (S. 24), which included market reforms similar to my previous proposals with the addition of a new Title I, an innovative program to provide vouchers to States to cover children who lack health insurance coverage. I also introduced Title I of this legislation as a stand-alone bill, the Healthy Children's Pilot Program of 1997 (S. 435) on March 13, 1997. This proposal targeted the approximately 4.2 million children of the working poor who lacked health insurance. These are children whose parents earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but do not earn enough to afford private health care coverage for their families. This legislation would have established a $10 billion/5 year discretionary pilot program to cover these uninsured children by providing grants to States. Modeled after Pennsylvania's extraordinarily successful Caring and BlueCHIP programs, this legislation was the first Republican-sponsored child health insurance bill during the 105th Congress. 
   I was encouraged that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed into law on August 5, 1997, included a combination of the best provisions from many of child health insurance proposals throughout this Congress. The new legislation allocated $24 billion for the next five years to establish State Child Health Insurance Programs, funded in part by a slight increase in the cigarette tax. The bill I am introducing today, the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999, would further augment this new State Child Health Insurance Program and would enable States to cover even more children, and includes new provisions to assist individuals with disabilities to maintain quality health care coverage. 
   My commitment to the issue of health care reform across all populations has been consistently evident during my tenure in the Senate, as I have taken to this floor and offered health care reform bills and amendments on countless occasions. I will continue to urge the Senate to address this vital issue and to stress the importance of the Federal government's investment in and attention to the system's future. 
   As my colleagues are aware, I can personally report on the miracles of modern medicine. Five years ago, an MRI detected a benign tumor (meningioma) at the outer edge of my brain. It was removed by conventional surgery, with five days of hospitalization and five more weeks of recuperation. 
   When a small regrowth was detected by a follow-up MRI in June 1996, it was treated with high powered radiation from the ``Gamma Knife.'' I entered the hospital in the morning of October 11, 1996, and left the same afternoon, ready to resume my regular schedule. Like the MRI, the Gamma Knife is a recent invention, coming into widespread use in the past decade. 
   In July 1998, I was pleased to return to the Senate after a relatively brief period of convalescence following heart bypass surgery. This experience again led me to marvel at our health care system and made me more determined than ever to support Federal funding for biomedical research and to support legislation which will incrementally make health care available to all Americans. 
   My concern about health care has long pre-dated my own personal benefits from the MRI and other diagnostic and curative procedures. As I have previously discussed, my concern about health care began many years ago and been intensified by my service on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
   Services, and Education, which I now have the honor to chair. 
   My own experience as a patient has given me deeper insights into the American health care system beyond my perspective from the U.S. Senate. I have learned: (1) our health care system, the best in the world, is worth every cent we pay for it; (2) patients sometimes have to press their own cases beyond the doctors' standard advice; (3) greater flexibility must be provided on testing and treatment; (4) our system has the resources to treat the 43.1 million Americans currently uninsured, but we must find the way to pay for it; and (5) all Americans deserve the access to health care from which I and others with coverage have benefitted. 
   I have long been convinced that our Federal budget of $1,700,000,000,000, could provide sufficient funding for America's needs if we establish our real priorities. The real question has been whether we have enough doctors, hospitals, medical personnel, etc. to take care of Americans in need of medical attention. I am convinced that we do. The part which has yet to be accomplished is to work out the financing for the delivery of such health care. As specified in the legislation which I have introduced, I am convinced that sufficient savings are possible within the current system to provide health care for all Americans within the current expenditures. 
   I share the American people's frustration with government and their desire to have their problems addressed. Over the past six years, I believe we have learned a great deal about our health care system and what the American people are willing to accept from the Federal government. The message we heard loudest was that Americans did not want a massive overhaul of the health care system. Instead, our constituents want Congress to proceed more slowly and to target what isn't working in the health care system while leaving in place what is working. 
   As I have said both publicly and privately, I am willing to cooperate with the Administration in solving the health care problems facing our country. However, in the past I have found many important areas where I differed with President Clinton's approach to solutions and I did so because I believed that the proposals would have been deleterious to my fellow Pennsylvanians, to the American people, and to our health care system. Most important, I did not support creating a large new government bureaucracy because I believe that savings should go to health care services and not bureaucracies. 
   On this latter issue, I first became concerned about the potential growth in bureaucracy in September 1993 after reading the President's 239-page preliminary health care reform proposal. I was surprised by the number of new boards, agencies, and commissions, so I asked my legislative assistant, Sharon Helfant, to make me a list of all of them. Instead, she decided to make a chart. The initial chart depicted 77 new entities and 54 existing entities with new or additional responsibilities. 
   When the President's 1,342-page Health Security Act was transmitted to Congress on October 27, 1993, my staff reviewed it and found an increase to 105 new agencies, boards, and commissions and 47 existing departments, programs and agencies with new or expanded jobs. This chart received national attention after being used by Senator Bob Dole in his response to the President's State of the Union address on January 24, 1994. 
   The response to the chart was tremendous, with more than 12,000 people from across the country contacting my office for a copy; I still receive requests for the chart. Groups and associations, such as United We Stand America, the American Small Business Association, the National Federation of Republican Women, and the Christian Coalition, reprinted the chart in their publications--amounting to hundreds of thousands more in distribution. Bob Woodward of the Washington Post later stated that he thought the chart was the single biggest factor contributing to the demise of the Clinton health care plan. And, as recently as the November 1996 election, my chart was used by Senator Dole in his presidential campaign to illustrate the need for incremental health care reform as opposed to a big government solution. 
   With the history of the health care reform debate in mind, I have drafted an incremental bill which would provide quality health care without adversely affecting the many positive aspects of our health care system, which works for 81.7 percent of working-age Americans. It is more prudent to implement targeted reforms and then act later to improve upon what we have  done. I call this trial and modification. We must be careful not to damage the positive aspects of our health care system upon which more than 193 million Americans justifiably rely. 
   The legislation I am introducing today has three objectives: (1) to provide affordable health insurance for the 43.1 million working-age Americans now not covered; (2) to reduce health care costs for all Americans; and (3) to improve coverage for underinsured individuals, families, and children. This legislation is comprised of initiatives that our health care system can readily adopt in order to meet these objectives, and it does not create an enormous new bureaucracy to meet them. 
   This bill includes provisions to encourage the formation of small group purchasing arrangements, to expand access to health insurance for children, to improve health coverage for individuals with disabilities, to strengthen preventive health benefits under the Medicare program, to increase access to prenatal care and outreach for the prevention of low birth weight babies, to facilitate the implementation of patients' rights regarding medical care at the end of life, to improve health education, to place greater emphasis on and to expand access to primary and preventive health services, to utilize non-physician providers, to reform the COBRA law to extend the time period for employees who leave their jobs to maintain their health benefits until alternative coverage becomes available, to increase the availability and use of consumer information and outcomes research, and to establish a national fund for health research within the Department of Treasury. 
   Taken together, I believe the reforms proposed in the Health Care Assurance Act of 1999 will both improve the quality of health care delivery and will bring down the escalating costs of health care in this country. These initiatives represent a blueprint which can be modified, improved and expanded. In total, I believe this bill can significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, improve the affordability of care, ensure the portability and security of coverage between jobs, and yield cost savings of billions of dollars to the Federal Government, which can be used to cover the remaining uninsured and underinsured Americans.

   Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today for the purpose of submitting a resolution calling for the Budget Committee to add $2 billion in the health account for the National Institutes of Health in fiscal year 2000. I am convinced that National Institutes of Health are the crown jewel of the Federal Government and they have made tremendous progress in conducting research into the causes and cures for disease. My vision for America in the 21st Century is to find the cure for cancer, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for the severe mental illnesses, for diabetes, for osteoporosis, and for heart cardiovascular disease. All of this is within our reach if we make the proper allocation of our resources. 
   As Chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, I am firmly committed to prioritizing our resources in order to provide maximum funding for biomedical research. Funding for the National Institutes of Health has been increased steadily during my tenure in  the Senate, regardless of who was chairing the subcommittee. Although the budgets were always tight and frequently had cuts called for by the administration, when the chairman was Senator Weicker, when the chairman was Lawton Chiles, when the chairman was TOM HARKIN, or more recently under my chairmanship, we have increased the funding tremendously. And the National Institutes of Health has responded with extraordinary advances in research. Now the work has to be pushed forward to see exactly what can be accomplished in the next century. 
   On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate resolution submitted by our distinguished colleague, Senator MACK, which stated that funding for the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over five years. Regrettably, even though that resolution was passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, when the budget resolution was returned, the appropriate health account had a reduction of $100 million. That led to the introduction of an amendment to the budget resolution by Senator HARKIN and myself, Senator HARKIN being my distinguished colleague and ranking member of the subcommittee which I chair. We sought to add in $1.1 billion to carry out the expressed sense of the Senate. Our amendment, however, was defeated 63-37. While the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, when it came to the dollars they simply were not there. 
   During debate on the fiscal year 1999 Budget Resolution, Senator HARKIN and I again introduced an amendment which called for a funding increase for the National Institutes of Health of $2 billion and provided sufficient resources in the budget to accomplish this. While we gained more support on this vote than in the previous year, unfortunately our amendment was again defeated, this time by a vote of 57-41. 
   In order to provide the necessary resources for biomedical research, Senator HARKIN have worked closely together to find these vital funds. In the past few years, Senator HARKIN and I have consolidated and eliminated 135 programs to enable us to save $1.5 billion. It's pretty hard to eliminate a program in Washington, DC but we have been able to do that. We used the $1.5 billion to provide to the National Institutes of Health, guaranteed student loans, and many other important programs. Last year, Senator HARKIN and I again went to work with our subcommittee and we were able, by making economies and establishing priorities, to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account, the largest increase in history. We, however, still have a long way to go if we are to meet our goal of doubling the funding over five years. 
   Our investment has resulted in tremendous advances in medical research. A new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in HIV affected persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. Human genome research has yielded dramatic developments in uncovering genes associated with a host of diseases, such as breast and prostate cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, and schizophrenia. 
   I personally have been the beneficiary of the tremendous advances of the National Institutes of Health. Two decades ago, there was no such thing as an MRI. That device detected a problem for me. And other advances led to good results for me. I know millions of people have benefited from the research and the investment which we have made in the National Institutes of Health. But that takes money, and that is why this resolution is being offered--to call upon the Budget Committee to add in $2 billion so we can carry forward the important work of the National Institutes of Health.
