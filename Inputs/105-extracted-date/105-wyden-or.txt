 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Congress passed a version of the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act, a bipartisan bill which I cosponsored along with Senators Murray, Gorton, and Smith. I would like to particularly commend Senator Murray for her strong leadership on this issue. She introduced the bill earlier this year and worked hard to secure its passage in this Congress. 
Dungeness crab is integral to the economies of Oregon's coastal communities. The fishery is successfully managed, from both an environmental and an economic standpoint, by the States of Oregon, Washington, and California. Under existing law, the Federal government would have taken control of the management of Dungeness crab next year, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our legislation prevents this from happening. This is a common sense approach: it extends the existing authority for the States to manage Dungeness crab in Federal waters and eliminates the need to develop a costly Federal fishery managment plan. 
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, enacted in 1976, established regional Fishery Management Councils to develop Federal management plans for fisheries in need of conservation and management in Federal waters. However, in order to meet regional needs, the interpretation of this provision has traditionally been flexible, allowing states to manage some fisheries in Federal waters. An example of this flexibility is state management of the West Coast Dungeness crab fishery. 
Since the 1960's, the States of Oregon, Washington and California have managed the Dungeness crab fishery in Federal waters. The three states and the concerned Indian tribes have worked together to make sure fishermen from each state are treated fairly and the fishery remains biologically sound. West Coast fishermen, scientists, fishery managers, and conservation groups all agree that state management has been a success story. 
From a conservation standpoint, state management of Dungeness crab is effective. The crabs are harvested in a way that ensures healthy populations for the future. In addition, the problem of bycatch, or incidental catch of other fish species, is almost non-existent in the crab fishery. 
Under the Magnuson Act, the authority for state management of Dungeness crab expires next year. The expiration of state authority would have required the Pacific Fishery Management Council to develop a Federal fishery management plan in 1999. Developing this plan would have consumed scant Council resources and staff time. 
As many folks in Oregon know, management of West Coast groundfish and salmon species presents huge challenges to fishery managers. The Council shouldn't be forced to divert critical resources from groundfish and salmon in order to manage a species like crab, which is doing fine under the existing states' plan. With the passage of this legislation today, the Council can continue to focus its resources on the fisheries that need special attention. 
This bill makes common sense by taking advantage of the unique situation presented by the Dungeness crab fishery. Essentially, Congress is agreeing with what many folks have said of this fishery: `if it's not broken, don't fix it.' I am glad Congress could work together in a bipartisan fashion to pass this common-sense legislation.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I would, at the appropriate time, ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes. I certainly understand there were Senators here before me, and I am happy to wait until after the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Delaware are finished.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the unanimous consent request that he made that ensured I would have the opportunity to speak now and also to thank him for all that I have learned from him during my first years in the Senate. 
It is one thing to take out a book that describes some of the procedures and the rules of the Senate, but it seems to me that there is no better way to learn about the Senate and the very high standards that are so important here than to simply watch the Senator from West Virginia for a few hours on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I take the floor this afternoon because it is my understanding that democracy in Oregon has won at least a temporary victory. I have been informed that there will be nothing attached to the comprehensive spending bill that would override Oregon's assisted suicide law. 
While I intend to be very vigilant to monitor any further discussions that take place on this matter, I come today to talk about why this issue is so important not just to my constituents but to all Americans. And I also thank the participants in the budget negotiations for their willingness to leave out this matter that is so complicated and controversial. 
I had informed the leadership of both political parties that I was prepared to speak at considerable length if there had been an effort as part of the final budget bill to toss Oregon's ballot measure on assisted suicide into the trash can. I was prepared to do this in spite of the fact that I have personal reservations about assisted suicide. I was prepared to do this because I believe that nothing is more important than the people's right to govern themselves. 
When the people of our States have made difficult decisions, difficult moral decisions about matters that have historically been within the purview of the State governments, it is out and out wrong for the Congress to butt in and override those decisions of voters in the States. 
The voters of my State have spoken clearly. In two separate referendums, the verdict was clear: Physician-assisted suicide should, under limited circumstances, be legal in the State of Oregon. If the Congress of the United States, meeting 3,000 miles away, had tossed those decisions aside, in a last-minute backroom deal, it would have been a great insult to the people of Oregon and in my view would have contributed mightily to skepticism and cynicism about Government. 
It would have been a mistake because there were many questions raised about the measure drafted by the Senator from Oklahoma who, it seems to me, is very sincere about his interest in this subject. In addition to overriding the popular will of the people of my State, his measure would have also set back considerably the cause of better pain management for patients in end-of-life care. 
That would have had serious consequences for the treatment of patients in severe pain across this country. His measure would have great implications not just for the people of Oregon, but for the people of all our States. More than 55 groups representing the medical community, many of whom oppose physician-assisted suicide, joined together in an unprecedented coalition to oppose the legislation of the Senator from Oklahoma because of their fear that doctors and other medical providers would be hampered. They feared that the cause of providing pain care to their patients would be set back by the way the legislation by the Senator from Oklahoma was written. I thank all of these groups for their commitment to humane care and for their hard work on this issue. 
The key groups that led the coalition were: The Americans for Better Care of the Dying, the American Geriatrics Society, the American Pharmaceutical Association, the National Hospice Organization, the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, and the American Medical Association. 
One of the reasons that so many of these groups worked so hard with respect to keeping out of the spending bill legislation that would overturn Oregon's law was their sincere belief that the legislation by Senator Nickles would have harmed the effort to promote good pain management. 
The Nickles legislation would have given the Drug Enforcement Administration new authority to look at every prescription of a controlled substance to determine for what it was intended. In addition, doctors and pharmacists under this legislation have had to be mind readers about what their patients were going to do with one of the drugs that was used under the Controlled Substances Act. Was the patient going to take a medication as prescribed for pain management, or would they have sought to use it to kill themselves? 
There is ample scientific evidence that pain management is not performed as well as it might be at this time. And to add further complexities and a broader role for an agency like the Drug Enforcement Administration to step into an area where it has never been before would have, in my view, added additional barriers and complexities to the effort to promote hospice care, palliative care, comfort care, and advance the science of pain management. 
Recently, the findings of a study in Oregon done in 1997 were published that show that families reported relatively constant levels of moderate to severe pain during their loved one's final week of life. During the final months in 1997, families reported higher rates of moderate to severe pain for those dying in acute care hospitals. There was one exception, which was when a loved one died in an acute care hospital in late 1997. An important study showed a statewide trend indicating that there were in so many cases moderate to severe pain for these individuals in the last week of life who would have required a physician and others to step in and advocate for those patients. 
I have received many letters and a great deal of e-mail from chronic pain patients. These stories are heartbreaking. They point out that it could be any one of us or any one of our loved ones or constituents who finds themselves in chronic, excruciating pain as a result of an accident or through the development of some painful, chronic disease. 
Unfortunately, pain patients in the current regulatory environment feel in many instances--and they have told me--as if they are treated like junkies, and that their providers are extremely nervous about how to use pain management in a climate where, had the Nickles legislation been adopted, certainly you would have had the Federal Government looking over the shoulders of doctors and pharmacists with respect to their motivation in prescribing drugs for those who are suffering these acute health and chronic ailments. 
We need to do a great deal more. We can do it on a bipartisan basis to advance the cause of pain management. I have had a number of discussions on this matter with Senator Mack, who has done, in my view, excellent work on a number of health issues. Senator Smith of my State is greatly interested in these matters. I believe we ought to work together so that early next year we can bring before the health committees--and I see our friend from the State of Texas, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health Care, is here; he has a great interest in these issues --a bipartisan package to promote good pain management before the Senate next year. We do need to do more to help the dying and those who suffer from chronic pain. 
I believe that the mere threat of legislation would put the Drug Enforcement Administration into such an intrusive role that physicians, pharmacists, and other health providers would be reluctant to use these medications and future medications that promote pain management, comfort care, and hospice care. The mere threat of this legislation would be a real setback to the kind of health care services that the vast majority of Americans want to see expanded. 
Certainly Americans can have differences of opinion on the issue of assisted suicide. I voted against our ballot measure once. I voted for the repeal of it the second time. I voted against Federal funding of assisted suicide. My reservations with respect to this topic are clear. But I think it is wrong for the Federal Government to butt in and override the voters of my State, on a matter that has historically been left to the States. It is especially wrong to do it in a way that is going to allow the Federal Government, particularly through the Drug Enforcement Administration, to play such an intrusive role that doctors, pharmacists, and other health providers will feel uncomfortable and reluctant to assist their patients who are suffering chronic and extraordinary pain. 
We have heard reports in Oregon from hospices where doctors have been reluctant to prescribe needed amounts of pain medication because they were frightened about the implications of being visited by a Government agency that would second-guess them. 
I am very pleased that the Nickles legislation will not be included in the comprehensive spending bill. I intend to remain vigilant throughout the remaining hours of the negotiations. I wanted to come to the floor this afternoon to talk about why this issue is so important not to just the people of my State, but to the people of this country. 
Finally, I am under no illusion that there will not be further discussions on the floor of the U.S. Senate about this topic. I know that the Senator from Oklahoma feels very strongly and sincerely about this issue. I know that there will be an effort to bring forward that proposal, and others like it, next year. I am aware that there are a number of Members of the U.S. Senate who would be willing to see Oregon's law set aside. 
I ask all of my colleagues to think just for a few moments over the next few months about their reaction if their State passed a law on a matter that the States have historically led on, and then a Member of the U.S. Senate sought to step in and lay that aside. That is, in effect, what some in the U.S. Senate are trying to tell the people of Oregon. I think that is a mistake. I think that Senators who would be willing to toss aside a vote of the people of Oregon ought to think about the implications of the precedent they will be setting that will have their voters and the popular will of their States set aside if this Senate, in the future, tosses aside the Oregon law. 
There is a better way. The better way is the approach that Senator Mack, Senator Smith and Members of the House, such as Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, and I are talking about. The better way is to say that there will be differences of opinion in our country about assisted suicide, but let us come together on that broad swath of policy that we all can agree on--which is to promote better hospice care, pain management, and comfort care in the use of advanced directives. 
Many of these services in many of our communities are utilized very rarely. So there is much we can do that will bring our citizens together, that will help us improve the conditions of our patients, reduce their suffering, without setting a dangerous precedent of overriding a law passed by the voters of my State that could redound to the detriment of other States and our citizens. 
Mr. President, I thank the negotiators who are dealing with the omnibus appropriations bill. I am pleased that it was not necessary for me to speak at length on the omnibus appropriations bill. Our voice will be heard when we are challenged in Oregon. We will be heard each time our rights are challenged. 
I will conclude my remarks. I see the Senator from Oklahoma here. He has been very gracious to this Senator in terms of discussing this matter and keeping me apprised of his intentions. We do have a difference of opinion on this issue and, at the same time, he has made it clear that he wants to work with this Senator, Senator Mack, and others, on a variety of issues that we can agree on relating to pain management. I know that we will be back on this Senate floor debating this topic in the future. But I want the Senator from Oklahoma to know that not only do I appreciate his courtesy in keeping me apprised of his intentions, but of my desire to work with him on a variety of issues relating to this topic where I think we can agree. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Linda Erwin of Portland, Oregon, for her career as both a gifted medical professional and as a tireless and dedicated educator. As one of the first healthcare professionals in the Pacific Northwest to recognize that gun violence is a public health issue, Dr. Erwin has just been awarded the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. She is one of only seven people throughout the Nation to receive this honor. 
Dr. Erwin is currently the Assistant Director of Trauma Services at Legacy Emanuel Hospital, and it was through her experiences as a trauma surgeon that she first became aware of the need for increased education about violence--especially gun violence. Dr. Erwin has taken advantage of her position, education, and talents to reach beyond the trauma room to educate young people throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
While working in England for two years, Dr. Erwin treated a total of two patients for gunshot wounds. Upon returning to Portland, she was struck by the high numbers of gunshot wound patients being treated each year at Emanuel Hospital. After speaking with victims and their families and friends, she realized that most young people did not recognize or understand the consequences of their risky behavior. Since then, Dr. Erwin has worked as a leading advocate for gun violence prevention, intervention and education. 
One of the keys to Dr. Erwin's success has been her ability to create partnerships. Many of the programs that she has initiated bring together and combine the efforts of the medical, legal, law enforcement, and education communities as well as non-profit organizations and committed volunteers. 
Dr. Erwin has successfully spread her message throughout the Portland community with such programs as `Save Our Youth,' `Safe Schools Safe Lives,' `Firearms as a Public Health Crisis' and `American Epidemic Programs.' She has also lectured throughout the Pacific Northwest, taking her educational presentations to peer and youth groups throughout the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. 
Dr. Linda Erwin is an outstanding example of a professional who has given her time, resources, and knowledge to the community for the betterment of all. For these reasons, Dr. Erwin has received Ameritech's Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. I would like to thank her on behalf of all those whose lives she lives she has touched.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am joined by my Oregon colleague, Senator Smith, in offering an amendment to S. 2513. My amendment will provide the critical final step to enable Deschutes County, Oregon, in the completion of more than three years of intense work that they have done to find an effective way to protect their groundwater and wetlands from inappropriate residential development. 
Deschutes County has completed several years collaborative work to resolve a number of extraordinarily difficult land use problems in that county. In particular, the County faces the prospect of development of more than 13,000 subdivided lots in the vicinity of the Deschutes River in the southern half of the county. More than half of these lots have not yet been developed, and the county now knows that if it does not prevent the further development of these lands, they are going to have major, intractable pollution of the groundwater and of the Deschutes River. 
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality tells us that at present rates of growth, this area faces serious ground water quality problems over the next decade. Further, these lands constitute the most important wildlife and wetlands habitat in the area. 
After several years of working with federal and state agencies and local citizens, under the authority of Oregon's Regional Problem Solving initiative, the County has come up with a plan to use incentives to shift development from these sensitive lands, over on to Bureau of Land Management lands that are not nearly so sensitive. Under this plan, the County will sell parcels of this land to prospective residential developers. However, before a developer may acquire a tract, the developer must have purchased `development rights' to lands in environmentally sensitive areas. Once these rights are acquired, the land will be rezoned so as to prevent any future development in the undesirable area. 
In fact, the BLM lands have already been logged. The BLM lands are easily served by a wastewater collection system and have other features that make the location far more appropriate for development. Local BLM officials have been deeply involved in this effort and tell us that if it fails, the damage to the natural environment of the area will be substantial, and far more expensive to deal with later. 
I particularly want to thank Senator Smith, Senator Bumpers, and Chairman Murkowski for working with me at this late date to work out this provision. I want to express my deep appreciation to Governor John Kitzhaber, whose Regional Problem Solving initiative paved the way for this effort. And finally, I want to thank the staff at the Bureau of Land Management here in Washington, in Portland, and at the Prineville District for approaching this matter from the distinct perspective of the greater benefit to the environment that this legislation will achieve. 
I also note the very active participation of Deschutes County Commissioner Linda Swearingen, Assistant County Attorney Bruce White, and Community Development Director George Read. They have provided critical help to get this measure approved, and certainly it is their vision for the future of Deschutes County that has gotten us where we are today. 
The amendment (No. 3802) was agreed to.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate suspend the rules and pass this important amendment. 
First, let's be clear what happens if this amendment is passed. The most important thing is that the grandfather on Internet tax provision that was so central to the States is preserved and preserved completely. 
Second, there is a separate section to ensure that all other existing taxes are preserved, and that there is another provision that would ensure that all ongoing liabilities--the matter the Senator from Florida says is important to the State of Connecticut--is also preserved. 
After we filed this amendment last night, we again reached out to all sides to try to address concerns. I have done this now for a year and a half. The original bill that came out of the Commerce Committee, by the time it came to the floor, had more than 30 major changes. In our efforts here now to be reasonable, we have made at least another 20 changes to try to accommodate the Senator from Florida and others. In fact, the definition of a discriminatory tax--which is what this is all about--is essentially that which was used in the House, and it was agreeable to the Governors and the States when it was debated there in the House. The reason that the Senator from Arizona and I have focused on this issue is that this definition of discrimination is essential to ensure technological neutrality. 
What this definition does is straightforward. It ensures that the new technology and the Internet is not discriminated against. It makes sure that a web site is treated like a catalog; catalogs aren't taxed. We don't want web sites to be singled out for selective and discriminatory treatment. The provision also makes sure that Internet service providers are, in effect, treated like the mail. The mail isn't taxed when a product is shipped to your home from a catalog merchant. Similarly, the Internet service provider should not be taxed merely for being the carriers or transmitters of information. In effect, Senator Coats recognized this in his amendment that was adopted yesterday. 
So what we have done is, yesterday, we have worked with the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Enzi, and others, to address this discriminatory tax question in a way that we thought would be agreeable to the States. Overnight, we tightened up the language to deal with the grandfathering question. The minority leader, Senator Daschle, made some important and, I thought, useful suggestions. We incorporated those this morning to make sure that when we talk about the grandfathering provision, as it relates to South Dakota and North Dakota, the grandfather provision would tightly protect those two States. We have done that. 
This Senator finds now that if we do not prevail on this point and the bill goes down, all of these efforts now for a year and a half are going to leave us in a situation where I think we will see, with respect to the Internet and the digital economy, the same problems develop that cropped up with respect to mail order and catalogs. We have had a number of people at the State and local level saying, you know, with respect to the mail-order and catalog issue, we wish we had done what you are bringing about with respect to the Internet. 
We know that we have to have sensible policies so we can protect some of the existing sources of revenue for the States. Some call it the `old economy'; I don't. I think they are extremely important to the States. We have to respect those, while at the same time writing the ground rules for the digital economy--the economy where the Internet is going to be the infrastructure and when every few months takes us to exciting new fields and increases dramatically in revenue. 
So I hope our colleagues will not cause all of the other important work that has been done here to go down. That is Senator Dodd's legislation and the important work done by Senator Bryan. There is a host of good measures that we agreed to accept as part of this legislation in an effort to be bipartisan and to accommodate our colleagues. 
But, once again, the goalposts are moving. The definition of discriminatory tax that came up in the House is essentially what we are using. The Governors and the States found that acceptable. And then, after taking that kind of approach, even last night, we moved again, at the request of colleagues--and we thought they were reasonable requests--to tighten up the grandfathering provision. Now is the time to make sure that we do not gut this bill, the definition of a moratorium, and particularly don't gut a concept that we think is acceptable to our colleagues, and that is the concept of technological neutrality. 
When you vote for the McCain-Wyden amendment to suspend the rules and pass this, you will be voting for a solid grandfather provision that ensures that all existing taxes are preserved. You will be voting to protect ongoing liabilities, which is what the Senator from Florida said he is concerned about, along with the Senator from Connecticut, and others. You will be voting to make sure, in a separate section, that all other existing taxes other than Internet taxes are preserved, and you will be voting for the principle of technological neutrality. 
I think it would be a great mistake to gut this legislation now after all this progress has been made. I represent a State with 100,000 small businesses. These businesses are a big part of the economic future that we all want for our constituents. They cannot afford a crazy quilt of taxes that would be applied by a good chunk of the Nation's 30,000 taxing jurisdictions, based on what we have seen during this debate. 
Let's do this job right. Let's do it in a thoughtful and uniform way. I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment Senator McCain and I have offered. I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I think this may well be a historic day. What the U.S. Senate is doing is beginning to write the ground rules for the digital economy. As we have seen just in the last hour again, it is going to be a tough job. 
We have had just in the last hour another set of questions that have come up with respect just to the terminology that is used in this new field. For example, some States call an Internet access tax a tax on on-line services. 
What we have done now as a result of the agreement among the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Florida and myself, is we have said that we are going to treat those terms the same way when, in fact, they have the same effect. I think that this exercise, while certainly laborious and difficult, is just an indication of the kind of challenges we have to overcome. 
I thank particularly the Senator from Florida. He feels very strongly about this issue and has made the case again and again to me that it is important to do this job right, and I share his view. I thank him for his courtesies. 
The Senator from North Dakota and I have been debating this legislation now for a year and a half, probably at a much higher decibel level than either of us would have liked. 
The chairman of the committee, Chairman McCain, and I have been friends for almost 20 years now. For this freshman Senator--not even a full freshman, an arrival in a special election--to have a chance to team up on this important piece of legislation is a great thrill. 
I thank him and his staff for all of their courtesies. 
Before I make any final comments, I want to thank Ms. Carole Grunberg of our office who again and again, when this legislation simply did not look like it could go forward, persisted. And she, along with Senator Dorgan's staff and Senator McCain's staff, has helped to get us to this exciting day. 
I am particularly pleased, Mr. President--I will wrap up with this--for the benefits that this legislation is going to have for people without a lot of political power in America. I think about the 100,000 home-based businesses I have in my State. I think about the disabled folks who are starting little businesses in their homes. For them, the Internet is the great equalizer. It allows people who think of themselves as the little guy to basically be able to compete in the global economy with the big guys. 
Unless we come up with some ways to make uniform some of these definitions and terms, which is what we have been trying to do in the last hour--and we have made some real headway and reached a success--those little guys are going to find it hard to compete. 
So I look forward to continuing the discussions with our colleagues as we look to other questions with respect to the Internet. This, it seems to me, is just the beginning of the discussion rather than the end. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues now to support this modified amendment, to support the bill, and I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, online consumer purchases are poised to explode to more than $300 billion early in the next Century. But the goldrush in cyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in cyberfraud. Congress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our current telemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net. 
In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone fraud each year, Congress earlier this summer passed the 1998 Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. The new law builds upon the four federal laws enacted since the early 1990s that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffens penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly, requires criminal forfeiture to ensure the booty of telemarketing crime is not used to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing fraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the masterminds behind the boiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero in on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly against suspected fraud. 
The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with today's digital economy. As more Americans go online, cyberscams are bound to proliferate. The Congressional crackdown on telemarketing fraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the Net unless the law gets there first. That is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today. 
The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act simply extends current law against telemarketing fraud to include the same crimes committed over the Internet. The approach expands the existing law applicable to mail, telephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over the Internet, and its enforcement would follow the same division of labor there is today between the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties that Congress enacted earlier this year to cyberscams. The growth of Internet telephony makes it more attractive for cyberscammers to set up shop offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this problem by allowing law enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry to the United States of those convicted of cyberfraud. 
The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of our most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target for more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers convicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in jail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better educate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law enforcement in catching the perpetrators. 
The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, through its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach program to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be advised against providing their credit card number, bank account or other personal information unless they had initiated the call unsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection rights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report suspected illegal telemarketing. 
Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start against cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are not companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers everything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad credit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into sending important personal financial information and hundreds of dollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure consumers with the promise of help them cash in on the Internet explosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-mailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort to target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when such fraud is aimed at seniors.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, let me say that I strongly support the Gregg amendment. Let me say to the Senator from Arkansas, I think his amendment is in the wrong place. I think it is supposed to go at page 25. But if we could work with him, we want to make sure that there is fair consideration of his amendment. 
Mr. President, let me also say that the whole point of the Internet Tax Freedom Act is to focus on electronic commerce. We have had, since the beginning of this discussion, efforts to bring into this debate a variety of other kinds of subjects, but it seems to me at a time when we have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions, many of which have varied and sundry ideas with respect to electronic commerce and the Internet, what we ought to do is stick to the subject at hand, and that is calling a brief time-out to look at these issues, a time-out in which the Internet would be treated like everything else, by the way. 
At various points in this debate we have heard about how we are establishing a tax haven for the Internet. That is simply wrong. During the moratorium, sales on the Internet would get treated just like other sales. It is very important now, with the extraordinary growth of the Internet, as our colleagues have noted, that we do this job right, which requires that we go forward with language such as that offered by the Senator from New Hampshire to ensure that we focus on electronic commerce. 
By doing that, we also increase the prospects for making sure that at the end of our work we have a policy that guarantees technological neutrality. We don't have that today in America. We have parts of the country, for example, where you get the newspaper through traditional mail, and you pay no tax on it. But if you read that very same newspaper on line, you pay a tax. That is not technologically neutral. That is what our legislation is all about. The Internet should not get a preference, nor should the Internet be discriminated against. It seems to me that by adopting the Gregg amendment we will ensure that the focus is on electronic commerce, No. 1; No. 2, we will have a chance to look at the very complicated and technical questions dealing with what is close to 30,000 taxing jurisdictions, and I urge my colleagues to support the original Gregg amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Gregg amendment and the rejection of the Hutchinson amendment. First, it is quite clear that this legislation is going to, in fact, study all of the questions related to the subject this bill deals with thoroughly. Let me just read into the Record exactly what it says with respect to what will be studied. It says: 
The Commission shall conduct a thorough study of Federal, State and local, and international taxation and tariff treatment of transactions using the Internet and Internet access and other comparable interstate or international sales activities. 
So it is right there at pages 21 and 22.

Mr. WYDEN. In just 1 minute I will be happy to yield. 
It is quite clear, at page 21 and page 22, that there will be `a thorough study' of the issues and that the commission will look at `comparable interstate or international sales activities.' 
The question, Mr. President, and colleagues, is whether or not we are going to focus on yesterday's concerns, which are the mail-order or catalog issues--and they are important ones--or are we going to look at trying to come up with some sensible policies with respect to tomorrow's issues which essentially involve the ground rules for the digital economy. 
Somehow, those that want to look at mail-order and catalog sales feel that they can resolve all of their concerns on this legislation. We feel otherwise. The reason that it is so important to have the Gregg language is that it does put the focus on electronic commerce. I and others believe that if we do look at electronic commerce, and look at it thoughtfully, that it may, in fact, come up with some answers to these other issues--mail-order and catalog questions, which are important--but if we change the focus of this bill, which is essentially what the Senator from Arkansas wants to do, I believe what is going to happen is, A, we will not get any sensible ground rules for electronic commerce, nor will we deal with the issues with respect to mail orders. 
The fact of the matter is that Main Street America overwhelmingly has endorsed this bill. We have entered into the Record the list of the groups that are for it. And the reason that Main Street has endorsed this legislation is that if you are a small business on a main street in rural Arkansas or rural Oregon, or any other part of the country that is essentially rural, right now you are having a lot of difficulty competing against the Wal-Marts and the economic giants in our country. 
The Internet is a great equalizer. By having a web page, by having the ability to do business on line, that Main Street business in rural Oregon or rural America, for the first time, has the ability, in an inexpensive way, to market and look at lucrative markets around the world. 
Picture, if we will, what will happen to a home-based business in Wyoming or Arkansas or Oregon if we do nothing. There are 100,000 of these home-based businesses in my State alone. They are the fastest growing part of our economy, and if we do not come up with some uniform tax treatment for these home-based businesses, what is going to happen is they will be subject to scores of different taxes all over America. 
How is a home-based business in the State of Oregon or the State of Arkansas going to go out and hire a battery of accountants and lawyers and experts to help them sort this out? They are not going to be able to do it. And that is why, when we had the hearings on this legislation in the Senate Commerce Committee, we heard from a small Tennessee business that tried to operate through this thicket of different kinds of State and local rules and ended up going out of business. 
These home-based businesses are simply not going to be able to hire the battery of experts and accountants and lawyers that some of those who have opposed this legislation are going to mandate on these small businesses. So I hope that we can stick to the issue in front of us. That would mean going forward with the Gregg amendment and rejecting the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. 
The Senator from Arkansas did ask me to yield, and I am happy to do so.

Mr. WYDEN. Reclaiming my time, as I said, the debate here is over, Do you want to focus on the subject of this bill, which is electronic commerce--that is what the legislation does; that is what the Gregg amendment seeks to do--or are we going to go back and study in this legislation essentially yesterday's economy? 
We believe that if you put the focus on electronic commerce--that is what the Gregg amendment does--we are going to be able to deal with the digital economic issues; and we may well, in fact, come up with some ideas and some innovative approaches that may well resolve the mail-order and catalog question as well. 
My concern, and the concern of the Senator from New Hampshire, is that essentially this is going to change the focus of this legislation to put it on the mail-order and catalog issues. There are Members of the U.S. Senate who feel that mail-order and catalog sales are insufficiently taxed. I am not one of them. I am one who believes that we all ought to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with tomorrow's set of economic concerns, which involves the digital economy. 
I tell the Senator from Arkansas that as the original sponsor of this legislation, I have made more than 30 separate changes to this legislation in an effort to accommodate what I think are valid concerns which come from States and municipalities and others who are advocating the viewpoint of the Senator from Arkansas. 
But what I am not willing to support is essentially changing the focus of this legislation. If we do that, I believe that the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State, and the hundreds of thousands across this country, are not going to see their concerns addressed; I think we will not be taking advantage of the opportunity to look at the Internet issues objectively, and we will lose that focus and take it off into another area which is, in my view, likely to not produce consensus with respect to the mail-order or catalog issue, nor make the progress we need to with respect to the Internet. 
Mr. President, I yield back the time.

Mr. WYDEN. I want to say that I think the Senator has made an especially effective approach and tell him that hardware account he gave is essentially what this legislation is all about. There has been discussion about who benefits here, huge corporations and the like. The people who benefit here are the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State, the hardware store that the Senator from Connecticut is talking about. 
The reason why that is the case is that the Internet is a great equalizer for those small businesses. The small businesses now that we are seeing in the State of the Senator from Connecticut and rural Oregon are having great difficulty today competing against the Wal-Marts of the world. They do not have huge advertising budgets like Wal-Mart. They don't have batteries of lawyers and accountants. These are small, entrepreneurial operations that now look at the Internet as a tool that can trampoline them into extraordinary economic opportunities they have never had. 
Without this legislation and the good work that has been done by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New Hampshire, if you are a small, home-based business in Oregon or Connecticut, you may well face a good chunk of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions in our country looking at your business as a cash cow. 
One of our colleagues said the threat here is the World Wide Web would become the `World Wide Wallet' if that kind of approach went forward. 
So what the Senator was talking about with respect to that hardware store account is why I introduced this legislation early in 1997. That is the very kind of operation that I think we ought to be looking to grow in the 21st century. 
I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I heard his account of the hardware store from the Cloakroom, and I think some have said--in fact, I heard it again today--that this was about Amazon.com or someone like that. Those people are not going to be in need of this kind of approach. This is going to benefit the small entrepreneurs, the home-based business, the kind of person the Senator from Connecticut is talking about. I thank him for yielding me this time.

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me try to describe briefly for the Senate where we are with respect to the important issue coming up now on the length of the moratorium. As Chairman McCain and my colleague, Senator Dorgan, noted, the two issues we have been trying to deal with, the question of grandfathering in existing States and localities and the length of the moratorium are linked, and we think we have a fair process in place now for resolving the two important issues. 
I would like to tell my colleagues why I think it is important that we go with the McCain amendment on the length of the moratorium. The legislation, when I introduced it in March of 1997, did not specify how long the moratorium should last. When we considered it in the Senate Commerce Committee, after a very lengthy debate and, in effect, taking a break for 5 or 6 months after the hearings were held to try to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle, the Senate Commerce Committee voted out legislation that set in place a 6-year moratorium. 
As Senators know, the Finance Committee then went forward with its legislation and imposed a 2-year moratorium. In a sense, this moratorium isn't even the most accurate way to describe it because even during this period Internet transactions were treated exactly like any other transaction. We have heard discussion of how, in some way, the legislation would create some sort of special tax haven for the Internet, and that is simply not the case. Internet transactions would be treated just like any other. 
The reason the McCain amendment with respect to the length of the moratorium is important is not just because it is a compromise--4 years--between the Commerce Committee bill and the Finance Committee bill, but I think it is going to take that long in order to deal with these issues in a thoughtful way. They are complicated questions. It is very clear that if, for example, someone orders fruit from Harry and David's in Medford, OR, uses America Online in Virginia to make the order, pays for it with a bank card in California, and ships it to a cousin in Boston, this transaction could affect scores and scores of local jurisdictions, as well as a number of States. So we do want sufficient time to sort out these issues. 
Under the amendment that will be first offered by Senator McCain and myself, there would be a two-step process. First, the commission studies the issues and makes its recommendations to the Congress. Second, the recommendation must be implemented. Our concern is that a number of State legislatures do not meet every year; mine is one. You are going to need the McCain-Wyden amendment with respect to the moratorium in order to make sure that you have sufficient time for both the study of these issues and recommendations to the Congress, as well as an adequate amount of time for legislative bodies to consider them. 
So we felt that the amendment we were offering not only was a fair compromise between what was passed in the Senate Commerce Committee overwhelmingly and what was passed in the Senate Finance Committee, but in terms of the actual logistics of State legislative sessions, we believe the amendment that we will be offering with respect to the length of the moratorium is a critical one. 
The fact of the matter is, when you have in the vicinity of 30,000 taxing jurisdictions--and that is the number in our country--you have the prospect of different taxing jurisdictions in States and localities that all see the Internet as the golden goose; you have the real prospect that policies could be adopted that would cause great damage to the Internet's development and cause that golden goose to lay far fewer eggs. 
What we are trying to do in this legislation is to restore a balance with respect to the moratorium. We think it is a fair compromise between what the two committees dealt with here in the U.S. Senate, and at the same time we think it is an approach that will give adequate time for the States and localities to deal with the recommendations that are made while making sure that businesses aren't confused and, in a number of instances, paralyzed by discriminatory and multiple taxation about which they are already expressing concerns. 
I think we have made a considerable amount of headway. As I have said in a couple of instances when I came to the floor, if you look at the legislation that the Presiding Officer heard discussed in the Commerce Committee early in 1997 and the legislation that is before the Senate now, it is clear that there have been many, many changes, over 30. Those are changes that were made specifically to try to deal with the legitimate concerns of States and localities that are concerned about their revenue prospects with respect to the digital economy. 
We have tried to be fair. We had a number of votes on the floor of the Senate. There were several which I thought would have done great damage to the philosophy of what we are trying to do in this legislation. There were others raised with respect to ensuring the fair analysis of a variety of issues and participation on the commission where, clearly, Senators have tried very hard to work together. 
The issue that is coming up now with respect to the length of the moratorium is critical. When I introduced this legislation last year, there was no end date on the moratorium. The reason there was not is that it was our view that if ever there was something that ought to be treated as interstate commerce, it was the Internet. The Internet is global; it knows no boundaries. It is not something that ought to be balkanized in the 21st century into kind of a toll-riddled freeway where it will be very hard to tap the potential of the Internet. 
We should make no mistake about it. The great potential for the Internet is for those individuals, such as those in rural America and inner cities, senior citizens, handicapped individuals, many of them operating home-based businesses, who with sensible governmental policies will be able to, in my view, make a very decent living in the global economy. But the prerequisite of having those kinds of opportunities will be policies that allow the Internet to flourish. Those policies should neither be discriminatory against the Internet nor should they be preferential. 
I have heard various Senators say over the last few days that in some way this legislation would ensure preferential treatment for the Internet. It would do nothing of the sort. It would say very specifically that Internet sales ought to be treated just like everything else. If you pay a specific tax by buying the goods in a jurisdiction in the traditional way, by walking into a retail store, under this legislation, even with the moratorium, you pay exactly the same tax if you order those goods over the Internet--exactly the same tax. There is nothing preferential, nothing discriminatory. 
In a little bit we will have that first vote on the amendment that Chairman McCain and I offered together with respect to the length of the moratorium. It will ensure that we have enough time to study the various issues with respect to electronic commerce and make recommendations, and it will give adequate time to have those recommendations implemented by the localities and the States. There are a number of States that do not meet every year, for example, with their legislatures. They would not have adequate time under the shorter version of the moratorium. 
Madam President, and colleagues, we will have those votes before too long. I thank the various Senators who have weighed in with myself and Chairman McCain, both today and over the last few days. This has been a good debate. And it is only the beginning of our discussions on the ground rules for the digital economy. 
This presents a whole new set of questions for the U.S. Senate. When we look at traditional commerce, even with the Senate Commerce Committee of 40 or 50 years ago, we were talking about moving goods from point A to point B. There was a role for traditional business. There was a role for labor unions and various other key economic sectors such as the transportation sector. That has changed now in many respects, because information--in effect, goods and services--can move on the Internet in a flash of light. So we need sensible policies. 
I urge my colleagues to support that first amendment that Chairman McCain and I are offering with respect to the length of the moratorium. It will ensure that States and localities have an adequate amount of time to act after the recommendations of the commission to go forward. It is a true compromise. The Senate Commerce Committee passed legislation that called for a moratorium of 6 years after my original bill with Chairman McCain, which had no end date at all. The Senate Finance Committee bill was 2 years. We are going forward with 4. That would give the States an opportunity to act in a thoughtful way. 
I hope on that first vote the Senate will support the McCain-Wyden amendment with respect to the length of the moratorium. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

I think it would be helpful, and perhaps the chairman would lay it out, to know that through this discussion there has been an effort to link the grandfather provision effort to make sure that States and localities that already have laws on the books are protected and to link that to the moratorium so that there would be an effort to be fair to both sides. I think the Senator has been very fair, and perhaps the Senator could elaborate a little bit on some of the challenges with respect to that grandfather debate.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the McCain-Wyden amendment is, of course, a compromise. The bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee was a 6-year bill. The bill that came out of the Finance Committee was a 2-year bill. So there was an effort to bring the parties together around 4 years. But that is not what is really important. What is really important is the timetable that is going to be essential to do this job right. 
Mr. President, 18 months after the date of enactment, the commission is going to make its recommendations--May of 2000. The moratorium under the finance bill ends in October of 2000. That means that there is less than 6 months to act on the recommendation before the timeout would end. Some States, a number, have legislatures that are not meeting in the year 2000. I am sure my friend and colleague, Senator Graham, would be interested in knowing that Arkansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, North Dakota, and Vermont all have legislatures that do not meet every year. So we are going to have a situation, it seems to me, where there will be essentially no time in order for a legislature to thoughtfully look at these issues. 
The Senator from Florida says that Chairman McCain and I are ramming this bill through the U.S. Senate. We have worked on it, now, for 18 months. We have made more than 30 separate changes in an effort to try to address the concerns of the Senator from Florida. There has been discussion about how this would create a tax haven on the Internet. Let us be very clear about what happens during the moratorium. If a person walks into a store and purchases a sweater in a jurisdiction where there is a 5 percent sales tax, if they order that sweater over the Internet, they pay exactly the same tax, exactly the same fee--technological neutrality. 
The Senator from Florida says that the apocalypse is at hand because there is going to be a huge reduction in revenue at the State level. When we began this bill with legislation that was much more encompassing than the one we are considering now, the Congressional Budget Office could not even initially score it. It then came back with a projection of less than $30 million. 
Nothing is being preempted here. The States and localities are allowed to treat the Internet just as they would treat anything else. 
At the end of the day, the kinds of people who will benefit from this are the senior citizens in Florida, for example, the home-based businesses in Oregon, people who are trying to use the Internet as a way to advance the chance to build a small business and particularly see the Internet as a great equalizer. 
They are not going to be in a position, those home-based businesses, to compete with the corporate giants. But if we create across this country a crazy quilt of State and local taxes where each jurisdiction goes off and does its own thing, it is going to be very difficult for those entrepreneurs, senior citizens, handicapped and disabled people to go out and hire the accountants and lawyers that would be necessary to carry out the vision of the Senator from Florida of the Internet. What we need to do is come up with some sensible policies, and it is going to take some time. 
If somebody from Florida, for example, orders Harry and David's fruit in Medford, OR, using America Online in Virginia, pays for it with a bank card in California, and ships it to their cousin in New York, we are talking about a completely different kind of commerce than we have seen in the past. Let us take the time to do it right. Without the amendment that the Senator from Arizona and I are offering--

Let us try to get out in front of these issues facing the digital economy rather than duplicating the mistakes we made with respect to mail-order and catalog sales.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I think we are making substantial progress on this legislation. I believe that in a few minutes Senator McCain and I are going to accept something like seven or eight amendments that have been offered in an effort to try to bring the parties together, and I would like to see us continue to work in this spirit. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, I introduced the Internet Tax Freedom Act in March of 1997. Since then, this measure has been one of the most hotly debated measures in this Congress--debated in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Through the course of this year and a half discussion, never once has this idea been suggested--not in the House nor in the Senate. And the fact of the matter is we are still having important negotiations in order to get at the issue of how long the moratorium ought to be. We are anxious to involve the Senator from Florida in that effort. It would seem to me that our job--just as we have tried to do with the seven or eight amendments which Chairman McCain and I are going to accept in a few minutes--is to continue to do our work in good faith. The Senator from Florida knows that I have gone to considerable lengths to be supportive of his position with respect to what would be studied by the commission in an effort to be responsive to his concerns. 
I would like to see us continue those discussions, both with respect to what the commission will study and how long the moratorium ought to be. When we arrive at that point, I and others believe that the commission will do a thoughtful and responsible job. We think they are going to work in good faith. If at any point they indicate that they are unwilling to pursue their duties in that kind of fashion, the U.S. Senate can get back at it. 
I think it is important that the Senate reject this amendment and let us continue in the kind of spirit that Chairman McCain and I have shown with respect to the seven or eight amendments that are going to come up very shortly that we have agreed to accept, and let us get this bill on the President's desk. 
The President of the United States is for this legislation, the majority leader of this body, Trent Lott, is for this legislation, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle, has said that he wants to see this bill enacted. I think it is important that we reject this amendment and move forward in good faith to work out the remaining issues.

It applies to one class of people and that is those who sell goods on the Internet. The amendment would impose on those sellers of goods on the Internet a new requirement that would not be imposed on someone who sells goods over the phone or someone who mails the goods when they get a check. 
Now, let's picture the kind of person who is going to be hurt by this amendment. My State, the State of the Presiding Officer of the Senate, has 100,000 home-based businesses. These are some of the most exciting businesses in the country coming up with new products. They are small. They are entrepreneurial. If this amendment passes, those 100,000 home-based businesses in Oregon--and there are thousands and thousands of other home-based businesses across the country in States that we all represent--they, and only they, will be subject to this new requirement. 
This amendment seeks to do what the Internet tax freedom bill seeks to prevent. Our legislation is about technological neutrality. We should treat the Internet like we treat everything else. It shouldn't get a preference. It shouldn't be discriminated against. But if you read section (a) of this amendment, you will see that it applies requirements to one class of people, and one class of people only. Those are individuals who sell goods over the Internet. 
This is discriminatory. This does what our legislation seeks to prevent. Those who vote for the amendment, in my view, in this Senator's view, are fostering the kind of policy that is going to lead to selective and discriminatory activity against those who sell goods through the World Wide Web. 
I yield back my time, Mr. President.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
Mr. President, let me take just a few minutes to talk about where we are with respect to the Internet tax bill and also to express my thanks to--who may have left the floor--but to express my thanks to Senator Bumpers. 
Senator Bumpers could have filibustered this legislation. He could have insisted on his rights as a Senator to speak at length on this past amendment that he feels very strongly about, as do a number of Senators, and I want to thank him for not doing that. He has been exceptionally kind to me. He knows that I feel strongly about this legislation. And he has been very constructive in working with the bipartisan group pursuing the legislation. 
Let me also just state, as I did, it is our intent--it is clearly spelled out in the legislation--that if a firm or a home-based business--I have thousands of them in Oregon; I know our colleagues do as well--if they are liable for a tax today, they are going to be liable under this legislation if that sale is conducted on the Internet. It is just that simple. 
So what it comes down to, is if you have a question from a mayor or a Governor who asks you about this subject at home--any Senator who is asked about this issue should simply say that this legislation does no harm to the States or to the localities, and it simply treats Internet commerce like any other kind of commerce. That was something that I, as the bill's sponsor, felt very strongly about. 
With respect to the legislation, I know other Senators wish to speak as well, and Senator Dorgan wants to address the Internet issue this afternoon as well. I am very hopeful we will be able to resolve the one remaining issue, and that is the question of the commission and what they are going to be looking at. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has been very helpful on this matter in an effort to try to get an agreement--Senator Graham has as well. I am very hopeful that we will be able to, now that we have addressed the major amendment, the Bumpers amendment, I hope that we will be able to get an agreement on exactly the duties of the commission and be able to go forward with the managers' amendment. 
Senator McCain and myself and others have been anxious to try to address concerns that Senators have had with respect to the length of the moratorium, other issues surrounding the managers' amendment. I think we can do that. 
So, again, let me say that I very much appreciate, especially on a Friday with Senators having a busy schedule, the opportunity to discuss this issue. We made considerable progress. I especially thank Senator Bumpers who could have spoken at length, filibustered this legislation, and he has been especially kind to me. I express my appreciation to him. 
I see the Senator from North Dakota who has worked many, many hours in an effort to try to get this issue to the floor, along with me and others, and I express my appreciation to him and say that I especially appreciate his effort to bring the parties together with respect to the commission and the issues that they will be pursuing there in an effort to make sure that as we look to the digital economy in the 21st century that we have a chance to examine those questions. 
Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to pursue a question at this time?

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his thoughtful comments, as well. I think there has been a considerable effort in the last few months to address this in a bipartisan way. 
I think the Senator from North Dakota is exactly right; what we want is technological neutrality. We don't want the Internet to get a preference. We don't want the Internet to be discriminated against. We want to be able to say, as we look to the brand new economy, the digital economy, that we don't make some of the mistakes that we made as we tried to sort out some of the issues, for example, with respect to mail order. I think the Senator from North Dakota has been very persistent in terms of trying to work with all the parties in making sure that the commission studies these issues fairly. That is certainly what I want. 
I was very interested in my friend's comments with respect to his town in North Dakota and how the Internet would allow, for example, somebody to log on in North Dakota and get goods from a sporting goods store far away and have them shipped to a small town in North Dakota. That is clearly one of the benefits. But what we also hope to do with the Internet Tax Freedom Act is make it possible to grow small businesses in North Dakota that will be able to furnish some of those goods and services. 
My friend from North Dakota has many small communities in North Dakota, as I do in Oregon. I want to make sure that Burns and Wagontire and other small towns in Oregon can compete. My view is that sensible Internet policies will make those small businesses more competitive than they are today. 
The reason that Main Street businesses support the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the bill that is before the Senate today, is that Main Street businesses, those small stores, recognize right now they are having a lot of difficulty competing with the Wal-Mart giants and certainly major corporations that are located overseas. 
And once you make geography irrelevant, which the Internet does, once you get a fair tax policy for a home-based business in Oregon or North Dakota, rather than those businesses facing discriminatory taxes, as we have been addressing today, I think we will grow more small businesses in North Dakota and Oregon on Main Street, and that is the hope of the sponsors of this legislation. 
So let me yield back to the Senator from North Dakota, as this Senator has to head off for a 7 or 8-hour flight home. I want to again express my thanks to the Senator from North Dakota. He and his staff have spent many, many hours toiling over what is arcane language, at best, with respect to the digital economy and these new issues. I think the Senator from North Dakota is right in saying that this is just the beginning of this whole discussion. We had another initiative yesterday that was very sensible--Senator Bryan's initiative dealing with on-line privacy as it relates to children. So we are just at the beginning of these issues. 
I hope to be sitting next to the Senator from North Dakota on the Communications Subcommittee as we tackle these questions. I think we have made considerable progress. I specifically thank Senator Graham, Senator Bumpers, as well as the Senator from North Dakota. They have had strong views on this matter, and they know this bill has been important to me. They have all been very gracious in helping to move it along. Also, Senator McCain will be back on the floor in a few moments. We simply could not have been here without the support of Senator McCain and his staff. I am looking forward to seeing this legislation go to the President before we wrap up. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator. He has correctly laid out the various time periods. Let me say again, the Senator from North Dakota knows both the chairman of the Commerce Committee and I are still wanting to work with those who feel that 5 years is too long a period. We are anxious to try to get an agreement and, hopefully, this can all be resolved as part of a managers' amendment. 
I think the concern of certainly myself and others is that 2 years is too short because it is going to take some time to work through a subject as complicated as this, and then there is going to need to be a period where the States have the chance to address it. I think we can come up with a period that is acceptable. Of course, the moratorium, such as it is, applies only to Internet access taxes. It does not apply to other spheres of economic activity. And with respect to other spheres of economic activity, again, Internet will be treated just like anything else. If a State and a locality has other means of raising revenue, we want to make it clear that, with respect to the Internet, the business conducted there will be treated like everything else. 
So let me yield back to the Senator from North Dakota at this time, with an assurance that we are going to continue to try to negotiate on this point an acceptable time period for all parties. We have discussed 4 years, and we have discussed a variety of options. We are going to continue to do that. I want it understood that both Senator McCain and I feel that the Senator from North Dakota is trying very hard to be helpful here, and we are going to continue to move forward in working with him to get this resolved.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first let me thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator McCain. I introduced S. 442 in March of 1997. Chairman McCain and his staff have worked almost nonstop with me since that time to try to put together a bipartisan bill. I thank Chairman McCain for all of these efforts. I share his views. We are anxious to get to the Bumpers amendment this morning. I have a few brief comments and, hopefully, we will be able to move to that expeditiously. 
If ever there was an issue that called out for treatment as interstate commerce, it is the Internet. The Internet, as we all know, knows no boundaries--not Federal boundaries, not State boundaries, in effect not even global boundaries. But what we have tried to do in our efforts over the last few months, and we have done it through more than 30 separate changes, is try to be fair to all parties--the States that are trying to look thoughtfully at the ground rules for the new economy and small businesses who overwhelmingly have endorsed this legislation. For the small businesses, the Internet is a chance to compete with the Wal-Marts and other big guys because geography becomes irrelevant. So, small businesses have supported it. I think that is why we have fashioned a bill with so much bipartisan support. 
The essence of this bill is that in the 21st century the new digital economy should be built on the principle of technological neutrality. The Internet should get no preference, nor should the Internet be the target of selective discrimination. Unfortunately, around the country we have seen instances, for example, where if you purchase a newspaper the traditional way, what is called snail mail, it is sent to you in your home and you pay no tax. But if you subscribe to the same newspaper via the Internet, you pay a hefty tax as a result. 
Depending on what State you are in, electronic commerce may be taxed as a telecommunications service, computer service, information service, or some combination, and there are different rates around the country. My concern has long been that if a significant number of the 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in America all decide to take a bite out of the Internet, or if we have 50 States going at it individually, the Internet is going to look like Dodge City before the marshals showed up. 
Chairman McCain was very right, that Internet growth is going to be enormous. There is a fair amount of Internet commerce going on today, but it is going to grow dramatically in the years ahead. That is why in our legislation we seek to come up with some ground rules for the new economy, and to do it before we have to react to critical problems. 
I submit the greatest beneficiaries of this legislation are not the affluent and the powerful. The affluent and the powerful have lots of tax lawyers and specialists who, if they run up against a crazy quilt of taxes on the Internet, they are not going to have any problem using all of their legions of tax specialists to deal with that kind of situation. 
The people who are really going to benefit from this legislation are folks like home-based businesses, one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy. My home State of Oregon has more than 100,000 home-based businesses, and in meeting with them, many of them have said that electronic commerce is the key to their survival. 
For rural communities and at-home parents and disabled individuals, the online world is a gateway to economic opportunity. If somebody in a rural community has a home-based business, for example, selling fruit or jam or something of this nature, I cannot believe that there is a single Member of the U.S. Senate who would want to subject that kind of person to a score of different taxes. I don't think there is a Senator who would want to do that. That is why we have this legislation before the Senate today, to come up with a set of ground rules. 
Mr. President, here is the kind of example we are going to be talking about: If the present Senator in the chair wants to send a gift basket from Harry and David's in Medford, OR, to his cousin, say, in Florida, paying for it with a bank card in New York, using America Online in Virginia, how many jurisdictions would have the opportunity to impose a tax on that kind of transaction? 
There really are no ground rules for that sort of thing today, and if there were to be a hodgepodge of large, new taxes on electronic commerce, it would be especially punitive on those folks in rural States, like Colorado and Oregon. That is one of the reasons that I and Senator McCain and others who have worked on this legislation have sought to bring this to the floor expeditiously. 
I would like to take a minute to explain exactly what is in the bill and what is before the Senate. 
First, the legislation is not going to preempt existing State and local taxes as long as they are technologically neutral. What that means is, if the authority is there for someone to pay a 5-percent sales tax when they buy a sweater in a particular jurisdiction, under the Internet tax freedom proposal, they will pay exactly the same kind of tax if they order it on the Internet. 
States that impose and enforce taxes on Internet access in place today are going to be able to keep them. None of the States that tax Internet access today actually has a law on the books that expressly authorizes the taxation of Internet access, but as we heard in the hearings before the Commerce Committee, there are a variety of problems already cropping up as a result of administrative rulings and reinterpretations of existing law. 
In fact, there is one major firm, Vertex, which has tried to sort through the status at the State level of how the Internet is being taxed. In a number of States, they basically said that they couldn't give a clear answer, but if anybody was interested in doing a business deal, a deal involving electronic commerce that touched on that particular State, they would be wise to get a consultation. 
The legislation will not allow any State to attempt to impose or assess or attempt to collect a tax on Internet access after October 1, 1998, unless it already had done that with a tax in effect. 
It is very clear that we are trying to be sensitive to the laws in place and the concerns of the States, but at the same time making sure that there is not going to be an opportunity for discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. 
In effect, what this legislation does is it ensures a timeout so that the commission of experts called for in the legislation can study these complicated questions and make sound policy recommendations to the Congress. But during that time, we take steps that we believe will be critically important to the development of electronic commerce as it relates to the smallest concerns in America. For example, the legislation assures that a web site is treated exactly like a mail-order catalog for purposes of interstate sales, so the taxing jurisdiction cannot attempt to impose a tax on a web site with respect to an out-of-State computer server. 
The fact is, the online world is racing past outdated policies. The ground rules that we seek to establish here are just the beginning of what I think is going to be needed for the digital economy. 
We have begun to debate in the Commerce Committee a variety of other issues. Yesterday, an important bill of Senator Bryan's was passed dealing with online privacy concerns as they relate to children. We may hear more about that before the end of the session, but I think that with this legislation we will begin to get the common definitions, the more clearly defined principles and standards, that are going to be essential for Internet commerce to go forward. 
Recently, I was home and met with some small businesses, and one of them said that he was very excited about the work that we were doing on this legislation. He said: `Just understand that I am not going to be able to grow my Internet business if there are 30,000 taxing jurisdictions all with their hands in our pocket.' 
The American taxpayers made it clear of late how they regard the IRS. If we were to have thousands of small jurisdictions collecting Internet taxes, I think that the concern we would have with respect to the IRS would be multiplied many times over at the thought of thousands of mini-IRS-taxing authorities collecting Internet taxes. 
I see that Senator Bumpers has arrived. I want to say, as Senator Bumpers comes to the floor and prepares his amendment, that I have agreed with him on a great many concerns over the years. I have agreed with Senator Bumpers about Social Security and the many times that he has led this body to take on spending boondoggles, environmental concerns, and the like. We don't happen to agree on this issue. I think it would be a mistake to let each State have its own sales tax arrangement for the Internet. It would certainly jack up taxes dramatically on the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State and the thousands of others across the country. I do think that if we have the States going off in their own directions, we do run the real risk of having the Internet look like Dodge City before the marshals showed up. 
I will conclude by way of saying that Senator Bumpers has worked very closely with this Senator, knowing that it is particularly important to me. We have gotten agreement on a number of key questions, and that was critical to getting the legislation to the floor. 
I want the Senator to know that he is going to be somebody whom this Senator will miss very, very much next year when I cannot look over and see Senator Bumpers and get his counsel on everything from Social Security to spending boondoggles. I thank him, because he has been aware that this legislation has been a priority of mine. I know he has strong feelings about it, and he was gracious enough to let it come forward and let us get these matters resolved. I express my appreciation to Senator Bumpers. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in November 1996, there was a tragic accident off the coast of California that claimed the lives of 10 out of 11 airmen, the crew of an Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft out of Portland. All of these crewmen were from my home state of Oregon. 
This was a devastating loss for all of us, but most of all for the families of those airmen who lost their lives. After any tragedy like this, the first question on everyone's minds is `why?' Why were my loved ones taken from me? This is what the families of these airmen wanted to know, but no one would give them a straight answer. 
After many, many months of frustration, these families came to me and my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, to get the Air Force to tell us exactly what happened. 
As a result of working with these families, with the Air Force, and with the committee staff, and with Senator Levin in particular, we were able to craft some language that is now included in the Defense Authorization Conference Report that we are considering today. This language takes a two pronged approach to dealing with the pressing issues the families have raised: improving crash investigations, and eliminating the secrecy in which these investigations are shrouded. 
Specifically, the language directs the Defense Department to review the way it conducts aviation accident investigations so that they are conducted in as thorough and objective a manner as possible, including making sure crash investigators receive the best training, and ensuring that the military department coordinate and share information on fleet safety. The bill also urges the Pentagon to seek the advice of the National Transportation Safety Board in improving investigation procedures, and I intend to make sure their valuable input is part of their review. 
Secrecy has long been the hallmark of these investigations and has kept loved ones in the dark about what happened and why. We have worked to reduce the secrecy involved in the investigations of tragedies, and this legislation takes a solid step forward in providing families and the public with better information. 
That's why this language also requires the Department of Defense to issue regulations to provide to family members periodic reports on the progress of investigations. I also spoke with Secretary Cohen about this recently, and he has pledged to make a solid effort to make sure families are kept informed of the progress of investigations. 
It's important that we eliminate secrecy from these proceedings. The last thing we should do is add to these terrible tragedies by keeping the families in the dark about the status of these investigations. From day to day, from week to week, from month to month, these families had to cope with not only the incredible pain of losing a loved one, but with the incredible frustration of not knowing the status of the investigation into their deaths. This new language seeks to put an end to this type of treatment. We owe it to the men and women who give their lives for their country.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that the Senate will not have to get into this cloture matter with respect to the Internet tax bill. The Senator from Florida is one of the Senators that I most respect in this body. I find myself agreeing with him on just about everything that comes before the Senate. As he knows, we have, over many, many months, tried to address the host of legitimate concerns that the States have. We have a number of Governors--the Senator from Florida having served as Governor, as have others here--who know a tremendous amount about this. I have tried to make clear, as the principal sponsor of this legislation, all we are seeking is technological neutrality with respect to the Internet. The Internet would be treated like everything else--nothing favorable, nothing discriminatory. 
Because many of the Nation's Governors are concerned about other issues, particularly the question of out-of-State sales, this legislation, S. 442, has become a magnet for a variety of other issues. 
The sponsors, Senator McCain and I, especially have, in my view, done somersaults now to make sure there was a fair evaluation of all the important issues with respect to out-of-State sales. Let me say, in doing that, there have been a number of other Senators--Senator Gregg and Senator Lieberman--who I think have been very fair in an effort to try to get to a compromise on this matter. As the Senator from Florida knows, just a few minutes ago Senator McCain and I were willing to make additional changes in the managers' amendment to ensure that there would be a fair study of both the Internet and commercial activities, which is the precise language that the Governors have sought. 
I don't think there is anything else that Senator McCain, I, or others can offer at this point to ensure that a fair and objective set of studies and analyses go on by the commission. 
I hope that if there continues to be opposition to this legislation, that those who oppose the legislation simply say that they are opposed and not, in effect, produce a situation which I think is going to turn what ought to be a bipartisan and thoughtful fight into what will be a very bloody battle. 
I see my friend from North Dakota here. The Senator from North Dakota has had strong views on this, and over many, many months we have been negotiating on it. He did not come to the floor today to object as a result of that work, nor did Senator Bumpers. 
I am hopeful that particularly Senators on the Democratic side are not going to force what I think will be a very unfortunate and bloody fight with respect to a bill that has undergone more than 30 separate and important changes since it was originally introduced to accommodate the concerns of the States and localities. Those folks were very, very opposed when this discussion started. They raised legitimate issues. We have sought to deal with them. I am hopeful we will be able to go to a motion to proceed early next week and not have a bitter fight as I think we have over cloture. 
Let me conclude by way of saying that I and my staff are prepared to continue to work around the clock with the Senator from Florida and others who may have questions about how this legislation will affect the States, but let us go forward in an effort to try to resolve this and not just get to a solution with respect to one section and then say, `Well, I have another one that we have to deal with,' which, regrettably, has been the case. I have enormous respect for the Senator from Florida and I think one of the more unpleasant tasks is to have an argument with him. I hope this can be resolved. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chairman. As the Chairman knows, one of my constituents, John Sleavin, lost his brother and nephew and niece under tragic circumstances when their pleasure boat was run down on the high seas by a Korean freighter. The accident was especially tragic because after the collision there was no attempt by the Korean freighter to rescue the family or even to notify the authorities about the collision. Mr. Chairman, you were very gracious to me in allowing my constituent to testify before the Commerce Committee on the need to reform the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) to provide just compensation for victims like my constituent. I believe he provided compelling testimony on the need for reforming DOHSA for maritime accidents. The FAA reauthorization bill reforms DOHSA but only for aviation accidents. I would like to ask the Chairman whether he will commit to work with me to reform DOHSA comprehensively so the reforms cover both aviation and maritime accidents.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I informed the minority leader that I will object to any unanimous consent requests to proceed to S. 2151 or any similar legislation containing provisions that would override Oregon's assisted suicide law. Should S. 2151, the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act come to the floor, I intend to insist that this body clearly hear the arguments against this legislation before voting on it, even if I must filibuster to assure that this occurs. 
Let me state, as I have done before on this floor, that I have personal reservations about the assisted suicide concept. I voted twice against assisted suicide in my home State, and I joined our colleagues in voting against Federal funding of assisted suicide. 
I personally believe that nowhere near enough has been done to promote hospice care, pain management, comfort care, and other approaches to deal with the end of life. 
The people of my State entered into an honest, direct, and exhausting discussion on the issue of assisted suicide--not once, but twice--through our public referenda process. I am not going to let that vote be set aside without an extended debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for all the work he has done over the last few months on the Internet tax freedom bill. We are going to get there to no small degree because the Senator from North Dakota has worked so closely with us. I thank him for it. 
In the last few minutes, we have talked about two extremely important subjects: the question of a Patients' Bill of Rights and the Internet tax freedom bill. Both of these bills are extremely important to me. In fact, shortly after I came to the U.S. Senate in 1996, I offered one of the key provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights with Senator Kennedy. It was legislation to ban these gag clauses, these ridiculous provisions in managed care agreements that literally keep physicians from telling their patients about all their health care options. These gag clauses are unconscionable. We received over 50 votes the first time we brought it to the floor of the U.S. Senate, at a time when people knew very little about the subject. I feel very strongly about the Patients' Bill of Rights and, hopefully, we can get an agreement, and I do think we can get an agreement that is bipartisan. 
I also want to say, Mr. President, how strongly I feel about passing the Internet tax freedom legislation as well. It is time for the U.S. Senate to begin to write the rules for the digital economy. The Internet is clearly going to be the business infrastructure in the 21st century. Usage is doubling every 60 days, or thereabouts, and it is clear we don't have any ground rules to address the critical issues that involve electronic commerce. 
If somebody in Iowa, for example, wants to order fruit from Harry and David's in Medford, OR, ship it to their cousin in Florida, pay for it with a bank card in New York and do it through America Online in Virginia, what are going to be the ground rules with respect to taxes? 
What the Internet cannot afford is the development of a crazy quilt of discriminatory taxes with respect to this burgeoning area of our economy. That is why it is so important that the Senate move on this legislation. 
I will close by saying a word about the manager of the legislation, the Senator from Arizona. Throughout these many months, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, and his staff have worked very closely with me and have worked very closely with a host of Members of the U.S. Senate. There have been more than 30 separate changes made in the Internet tax freedom bill from the time it was originally introduced on a bipartisan basis. 
I want it understood that a bipartisan effort under the leadership of Chairman McCain has been made for many, many months now, involving Senator Stevens originally, with respect to the Universal Service Fund. Senator Dorgan has had a variety of issues with respect to treatment of the States. Senator Bumpers has had enormous contributions and questions that we felt had to be addressed, as well as Senators Gregg and Enzi. 
I am very hopeful that very shortly this week this legislation is going to be brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate, and I am very hopeful that it can be brought to the floor in a way that will also allow for the important Patients' Bill of Rights legislation to go forward. 
I have spent a considerable amount of my time since coming to the U.S. Senate on both of these issues, working on both of them in a bipartisan fashion. I think both of them are now ready for consideration on the floor of the Senate. 
I see the chairman of the Commerce Committee is here now and has another important bill to bring up. I will close by, again, expressing my appreciation to him for all the time that he has put in to try to get the Internet tax freedom legislation specifically before the Senate. I believe we are ready now, and certainly those Senators who have brought amendments to the chairman and myself have a right to be heard and they should be heard. 
I believe we are ready for an agreement that will protect the rights of every Member of the U.S. Senate and, at the same time, allow the Senate to go forward and take the first steps--it is going to be a long journey--it is time to take the first steps to writing some of the essential rules for the digital economy, the Internet, which is going to so dominate our lives in the next century. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier today, I called in a hold on the nomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak Reform Board. Consistent with my policy of publicly disclosing holds, I am including the following statement in the Congressional Record, stating my reasons for placing a hold on this nomination: 
I am placing a hold on the nomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak Reform Board because of her role as an Amtrak Board member in voting to terminate Amtrak's Pioneer route. A subsequent GAO report indicates that at the time Ms. Rosen approved terminating the Pioneer, other Amtrak routes that were even less profitable than the Pioneer were kept in service. Before I will allow Ms. Rosen's nomination to move forward, I am seeking certain assurances from Ms. Rosen that if confirmed as a member of the Amtrak Reform Board, she will insist that Amtrak make decisions about passenger rail service on the basis of objective financial criteria. 
Subsequent to calling in my hold on Ms. Rosen's nomination, I and my staff had conversations with her to discuss my concerns. During those conversations, I received assurances from Ms. Rosen that as an Amtrak Board member, she would insist that decisions about Amtrak routes and services would be made on the basis of objective financial criteria and that she would work with me and other Members of Congress to address the needs of rural communities for passenger rail service. As a result of these conversations, I am withdrawing my hold on Amy Rosen's nomination to the Amtrak Reform Board.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am today, along with Congressman Blumenauer in the U.S. House, introducing legislation to make sure that in the next century the children of Portland can go to their kitchen faucet and take a glass of drinking water that is as safe and pure as any that the pioneers found when they got here. 
Why protect the Little Sandy? The answer is as clear as the water in that stream. Essentially, what we are proposing is to finish the job begun two years ago with passage of the Oregon Resources and Conservation Act of 1996, which brought statutory protection to the Bull Run Watershed. 
Portland's city fathers acted in 1890 to protect Bull Run, and it is fitting that we continue that effort today. More than one-third of the Little Sandy watershed has already been logged; clearly, this drainage has already been pushed, and pushed hard, in terms of past timber harvest. 
The protection our bill would offer will not only affect clean drinking water, but salmon recovery as well. I am hopeful that this legislation will become an important part of our region's approach to restoring steelhead habitat. 
Finally, I want to commend the leadership of Mayor Vera Katz, Commissioner Erik Sten, and former Commissioner Mike Lindberg, whose vision for Portland's future laid the foundation for the introduction of this bill. 
I first introduced legislation to protect the Little Sandy when I was in the House. In passing the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996, I made a compromise with Senator Hatfield in which we would designate the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit as a protected area that is off limits to commercial timber harvest, and designate the Little Sandy as a study area. I am now asking the Congress to approve the addition of the Little Sandy study area to the Bull Run Management Unit, and to be subject to the management prescriptions which were established under the ORCA governing the Bull Run.

 Mr. WYDEN. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Daschle, Smith of Oregon, Baucus, Burns, Johnson, and Craig, in introducing legislation making an important adjustment to the way the Government manages rights-of-way over federal lands. The provisions in this bill address the situation involving liability standards for electric utilities that utilize federal rights-of-ways to provide electricity to rural communities. 
I am pleased to be working on this issue with my good friends and colleagues from Oregon, Bob Smith and Peter DeFazio. Chairman Smith has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which received a hearing in the House Resources Committee earlier this year. During that hearing, one of my constituents, Mr. Bill Kopacz of Midstate Electric in LaPine, Oregon testified on the need to reform the current federal policy of requiring strict liability for fires that occur in right-of-ways. 
Under strict liability, the holder of a right of way is responsible for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder of the right of way without regard to the holder's negligence. 
The problem that this legislation addresses is best illustrated by the experience of the Midstate Electric Cooperative of LaPine, Oregon. 
As a matter of prudent maintenance, Midstate trims or removes trees on right-of-ways that pose a risk of falling onto electric lines. On federal rights-of-way, the cooperative consults with the appropriate land management agency--which of course must approve these management actions. After proposing the removal of a number of trees on a Forest Service right-of-way in 1984, Midstate was told by the agency that it could cut some down, but had to leave other specified trees standing. Of course the predictable happened--one of the trees that Midstate had proposed cutting, which the Forest Service had refused to allow to be removed, fell into a power line and started a fire. 
In the end it cost more than $326,850 to put that fire out--and Midstate Electric got the bill. Since the fire resulted from a management decision of the Forest Service, Midstate went to court in an attempt to appropriately assign the financial liability of fighting the fire. Midstate lost the court action because of a ruling which interpreted right-of-way contracts as holding the co-op and other right-of-way lessees to a strict liability standard. 
The 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act provided federal agencies with the authority to impose strict liability for costs associated with hazards on federal lands. Prior to 1976, agencies recovered costs associated with hazards, such as costs required to put out a fire, on the basis of normal negligence. 
This bill would replace that strict liability standard in favor of a normal negligence standard that is routinely used in private right-of-way contracts. The new standard will say: if you caused it, you are responsible for it. Rural electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities and municipalities are not looking to pass the buck to the American taxpayer. If they are negligent in maintaining federal rights-of-way, they should bear the responsibility. However, by enforcing any standard more rigid than that, the land management agencies are purposefully transferring cost to private citizens. 
The minimum impact of the current strict liability policy is higher electric rates for those rural communities who live in close proximity to public lands. The possibility exists, however, of even more punitive impacts in the form of the loss of insurance coverage for entities with federal rights-of-way liability. 
In my judgement, this legislation restores an appropriate balance to the shared responsibility of both the land manager and the utility in reducing the natural hazards along a right of way. As we saw in the Midstate case, because the Forest Service bears no exposure to costs associated with fire and risk prevention, the Forest Service simply did not allow the full use of measures to reduce those risks. 
This legislation will not only benefit the state of Oregon. Utilities all through the United States have rights-of-way permits with our land management agencies. This proposal is of interest in states such as California, Idaho, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Pennsylvania. I believe my proposal is fair and balanced legislation that protects our rural communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to perfect this legislation in the waning days of the 105th Congress.

Mr. WYDEN. I thanked the Chairman for helping us in the Northwest to address a serious, growing problem with a tremendous overpopulation of geese in the Pacific Northwest. During the course of the past year the Oregon and Washington Farm Bureaus, the Alaska Waterfowl Conservation Committee, and state and federal wildlife agencies have worked together on a plan to address this growing problem, and I appreciate the Chairman's help in funding this proposal. Mr. President, the Oregon and Washington Farm Bureaus have provided critical leadership in helping us obtain these funds, and I wonder if the Chairman of the Subcommittee would engage in a colloquy about how these funds are to be spent.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my desire to work further with the Chair of the subcommittee and ranking minority member on a particularly important provision affecting our YMCAs, our YWCAs and other charitable organizations that do so much good work throughout the country. Throughout the recess, I heard continually from constituents who enjoy these important organizations in Oregon that they are concerned about a provision in the committee report accompanying this legislation that deals with the tax-exempt status of these organizations. I would say that I am of the view that these nongovernmental groups can provide critically needed services in our country, particularly as it relates to juveniles: preventing crime, drug use and unwholesome activities in which some kids do get caught up. 
As many in this body know, Senator Smith and I have talked at some length about approaches to deal with the tragedy that we saw at Thurston High School earlier this year, when a young person entered the school with a gun. A number of our young constituents were killed and injured. It seems to me one of the very best antidotes to this kind of juvenile violence is the important work done in afterschool programs by these organizations. I am concerned that a provision in this legislation could curtail some of the important activities that the Y's and Jewish Community Centers and other important organizations provide. 
What has transpired is that in 1984 the Internal Revenue Service issued a technical ruling making it clear that fitness activities provided by these and other organizations remain charitable as long as the entity, the nonprofit, serves a broad segment of the community. These organizations, the YMCAs, the YWCAs, the Jewish Community Centers across our country do provide critically needed services, particularly to low-income individuals. They have philanthropic missions related to health and education, community welfare. My concern is a provision relating to the tax-exempt status of these organizations, in effect, could prompt a review that would have a chilling effect over the entire range of work done by these organizations. 
I have organized a letter with nine Members of this body, a bipartisan letter--Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Roberts, Senator Grassley, Senator Murray, Senator Durbin, Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski and myself, to make it clear to the managers of this legislation that we want to work with them on a bipartisan basis to make sure that the important work done by these community organizations is not in jeopardy. It seems to me, as we look to the 21st century, trying to make sure the budget is balanced, still meeting the needs of our communities and particularly the young people, that these are the very programs that are most likely to make a difference. 
I had thought the question of the tax status of these groups was settled law in 1984. I note I am unaware of any abuses since 1984 or of any violations by the `Y's' with respect to this charitable exemption, and it is for that reason that I do ask this afternoon to work further with both the majority and the minority to make sure the tax status of these groups is protected and the important work they are doing continues to go forward and, in fact, expands in the years ahead.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hope this amendment is just the beginning of the debate on agricultural labor. But I believe that the legislation before the Senate is based on three principles that can last well into the 21st century and be in the interests of both farm workers and farm employers. 
The first principle on which this amendment is based is that 
the U.S. worker must come first--that U.S. workers, for example, when they participate in the registry, will have the right of first refusal to any available farm job in our country, and that the Federal Government is required to notify those workers about available positions. 
Second, this amendment brings before the Senate specific changes proposed over the years by the Farm Worker Justice Fund to improve working conditions for the farm workers in our country. 
Third, it will replace the current dysfunctional system for administering this program with one that is modern and is based on the use of computer technology. 
At every step along the way, this package tries to address specific concerns raised by worker advocates, as well as those advocating for the growers. My colleague, Senator Smith, talked about the registry. If a U.S. worker participates in the registry, that worker is entitled to benefits that U.S. workers are not entitled to today, such as housing and transportation. And the registry also seeks to address the concerns of growers, specifically, by saying that when a grower utilizes this registry, the grower can then be certain that there is a presumption that their workers are legal. 
The last point I would like to raise, because I know many of my colleagues want to speak and have important questions, deals with exactly the number of people involved in farm labor in our country. This is the centerpiece of the question. We have heard a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about a guest worker program. There are very few legal guest workers. There are 1.6 million farm workers in our country and perhaps 25,000 guest workers who are here legally under the current program. The 1.6 million farm workers, who work on those farms, have virtually no legal entitlements other than to the minimum wage. So what this legislation does is it potentially extends basic worker protections to a far greater share of that 1.6 million pool of workers, save 25,000. It will create a circumstance in which hundreds of thousands more farm workers get access to housing and transportation and other benefits that they do not have today. 
I know this is a new concept, but it is an important one because what this amendment seeks to do is to change the nature of the system so we can make sure the bulk of our workers are legal in America. The General Accounting Office made the judgment that there was no shortage of workers in America, but they concluded that way because they counted illegal workers. Right now, any grower can tell you that their workers may appear to be legal, but that the Social Security Administration often rejects more than half of the Social Security numbers filed. So what we have is a situation with growers caught between being penalized because they cannot find legal workers or being felons because their workers are not legal. 
I believe workers deserve better and growers deserve better. That is what this amendment does. I appreciate Senator Smith giving me this time from the allotment that he has.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his patience. It has been mentioned that this is in some way a bracero program. My friends, this is not. Under the Bracero Program, for example, there was no right of first refusal for U.S. workers to available jobs in our country. That is what is different here--U.S. workers first, first dibs on any available position. 
Point No. 2: There has been discussion that this amendment would in some way increase illegal immigration. Right now, of the 1.6 million farm workers, perhaps a million of them are illegal. What we are advocating is an above-ground system that guarantees fundamental protections to legal workers. Some of our opponents, it seems to me, prefer an underground system that is going to keep thousands of those workers hidden in the back of a U-Haul trailer or the trunk of a car. That is not humane. We don't want those workers in the back of a U-Haul or in the trunk of a car. We want them participating in a legal, humane system that rewards both the workers and the growers. That is why this proposal makes sense. I hope it will receive strong support from our colleagues.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Subcommittee Chairman for including $50,000 in the Committee Appropriations report for a potential loan to fund an innovative fishing capacity reduction program on the Pacific Coast. The program, if it receives the approval of fishermen on the West Coast, would be the first capacity reduction program to be ultimately funded by the fishing industry itself. 
To comply with the requirements of section 504(b) of the Federal Credit Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 661c), an appropriation is required to cover the potential cost to the government for a debt obligation. My request assumed that the maximum potential cost to the government likely to be determined for the loan would be one percent, which would allow a loan of $5 million based on the $50,000 appropriated by the Committee. It is my understanding that if the Secretary of Commerce finds that the potential default rate for the loan is less than one percent, the loan amount would be accordingly higher than the $5,000,000 authorized by the report. For example, if the potential default rate for a future Pacific Coast buyback is determined to be one-half of one percent, the loan could be as high as $10,000,000 based on the appropriated $50,000. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, Senator Smith and I, having visited with our constituents at home and in Springfield, OR, after the terrible tragedy at Thurston High School, believe it is absolutely critical that concrete steps be taken between now and the beginning of the school year to increase the safety for our young people in schools across the land. 
We believe this legislation, which has now been agreed to by both the majority and the minority, can be the first concrete step that will be taken to ensure that this fall our young people and their families can have an added measure of safety when they attend our Nation's schools. We believe that when a young person brings a gun to school, that ought to set off a five-alarm warning that there are problems for our society. 
Our colleagues on several occasions have mentioned today that in a number of States it has been documented that in several hundred instances a year young people bring a gun to school, disciplinary action is taken, but then it is essentially at the discretion of law enforcement officials and others as to what additional steps will be taken. 
Law enforcement officials across our State and across the country have made it very clear that they don't believe it is appropriate to put that discretion in their hands. They would like to make sure that government sets out a policy that would stipulate that when a young person brings a gun to school, that that young person will be detained for an adequate period of time to have a mental health assessment, to have law enforcement officials involved, to have health policymakers participate in what action should then be taken to best promote safety in our society. If my home State of Oregon had this policy in effect at the time of the tragedy at Thurston High School, Kip Kinkel, who is alleged to have perpetrated these crimes, would have been before a judge and held, and, in my view, unquestionably, would have been detained rather than sent home, where he allegedly killed his parents and then came back, literally, within a relatively short time, and shot and injured more than 20 young people at Thurston High School in Springfield. 
What our legislation does is ensure that States that have put in place a policy of detaining a student caught with bringing a gun--that States with that policy would be accorded a priority for title V funding, the prevention and delinquency funding program, under this legislation. That way, we would ensure that, on an ongoing basis, every State in our country would have an incentive to ensure that when young people bring guns to school, as was done in the case of the Springfield tragedy, rather than simply leave to fate what happens next, there would be a finding of what was the most appropriate step to take to ensure the safety of the community. 
Mr. President, I think we all agree that our schools ought to be places of learning, not of tragedy and violence. One lesson that has been learned from the tragic shootings in Oregon and Arkansas and other States is that clearly there is something wrong today with the policies for dealing with young people and guns. The policies today aren't working. Young people are falling through the cracks, and some of them are shooting other children. Bringing a gun to school ought to be a warning signal, an early sign, that there is a serious potential threat for our society. When that act takes place, it is important to get the student out of the classroom, off the streets, and in front of a professional who can make a determination of how much of a threat that student is to the community. 
I think most legislators would agree we don't have all the answers, but we do know that keeping an angry student with a gun out of the classroom and off the schoolyard ought to be part of the solution. That is why the amendment that I sponsor today, with Senator Gordon Smith of my home State, focuses on two tracks. First, Senator Smith and I seek to remove the threat of violence from our schools as soon as it is identified. Second, we help our communities find the resources they need to identify and serve at-risk students so it is possible to prevent a potential health and safety problem from becoming the sort of tragedy that was seen at Thurston High School. 
This amendment provides concrete incentives to States to immediately remove any student who brings a gun to school and to get that student before a judge and other qualified professionals. If the judge determines that student is a threat to the community or to the individual themselves, the State must hold that student for a period of time that would allow for an appropriate placement that protects our society. 
If a State has in place this sort of policy to protect the community, families, and students, our legislation will give that State priority when it comes to funding juvenile justice grants. That means they will be in a position to devote more resources to make sure that at-risk students don't follow that path of crime and delinquency, and it will be possible with these grants to target high-risk young people for aggressive and early intervention so these young people can be reached with appropriate treatment before they fall through the cracks. 
What has been learned in Springfield and the other communities across this country is that expelling a student for bringing a gun to school may adequately punish the student's behavior, but it is not enough to protect the community and our society. 
It is important to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken at that time--at that time when the student is apprehended by school officials, so that that student has every opportunity to work through potential problems they may be having at home, or with their peers, and our society can find a balance between preventing these crimes from occurring and punishing them when they actually take place. 
There isn't a Member of this U.S. Senate who is not deeply concerned about this set of incidents across our country--literally across our Nation--where young people have been taken from us by school violence. In Springfield, OR, where Senator Smith and I visited with the President--who deserves great credit, in my view, for supporting our bipartisan legislation--the community promised Senator Smith and I that they wanted to let the violence end here. 
It is our hope that this legislation will give States the incentive they need to enact tough detention statutes to ensure that what happened in Thurston doesn't happen across this country. My friend and colleague, Senator Smith, is here and I want to yield the floor in just a moment. I want to thank him for the bipartisan effort that has been made on this legislation and on so many other issues that have been important to the people of Oregon. The people of Oregon and the people of our country do not see these as bipartisan issues. There is not a Democratic approach to preventing school violence and a Republican approach to preventing school violence. I tell our colleagues that the approach Senator Smith and I bring before the U.S. Senate tonight has been supported by those who oppose gun control and those who are for gun control because they see this as commonsense Government that will be good for our students and our families. 
I will close by saying that when the Senate acts tonight, this can be the first concrete step that actually protects students and families when school starts this fall. So we are very grateful to our colleagues for helping us, including our friends Senator Hollings, Senator Gregg, and Senator Leahy, who is not on the floor, and Senator Hatch has been so helpful. Senator Sessions has added an innovative approach with respect to establishing a court supervisory initiative to addressing unlawful juvenile gun use. This is a bipartisan step forward in making our schools safe across this land. 
I yield the floor at this time.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in the nineteenth century, Merriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the western reaches of our expanding country. As they explored my home region of the Pacific Northwest, Lewis and Clark cataloged the mineral and natural resources of the land. In particular, they spoke of a mighty river known to the local inhabitants as Nch'i Wana, the Great River. We know it today as the Columbia River and its importance as a reliable source of water and power to the people of the Pacific Northwest is undeniable. 
When Twentieth Century American explorers embarked on a similar journey to explore the Moon, one of their earliest actions was to bend down to the surface and pick up a rock. That simple movement framed an ancient reflex that underscores the basic imperative to explore our surroundings. Today, I want to recognize the important role played by the earth sciences in expanding our economy, supporting our national goals, and increasing our knowledge of the larger world. 
Modern geophysical research reveals that ours is a dynamic planet. On the Earth's surface, great tectonic plates shift continental positions with terrific force. On the ocean's surface, microscopic plants and animals help regulate global atmospheric gases and serve as the foundation of our planet's food web. In the deep ocean abyss, mysterious and wondrous animal communities thrive in endless darkness by deriving life-sustaining nutrients from active volcanic vents. 
Earth science is a global science that speaks a global language and unites people by promoting sustainable development. The study of earth science provides the skills necessary for locating and utilizing natural resources, understanding natural processes that often conflict with human designs, and comprehending our natural heritage through the unusual perspective of geologic time. The unique panorama of geologic time allows us to observe the full range of natural processes on Earth and aids in developing a comprehensive view of the natural world beyond a perspective limited only to that of human influence. 
In my home state of Oregon, we celebrate the land and respect the power of nature. We have learned to protect our citizens and expand our economy by working with nature and prudently mitigating natural hazards. In consideration of the importance of the earth sciences in the daily lives of all Americans, I submit, for the Record, the resolution issued by the Association of American State Geologists.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before I begin, I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from Delaware, who spent about 2 1/2 hours with a group of us this morning, working to make sure that this legislation got to the floor today. I also want to thank our colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who was equally helpful in our effort to make sure that this bipartisan legislative effort didn't blow up at the last minute. I want to assure my colleagues that it was very close to going by the boards this morning. 
Mr. President, the wheat farmers of the Pacific Northwest are 6 days away from a disaster. On July 15, Pakistan is going to initiate a process to purchase 350,000 metric tons of white wheat for August 1 to 20 shipment. Without access to the Government credit guarantees that we are talking about here, U.S. producers are not going to sell a kernel of wheat to Pakistan. The USDA estimates that Pakistan is going to import just under a million metric tons this year. Now, our prices are at a low. This year's crop is going to be one of the best ever. 
But the fact is, farmers across this country are staring an economic train wreck in the eye. We have a storage and transportation bottleneck with the imminent wheat harvest. We have a fair amount of the old crop still in the bins. We are facing the prospect of storing a great deal of wheat on the ground this year. Making a sale to Pakistan in the key August shipping period would be an enormous help in dealing with these logistical challenges. A sale might mean the difference between two or three turns of a river barge fleet versus only one turn in August. 
Let me touch briefly on what it means to just one county, Umatilla, which I am very pleased that my colleague, Senator Smith, who has worked so effectively with all of us on a bipartisan basis, calls home, and wheat growers there produce nearly one-third of all the wheat produced in our State. The economy of that county depends on both the direct sales of wheat and on all of the related jobs through suppliers, equipment, fertilizers, warehousing, shipping, and all of the economic base of our regional economy. 
The fact is, Mr. President, and colleagues, unilateral sanctions simply do not work. They end up inflicting harm on U.S. producers and shippers. They don't target those specific leaders who are engaged in the most reprehensible activity. They hand market share to our competitors and then put the typical citizen in these countries in a position where they will not be able to secure the humanitarian help they need to survive. Each of these outcomes is not, obviously, a growth of U.S. foreign policy. 
I am of the view that we do a lot of things well in our country. But I think what we do best is we grow things, and, at a critical time when we are seeing the United States in a position to play this leadership role in the global economy, it would be a tragedy to make the mistake of not passing this legislation, which, as far as I can tell, has kept about 15 Members of the U.S. Senate on the floor simply to speak for how important this legislation is. 
We are, in the Pacific Northwest, 6 days away from a disaster. So it is critical now at the 11th hour that this legislation pass. 
I am pleased to have been a part of this bipartisan group that has worked on this legislation over the last few weeks. 
Again, I want to express my thanks to Senator McConnell of Kentucky, and Senator Biden, for their patience through that 2 1/2 -hour exercise this morning that had Sandy Berger of the White House and others involved, because had not Senator McConnell and Senator Biden been so patient this morning, we might not have this bipartisan legislation on the floor this afternoon, and our wheat farmers would not have had the help they need. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, every Member of this body has watched horrified these last few months at the outbreak of gun violence that has struck America's schools. Now, with the new school year just a few weeks away, it is time for this body to respond to America's parents who are frightened for their youngsters and are asking, what can be done to protect their children when they are at school? 
Frankly, a lot of those parents don't believe that this Congress will produce very much. They know there has been considerable acrimony about the whole debate over guns in America. Certainly there are many areas where reasonable people can differ. There are constitutional protections with respect to the right to bear arms, and at the same time we are also concerned about the safety of those youngsters when they are away at school. 
Senator Gordon Smith, my colleague from Oregon, and I believe it is time to set politics aside with respect to this issue of gun violence in our schools. That is why we have teamed up on important legislation which we believe ought to be enacted by the time school starts in the fall. We don't think this is the complete answer to this scourge of school violence, gun violence, that our youngsters face, but we think it can make a real difference. 
We propose this legislation after the tragedy in Springfield, OR. As the Presiding Officer of this body knows, there has been a rash of these violent incidents at our schools. The problems have literally been seen in schools from coast to coast. Senator Smith and I have introduced legislation which I believe would lay out the beginnings of a rational policy to control school violence in America. 
What we have proposed--we did it after consulting with families, law enforcement officials, educators, people who are for gun control, people who are against gun control--we have proposed legislation which would stipulate that when a young person brings a gun to school, that would, in effect, be a five-alarm warning to society. It would make it very clear that at that point there is a real threat to young people, to teachers, and our society. And young people who bring a gun to school, under our legislation, would be detained for up to 72 hours for a comprehensive evaluation, from the standpoint of mental health considerations, law enforcement issues, family questions, the whole gamut of concerns that ought to be looked at when a young person brings a gun to school. 
The alleged killer at Thurston High School, in Springfield, OR, was apprehended at school with a gun the day before he shot more than 20 of his classmates. That day, the police made a decision which is duplicated each day across our Nation, a decision that seemed reasonable at the time. The youngster was released to his parents, parents who were themselves teachers and who were known to be concerned and involved in the lives of their children. Currently, many police departments across America have complete discretion to treat young people caught with a gun at school in the manner they deem appropriate. As Springfield's own police chief has argued, the evaluation that needs to occur in these situations is beyond the means and capacity of most police forces across our country. 
So Senator Smith and I have introduced legislation which would provide an incentive for each State to enact a law requiring a mandatory 72-hour detention for any child caught with a gun at school. If a State passes such a law, it will be eligible for an additional 25 percent in funding under the Juvenile Justice Act. The cost of this legislation is small, perhaps $25 million a year, and certainly modest when you look at the State's overall requirements in the effort to prevent school violence. 
Now, Mr. President, we are not suggesting that this is all that needs to be done. Certainly, though, our first responsibility when a child brings a gun to school is to protect all of the kids who come to that school armed only with their books and their calculators. Children caught with a gun at school ought to be detained for a sufficient period to protect the other children and to evaluate the degree to which they are a threat to themselves and those around them. 
I believe this legislation can win the support of every Member of this body, be enacted in time for the opening of the fall school year 
and should be acted on as soon as possible. Mr. President, Bill Clinton has spoken favorably of this legislation during his visit to Springfield, OR. The Nation's mayors--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives--have spoken favorably of this legislation. I am very hopeful that even though this body has an extremely busy schedule in the weeks ahead, there will be time, on a bipartisan basis, to ensure that this legislation moves forward. 
According to Larry Bentz, principal of Thurston High School in Springfield, OR, the Thurston High community is slowly returning to some semblance of normalcy. The kids are engaged in the traditions of summer--swimming, playing basketball, summer jobs. With the memories of the brutal shooting at the high school seared into their memories, the parents are trying to push ahead and return to family routines and responsibilities. But they want to make sure that this body, and elected officials everywhere, don't forget about the gun violence that has shattered young lives and families in Springfield, OR--and, in fact, in five States over the last school year. Senator Smith and I urge that this body not let that happen. We ought to listen and learn from the lessons of Springfield and commit to doing our part to end school gun violence now as the schools look to opening their doors for a new school year. 
Now, the Thurston community is still processing the tragedy at Thurston High. They are debating a variety of approaches and ideas for reducing school violence. Senator Smith and I don't pretend to have all of the answers, but we know there are some practical steps that the U.S. Senate can take, and take promptly, to make our schools safer in America. 
There are other steps that need to be taken, Mr. President. We have to make certain that communities have the resources to evaluate kids in trouble. I heard again and again, as I visited with families in Springfield, from hard-working, middle-class families, that they simply could not get any help until their youngster was violent. That is just not acceptable in America, Mr. President. It is not right to say that there will be no response until a young person is actually violent. We have to get there early. We have to get there with preventive strategies. 
Senator Smith and I hope to be back before the U.S. Senate with other constructive approaches in the days ahead. But let us make a strong beginning, Mr. President. Let us make a strong effort in the U.S. Senate to take the first step to averting further school tragedies. In Oregon alone, young people were apprehended with guns at school 100 times in the last school year--and those were simply the ones who were caught. So as our country goes about the business of the pleasures of summer, and as the U.S. Senate deals with what we know is going to be a very hectic schedule over the next few weeks, let's not forget about what happened in Springfield, OR, in Kentucky, in Arkansas and in Mississippi. Let us remember that our young people will be back in school in just a few weeks. Let us do our part to make sure that school violence ends here. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the past two weeks I have been working with Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Biden and others to reach an agreement so that the legislation reauthorizing the office of the so-called Drug Czar, H.R. 2610, can move forward. I do not object to the reauthorization, but have been prevented from offering an amendment to the measure and will not give my consent to adoption of the Drug Czar bill until we have reached agreement on my amendment. The amendment I wish to offer is bipartisan legislation Senator Gordon Smith and I have sponsored in response to the gun violence that struck Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon. The bill, S. 2169, would provide an incentive for states to enact a 72-hour holding period for students that bring guns to schools so that the students who bring guns to school may be fully and thoroughly evaluated by professionals. The President has endorsed our proposal, and it is my hope that we can reach a consensus that allows the Senate to pass both the Drug Czar measure and the Wyden-Smith bill.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for nearly two years, my home state has suffered through an agonizing process, trying to find out what happened aboard King-56, an Air Force Reserves C-130 that crashed off of the California coast, killing 10 of the 11 Oregon airmen on board in November, 1996. The families of those victims have worked tirelessly to find out the truth, both for their own peace-of-mind and so that corrections could be made, if necessary, to protect other American servicepeople. It should not have been nearly as hard as it has been to get this information. 
Drawing from this experience, my Oregon colleague Senator Smith and I have joined together to put forward this proposal to try to change the procedures that the Air Force uses for investigating crashes of this sort, so that others will be spared the suffering that Oregonians have had to ensure. 
At the outset, let me acknowledge the hard work of the Air Force since reopening the King-56 investigation late last year. For many months now, a Broad Area Review, or simply BAR, to use the military acronym, has been both investigating the cause of the King-56 crash and the safety of the entire C-130 fleet. The BAR, after thoroughly re-checking all available material, and having the help of an experienced NTSB crash investigator, was able to narrow down the list of possible causes of the crash to about two dozen, and determined that the only way to pinpoint the cause would be to recover additional King-56 wreckage. The Air Force candidly admitted that they were mistaken not to have collected all the wreckage in the first place, and that they would do everything they could this time to get it right. They are out in the ocean right now trying to salvage everything they can. I know that the families are eagerly awaiting the results of the new salvage operation, and, hopefully, the Air Force will soon learn the exact cause of the crash, and give the families some sense of closure. 
Finding the exact cause of the King-56 crash has another, very important purpose. Crews flying other C-130's have frequently reported problems similar to what the Oregon reservists encountered on their airplanes. The BAR has been able to apply the lessons learned from the King-56 crash to the entire fleet. For example, a major problem the BAR turned up was the near total inconsistency in emergency procedures manuals issued to crews. The Air Force identified this problem, standardized and rewrote the manuals, and issued them to all C-130 crews. 
And thank goodness they did. Because earlier this year a C-130 took off from McChord Air Force Base in Washington state and experienced an engine problem known as `four-engine rollback,' or loss of power to the engines. The C-130 that went down off the California coast also had simultaneous failure of all four engines. In that instance the emergency manual listed as an option ditching the plane in the ocean, which turned out to be a tragic error, and only one crewman survived. However, the C-130 that took off from McChord had a newly revised emergency manual on board written after the BAR review. They were able to bring their plane under control and land it safely. So I am pleased the Air Force found and fixed such problems, making these planes safer. 
Although this is welcome progress, nagging questions keep coming to mind. Why did the original investigation not make as much progress in finding the cause of the accident? Why did the Air Force turn up the numerous flaws and problems in safety procedures in the C-130 fleet only after two Senators stepped in to get them to conduct a more thorough review? The plain fact is that the problems with the original investigation were not an isolated incident. The failure of the original investigation was a symptom of the shortcomings of current investigation procedures and guidelines in general. 
We need an aviation accident investigation process that would have gotten it right the first time around. Reports indicate that Pentagon crash investigators are undertrained and under funded. I question whether the current system of conducting two separate investigations, one public, the other secret, is the best system possible for finding the causes of accidents and applying the lessons learned. 
So what the Wyden/Smith amendment does is simple and straightforward. It establishes a Pentagon task force to review procedures the Department of Defense employs to conduct aircraft accident investigations and to develop solutions for improving the overall process. I give the Pentagon credit for their renewed diligence on the King-56 investigation and their review of the C-130 fleet. It is my hope--and expectation--that they apply this diligence to coming up with ways to improve the overall process, and make the planes our men and women in uniform fly every day safer. 
Our amendment also touches on how families are notified of such terrible accidents and of the care and support they receive. The reason the Oregon families first came to Senator Smith and me was because, after losing their loved ones, the Air Force treated them miserably, there's no better way to put it. Not only did the Air Force not provide the families with the support, guidance, and comfort that they deserved, but they refused to provide the answer that would have surely been at the top of any of our minds had we lost a loved one: how could this possibly have happened? Their treatment was far inferior to the way Congress recently mandated families be treated in civilian aviation accidents. 
What the families of King-56 got was a totally inconclusive investigation report. When they wanted more information, especially what was contained in the separate, secret safety report, the Air Force refused outright. Senator Smith and I tried to help them obtain the answers they needed, but we, too, were met with more stonewalling. After we brought significant pressure to bear, the Air Force decided to reopen the probe. Since then they have done a better job of keeping the families fully informed of the progress of their investigation. 
The King-56 episode turned up a number of basic problems with the way the Pentagon notifies families in such terrible cases. Working closely with the families, Senator Smith and I passed amendments to last year's defense bill that have led to improvements in family notification procedures. For example, earlier this year the Air Force issued instructions to improve the flow of information to families, to enhance the role of family liaison officers, and to establish an Office of Family Assistance. DoD efforts to improve family notification are still ongoing, and I intend to watch their progress closely in case further action is needed in Congress. 
Although I welcome this progress, one basic issue has been left out of the mix, namely, the problem of providing families with maximum information not only after an investigation has been concluded, but, more importantly, while the investigation is taking place in the weeks and months after an accident. The Air Force has proposed to do a better job of informing families about how investigations are conducted and even why they can't have any information immediately. While attempts to provide better information are helpful, current efforts just don't get at one of the biggest headaches the Oregon families encountered: knowing what the investigators know. 
The Wyden/Smith amendment, in addition to requiring DoD to come up with improvements in accident investigations, gets at this problem. We require the Pentagon to provide next of kin with regular and timely interim reports on the progress of both legal and safety investigations, providing them with the best possible information during what must be a most agonizing ordeal. Better information about ongoing investigations is just one part of what families need, and it is my hope that future families will not have to endure what the Oregon families were forced to. Again, I think the DoD learned its lesson about how to treat families, especially after the DoD Inspector General scrutinized it as a result of our amendment last year, and they are actively working on solutions. But the specific need for interim reports needs to be addressed as well. 
I'd like to thank the Air Force again for their diligence in reopening the King-56 crash investigation and helping the families reach closure on this terrible episode. I am pleased by the progress the Pentagon has made in improving C-130 fleet safety, and by the measures they've taken to treat families better in the future. It's time to apply the lessons learned from King-56 to all accident investigations, and I look forward to working with the Pentagon in the future to make sure our men and women in uniform fly the safest airplanes possible, and that their families receive the best possible care and attention, in good times as well as the bad.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, fewer than 50 legislative days remain in the session. Dozens of nominations are pending and more than 400 items are on the calender. Being an election year, this is a recipe for an explosion of an extraordinarily powerful Senate practice. . . the use of secret holds. 
On Monday evening, Senator Grassley and I came to the floor to put members on notice that we would be offering the same amendment we offered last year on anonymous holds. We discussed the Century-old Senate tradition of members being granted the courtesy of `holding' a debate until they are available to participate. We believe this venerable Senate practice should continue. As a public institution, however, we believe the use of holds should occur in the full light of day. We believe in the not-so-radical notion that the public's business should be done in public. 
The amendment we are offering is identical to an amendment that the Senate adopted last Fall. The amendment would eliminate the secrecy of the Senate's holds procedure. It would simply require that any Senator who notifies leadership of an intent to object to a motion to proceed make that objection public within 48 hours. 
Last fall, the Senate adopted an identical amendment by voice vote. No Senator spoke out against it. We had discussed this idea for more than a year. But in the closing hours of the last session, our amendment was dropped from the D.C. Appropriations bill. At that time I vowed to stay at it until it's done. 
Today, as time is running out on the session, we are sure to face the same situation again of a proliferation of anonymous holds. They will threaten the Senate with legislative gridlock. When the Senate dropped our amendment last Fall, there were at least 42 holds in play, and even the Minority Leader had to admit to reporters that he didn't know who had placed them. `If you don't have hold, you ought to feel lonesome,' Senator Daschle said. 
Over the past eight months, we have been working in a bipartisan manner to lift the secrecy that so often surrounds the use of holds. We have worked with the Leader's Bipartisan Task Force on Senate Reform. In February, nine Senators joined Senator Grassley and me in a bipartisan letter to the Senate leadership asking that they work with us to change the Standing Orders of the Senate to eliminate anonymous holds. We made it clear we are not out to scrap the Senate's holds procedure, but to scrap the secrecy surrounding it. 
In May, the Bipartisan Task Force on Senate Reform, chaired by Senator Bennett, reviewed this idea and discussed it with the floor staff of both parties. The members expressed great interest in it, but it was clear from our discussions that certain members in key positions would not look favorably on the task force moving forward with the idea. 
The right of every member of this body to prevent debate on a motion or bill is a very powerful tool. But this right can be found nowhere in the Constitution, nowhere in our Federal statutes and nowhere in the Senate's rules. In fact, it is not a Senate rule or standing order. It is not a right. It is a practice, or a custom that we have come to view as a right. 
Let me be clear: our amendment does not challenge or affect in any way the ability of each Senator to place a hold. Our amendment would preserve that ability. What we are challenging is the way in which Senators use this extraordinary power. Such extraordinary power should be exercised in public. 
The use of secret holds leads to a curious game of procedural `hide and seek.' Senator A, for example, blocks Senator B's bill with a hold, so B sets off to buttonhole all 99 other Senators, trying to find out who is responsible. If the Senator does find out, it is possible B will place a hold on A's bills in retaliation. Sometimes it becomes even more complex, with `revolving holds,' where the group of objecting Senators simply rotates the hold, always one step ahead of the Senator chasing down the hold to try to move a bill. Another session should not become bogged down with burdensome, anonymous holds. 
The Senate is a public institution. Our offices are open to the public, we conduct our hearings in public, our debate takes place in public and each time we answer the roll call, everyone knows how each Senator voted. But many of our holds are not public. We believe the public's business should be conducted in public. 
At a time when the American people are increasingly cynical and skeptical about government, there should no longer be any room for the kind of closed-door dealings represented by the secret hold. The secret hold cheapens the currency of democracy. We should open the door on this closet filibuster. 
Mr. President, our amendment provides that every Senator may continue to place a hold on a measure or matter, and simply requires that the Senator announce the hold publicly within 48 hours. Our amendment enables the Senate both to maintain its proud traditions and to have openness and accountability.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last year's balanced budget agreement contained provisions to make Medicare more efficient by moving away from wasteful practices that the private sector long ago consigned to history, while offering seniors in Oregon and other states more and better choices for their health care service. The bipartisan bill Senator Smith and I are introducing today will make sure that those provisions are implemented in a way that will indeed bring about the full potential of these reforms. 
The Medicare+Choice Payment Equity Act of 1998 will finish what we started with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by creating payment equity under Medicare's formula for paying for managed care services . Without equity in payment, beneficiaries in Oregon could be penalized because they may never get the same kinds of services in their Medicare managed care package that are available in other areas of the country with less efficient health care systems. 
For states like Oregon with cost efficient health care systems, the Medicare formula resulted in lower payment. While we made progress in correcting this inequity through the Balanced Budget Act, changes made at the last minute in the legislation will actually prevent efficient states from ever gaining full equity in payment under Medicare managed care plans. 
This legislation corrects that by requiring full funding of what is known as the `blend' portion of the formula. With managed care taking a larger role in Medicare it is more important now to assure equity in the payment formula. This legislation is supported by the Fairness Coalition and the American Hospital Association. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed for the Record.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I join together with Senator Frist and ten other colleagues today to introduce bipartisan education reform legislation, based on a simple proposition: the federal government should liberate schools from the federal government's mandated bureaucratic water torture in return for schools committing to improve student performance. This bill is an invitation to innovation, an opportunity to develop home grown, locally driven solutions to Americans biggest education challenges. 
This legislation would empower states to get out from under burdensome federal education regulations, by expanding the enormously popular `Ed-Flex' demonstration program--in which 12 states already participate--into a nationwide effort. Ed-Flex is the program that allows states to waive out of certain federal regulations if they come up with a plan to show how they can do a better job. A State has to waive their own set of education regulations, develop high academic standards for their students and hold schools accountable for results. 
Here is a brief example of how Ed-Flex works: In the past, federal funds have allowed schools to purchase computers for students with disabilities, but the rules prevented others from using the equipment when the students weren't using it. So in an Oregon school district, in return for committing to using the idle computers to improve adult education, the State got a waiver to use the computer for this extra use as well as for the disabled students. 
Ohio uses a teacher training program that, without a waiver, can only be used to train teachers in math and science. Ohio wanted to use it where the greatest academic need is. They now have an Ed-Flex waiver and can tailor their teacher training program to the needs of the students, not to the needs of the federal government. In exchange, Ohio will have better prepared teachers in the classroom to help students improve in those areas. 
My state also uses Ed-Flex to allow school districts to team up with community colleges to better prepare kids to go into the workforce. Using the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act program, Oregon students can earn college credit or learn a practical skill without worrying about whether a credit will transfer or if they have to file several different pieces of paperwork. 
And even more kids will be able to benefit if we can expand Ed-Flex to allow school districts to streamline bureaucracies even further and eliminate waste. The bill Senator Frist and I are introducing today will expand Ed-Flex from a pilot program in just a few states to every place from Maine to Honolulu. The bill will also provide a unique opportunity for current Ed-Flex states to experience more flexibility in their adult literacy and educational technology programs. 
Let me give you an example of how the new flexibility will benefit my state. According to the National Adult Literacy Survey, Oregon has one of the highest literacy levels in the country. In fact, 75 percent of Oregonians have basic reading skills; that is, they can proficiently read, write and speak in English, whereas 55 percent of all adults in the nation achieved that level. Yet, for Oregonians, less than 100 percent is not good enough. We want all of our adults to have basic literacy skills. Under the Adult Education Act, a State can only use 20 percent of the funds to prepare people to make high school equivalency tests. That may work for a state that has a very low literacy level, but it does not work for Oregon. 
Oregon would like to develop a waiver to use the funds to help all illiterate or semi-literate adults earn a GED (general education development) or other high school equivalency measure. The more people with a GED, the more valuable our workforce becomes. Under our Ed-Flex bill, Oregon would be eligible to apply for that waiver. 
Mr. President, this bill grows out of the work of the Senate Budget Committee's Education Task Force, which Senator Frist chaired, and on which I served. Together, in hearing after hearing, we listened to States tell us that they can do a better job. They said they could balance flexibility and accountability and they we ready to be judged by results, not process. We know as well that Ed-Flex has strong support from the Administration, and our bill has strong bipartisan support in the Senate and from the National Governors Association. 
Oregon was the first state to participate in Ed-Flex, and people in Oregon are convinced that regulatory flexibility and school accountability work. It is time to expand that approach nationwide.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to encourage the Department of Energy to involve the State of Oregon in decisions about the cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This amendment is needed to protect Oregonians from the unusual and highly dangerous hazards that the Hanford Nuclear Reservation poses for the people of Oregon. 
This amendment should be familiar to many members of the Senate because a version of this legislation previously passed the Senate as an amendment to the FY97 Defense Authorization Bill. 
Mr. President, there is no other contaminated Federal property in the country that has caused the serious injuries to residents of another State that Hanford has already caused to citizens of Oregon. And no other Federal site currently poses anywhere near as serious a threat to the health and safety of citizens of another State as Hanford does to our citizens. 
Because of this special situation, the State of Oregon needs to be involved in decisions about how DOE proposes to clean up the Hanford site. 
I want to make clear that recognizing the unique conditions present at Hanford and the immediate danger they pose for Oregonians does not set a precedent for other Federal facilities besides Hanford. It will not turn every military base with a leaking gasoline tank into a multi-state cleanup issue. 
Let me put to rest any concern that this amendment will be misconstrued in that way. First, there is simply no facility in this country--Federal or non-Federal--that compares to Hanford. In fact, Hanford is generally considered to be the most contaminated site in the Western hemisphere. You would have to go to the former Soviet Union to find a site as polluted as Hanford. 
The extent of the environmental problems are mind boggling: 
Over the years, 200 billion gallons of toxic and radioactive liquids from nuclear weapons production were dumped at the site. That's enough to cover Manhattan to a depth of 40 feet. 
The Hanford site currently contains 56 million gallons of high-level radioactive wastes in 177 tanks. Some of these tanks are as big as the Capitol Dome. At least 54 of these tanks are known or suspected to be leaking or pose risks of explosion. 
The site also is currently storing 2,300 metric tons of high-level nuclear fuel rods in leaking basins located only a quarter mile from the Columbia River. 
And these are just a few of the problems that we know about. 
Second, there is also no other site in the country that has affected the health and safety of residents in another state the way Hanford has affected the citizens of Oregon. 
Oregonians living downwind from Hanford have suffered from thyroid cancers and other medical problems caused by airborne releases of radioactive iodine. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing through the 1950s, these releases average between 100 and 2,000 curies per month. To put that into perspective, the residents around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania were evacuated in 1979 when the Three Mile Island accident released 15-24 curies into the Pennsylvania countryside. 
The airborne releases from Hanford were 10 to 100 times what were released from Three Mile Island, and these releases were occurring every month! Ongoing epidemiological studies have linked these releases to increased cases of thyroid cancer and other adverse health effects on Oregonians living near the site. Children drinking milk from farms in the area were the ones most harmed by these releases. 
Hanford also poses a serious health threat to the more than 1 million Oregonians who live downstream from the site. Radioactive materials have been released into the Columbia River when water from the River was pumped through the sites nuclear reactors to cool them. Other hazardous and radioactive materials that were dumped at the site have and are continuing to seep into the River. A General Accounting Office report I released earlier this year documents that 900,000 gallons of radioactive wastes have leaked out of the Hanford tanks, contaminated the groundwater and this contaminated water is now heading toward the Columbia River. 
The bottom line is many Oregonians are suffering adverse health effects from living near Hanford. And many more are at risk of future harm because of conditions at the site. 
Finally, my amendment does not set a precedent for Federal facilities nationwide because it only encourages the Energy Department to continue existing efforts to involve Oregon in cleanup decisions. There is already in effect a Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Oregon and the Department of Energy concerning Oregon's participation in decisions about Hanford cleanup. The linkage to this agreement puts the site into a special category of Federal facility cleanups. It draws a bright line that divide Hanford from the hundreds of other contaminated Federal facilities around the country. 
The unique factors involved in the Hanford cleanup justify granting the State of Oregon a greater role in decisions about clean up of the Hanford site. 
I urge my colleagues to recognize how Hanford has harmed and continue to pose a serious hazard to the people of Oregon by giving our State the opportunity to play a greater role in cleanup decisions at the site.

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, only 52 legislative days remain in this session. Dozens of nominations are pending, and more than 400 items are on the calendar. Being an election year, this is a recipe for the explosion of a little-known procedure, but one that is extraordinarily important as the Senate moves to the end of the session. I speak today about the issue of secret holds on nominations and legislation before this body. 
Nowhere in the Constitution nor in our Federal statutes is there any mention of the right of a U.S. Senator to put a secret hold on a bill or a nomination. Nevertheless, this power is one of the two or three most significant powers that a Member of the U.S. Senate can have. In effect, this power allows any Member of the U.S. Senate, in secret, to block a nomination or a piece of legislation from even being considered on the floor of this body. 
I have talked to citizens at home about this. They are stunned that any Member of the U.S. Senate would have the power to be able to block something. But what really galls them is the right to do it in secret without there being any accountability whatsoever. 
I am of the view that it is appropriate that Members of the U.S. Senate, in efforts to represent our constituents, have the power to make decisions that are going to affect dramatically the lives of millions of Americans. But I think that extraordinary power ought to be accompanied by real responsibility. Certainly if one Member of the U.S. Senate is going to block this body from even considering a bill or a nomination, it should be accompanied by public disclosure. 
Our friend, Senator Grassley, has come on to the floor. The Presiding Officer and our colleagues know that for more than a year he and I have been trying to bring some sunshine to the U.S. Senate. We have been trying to change the rules so that if a Member does singlehandedly seek to block a nomination or a bill from coming to this floor, they would be required, as part of the Standing Order of the Senate, to stipulate in the Congressional Record that they were, in fact, that individual. 
We are moving to that part of the legislative session where the secret hold is most abused. Very shortly, in this body we will begin a game that I call legislative hide and seek. We will have holds on nominations and bills. Outside this Capitol Building there will be lobbyists trying to figure out who has put a secret hold on a particular bill or nomination. And this entire process contributes to the cynicism and skepticism that so many Americans have about our government today. 
Madam President and colleagues, it came to light in the fall of 1997--which, as we all know, wasn't an election year--that there were 42 holds in play at one time. As I mentioned, this game of legislative hide and seek was underway outside these Chambers. 
At that time, Senator Grassley and I were able to win on a voice vote an amendment to change the Senate's Standing Orders to require public disclosure of a hold. But then, in what was really the ultimate irony, our effort to end secret holds was secretly killed in a conference committee and vanished when the D.C. appropriations bill was brought back before the Senate. 
I hope now with just over 50 legislative days remaining, that the Senate would on a bipartisan basis change this particular longstanding tradition--a tradition noted nowhere in the Constitution, our Federal statutes or Senate rules--and bring some openness and some sunshine to this body. 
The hold started out as simply an effort to try to accommodate our colleagues. If a Member of the U.S. Senate had a spouse who was ill or a relative who faced a particular problem, they could, on a Monday, say, `I can't be there on Tuesday, would it be possible to hold things over for a couple of days so I could address a matter that was important to my constituents?' 
That is not what Senator Grassley and I are talking about. We are not talking about the right of a Senator to be present to discuss an issue important to them and to their constituents. We are talking about making sure that when a Member of the U.S. Senate digs in and digs in to block a particular nomination or a bill from either coming to the floor or ever being considered at all, that at that point they would be required to disclose publicly that they are the individual who is blocking consideration by the Senate. 
Under our amendment no Member of the U.S. Senate would lose their power to place a hold on a bill. A Senator's power would be absolutely unchanged with respect to the right to place a hold on legislation. All that Senator Grassley and I are saying is when you put on that hold, be straight with the American people. Let the Senate and let the American people know that you are the person who feels strongly about a particular issue. Make sure that it is possible, then, for us to find out where in the discussion of a particular nomination or piece of legislation the Senate is considering there is a problem. This has not been the case, and this situation is getting increasingly serious. 
In the two years since I have been here I have seen more and more abuse of this process. We are seeing in a number of instances that even the Senators themselves don't know that a hold is being placed in their name. I have had Senators come to me and say, `I learned that one of my staff'--or someone else's staff--`put a hold on a bill,' and the Senator I was working with didn't even know that a hold had been placed on the legislation. 
This ought to be an easy reform for the U.S. Senate. It simply would require openness, public disclosure, and an opportunity for every Member of the Senate and for the American people to know who, in fact, feels sufficiently strongly about that bill, that they are the one keeping this body from considering it. 
A number of public interest organizations and opinion leaders have come out in favor of the effort being pursued by myself and Senator Grassley. I will close my opening remarks and then yield my time to Senator Grassley, with just a quick statement from a Washington Post editorial that came out in favor of this effort. 
The Washington Post said:  
It's time members of the Senate stand up and answer to each other and the public for such actions. What are they scared of? 
That, Madam President, is what this issue is all about. It doesn't pass the smell test to keep this information from the American people. There is not a town meeting in our country where it is possible for a Member of the U.S. Senate to say, `I'm involved in making decisions that affect millions of people and billions of dollars, but you know, I'm not going to tell you anything about it. I'm not going to let you in on this particular procedure.' 
Again, this is a procedure that has evolved over the years, that is written down nowhere, not in the rules, not in the statutes, and not even in the Constitution. 
Madam President, it is time to ensure that when Senators exercise the extraordinary powers that we are accorded in the Constitution and the laws of our land, that those powers be met with responsibility, powers that make it clear that when there is legislation affecting billions of dollars and countless Americans that we are going to let the public in on the way the Senate does its business. 
Senator Grassley and I filed our amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. It is our intention to bring this bipartisan amendment before the Senate at the earliest opportunity. We want to make it very clear that between now and the fall, when we are likely to have 60, 70, 80 secret holds and this game of hide and seek is being played all over the Capitol, Senator Grassley and I want to have the Senate rules changed so that the public will know at the end of a session how and when these important decisions are being made. 
Before I conclude, let me just say to my colleague from Iowa, who has joined us on the floor to speak after me this afternoon, I have enjoyed working with him on many issues. I serve on the Senate Aging Committee, which he so ably Chairs, but I am particularly appreciative of the chance to work with him on this issue. We have had a bipartisan team pursuing this matter for many, many months. We want it understood that there is absolutely nothing partisan, nothing Democrat, nothing Republican, about our desire to bring real openness and accountability to the U.S. Senate. This isn't about partisan politics. This is about good government. This is about making sure that in the last days of a Senate session we are no longer playing legislative hide and seek, but are making decisions in a way that we are accountable to the public, and that the American people can follow. We want to contribute to confidence in the way the Senate does its business, rather than to what we face today, which is additional skepticism and cynicism by virtue of the fact that the Senate does so much business at the end of a session in secret. 
I thank my colleague from Iowa, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, twenty-five years after enactment of the Clean Water Act, we still have not achieved the law's original goal that all our nation's lakes, rivers and streams would be safe for fishing and swimming. 
After 25 years, it's time for the next generation of strategies to solve our remaining water quality problems. We need to give States new tools to overcome the new water quality challenges they are now facing. 
The money that has been invested in controlling water pollution from factories and upgrading sewage treatment plants has gone a long way to controlling these urban pollution sources. In most cases, the remaining water quality problems are no longer caused by pollution spewing out of factory pipes. Instead, they are caused by runoff from a myriad of sources ranging from farm fields to city streets and parking lots. 
In my home State of Oregon, more than half of our streams don't fully meet water quality standards. And the largest problems are contamination from runoff and meeting the standards for water temperature. 
In many cases, conventional approaches will not solve these problems. But we can achieve water temperature standards and obtain other water quality benefits by enhancing stream flows and improving runoff controls. 
A major problem for many streams in Oregon and in many other areas of the Western United States is that water supplies are fully appropriated or over-appropriated. There is currently no extra water to spare for increased stream flows. 
We can't create a new water to fill the gap. But we can make more water available for this use through increased water conservation and more efficient use of existing water supplies. 
The key to achieving this would be to create incentives to reduce wasteful water use. 
In the Western United States, irrigated agriculture is the single largest user of water. Studies indicate that substantial quantities of water diverted for irrigation do not make it to the fields, with a significant portion lost to evaporation or leakage from irrigation canals. 
In Oregon and other States that recognize rights to conserved water for those who conserve it, irrigators and other water users could gain rights to use conserved water while also increasing the amount of water available for other uses by implementing conservation and efficiency measures to reduce water loss. 
The Federal government can play a role in helping meet our nation's changing water needs. In many Western States, water supply problems can be addressed by providing financial incentives to help water users implement cost effective water conservation and efficiency measures consistent with State water law. 
And, we can improve water quality throughout the nation by giving greater flexibility to States to use Clean Water Act funds to control polluted runoff, if that's where the money is needed most. 
Today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Burns, in introducing legislation to authorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program to provide loans to water users to fund conservation measures or runoff controls. States would be authorized, but not required, to use their SRF funds for these purposes. Participation by water users, farmers, ranchers and other eligible loan recipients would also be entirely voluntary. 
The conservation program would be structured to allow participating users to receive a share of the water saved through conservation or more efficient use, which they could use in accordance with State law. This type of approach would create a win/win situation with more water available for both the conservers and for instream flows. And, by using the SRF program, the Federal seed money would be repaid over time and gradually become available to fund conservation or other measures to solve water quality problems in other areas. 
My proposal has the support of the Farm Bureau, Oregon water users, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Oregon Water Trust. 
I urge my colleagues to support giving States greater flexibility to use their Clean Water funds for water conservation or runoff control when the State decides that is the best way to solve water quality problems and the water users voluntarily agree to participate.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, around this building now there is that army of high-priced tobacco lobbyists who are getting ready to celebrate tonight. It looks like the tobacco industry is going to win a big round in this fight. The children lose. The powerful will beat out the powerless. 
But this fight is going to have other rounds. And to those who think that the Senators who are trying to protect the kids are going to give up today, I ask, `What are you smoking?' The health of millions of our kids is worth a long, hot summer of debate in this Capitol. Get ready for it, folks.

Mr. WYDEN. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked side-by-side with Senators Burns, Ashcroft, Leahy and others on the critical issue of encryption. Our common goal has been to craft a policy that puts the United States squarely out front of the crypto-curve, rather than locks us permanently behind it. A one-size-fits-all government policy simply won't work in this digital era. We all recognize and acknowledge the legitimate needs of law enforcement and the national security communities, but tying the hands of America's high technology industry in the process will serve neither those needs, nor the national interest in maintaining our competitive edge in the fiercely competitive global marketplace. It's time to move forward with comprehensive encryption reform legislation.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I believe it is very clear that the tobacco industry and their allies will pull out all of the stops to kill legislation that protects our children. It is very clear how the tobacco industry hopes to bring about this legislation's demise. The tobacco lobbyists want to produce a death by distraction. It is very easy to see why the tobacco lobbyists are pursuing this strategy. They cannot derail our cause of protecting children from starting to smoke on the merits. The case for passing legislation to protect our kids is too powerful. It is too strong. It is too moral. 
So the tobacco lobby hopes to throw everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into this debate, hope that it doesn't stink the place up too much, and then hope that the American people lose sight of what this is really all about. But the fact is that the American people get it. They know that this is about protecting children. They are not going to fall for this strategy of trying to produce enough distraction that somehow the Senate will have to move on to other issues or somehow some other question will have to be addressed on this floor. I believe that allowing this bill to die by all of these distractions would be one of the most shocking abdications of our public responsibilities that has been seen in years. 
If this body stays focused on the goal of protecting children, works through the relevant amendments, and passes this important legislation, this Congress would have a lasting legacy of accomplishment in the cause of keeping our children healthy in the 21st century. 
There are a variety of legitimate issues that have come up in this debate. The question of education policy, of income taxes, a whole host of questions. 
I happen to agree with a number of our colleagues on the other side who want to make it tough, for example, to raise taxes. I am one of the Democrats who voted to do that. But this is not the proper bill on which to have a debate about tax policy. This is not the proper vehicle to have a comprehensive discussion about tax reform. This is about tobacco. 
I see our friend and colleague, Senator Ford. He and I serve on the Commerce Committee. We produced a bill that came out of committee by 19 to 1 because we stayed focused on the relevant issues. We didn't always agree. 
I have enormous respect for Senator Ford. He has done yeoman's work on the question of making sure our farmers get a fair shake. He knows I feel strongly on key issues: for example, making sure that these tobacco companies don't pay for a settlement in this country by targeting youngsters around the globe. But together, and with our colleague, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, we produced what we think is a fair package. There can be further discussion of those issues. But we stayed focused on the question of tobacco. We didn't raise a whole host of other issues that are important to both of us. We stayed focused on the cause of trying to protect children, recognizing that we would have further discussion of that subject here on the floor. But we stayed focused on the topic at hand. 
The fight to stop the cigarette industry from marketing to children did not begin this year. But this is the year we have an opportunity to make real progress. I was a Member of the other body and participated in the hearings held by then-Chairman Henry Waxman. The tobacco executives told me under oath that nicotine isn't addictive. The American people didn't believe them. The Surgeon General of the last 20 years didn't believe them. As a result of that hearing, and the documents that have come out over these many years, we have been in a position to make great progress--progress, for example, that lead to that 19-to-1 vote in the Senate Commerce Committee. 
So this debate is the culmination of years of work by those who have been trying to promote the cause of better health for the children in our Nation. We are trying to do it in a way that is going to help kids around the world be healthier. For the first time, we are going to say that you have to protect kids in Oregon and in Texas, and across this country. But we are going to get the Government out of the business of trying to help these tobacco companies sell cigarettes overseas to hook kids in Bangkok and Bangladesh. 
That is important. But we are up against tremendous lobbying. The tobacco companies have spent millions. Maybe what we need is a `Million Child March' on Washington, DC, with families, with health professionals, to show that we are not going to be derailed by these lobbyists. These lobbyists are not going to be allowed to derail the cause of public health in this body. We are going to come back again and again and again in the days ahead. 
So this issue is focused on what really counts; that is, protecting children. There is not going to be a death by distraction. There is not going to be a precipitous and unfortunate demise for this bill by virtue of so many other issues coming up and being debated on this floor. We are going to stay focused. 
Mr. President, I know of the good work that you have done on this issue. We have fought together on a bipartisan basis to try to protect children in our State. I am looking forward to seeing the kind of spirit that you and I have brought to this issue come to this body as a whole to make sure that we stay focused on the issue of protecting children. 
I yield my time, Mr. President.

Mr. WYDEN. 
 Mr. President, these tragic incidents involving students bringing guns to school have taught us that we must proceed on two tracks. Government's first responsibility is to protect our citizens, particularly our young people, from violence. The only way to do that when a student brings a gun to school is to get them out of the classroom, off the streets, and in front of someone who is in the best position to determine what steps to take. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Gordon Smith will help that happen. 
Mr. President, all over my state people are calling out for help. The Springfield Chief of Police and the Governor both recognize that the way we currently deal with kids and guns is not working. These kids are slipping through the cracks--only to resurface in deadly and dangerous ways. Mr. President, our current policies are not working. They are not serving anyone. Simply put, when it comes to kids bringing guns to school, we can and must do a better job. We must stop the violence before it spreads across one more school yard. The memorial fence at Thurston High School is the last memorial fence I ever want to see--in Springfield, Oregon, in Pearl Mississippi, in Jonesboro, Arkansas--or anywhere else in the country. Let it end here. 
Today, Senator Smith and I are introducing legislation that encourages states to pass laws to require a student who brings a gun to school to be held for up to 72 hours and undergo a psychological evaluation. If a state adopts such a law, the state would be eligible for an increase of 25% in the Juvenile Justice funds that would enable it to provide the type of psychological evaluation and other treatment that such a student needs. 
Bringing a gun to school is a warning sign that must be taken seriously. And while so-called `zero tolerance policies' that mandate a student be expelled for bringing a gun to school may adequately punish the behavior, they are clearly not enough. We must offer services to this student--see what is going on in that student's head and help them through the rough spots. We must find a balance between preventing these crimes from occurring and punishing them once they do. 
Voters in Oregon are tough on juvenile crime, especially serious crimes. We have the minimum sentences. We have the prisons. We do not allow juveniles probation or parole. We do not release juveniles early for good behavior. What Oregon needs is a system that works from the beginning--when the warning signs appear, not just at the end, when harm has been done. Oregon needs resources to identify these kids and help them before there's an arrest to be made. Across the country the message is spoken loud and clear: punishment, while important, is only part of the solution. It does not save lives. Prevention does. 
Mr. President, my bill will help communities better identify and service students at-risk of endangering themselves or others with a firearm. My bill gives everyone involved--teachers, public school administrators, law enforcement, police officers and juvenile justice professions--the tools they need to get a troubled student the help he or she needs. Under the State laws my bill would promote, when a student brings a gun to school, the public school must report this behavior to law enforcement and the juvenile authorities immediately. Police must then come to the school and determine if there is probable cause to take action. If there is cause to take action, the police must bring the student into the station for two purposes: first, the student must have a mental health professional give him or her a psychological evaluation, and second, the student must immediately be scheduled for a judicial hearing. The State has up to 72 hours to complete these intervention measures. States pass a law following these parameters will receive a significant bonus: they will receive 25 percent more money to spend on juvenile prevention and intervention services.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, the single most important step this Congress can take to protect our youngsters from the tobacco companies that prey on them is to hold each of those companies individually accountable. And that is what the look-back legislation does that is now before the Senate. 
I would like to spend just a few minutes talking about why this is such a critically important amendment in terms of protecting our children. 
History shows, and shows very clearly, that each time the Congress tried to rein in the tobacco companies in the past, the tobacco companies would use their enormous marketing, entrepreneurial and public relations skills to get around those efforts. So this amendment offered by our colleagues, Senators Durbin, DeWine, myself, and others, provides an opportunity to literally reverse the course of history. 
Previous efforts were always evaded by the tobacco companies. They were able to get around efforts to restrict electronic advertising; they were able to get around the early warning labels that were passed by the Congress. When our colleague on the other side of the Congress, the late Mike Synar, passed legislation to ensure that the States would take strong action to enforce the antisales laws to minors, the tobacco companies got around that. And the reason is that past policies never provided a way to hold each individual company accountable. 
So that is why this legislation is so very important. I would submit to my colleagues--I argued this in the Senate Commerce Committee when, as the Presiding Officer knows because I offered a similar proposal there as well--that this is really the key, if you want to see tobacco companies clean up their act and do what they have long said they would do, and that is, stop targeting the youngsters of our country. 
If you really do not want to change business as usual, vote against this amendment. If you think that tobacco companies will do it on their own, then you ought to oppose this amendment. But if you want to change the course of history and make sure that we have the tools to hold the companies accountable when they again, as they have done throughout history, look for ways to get around this legislation, if you really want to get the job done right, then vote for this amendment offered by our colleague from Illinois. 
The tobacco companies have spent vast sums in recent months arguing that this sort of legislation really isn't needed, that they would take strong action on their own and that they have cleaned up their act from years past. In the Senate Commerce Committee, we heard that argument. As the Presiding Officer knows, we heard from all the CEOs at that time. Given the fact that many of the documents and the accounts of past industry misdeeds were pretty old, a number of us were inclined to say it is a new day. Let us see if the tobacco companies are going to be better corporate citizens. Let's see if they have cleaned up their act. 
As we prepared for those Commerce Committee hearings, Mr. President, I learned that the Brown & Williamson Company was again engaging in conduct that did not really reflect what they and other companies were saying in the ads that they were running at that time about how it is a new day and they have cleaned up their act. 
A brief bit of history for the Senate I think would be revealing. 
I participated, as a Member of the other body, in the hearings in 1994 where the tobacco executives then under oath, told me that nicotine isn't addictive. Of course, they contradicted every Surgeon General for decades. But there was actually a revelation at that hearing that perhaps was equally remarkable. At that hearing, it was brought to light that the Brown & Williamson Company was genetically altering tobacco plants to give it an added punch as a way to attract smokers--shocking 
evidence. And when brought to light, the Brown & Williamson Company pledged to the committee, to the country, that they wouldn't engage in that kind of conduct again. 
As we prepared for our hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee, we began to hear about news reports that the Brown & Williamson Company was using genetically altered tobacco, known as Y-1, in cigarettes and selling them both here and abroad. So when the executives came before the Senate Commerce Committee I asked them about this. In their words, the CEO of the Brown & Williamson Company said, `We are working off a small stockpile of genetically-altered tobacco, and in fact that is being included in cigarettes in our country and around the world.' 
As many in the Senate know, there is now a criminal inquiry underway. There have already been those who have pleaded guilty in connection with this matter. The Justice Department continues its investigation. 
The reason I bring this up is this is a concrete, tangible reason why we need the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois. The Senator from Illinois, our colleague, Senator Durbin, gives us a chance to reign in a company that engages in that kind of rogue action, action that is detrimental to the health of the American people, and action that, in fact, as recently as 4 years ago said they would never engage in again. 
It is one thing to talk about conduct that is 20 or 30 years old; it is another thing to talk about conduct that stems from the 1950s. But it is quite another to see a company that makes a pledge to the American people that they will stop engaging in a health practice which is obviously detrimental to children and to our citizens, and then start it again, even while the hot light of the Congress is examining their conduct in considering legislation. 
These companies are not going to change on their own, Mr. President. We are going to have to hold them accountable through legislation. That is why this amendment is so very important. I will tell my colleagues that I believe this amendment, in connection with the accountability requirements that the President knows we set up in the course of our Commerce Committee deliberations, is the single most important tool for reversing history and making sure that after this bill is passed and the tobacco companies try to get around it, that we will have some strong tools to rein them in. 
I know we want to move to a vote on this, but I simply wanted to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to say that I think this is a critically important amendment. It is critically important for each Senator who really is serious about changing business as usual with respect to tobacco policy. The single most important concept the tobacco companies fear is accountability. They have not been faced with company specific accountability when we have passed previous legislation--warning labels, advertising restrictions, or the Synar amendment. They never had to face an amendment like this that would say, look, we are actually going to require you to produce results. 
I hope our colleagues will, as reflected by the bipartisan authorship of this amendment--our colleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine--will pass this legislation. It is critically important for the youngsters of this country. It is the one part of this bill that will make sure that the job actually gets done in protecting youngsters, and not allow another piece of legislation, once again, to be evaded by the tobacco companies' genius, their marketing skills, and the vast sums that they will continue to spend with respect to marketing their products. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
As Senator Smith has said, the people of Oregon are grieving this morning. Our hearts are out to them. This is a time when all of us from Springfield, OR, to Springfield, MA, have to take a few moments out from our daily routine and reflect on what has happened in our home State. This is supposed to be a joyous time of year for kids in high school. They think about summer vacations and plans, time with family. Once again, however, our country has been rocked by unspeakable violence. I think all of us know that young people get upset and they do foolish things. But that is not what this is about. 
In times past, when young people got angry, they might throw a rock, they might throw a fist, but there was not this pattern of deadly gun violence. And so now it is critically important as we grieve for the people of our home State--my staff has been trying to help, giving blood, assisting others in the community, but it is especially important now to get beyond the kind of finger pointing and the sort of blame game that inevitably takes place here and look to how these tragedies can be prevented in the future. 
I share Senator Smith's judgment that this is about what is in our heart. It is about taking every possible step in the schools, in the family, through the education and health programs and through law enforcement programs, to protect our citizens and to reach out to those young people in trouble. That way we have a chance to restore safety in our communities and peace of mind for parents who, right now across this country, because of Springfield and the previous tragedies, are going to get up in the morning saying to themselves: What is going to happen at my child's school today? We cannot have that. No Member of the Senate can abide by that. And that, to me, is our central challenge today. 
Oregonians have come together in the last 24 hours to do what we always do best, and that is to help friends and neighbors in a time of great need. We have seen an extraordinary outpouring of concern in Springfield towards families. It is not possible to find any real comfort at a time like this, but if you can feel hopeful--we have got to get up every morning working to make this a better world and a safer world--we can take some comfort in knowing that communities like Springfield do work. They are getting up this morning and saying that they are going to try to reach out to everybody in that community, to try to do everything possible to heal in Springfield and our home State but, even more importantly, to do everything they can to make sure that tragedies like this do not happen again in Oregon or anywhere else. 
That is what we need to work for in this Chamber. Government policies can help, and with the government being a better partner, and families and schools and communities rallying, as Springfield has, we can make a difference and we can stop this carnage in our schools. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for our nation's economy, transportation is literally where the rubber hits the road. There are few things more important to my home State of Oregon or to the country's economy than how well we build and maintain our transportation system. Transportation is one of the basic ingredients in any economic growth recipe. It is one of the key things that businesses will look at as they consider where to locate. 
Both houses of Congress recognized this in passing bills to rev up transportation spending over current levels. Providing more money transportation money clearly helps keep us on the road to competitiveness and economic prosperity. 
But the transportation debate involves more than just economics, as important as that is, it's also about our quality of life. I've always believed that you can't have major league quality of life with minor league transportation systems. In the modern world, a transportation bill is about so much more than just how you get from point A to point B. 
Congress recognized this when we passed the original ISTEA legislation. For the first time, there was Federal recognition that decisions about where and how to build transportation projects can have tremendous impacts on our communities, our environment and our citizens' quality of life. Through ISTEA, we began to consider the true costs of our transportation spending as part of the process of planning transportation projects. And, for the first time, Federal funds were made available to mitigate the impacts of these projects throught the CMAQ and the Transportation Enhancements Programs. 
ISTEA recognizes that properly planned and constructed transportation systems are both economically efficient and environmentally sound. 
Badly designed or badly built systems waste taxpayer money and contribute to traffic congestion that snarls our highways. This causes both additional stresses for commuters and additional exhaust emissions that degrade the quality of our air. 
Both the Senate and the House bills continue many of these landmark initiatives of the original ISTEA legislation. These were clearly good first steps, but if we're going to improve both our transportation system and our quality of life, we need to do more than spin our wheels. 
Today, the Congress has recognized that the Federal government's role in funding transportation project also has ripple effects on patterns of development in our local communities. When it comes to transportation, if you build it, they will come and build around it. 
Uncontrolled development not only hurts our citizens where they live and breathe, it also hits them in their wallets. Several studies have come out that show the costs of sprawling growth are significantly higher than more compact, managed growth patterns. These studies show that taxpayers can save billions of dollars in public facility capital construction and operation and maintenance costs by opting for growth management. 
Because of the major impacts Federally funded transportation projects can have, there is an appropriate role for the Federal government in ensuring these projects and the development they spawn are both economically and environmentally sound. 
That role should not be to embroil the Federal government in land use decisions that have historically been State and local issues. We don't want Federal zoning. 
Instead, the proper role for the Federal government is create incentives to encourage and build on the State and local efforts to address transportation and growth that are already underway. I am very pleased to report that the ISTEA conference report includes a program I proposed to help local communities grow in environmentally sustainable ways by creating incentives for local growth management. 
I greatly appreciate Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner and Senator Baucus working with me to include this program in the bill. Chairman Chafee and the other managers of the legislation also deserve enormous credit for how they have built on and reinforced the goals of the original ISTEA law. Thanks to their efforts the bill now before the Senate will enable our national environmental policies to merge more smoothly with our transportation policies. 
The new Transportation and Community and System Preservation Program provides $25 million per year investigate and address the relationships between transportation projects, communities and the environment. The Program consists of three parts:

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it is hard to imagine a greater threat to international stability than the rogue nation of Iran coming into possession of weapons of mass destruction. 
There are three important reasons why the Iran missile proliferation act should be passed at this time. 
First and foremost, the Iran missile proliferation act is, above all else, a nonproliferation measure. It is intended to halt the spread of missile technology to Iran. With the alarming news that India has tested nuclear weapons and, in reaction to this, Pakistan is now considering testing its own weapons, we see the prospect of a dangerous spread of nuclear technology that only underscores the need for further U.S. resolve in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
The second reason this legislation is important now is because of the lack of cooperation on the part of the Russians. Generally, the United States and the Russians have a clear, common interest in halting the spread of advanced weapons technology, including missiles. Although there has been some movement within Russia to halt the spread of missile technology to Iran, there is clearly not enough being done. Coupled with reports that Iran may be actively acquiring biological, chemical, and even nuclear weapons, the case for this legislation is clear. 
Finally, this legislation is needed to bolster our Iran policy and to send a clear signal that the United States will not tolerate the spread of missile technology to Iran. Earlier this week, President Clinton decided to grant a waiver from the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to a huge energy project by a French firm and others. Many of my colleagues and I urged the President not to grant this waiver; yet, a decision was made to do so. I believe that this sends the wrong signal to the international community with respect to investment in Iran. 
Foreign investment could enable Iran to rebuild its energy sector and vastly increase its economic strength, allowing it to acquire vast assets that it could use to re-arm and acquire terrible weapons of mass destruction. While I disagree with the President's decision to grant the waiver for the French and Russian energy project, I feel even more strongly about the transfer of missile technology to Iran. 
Let us make no mistake about it, Iran has become the most serious threat to stability in the Middle East. Israeli and American intelligence have recently discovered that, due largely to technology obtained from Russia, Iran may soon have the capability to begin assembling and testing ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and other vital targets in the Middle East. 
Russian companies are providing Iran with crucial technologies, including wind tunnels for the design of missiles, lasers, and special materials for missile construction. There are even reports of over 9,000 Russian advisers working in Iran on a variety of military projects, and Iran tested a Soviet-designed rocket engine last year. 
Iran, one of America's foremost self-proclaimed enemies, has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks, ranging from taking hostages and hijacking airlines to carrying out assassinations and bombings. 
Now is the time to send a clear signal to the world community that selling missile technology to Iran is totally unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this vital measure, which takes concrete steps to halt the spread of ballistic missile technology to Iran and will act to support the preservation of peace and stability in the Middle East. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the international provisions of the tobacco legislation have been the subject of many hours of discussion and negotiation. The current provisions serve as a strong platform that I hope this body will continue to build upon in the years to come as we seek to protect all children from the diseases and the economic costs brought about by tobacco use. I received letters which demonstrate the breadth of support and the importance the public health community places on maintaining the international tobacco control provisions in the tobacco legislation.

<TEXT>
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I offered the amendment in the Senate Commerce Committee to toughen the look-back penalties for one reason. I believe that stronger look-back penalties provide a powerful tool to actually change the course of history and hold the tobacco companies accountable when they pursue youthful customers. 
A brief review of the history indicates that the tobacco companies won't change on their own. For example, if you look at every previous effort, every single previous effort on the part of the Congress to hold the tobacco companies accountable, the tobacco companies, in fact, have found a way to get around those efforts. That is what happened when the Congress sought to go forward with restrictions on advertising. That is what happened when the Congress legislated warning labels. And that is what happened when the Synar amendment was enacted. 
Many will remember our colleague who served in the other body. Mike Synar wrote very tough legislation that would, in effect, require that the States carry out the laws to protect our kids when they were targeted. The tobacco companies found a way around that. 
So the tobacco companies have found a way around every single previous legislative effort on the part of the Congress to hold them accountable. Those who would like to know more about this history can learn about it simply from the documents that have come out since the 1994 hearings in the Health Subcommittee on the other side of the Capitol. 
Now, the tobacco companies would like us to believe that they will change the course of history and their behavior on their own. Many of the Senators will remember after the original attorneys general settlement the tobacco companies took out very large advertisements in both the Nation's newspapers and in the electronic media. The basic message of those ads that were taken out by the tobacco industry when they were encouraging support for the original settlement, was their message that it was a new day. Tobacco companies said it is a new day. There will be improved corporate citizenship on the part of the tobacco industry, and that the sordid history that came out after 1994 in those various documents was a part of the past. 
I think the inclination of every Member of the U.S. Senate is to say industry can change. Our colleague, Senator Durbin, made mention of the fact that many of the executives who testified in 1994 aren't alive today. So a number of us were very hopeful that it would be a new day in terms of tobacco industry behavior. But when the Senate Commerce Committee held hearings earlier this year under the leadership of Chairman McCain, we received powerful evidence that things really had not changed. 
I will cite one example in which I was personally involved. In 1994, when I was a member of the Health Subcommittee on the other side of the Capitol, Henry Waxman brought the Nation's tobacco executives before the Health Subcommittee. It came to light that the Brown & Williamson company at that time was genetically altering nicotine, genetically altering nicotine to give it a special punch and to hook their customers. This was, of course, a flagrant example of subverting the public interest. It was documented by the Food and Drug Administration. At that time, the Brown & Williamson company assured the country that 
they would not engage in that conduct again. 
During the course of our preparation for the hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee 4 years later, I and other members of the committee learned from news reports and others that there was evidence that, in fact, Brown & Williamson was again genetically altering nicotine and again engaging in this detrimental conduct that they pledged to the country they would never engage in again in 1994. 
So when the CEO of the Brown & Williamson company came to the Senate Commerce Committee with the other executives, I asked specifically about what kinds of practices the company was engaged in with respect to genetically altered nicotine. The CEO of that company said, in fact, that they were again selling this product, and in their words, in response to a question I asked that day, they admitted that they were working off `a small stockpile of genetically altered nicotine,' engaging in conduct that they pledged the country in 1994 that they would never engage in again. 
The reason I bring this example up is that if a tobacco company will engage in that kind of brazen conduct, in that kind of conduct when they are under the hot spotlight of the U.S. Congress, as they have been for many months, what are they going to do when the attention of the Congress and the country turns elsewhere? This isn't about conduct of 20, 30, 40 years ago. We know that took place in the past. A number of us were very interested in knowing whether the companies really did want to change of their own accord. Many of those who have opposed tough look-back penalties have used this argument in the past. Companies are changing. These kind of tools of big government are certainly unnecessary, at best. 
The Brown & Williamson example where they are working off a small stockpile of genetically altered nicotine at this time is certainly strong evidence that these companies have not really changed and it is not the new day that the Congress and the country were told about after the original settlement from the attorneys general. 
Given that past history, over 20, 30, 40 years, and the most current history, the Brown & Williamson example which, by the way, the Justice Department is now conducting a criminal inquiry into, there have already been pleas in this regard--given that past history and the history present, many of us are not willing to say that it is actually a new day in the tobacco industry. 
Mr. President, I want the Senate to know why I am particularly skeptical. I was a member of the Health Subcommittee of the other body in 1994, Chairman Waxman, the late Mike Synar, and others, did an extraordinarily good job of questioning the executives. But when it came to my turn during those hearings, I recognized that it had not yet been put on the public record whether these executives believed that nicotine was addictive. 
So, in 1994, at those hearings, I went down the row with each of the executives, one by one by one, each of them, and asked them whether nicotine was addictive. And each of them under oath at that time said that nicotine was not addictive. 
I like to think that moment contributed in some way to the important legislation we have before us, contributed to our positions for enacting strong legislation. But it seems to me that set of hearings and the documents that have come to light will only make a real difference over time if we now follow up on those early efforts and pass the strongest possible look-back legislation. That is why I offered a very tough set of additional penalties when companies don't meet their specific targets for reducing youth smoking under the Commerce Committee bill. That is why I am pleased to be able to join Senators Durbin, DeWine, Chafee, and others this afternoon. 
The bottom line, with respect to our amendment--many of the details have been addressed--but the bottom line is if you do not have aggressive look-back penalties, look-back penalties that really zero in on aggressively the companies in a specific way, you effectively penalize the companies that try to change their behavior twice. You penalize them once through the industry assessment and second through the loss of market while other companies continue to market to children and a future market share. 
This amendment represents a fairer approach. It does not allow the Congress, in effect, through loopholes in this look-back set of provisions, to place a company that does try to clean up its act, does try to change history, we make sure under our amendment that company wouldn't be placed at a competitive disadvantage when they said, now we are going to change and not seek out children. 
Let me also say that because the number of teen smokers has actually grown since the original settlement was announced last summer, the changes that we offer today will essentially hold the industry to a reduction level to which they have already agreed. So, in fact, this amendment is stronger than what came out of the Senate Commerce Committee on the 19-to-1 basis. But given what we have seen with, again, the number of teen smokers actually increasing, this, in effect, simply ensures that the industry is held to a reduction level to which they have already agreed. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, Senators Durbin and DeWine went into a number of the details with respect to how the look-back legislation works. I don't think all of that needs to be belabored at this time. But I would like to say that to me what this amendment is all about is reversing the course of history. History shows that in the past when we would write these laws, the tobacco companies would bring their entrepreneurial and advertising talents to the task then of getting around them. And the tobacco companies have more of that kind of advertising and entrepreneurial talent than anybody else around. They would always find a way to evade the law. 
Learning from past history with respect to the warning labels, with respect to electronic ads, with respect to the way in which the industry got around the Synar amendment, we are making it clear that we are going to have the tools to rein in the scoff-law companies, those that do not clean up their acts as they have pledged to do. We do so in a realistic way. We do so in a fashion that makes sure that companies that really have changed won't be put at a competitive disadvantage. 
I would say, finally, Mr. President, and colleagues, to those of you who have talked to me personally about those 1994 hearings, and what happened during the course of those 7 hours where the executives said that cigarettes were like Hostess Twinkies, 
cigarettes weren't addictive, and they never preyed on children, if you really want to reverse the course of history, if you really want to hold the companies accountable, if you really want to rein in the conduct that we saw demonstrated again in the Senate Commerce Committee when Brown & Williamson admitted that they are now using genetically altered nicotine, if you want to change that behavior, vote for this bipartisan amendment, because this is something that is going to change the course of history and make sure that these companies don't prey on our youngsters in the years ahead. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to take this opportunity to discuss why I believe it is so important that the U.S. Senate pass strong legislation to protect our children from the tobacco companies that are preying on them. 
I got my real start in public service in Eugene, OR, right after I got out of law school in my twenties in Lane County in Oregon. I started a senior citizens legal clinic. I was able to get almost all of the attorneys in town to volunteer their time, coming to the senior citizens center to help the older people with the varied legal problems that seniors have. 
At the legal clinic when I was in my twenties I saw firsthand the extraordinary health consequences that smoking has for our citizens. I saw older people come to that legal clinic in Lane County in Oregon racked with emphysema. They were struggling for every breath. 
I found myself, having organized this legal clinic to help older people, having to console the widows and widowers of cancer victims, families that lost loved ones years and years before their time. I saw then when I set up that senior citizens legal clinic exactly what cigarettes can do to the health and well-being of our citizens and the toll that they take on American families. 
So when I decided to seek elected office I said that I would put a special focus on my service in the U.S. Senate in trying to improve the health care of our citizens. I said that I wanted to focus on health care issues in a meaningful way, because I came to feel that if a person doesn't have their health care, doesn't have well-being, then they can't really focus on much of anything else. If they and their loved ones can't get access to decent medical care and they are suffering, there really aren't many other issues that a person and a family can focus on. 
When I came to the U.S. Congress, I said I am going to remember all those seniors that I met at the legal clinic when I got out of law school, and I said if we really are going to take strong steps to improve the health of our citizens, we had to take on these tobacco companies, and that we will take them on even if it was a tough fight in order to make the lives of our citizens better when they got older. And it was just that simple. 
The older people that I saw in that legal program didn't get started smoking when they were 48 or 55. They got started in their teens. They got started as kids when they were the age of Adam Wyden and his sister Lilly. 
So I felt then that all other issues revolved around whether our citizens had their health. I remember those older people who came to the legal clinic in Oregon. I said we are going to take steps to make their lives better, and I am going to make that a special focus of my service in the Congress. 
So when I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980, I was able to win a position on the House Health Care Subcommittee, a committee that, in my view, turned out some of the most important public health legislation in our country's history under the extraordinary leadership of Henry Waxman. I got to serve with one of the most courageous public officials who has ever served in the U.S. Congress, the late Mike Synar. 
Against all odds, against all odds when he faced tremendous resistance in his home district, the late Mike Synar was willing to stand up for kids, and, in fact, wrote one of the first and the most important public health statutes to protect kids against the tobacco companies that prey on them, the statute known as the Synar amendment. Of course, the tobacco companies worked very hard to try to get around that because the Synar amendment stood for the proposition that we were going to enforce tough laws to protect our minors at the State level. That was too much for the tobacco companies, just as they sought hard to get around the early advertising restrictions on the electronic news, just as they sought to get around the early warning labels, they sought to evade the mission and the specific requirements of the Synar legislation. 
So Mike Synar, Henry Waxman, I, and others worked through the 1980s to try to rein in these tobacco companies and improve the lives of our children. 
A little over 4 years ago we were at the now well-recognized hearing with the tobacco CEOs who under oath addressed for the first time before the U.S. Congress these major public health questions that the Senate has been occupied with over the last couple of days. 
Mr. President, it was an extraordinary hearing. It went on for more than 7 hours. The executives said, for example, that cigarettes were sort of like Hostess Twinkies. They said that, of course, they never ever would target young people. And for more than 7 hours they said under oath that cigarettes essentially were not something that the U.S. Congress should be focusing on. They said it is just like any other health concern a person might have with sugar or with fat. Why is the U.S. Congress singling out tobacco, was essentially their message over a hearing that lasted more than 7 hours. 
Chairman Waxman, Mike Synar, and others did, in my view, a superlative job trying to put the key issues on the record. When it came to my initial turn I felt that it was especially important to get the executives' position on whether nicotine was addictive. We had them all in front of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Subcommittee on Health. They were under oath. So I simply said I am going to go down the row. I am going to go down the row and ask each one of these executives one after another whether nicotine is addictive. So I began. 
The first executive said nicotine was not an addictive substance. The second executive said that nicotine was not addictive. The third one raised questions again about why anyone would possibly have reservations about this issue, specifically why we would be asking whether nicotine was addictive. And all of the executives then under oath said for the first time that nicotine was not an addictive substance. 
They contradicted the Surgeon General, who has come before health committees in the Congress for more than 20 years, and perhaps even more importantly, they contradicted what their own executives were saying for more than 30 years. That, of course, came out after the hearing took place. But what has been especially telling is that, after that historic hearing in 1994 when the executives said nicotine wasn't addictive and didn't target kids, a voluminous record has been made by various committees in the Congress which documents and makes very clear that these executives, in fact, knew all along that nicotine was addictive. There was not any question in their minds about whether it was addictive. Their own documents had proved that. But yet they told the U.S. House of Representatives, the Subcommittee on Health, and myself specifically under oath that nicotine was not addictive. 
I think that moment contributed in a significant way to our achieving a chance now to pass important legislation to protect our children. But there were a number of other important issues that were brought up that day before the Health Subcommittee that have implications even this evening as the Senate considers this historic legislation. And I would like to just touch on one of those. 
At that hearing, it came to light that one tobacco company, Brown & Williamson, was in fact genetically altering nicotine in order to give it an extra punch, in order to make it more addictive to children and others who used the product. The Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of David Kessler had essentially brought this to light. The committee confronted the Brown & Williamson Company, and they were under oath and said that they would cease utilizing this high-nicotine tobacco called 1Y. So this was more than 4 years ago. It came to light as a result of the investigative work done by the Food and Drug Administration. 
After the Brown & Williamson Company was caught using 1Y, this genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco, they said they would not do it anymore. 
A number of things happened over the last 4 years. One of them was that I had the honor of being chosen by the people of Oregon to serve in the Senate, and I was chosen to serve in the Senate January 30 of 1996. Having had the additional privilege of being named to serve on the Senate Commerce Committee under the outstanding leadership of John McCain, and our ranking Democrat, Fritz Hollings, I had a chance to participate in the next round of important tobacco hearings under John McCain's leadership. We held a number of them prior to the committee's consideration of the legislation that is now before us. And when Senator McCain asked the executives--and a number of them, of course, are new--to come before the Senate Commerce Committee, I asked Brown & Williamson what was the current status of the use of 1Y genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco. 
The reason I asked the question is that I had read news reports that this special, genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco was in fact still being used by the Brown & Williamson Company even though the company had said under oath that it would no longer use this genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco. And in fact at that important hearing chaired by our leader on the committee, John McCain, Brown & Williamson said in fact that they are now working off a small stockpile of genetically altered nicotine. There is already a criminal investigation underway. 
The reason that I bring this to the attention of the Senate tonight is for just one reason. If this company is so brazen as to engage in this conduct, having promised the American people that they would no longer do it again, and now being watched under the scrutiny of the Congress, what will it be like, Mr. President and colleagues, when in fact the hot spotlight is turned away from tobacco? This company has engaged in activity that they pledged to the American people they no longer would engage in, and they told the McCain committee that they are now working off a small stockpile of genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco and that this product is being used in our country and overseas. 
The other reason that I bring this to the attention of the Senate, Mr. President and colleagues, is this goes right to the 
heart of the industry's argument that it is a new day and that they are pursuing a new standard with respect to corporate citizenship. Before the McCain committee, the executives came and said: We realize that what happened in yesteryear was no longer acceptable. We are going to clean up our act. We are going to make sure that young people are not targeted. 
I think it is the impulse of all of us to say, new executives, new day; let's look at this anew. But when it came to light that Brown & Williamson was again using genetically altered, high-nicotine tobacco after promising the American people and the Congress that they would no longer engage in the practice, that is a pretty blatant contradiction of the claim that things really are different, that it is a new day, and that tobacco companies want to clean up their act. 
As we consider this legislation on the floor of the Senate, Mr. President and colleagues, the Justice Department continues its inquiry into the use of this genetically altered nicotine, and there have already been criminal pleas that have been entered into. 
Now, having said that, and noting some of the great challenges, let me also talk about what I think is a significant success, and I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity to do it while Chairman McCain is here and on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President and Chairman McCain, I will tell you that when I left the Waxman hearings in 1994, walking out of that hearing room with the late Mike Synar, I told him that I was not convinced that we would make real headway in this fight to protect our children in our lifetime. I said to Mike Synar, `We are going to be up against all of the odds. We are going to be up against a lobbyist tidal wave. I am not sure we are ever going to do it in our lifetime.' 
We lost the late Mike Synar years before his time, but a lot of us said that we are going to continue that work. And we have the opportunity to do it because Chairman McCain was courageous enough to take on this issue, come to Members of the Senate like myself, come to the public health groups, and say that we are going to focus on this issue until we get it done. 
He did not minimize how tough a job it was. All he has to do is look down the row of his committee members. He has our good friend, Wendell Ford, sitting a few places away from me. It is going to be a challenge to get Wendell Ford and Ron Wyden to support a bill. We both did in the Senate Commerce Committee. 
I commend Chairman McCain at this time because we would not be on this floor, we would not have made as much progress, had he not been willing to take this issue on. I say to you, Mr. President, and to the country, we have come a long way. If you had told me 4 years ago, when I walked out of the Waxman hearings, that we would now be debating whether to impose fines of billions of dollars on companies that do not meet tough targets in reducing youth smoking, if you had told me 4 years ago that we would be having a debate on how to do that and impose those penalties, I would have asked you, `What are you smoking?' Because I thought there would never ever be an opportunity like that in my lifetime. 
We have that opportunity because John McCain has focused on this issue and brought together a group in the Senate that certainly does not agree on every single issue--that has been very clear--but does agree on how important it is to focus on this and get the job done. 
Now, I do want to touch for just a few additional moments on several of the specific issues that have been important to me, and talk for a bit about why that is the case. 
First, I am certain that many Members of the Senate have not heard about the accountability requirements that are in the legislation that we take up this week. And the word `accountability,' for me and most public health specialists, is probably the single most important word in the discussion of this whole subject, because in the past it has not been possible to hold the tobacco companies accountable. For all of the past legislative efforts designed to rein them in--the Synar amendment, the early warning labels, the restrictions on electronic advertising--the industry would use their marketing and entrepreneurial talent and would find a way around them. So when we focused on enforcement issues in the committee, I began to discuss with Chairman McCain and the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee how we could assure our children and future generations that there would be an ongoing watchdog who would scrutinize the practices of the tobacco companies when they inevitably try to get around the new law that I hope this Congress passes and that I know President Clinton will sign. 
The tobacco companies, once again, when we get a new law, will put their entrepreneurial and marketing talent to the task of getting around it. They will have scores of slick strategies to employ to try to get around these protections. With the accountability requirements in this legislation, we will have an ongoing watchdog who will be in a position to let us know when the tobacco companies start trying to evade an important new public health law, as they have done every single time for decades. 
With the accountability requirements, public health officials, the Surgeon General, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and the Office of Minority Health, will be involved in looking at company-specific behavior to determine whether a company is trying to evade the requirements of this law. They will be able to recommend at any time that a company that seeks to evade the strictures of this statute ought to have any liability protection they have pulled. Tobacco companies clearly have not been straight with the Congress. All their documents that came out after the 1994 hearings that contradicted what the executive said under oath in 1994 have made it very clear to me the single most important word in this debate--the single most intellectually honest word in this debate--is `accountability.' I, again, thank Chairman McCain and his staff. They were under a lot of pressure from powerful interests to essentially strip out these accountability requirements. Once again, Chairman McCain hung in there for the public health, and I want to tell him how much I appreciate that. 
There are two other issues I would like to touch on briefly, with the first being the issue of the health care of our minority citizens and those in communities inhabited by many minority Americans. For years, again as has come out in documents since the 1994 hearings, the tobacco companies have shamelessly targeted these minority youngsters and minority communities to sell their products. I think it is critically important now that in this legislation there be resources specifically targeted to these minority communities and to minority youngsters who are preyed upon by the tobacco industry. This legislation provides a first step toward addressing the 
 health concerns of minorities by assuring that all of the State efforts for smoking cessation and prevention include minority populations, and that services can be made available through community-based organizations. 
In the Congressional Black Caucus, for example, Congressman Bennie Thompson has done a yeoman's job in terms of trying to focus both the other body and the U.S. Senate on this issue. I know they have talked about this with Chairman McCain. This issue is not one that we are going to allow to be swept under the rug. It is not right to see so many minority youngsters get involved with tobacco at an early age, and it is unconscionable the way these tobacco companies have targeted our minority communities. In addition to the support for the State plans for smoking cessation and prevention, the Office of Minority Health will be represented on the accountability panel. In my view, this is a significant win for the cause of minority health. 
We are going to have much to do as we consider these questions through the rest of the debate in the U.S. Senate and in the House. I am particularly troubled about the prospect that some of the focus on improving the health of our minority citizens, and specifically seeing a reduction in smoking among minority youngsters, will get lost if the final judgment by the Congress on this issue is to create a State block grant approach. I don't want to see this issue, which has been neglected for so long, lost in some sort of amorphous block grant where, once again, the health needs of minority youngsters and minority communities get lost. So there are going to be a number of Members of the U.S. Senate who care about this issue, particularly Senators Jeffords and Harkin, and I am looking forward to working with them to strengthen the minority provisions, minority health provisions of this legislation. I know that Congressman Bennie Thompson is going to bring his talents and energy to doing that as the House considers the bill as well. 
Finally, there is one last issue I would like to raise. I have been talking tonight about the needs of youngsters in the United States. I represent the people of Oregon. I have the privilege of representing them, serving with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith who, in my view, has been a very strong voice for protecting youngsters in this debate. I appreciate that very much. We are both very proud to represent Oregon, and to work to improve the health of youngsters all across this country. 
But I come tonight, as well, to talk about an issue that I think ought to strike at our moral conscience, and that is, as I have said, to say that it is critically important that we protect kids in Bend, OR, across the country, in Bangor, ME, and communities in between. But it is also critically important to protect kids in Bangladesh and Bangkok, because a child is a child is a child. And I hope--it is my fervent hope--that when this bill heads to the President of the United States, that we will have put in place extremely strong health protections for youngsters across the world. 
Let us not say on our watch that to pay for a settlement, a tobacco settlement in the United States, the children around the world lost their health. Let us not sacrifice the lungs of youngsters around the world to pay for a settlement here. Let's protect kids in the United States. That is what we have a sworn obligation to do. But let us not forget youngsters around the world who don't have lobbyists, who don't have lawyers and the great array of talent that so many powerful interest groups have. 
I will say that if we don't speak for those children all over the world on our watch--the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I are about the same age, I am a little older, I resent that, but a little older--but on our watch, millions of youngsters around the world will get sick during our lifetime and die needlessly. I know that the Presiding Officer and all our colleagues don't want to see that. That is why I think it is so important that we pass the provisions in this legislation that will protect youngsters around the world when the tobacco companies target them. 
Make no mistake about it, that is the game plan. The game plan for the tobacco companies is consumption is going down here--it is well documented--and it is going up at a staggeringly high level around the world. The evidence shows, for example, that for every smoker who quits in the United States, two start in China. There are countries around the world that actually are in support of companies that sponsor contests to see how many cigarettes a youngster can smoke at one time. If we don't take the steps to protect these youngsters around the world who are envisaged in the McCain legislation before us, we will have the bizarre situation where a tobacco company in the United States won't be able to slap a decal on some car or something that is utilized at a sporting event, but that same company will be able to participate in these contests around the world to see how many cigarettes a youngster can smoke. 
I don't think we ought to have that kind of double standard where we say we are going to protect kids here but we are really not much interested around the world. I know that this is an issue that a lot of Members are not familiar with, but we are going to take the time over the next few days and, in the days ahead, to make sure that they are, because I think those kids count, too. 
The legislation before us today is not all that I would want, and it is not all that Senator Durbin and Senator Wellstone and Senator Harkin and many others who have been interested in this issue would want either. We really had our ideal plan and consideration in the Senate Commerce Committee. Chairman McCain was straight and realistic with us. We knew that we couldn't win that kind of package on the floor of the U.S. Senate, so we vowed that we were going to lay a foundation to protect the health of youngsters around the world, as well as youngsters here, and that is what we have done in this legislation. 
It wouldn't be my first choice, but to tell you the truth, Senator Hollings, who very graciously worked with us essentially nonstop over the weekend, wouldn't think it is his first choice either. But that is what the legislative process is all about. What this legislation does with respect to kids around the world is very, very important. 
Make no mistake about it, it is a strong beginning at laying out a global policy to protect kids around the world. It essentially does three things. 
First, for all time--for all time--it gets the Federal Government out of the business, through the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies, of promoting the sale of tobacco overseas. For the first time, the U.S. Trade Representative will be directed to consult with the Department of Health and Human Services concerning any trade actions related to tobacco. The U.S. Trade Representative will not be acting in a vacuum. They are required to let the Congress of the United States know when tobacco companies approach them on these matters. I think it is fair to say that with respect to the role of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Federal agencies that are charged with leading the international trade effort, that never again, as a matter of Federal law, will we have them promoting the sale of tobacco overseas. 
Second, for the first time, we will require that U.S. health warnings on cigarette packs for exports are carried in a specific way. In effect, we are making it clear that the kind of warning labels, health-specific, that we have in the United States have to apply overseas. If the other governments around the world choose to put another warning on, it has to be substantially similar--substantially similar--in terms of the warning provided to our citizens. 
It would not be right, as our colleague Dick Durbin has said, to let them off by putting on a warning, `Well, cigarettes may cause bad breath,' or, as some have seen in other parts of the world, `Cigarette smoking may be inconvenient to your neighbor.' That won't do. 
Around the world, as a result of the legislation 
 incorporated into the McCain bill that we are considering now on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the warning that is health specific used in our country will have to be used around the world by regulation unless it is substantially similar. Those labels will make it clear that smoking is harmful, and they will be scientifically based. 
The administration is charged with finding the most effective compliance mechanism and assuring that the labels are in the language of the country of destination. That is extremely important and something long sought by the public health groups. 
Finally--I guess our colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, took particular issue with this--this for the first time puts resources into the effort to work in an educational fashion around the globe. Several hundred million dollars is devoted to our participation in these global kinds of health efforts which are critically important, because if, for example, we learn about an important educational innovation that really does reach kids--for example, some of the counteradvertising that is already showing real promise in deterring youth smoking--we want to make sure that this kind of information is easily shared with the global network of public health specialists. 
This isn't going to be sort of sock the Government. This is to make sure that kids around the world don't get sick. If we can prevent those illnesses, those countries will be able to avoid some of the much larger medical bills which often, as our colleagues know--particularly the Presiding Officer of the Senate because of his role in foreign affairs--and avoid coming to our Government to ask for support to deal with it. 
So again, if we can prevent these illnesses among young people, particularly as it relates to tobacco, my sense is that the Presiding Officer of the Senate will see fewer demands for help with much greater medical bills which will come about as youngsters get hooked and addicted to tobacco. 
Finally, the bill sets up a system to combat smuggling, and in much the same way the Federal Government today enforces the law against the smuggling of alcohol. And in regard to the smuggling provisions, I particularly want to commend the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who has long been involved in this issue. 
The tobacco companies, as a number of our colleagues already noted to me, do not want these provisions in this legislation. They do not want these provisions to ruin their business plans to target kids overseas. That is what the game plan is all about, Mr. President, and colleagues. It is about recognizing that consumption is going down in our country and skyrocketing around the world. With the export provisions, through removing the U.S. Trade Representative and Federal officials from the business of promoting tobacco permanently, through the warning labels, through the funds to participate in educational efforts, we make a very strong start to protect kids around the world. And I again thank Chairman McCain for his help. 
Mr. President, I want to wrap up with one last point. 
I think I am the only Member of the U.S. Congress on either side who had the privilege in the last few years to participate in historic hearings in both of the Commerce Committees. I had the honor of serving on Henry Waxman's subcommittee as a Member of the other body and I am now honored to have the chance to serve with John McCain, who has done so much to bring this bill to the floor tonight. 
I will say that I think we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to protect kids. That is what this is all about. At the end of the day, it is not about all these arcane and technical questions that we are debating on the floor of the Senate. That is not to say those questions are unimportant. They are. They are very important. 
I will tell you, all of our colleagues who I have heard have been asking important questions. But as we ask those important questions, let us not lose sight of the end game here, which is to protect kids. 
We have a President who is willing to take on the tobacco lobbies. That is a major reason we have come thus far. We have a chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who has reached across both sides of the aisle to try to fashion a strong bill. We have public health groups all over this country who have made the case with their volunteers, with their physicians, with their nurses, with all of the individuals who participate in these superb organizations that now is the time, now is the time to act. And that means passing a bill in this Senate. 
It is not going to be the perfect bill. It is not going to be what any of us would like in an ideal world. That is why I said there are a number of aspects of the export provisions that I was very bothered to see disappear. Senator Hollings has concerns about what is in there--that is the process of fashioning legislation--but we were able to make a strong start at protecting our kids. And if the Senate passes this bill, and does it in a timely way, we can make a difference for kids here and around the world. 
But I say, Mr. President, and colleagues--and I will conclude with this--the clock is ticking. It is not exactly an atomic secret that there are not many days left in the session. And delay is the best friend that the advocates of the status quo could possibly have. Delay is the very best friend of the tobacco lobbies that want to engage in business as usual. Delay is a perfect opportunity for all of those who say, `Tobacco company profits ought to come before the health of kids, that, well, we just have to study this longer. We don't know all the facts.' 
I say, Mr. President, and colleagues, that we will have a chance all the way through this process, through the amendments on the floor, and the House considers its legislation and passes it, as we go to conference, we will have a chance to learn more, to refine this legislation and to improve it. That is what we did through the many hearings that were held in the Senate Commerce Committee. That is what has happened through the work done by the Labor Committee, the Judiciary Committee, with so many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But let us not miss this opportunity to pass this legislation. We have to do it soon. The clock is ticking. 
Mr. President, this bill will be good for our children. More importantly, it will be good for our children's children. It is my fervent hope that this Senate passes this legislation, and does so in an expeditious way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I voted for S. 1723 because I am convinced that some high technology companies are facing critical labor shortages, which is in turn hampering growth in this important economic sector of Oregon's economy. It is critically important, however, that the final legislation contain additional protections for workers rights. Specifically, we should make certain that no qualified U.S. worker will be laid off simply to be replaced by a foreign worker. Further, we should ensure that employers who want to use this program have taken steps to find qualified American workers. I look forward to continued progress on this legislation as it proceeds to conference.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the last three years, this Congress struggled with many of the difficult issues in the Amtrak reauthorization bill. We finally reached an agreement late last year and sent legislation to the President for his signature, which he signed on December 2, 1997. 
In the process, my state, and its neighbors, lost a valuable service on the route of the Pioneer. I fought hard to keep that service running but citizens of eastern Oregon continue to feel frustrated over the loss of this service. 
I want Amtrak to succeed and I want to make sure that the legislation we enacted last year is properly implemented. The Administration is late in submitting its nominations for the Amtrak Reform Board which was created in last year's bill. Although I hear that the Administration has begun the process of picking candidates for the seven positions that are required by law, I am concerned that the names under consideration will not represent the various regions of the country that make up the Amtrak system. If the restoration of the Pioneer is to receive fair consideration, it must be by a Board of Directors that reflects the regional needs of all sections of the country. My friend, the Majority Leader, who also sits on the Commerce Committee has made clear on more than one occasion that if Amtrak is only a series of regional corridors and not a national system, it will not continue to receive the support of Congress. 
While I believe the new Amtrak Board should meet the qualifications spelled out in the Act, they should also have a sense of geographical balance. I fear the loss of support for a national system if we wind up with a Board that represents only one region of the country. In particular, the west and mid-western states again appear to be left out of consideration as sources of Amtrak director candidates. 
As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I will be looking for regional balance when these nominations are submitted and encourage my colleagues to do so as well.

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we had a thoughtful discussion on the floor of the Senate earlier today with Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan especially with respect to the high-tech issues that will be coming up over the course of this week. 
In a sense, it is ironic that we call it high-tech week here. I am very pleased that Senator Lott and Senator Daschle have been able to get an agreement to deal with these issues. And, in a sense, we are going to be dealing with high-tech issues all year round as we face the 21st century. It is not going to be something that we look at just from time to time, but it will essentially dominate, in my view, debate about public policy in the years ahead. And I am particularly hopeful that this week we will have an opportunity on the Senate floor to debate the Internet Tax Freedom Act which, as our Presiding Officer knows, was debated at some length in the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year. 
My sense is that these tax issues are especially important because it is so critical that our country lay out a set of ground rules, a set of principles that will address the question of taxation and the digital economy. 
Right now, you can live in the Dakotas, and if you want to send a tasty fruit basket from a company in Oregon, you can order it on line, say, from a firm in Virginia, and pay for it with a Florida bank card, and you can end up absolutely baffled with respect to how many jurisdictions may be in a position to impose taxes on this particular transaction. 
We have already heard in testimony before the committee that the uncertainty surrounding these transactions has caused some businesses to go under. In particular, we heard from a small business in Tennessee about the problem. The Wall Street Journal recently reports in a Peat Marwick survey that many financial executives are uncertain with respect to how transactions will be handled in cyberspace. This has contributed to uncertainty and reluctance to go forward and do business on line. 
Recently, one of the prominent analysts, a firm by the name of Vertex, cited several States where it was really impossible to know how to proceed with respect to electronic commercial transactions because, in effect, the rules were so fluid that you would have to get an interpretation of tax law that really was not written. 
So I and others have introduced the Internet Tax Freedom Act. And its purpose is simple. That is to give consumers and businesses engaged in electronic commerce a timeout from discriminatory taxes so that our country can develop a fair and reasonable policy on Internet taxation. 
And we are very proud of the strong bipartisan support that this effort has received. Governor George Bush, for example, from the State of Texas, has recently spoken out on this issue. Our colleague, Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont, Steve Forbes--the list of supporters for this effort literally spans the spectrum. 
I believe that the reason it has been possible to generate such strong bipartisan support for the Internet Tax Freedom Act is that during this period where there will be a bar on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, all other forms of taxation that are used in the regular course of business would be allowed to go forward. 
So during the period when our country tries to develop a set of ground rules for taxation of electronic commerce--all of the property taxes, all of the sales taxes, all of the use taxes, all of the business license fees that are nondiscriminatory--would stay in place. 
For our colleagues that have been following this issue, it is all laid out very specifically in section 3 of our legislation. For example, under our legislation if Mr. Brown in South Dakota picks up the phone and orders a sweater from J.C. Penney in Illinois he would pay the same sales tax as if he walked into J.C. Penney in Sioux Falls, SD. South Dakota taxes sales of goods over the Internet the same as sales of tangible personal property through more traditional channels. Exactly the same treatment for a transaction, whether it is conducted over the Internet or whether it is conducted through more traditional means. 
Going further, if you are a chef in Charleston, SC, and you order a new saucepan from Williams-Sonoma in California, under our legislation you would pay the same sales tax as if you walked in to the Williams Sonoma shop in Charleston. South Carolina taxes sales of goods over the Internet the same as sales of tangible personal property through more traditional channels. 
Now, there has been an effort by some to say that this legislation would in some way harm Main Street. The fact of the matter is that Main Street has overwhelmingly come out for this legislation. I will append to my statement a long list of the business groups that support the legislation, but every Member of the U.S. Senate has received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce in recent days with a ringing endorsement of the Internet tax freedom legislation. And the reason for this very strong support, in my view, is that Main Street business has come out strongly for the legislation. I believe the reason that Main Street businesses are so strongly supporting the Internet Tax Freedom Act is that for them, the opportunity to do business on-line ensures that geography will be irrelevant in the 21st century. 
A lot of those small businesses on Main Street in rural America--and I represent many of them in the State of Oregon--do have difficulty competing today in the global marketplace. One of the reasons they do is because geography is a very big barrier in terms of their ability to tap the global economy. With the Internet Tax Freedom Act ensuring that they are treated fairly both during this period when there is an effort to come up with new ground rules, and for the 21st century, we give new opportunity to those small Main Street businesses across America. I believe that is why they have endorsed this legislation so strongly. 
If ever there was an issue that was appropriate for the U.S. Senate to deal with, it is this question. This is what article 1 of our Constitution is all about. We have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in America. I believe it is fair to say that if a fair number of these taxing jurisdictions go forward and levy taxes on electronic commerce, in a discriminatory way this will do enormous damage to what I believe will be the business infrastructure of the 21st century. 
Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan, as I said, had a very thoughtful discussion of the potential of Internet commerce in the years ahead. But let us make no mistake about it, if these small businesses all across this country are going to suddenly 
have to put on accountants and various kind of tax specialists to figure out what kind of taxes they owe in various local jurisdictions across this country, this will damage electronic commerce and the ability of the small businesses to compete in a profound way. 
If you have a two-person operation, a two-person business operating out of an individual's home, and they are somehow supposed to collect scores of different sales and property taxes across this country there is going to be enormous confusion just as we see the electronic marketplace take off. I know no Member of the U.S. Senate wants to see that happen. 
The bottom line is that the Internet Tax Freedom Act applies only to those taxes that are not technologically neutral. Only those taxes that single out the Internet would be affected, and every business in America would still have to pay its share of taxes. So if a State has a 3-percent sales tax that a customer has to pay the State when walking into a store to purchase a product, under the Internet Tax Freedom Act, section 3 specifically, the State can, in fact, charge a 3-percent sales tax on goods ordered over the Internet. 
I am very hopeful that there will be an opportunity to debate this issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate. A number of my colleagues, Senator Dorgan specifically, have important issues that they want to raise. I and other sponsors of this legislation have sought to address many of them. But I believe this is one of the most important issues that this Senate could be dealing with because it is going to frame the ground work for the digital economy in the 21st century and it is important that all businesses are treated fairly. 
It is also important that the U.S. Senate realize the damage that can be done if you continue to see a growth in the kind of confusion that the Vertex Company has pointed out with respect to the inability of businesses to get answers. We will damage Internet commerce if we see more small businesses like the Tennessee businessman who testified before the Commerce Committee that he went out of business because of the confusion on the part of his State with respect to how electronic commercial transactions ought to be handled. 
No Member of the U.S. Senate wants to see that happen. We have an opportunity to get this issue with respect to the digital economy right. We have a chance to take a timeout from discriminatory taxes, come up with a policy for Internet taxation that is fair and makes sense. Let's not kill the Internet goose that is showing the capacity to lay an extraordinary number of golden eggs. 
I hope we will have a chance to discuss this issue at great length throughout the course of the week. I especially want to thank my colleagues, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, who has worked diligently with me on this legislation for more than a year; my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who does have questions about this legislation but has always been very fair in terms of raising them. I am very hopeful we will have a chance to debate and vote on this legislation during the course of this week. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the floor, let me say I thought he was extraordinarily eloquent. I got a chance to know Senator Randolph a bit as a Member of the House. And the Senator's statement here today really sums up the extraordinary qualities of this great man. I am very pleased to have been able to be here for a few minutes to hear the Senator's very fine speech. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate engaged in a particularly important debate about the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
I particularly want to commend the leadership and dedication of my colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith. Senator Smith managed this important legislation on the floor with great competence, and the people of Oregon should be proud of how he handled this difficult assignment. Despite my colleague's persuasive efforts, however, I have decided to oppose this treaty. 
Mr. President, a new era in world affairs demands new forms of international cooperation. There is indeed a clear and immediate imperative to bring the new democracies of Eastern Europe into the family of freedom-loving nations. 
What is less clear is that the best way to do this is through the new military alliance proposed by this treaty. My reservations about this treaty are three, and I would like to outline them briefly. 
First, the treaty redefines NATO's fundamental mission from protecting against a known threat into something much more nebulous. The initial purpose of this alliance was to contain communism and staunch the threat of the Soviet Union spreading its sphere of influence over the entire continent. With four decades of sound leadership, consistent vision, and unflinching strength, the alliance succeeded in that endeavor, bringing the West safely through the Cold War, and allowing the people of Eastern Europe to finally reassert their long-suppressed desire for freedom. 
But what is NATO's role in a new environment, with the Soviet Union relegated to history? I don't think that question has been sufficiently debated, or an answer sufficiently defined, for us to be rushing into this expansion. Is there really some strategic end that would be served by the United States pledging to treat any conflagration in the turbulent realm of Eastern Europe as an attack against our own sovereignty? 
It may well be that there are circumstances in which the cause of world peace and security would be best served by an American commitment to turn back an aggressor or defend a fragile democracy. But in the absence of a well-defined threat or clearly articulated strategic mission, it is hard to see how this expansion of NATO is anything other than a gamble that an institution created for one purpose is equally suited for the yet-to-be-determined purposes of a new time. 
Second, I believe that this expansion will have a deleterious effect on our relationship with Russia. At this critical time--when what was once our most formidable adversary stands at a delicate point between the continued climb toward democracy and freedom on the one side, and a fall backwards into heavily-armed nationalism on the other--I'm especially troubled that this proposed NATO expansion will push future Russian leaders in the wrong direction. 
As the end of this century approaches, Russia is still in possession of one of the world's most powerful military arsenals. A Russia with reborn territorial designs on her neighbors is the greatest imaginable potential threat to European stability and security. 
That is why it is so vital that we seek ratification and implimentation of the START II treaty with Russia, which would actually reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal. The Russian Duma has so far refused to take this step, but appears to be moving in that direction. If they interepret this expansion, however, as a hostile gesture in their direction, they may well refuse to ratify, leaving us all less safe than we might otherwise have been. 
The United States has made tremendous strides in our relationship with Russia since the fall of the Soviet system. American diplomacy now should be focused on consolidating those gains, and finding ways to help Russia complete its transition to democracy. Many experts in our own country, as well as many of the most credible pro-Western leaders in Russia itself, have warned us that expanding NATO could inflame nationalist passions, and lead to a turning away from the path of democracy and peaceful relations. That would be the most disastrous of unintended consequences, and must give us pause as we consider this step. 
Third, the cost of this initiative is anyone's guess, and must compel us to caution as well, particularly considering that the United States already pays a disproportionate share of NATO's costs. If NATO expansion were vital to our national security, then our country would be resolved to pay any price, in President Kennedy's timeless phrase. But we live in a fundamentally different time, one in which each country's security is determined as much by the quality of its schools and the cleanliness of its air and water than by the might of its armies and navies. Committing to an expanded military alliance which may entail far greater costs than the Administration has estimated could diminish our ability to make the investments that will make us safer and stronger. 
The Senate had an opportunity, through the amendment offered by Senator Harkin, to gain a better sense of the size of this financial commitment. I strongly supported that effort. Unfortunately, it did not prevail, and we are left with burning questions about the size of the financial commitment entailed by this treaty, and the effect that will have on our ability to address those domestic priorities which make us stronger as a nation. 
What is true for us is true for these struggling new democracies as well. As Senator Moynihan has pointed out so wisely, these countries are under no immediate threat. Their most pressing challenge is the development of growing economies, and the institutions of democracy. But if they join NATO, these struggling nations will be required to spend billions on the latest in military hardware instead of making critically needed investments in areas that lead to long-term benefit: infrastructure, education, environmental health, and many others. 
Decades of a failed communist system left these countries in economic ruin. I believe it is a testament to their energy and determination that they are slowly overcoming this legacy and building up new, vibrant free market economies. We should, in the name of international security, be doing everything possible to help them through this transition. 
I do not believe that anyone has properly assessed the impact that joining NATO, and making the necessary investments to participate in that military alliance, will have on our Eastern European friends' ability to continue a successful transition to market economics. And I do not believe we should jump pell-mell into such an enlargement until we have done so. 
The democratization of Eastern Europe is an exciting and hopeful development. As a child of the Cold War, I am awed by the transitions we have seen. The United States has a special responsibility to nurture freedom wherever it is seeking to plant its roots. But in the final analysis, it is not clear that extending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is the best way to do it. 
In this case, the burden of proof is on the proponents. We should not take so solemn a step as committing American lives to the protection of another country unless we are absolutely certain, beyond any doubt, that it is the wisest of possible courses. I remain unconvinced, and so I opposed the measure.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in submitting this resolution condemning the subsidized sale of European barley into the California barley market. 
Today several of us met with the European Union Ambassador, Mr. Hugo Paemon, to express our extreme concern about this shipment and about the future it bodes for the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union. Quite frankly, Mr. President, I think that we were heard but I am not sure, in the American vernacular, that Mr. Paemon quite `gets it.' 
Mr. President, I want to suggest that whether this is just a skirmish, or whether it is the first battle in what many believe could become a rapidly escalating conflict over trade in agricultural goods, for barley producers in Oregon and across America, there has been no more serious matter in the past decade. 
My language is strong, Mr. President, because it is very important that Senators understand that if this shipment proceeds it sets an extremely dangerous precedent for our agricultural trade practices. 
There is a very real concern in Oregon that if we allow this shipment of grain, the shipment of which would simply not be possible without an extraordinary level of European Union subsidy, then we will have opened the door to further shipments that could have devastating effects on our domestic commodity prices. 
For my colleagues who have not yet heard about this issue, a shipment of European Union barley, at a restitution subsidy rate of $51 per metric ton, that was originally targeted into the Saudi Arabian market was not sold. In search of a buyer, this shipment was subsequently sold into the California feed barley market at a price well below the then-current market price. 
Mr. President, the United States is the world's largest producer of feed grains and the world's largest exporter of feed grains. Were this European barley not subsidized at half of its value, we would not be having this discussion because there is no way it could have been priced competitively with domestic feed barley. 
I met this weekend with barley producers in Klamath Falls, Oregon. These folks are already seeing very tough barley prices this season, down about $5 a metric ton from what they have normally received over the decade. They are taking some hits as a consequence of our national policy through the Farm bill of phasing out income maintenance programs. And now the European Union is sending us a heavily subsidized shipment that is causing collapse of the market. Enough is enough. 
This European Union shipment, because it has the capacity to flood the California market for the next 9 months, has caused prices to drop $10 per ton in one week. One individual who operates a grain elevator in the Klamath described telling a local producer that he had lost some $20,000 in 48 hours as a result of this dumping of this subsidized barley into California. 
These farmers ask, correctly, that if ever there was a time for the federal government to come to the defense of American agriculture, now is that time. We face collapse of our American barley market because of this relatively unique occurrence; now is the time to go to the mat in defense of our producers against wholly subsidized foreign dumping. 
Mr. President, we should also recognize, and thank, the larger wholesalers of barley in California who passed up this sale, which to them represented I'm sure a very lucrative marketing opportunity. These companies understood the damage that the sale would do to their customers and most reliable suppliers, the U.S. barley producers. But surely if this sale is allowed to go forward, and other fire sales are allowed to follow, those firms will no longer be able to afford that posture. 
Mr. President, as a supporter of free trade, and of providing fast track authority, if we are to retain our credibility with American farmers then we must show the ability to act forcefully when faced with these sorts of irritants to free trade. There is no precedent for this sale, and if we allow it to go forward then those of us who believe in the promise of freer trade will have some difficulty explaining to our farmers that greater trade freedom is in their best interest. 
Mr. President, It is very important to all Oregon producers that the U.S. Senate act quickly to respond to this unprecedented attack on one segment of our agriculture industry. I urge the swift adoption of this resolution.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, the poster that is next to me today is a photograph of one of the most important doors in the world. It is an entry to the World Trade Organization, an organization where decisions are made on an ongoing basis that affect the lives of millions of Americans and billions of citizens around the world, decisions that are directly related to their ability to have good-paying jobs, decisions related to their health, their safety and their well-being. 
Mr. President, these are decisions, as our colleagues can see from this photograph next to me that recently appeared in the New York Times, that the World Trade Organization makes behind closed doors. In fact, they seem to think it is so important to do their business in secret that the World Trade Organization has posted it in five languages--five languages--just to make it clear that the public, not just the public in the United States, but citizens around the world, are barred from learning of the deliberations that go on behind those doors at the World Trade Organization. 
I do not come to this floor as a protectionist. In fact, I have voted for every market-opening trade agreement that has come before the Senate and, during my years in the other body. Trade, open and expanded trade, is the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest. In my home State of Oregon, one out of every five jobs depends on international trade. 
But I am concerned because the World Trade Organization's decisions have enormous implications for the daily lives of our citizens, and I do not think it is right that those decisions are made behind closed doors. I do not think that a new focus by the World Trade Organization on openness is inconsistent with the principles of expanded and free trade. 
If the World Trade Organization had open meetings and could hear evidence from outside experts, it is possible some of their decisions would have turned out differently. Take, for example, the recent case the United States lost involving shrimp imports. The World Trade Organization overturned a U.S. ban on imported shrimp caught without turtle excluder devices. If expert witnesses had been allowed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these devices in protecting an endangered species, I expect that the World Trade Organization would have upheld U.S. law. But experts were shut out of those proceedings. Environmental groups, just as so many business groups have done, condemned that ruling saying, `Three unaccountable trade bureaucrats sitting behind closed doors in Geneva should not have the power to make up rules that sabotage global environmental protection.' 
The World Trade Organization holds more than 150 scheduled meetings a year, and hundreds of others. According to World Trade Organization rules, the Ministerial Meeting, which is to be held at least once every 2 years, shall ordinarily be held in private. The meetings of the General Council are also held in private. All other World Trade Organization meetings follow the same rules. In fact, one observer noted the World Trade Organization carries out all its activities in strict confidentiality in meetings closed to the public, including the press and nongovernmental organizations. 
Next month, the world's major trading nations will meet in Geneva for the second ministerial conference. They will also be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the world trading system. I urge the President of the United States, if he chooses to go to Geneva, to use that opportunity to call for an end to the closed meetings of the World Trade Organization. 
A few weeks ago, with the bipartisan support of our colleagues, the Senate adopted my amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill that simply tells the President to instruct the U.S. Representatives to the World Trade Organization to open the organization's doors to the world's public. 
Today I am joined by several of my colleagues in a letter to the President urging that he attach a top priority to opening up the World Trade Organization. On a bipartisan basis, Senator Abraham, Senator Kerrey, Senator Connie Mack, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Rockefeller have joined me in urging that the United States not accept closed markets overseas, but also not accept closed doors in Geneva. 
Eliminating the secrecy of meetings takes on a greater sense of urgency in light of the growing power of the World Trade Organization. Just this year, the World Trade Organization is working behind closed doors on new rules on trade in agriculture, financial services, information technology, government procurement, and many other areas. 
As the World Trade Organization becomes more enmeshed in global standard-setting and multinational regulations, the agency's secrecy becomes even more disturbing. For example, an important industry group, the American Insurance Association, has publicly criticized the closed-door nature of the road to Geneva. 
The type of secrecy that is employed at the World Trade Organization would not be tolerated here in the United States. In our country, when a Federal agency proposes a new rule or regulation, it must seek public comment. We hold hearings. There is debate in the press. 
But that fundamental openness is missing in Geneva. The World Trade Organization doesn't have to seek public comment on its actions. It doesn't have to allow the public to watch its deliberations. And this is wrong. The World Trade Organization ought to be held accountable for its decisions and actions. They should not be allowed to withhold from the public information about their activities in meetings. 
The press has a special place in the gallery here in the U.S. Senate. In Geneva, the delegates vote by secret ballot about whether to release a statement after the meeting is over. 
The President of the United States, to his great credit, has called for greater openness in the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement process. This was listed as a principal U.S. trade negotiating objective in the fast track legislation of last year. In recent testimony before a House committee, senior U.S. officials said that the United States will seek greater transparency in the settlement process in the World Trade Organization. And Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's first trade negotiator, has said, `These are very important issues. But it is like they are being dealt with somewhere in a closet and no one is watching.' 
Agricultural trade is just one area where private decisionmaking at the World Trade Organization has enormous public implications. Since the 1980s, food imports to the United States have doubled. At the same time, while most imported food is 
wholesome, public health scientists are saying they are seeing more outbreaks of disease linked to imported food--raspberries from Guatemala; carrots from Peru; strawberries, scallions, and cantaloupes from Mexico--the list goes on and on, and some point to the illnesses from this produce as an unintended byproduct of the fact that the safety issues are not debated in the open at the World Trade Organization. 
So, our message is simple. The decisions of the World Trade Organization on food safety or other key standards should not be made behind closed doors. The World Trade Organization has the regulatory power to decide whether an Oregon wheat farmer can sell his wheat overseas and whether an Oregon cattle rancher can sell his beef in Europe. A November 28, 1997, WTO report on relations with nongovernmental organizations found that the World Trade Organization restricts the availability of documents on these and many other important issues for our constituents. 
The World Trade Organization's dispute settlement process is binding. Last November, an opinion piece in the Journal of Commerce stated:  
World Trade Organization dispute settlement process operates largely in the dark with confidential briefs, closed hearings, unsigned opinions and non-transparent, ad hoc panel appointments. Clearly defined rules on procedure, conflicts of interest and other ethical issues for litigants and judges are not established. 
Opening dispute settlement to public view, as the President has called for and as our bipartisan group of Senators calls for today, is essential to maintaining the integrity of the process. 
Last December, 129 Members of the Swiss Parliament criticized the World Trade Organization for its lack of democracy, calling for greater transparency. The Swiss should know. They have a front row seat on the proceedings in Geneva, and even they believe that it is difficult, if not impossible, to come up with information about these important proceedings. 
I close with this last comment. The call for openness at the World Trade Organization is a pro-trade position. It will strengthen this organization. Sunshine will be beneficial to the cause of free and expanded trade, a cause that I have consistently voted for in my years in the U.S. Congress. But if there is a continued lack of accountability, if there is a continued obsession with secrecy, I believe that is going to undermine the cause of expanded trade in the world. I am very hopeful that as we look to bring more openness to the World Trade Organization, we will see the importance of doing the public's business in public all through the world. 
Mr. President, many of our colleagues are aware that I am trying to bring more openness to the U.S. Senate, with Senator Grassley, by barring the right of a Senator to put a secret hold or objection on business here in the U.S. Senate. So I am very hopeful that this year will see changes, changes in the rules in the U.S. Senate, that will bring more openness to the way decisions are made here, changes at the World Trade Organization so there is more openness and more accountability in the way decisions are made there. 
I hope I will be able to come back to this floor in the months ahead without this poster, and say the World Trade Organization has taken down the `private' signs and shown the public how it is making its decisions and why. Doing the public's business in public is more likely to generate confidence in the important decisions that are made at the World Trade Organization and here in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today we confirmed an outstanding lawyer, a knowledgeable and diligent servant of justice and great judicial nominee from my State of Oregon. It was a great honor to present to the Senate the name of Mr. Garr `Mike' King to be a United States District Judge for the District of Oregon. 
Mr. King comes before the Senate today with the bipartisan support of the Oregon Congressional delegation, and with broad support from both Oregon's law enforcement community and our state's legal community. Mr. King has served as a member of the Oregon State Bar Association since 1963 and has distinguished himself as one of the finest attorneys in the state. During this period of time, Mr. King has developed a sterling reputation for integrity, hard work, intelligence, and diligence. 
In addition to his outstanding career as an attorney in private practice, Mr. King also has served as Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney and was elected to the Board of Regents of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He helped draft the Oregon Rules for Civil Procedure, authored the arbitration rules for Multnomah County and served as an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association. He has been active in the U.S. District Court Mediation program since it was initiated and has worked quite closely with the Court to improve the federal mediation system. 
Mr. King is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps who served his country with honor from 1954 to 1957. He has lived in Oregon for the past 35 years and is a proud father of seven children who is deeply involved in his church and community affairs. As those of my colleagues who were at Mike's confirmation hearing can attest, I think he single-handedly managed to fill about half of the hearing room with family members from all over the country, and I believe that speaks volumes about the kind of caring, concerned and committed family man Mike King is. 
As with previous recommendations that I have made for the federal bench, the recommendation of Mr. King was preceded by an extensive bipartisan screening effort undertaken by a committee of leading Oregon attorneys. The selection committee was appointed with input from all the members of the Oregon Congressional delegation and the Governor's office. All applicants reviewed by the committee were evaluated on three criteria: judicial temperament, fitness to serve on the federal bench, and legal qualifications. Mr. King was rated very highly by the committee, and after personally interviewing him, I found him very well qualified for this position. 
I want to again thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch for moving us to this point in the process. I am very grateful for both the amount of time and good counsel you continue to give me in the consideration of my region's needs on the federal bench. 
I also thank my colleague, Senator Smith, for his efforts on behalf of this nominee. Senator Smith and I have now worked together in support of two other fine candidates to the federal bench, both of whom have been confirmed by the Senate. 
I am certain that Mike King will bring to the federal bench the same intelligence, legal skill and integrity that he has brought to his work as one of our state's most respected attorneys.

Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the cooperation of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, in working with me on this matter. My purpose in offering the original amendment in Committee was truth in budgeting. The truth I am seeking has been masked by inflation. With inflation being lower than anticipated, the CBO and GAO estimate there is as much as a $3 billion inflationary windfall surplus in the budget for 1999, and as much as a $26 billion surplus over the next five years. My concern is the American taxpayer never sees this inflationary windfall and probably doesn't even know it exists. The money is not accounted for by the agencies and is not returned to the taxpayer. Unfortunately, the windfall appears to end up as walk-around money in the pockets of bureaucrats. That is why I am pleased that together with the Chairman of the Budget Committee we will request the General Accounting Office to tell Congress by May 15 the exact amount of the inflationary windfall for FY99, how the agencies intend to use the inflationary windfall and how CBO can go about making this calculation for future years. Our request will also direct the GAO by August 15 to develop for us a methodology for correctly calculating inflationary estimates that is applicable to both defense and non-defense spending and how the agencies expect to use the additional funds. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the GAO's chart for FY99 Economic Adjustments as well as the CBO's March 24, 1998 letter to me on the inflationary windfall.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 
In Oregon and across America, people are starting to think that `affordable housing' is the biggest oxymoron since `jumbo shrimp'. Decent houses have become unaffordable for many working moderate-income families. Mr. President, today I am introducing the `Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act.' This bill encourages all governments to streamline regulations to help bring home ownership within the reach of middle class families who can only dream of it today. 
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) says that housing is affordable if all costs--mortgage, utilities, property taxes and insurance--consume no more than 30 percent of household gross income. Yet in Clackamas County, Oregon, for example, the median family income is $49,600, while the average cost of a house is $200,000. This makes it virtually impossible for many people, especially young families, to obtain all the benefits of home ownership. 
While many factors contribute to real estate prices, one of the main things that drives prices higher is the proliferation of government rules and fees. In Portland, fully 5 percent of the average home price of $155,400 comes directly from permit fees and so-called `system delivery charges,' some of which may serve worthwhile purposes, but should be re-examined as a total package. All of these added costs are eventually passed onto the buyer and often keep families from buying homes they could otherwise afford. 
The federal government has a role to play in the affordable housing debate. It can promote community goals of environmental protection, access for people with disabilities, and better transportation planning, in the context of their financial impact on home buyers. 
This bill, the Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act of 1998, would do this by encouraging the formation of Barrier Removal Councils in every local jurisdiction that receives HUD block grants for community development. Mr. President, back home in Oregon I have assembled a housing task force to advise me on housing policies. My task force told me that communities need to sit down and examine the issue of affordable housing before the bricks are set and the mortar is poured. That's why these Barrier Removal Councils are important. These councils would be charged with taking the kind of big-picture approach that can identify ways to lower barriers to home ownership that overlapping and outdated regulations cause. In other words, we need to look at the forest as a whole, not just one tree at a time. 
This bill is similar to legislation I introduced last week to establish a special bicameral Sunset Committee in Congress to review every federal program every five years. Programs, regulations, and laws tend to pile up because legislatures at both the local and federal levels generally work to address specific problems, one at a time, often forgetting to examine the cumulative effect of prior laws. There is a need to set up mechanisms to examine regulations affecting affordable housing in their totality. This bill would also call for a special national conference every two years to discuss regulations that may be barriers, and creates a national clearinghouse to provide information to communities on the work being done to remove barriers in other parts of the country. 
This legislation will help home buyers by improving some of the ways the Federal Housing Administration--the lender for many middle-income families--operates. It allows them to make loans to more people, by redefining the areas they operate in. And it simplifies the convoluted process that FHA uses to determine the down payment that a family is expected to make. You should not need Bill Gates' money to afford a home and you should not need his math skills to figure out how much your house is going to cost. 
Finally, Mr. President, our bill asks the federal government to take the impact on home buyers into account by requiring all federal agencies to include a housing impact analysis, except on policies where there is no impact. The Housing Impact Statement focuses the attention of agencies on the question `how does this policy affect home prices' every time it tries to solve a problem by instituting a new regulation. It is always important for government at every level to understand the consequences of its actions. This is an effort to try to instill that good government philosophy into the housing area. 
Home ownership has always been part of the American Dream. It is everyone's responsibility to keep it from just being a dream for working families.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that would improve and modernize the current system for accessing information about hazardous chemicals in the workplace. This legislation will make it easier for workers to protect themselves against chemical exposure risks in their workplaces by giving them online access to essential safety information. It will also make this information more quickly accessible in the event of an emergency. 
Under current regulations, employers are required to have available in the workplace Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) describing every chemical ever used at the site. The MSDS contains information about the chemical and what to do in the event a worker is exposed by ingesting it, having it splash on the skin or in the eyes. 
Employers typically keep MSDS sheets in hug binders making them difficult to access quickly during actual exposure incidents. As a result, emergency personnel may have to flip through page after page of information to find out how to respond to the specific chemical exposure. This complies with the law, but it's not the best way to get critical information in an emergency. 
The better approach is to have the information accessible online. This can greatly reduce the time it takes to get essential information on the proper first aid procedures in the event of exposure. In some cases, this faster response can literally mean the difference between life and death. 
The bill I am introducing today allows--but does not require--electronic access to MSDS information, so there is no mandate that employers have to switch to an electronic system. This legislation simply updates the current workplace safety system to recognize the widespread use of computers in the workplace. It merely provides an additional option that can yield better protection for workers with less hassle for employers. 
My legislation requires chemical hazard information to be written in plain English, so that workers and emergency personnel can better understand the risks and what to do in an emergency. The MSDS sheets now in use are typically written by lawyers to protect the chemical manufacturers from liability. Because they are often written in legalese, it is difficult for workers to understand MSDS, especially in emergencies. 
For example, instead of simply stating, `Keep this material away from your eyes,' the instructions on one MSDS say `Avoid ocular contact.' Workplace safety information should be understandable to all employees without having to look up every other word in the dictionary. 
My legislation addresses this problem by requiring information on new hazardous chemicals brought into the workplace to be written in easily understandable English. 
This legislation has the support of Oregon OSHA officials, industry and union safety officials. A companion bill introduced in the House this week has bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support this common sense workplace safety initiative.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a friend and a constituent of mine who is a great legal thinker and writer, a pillar in her community, a respected and valuable Associate Justice on the Oregon Supreme Court, and someone who I believe will be an outstanding federal court of appeals judge--Justice Susan Graber. 
Let me begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and in particular the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah for acting on the nomination of Justice Graber and holding a confirmation hearing earlier this year. 
Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Justice Susan Graber for appointment as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Justice Graber comes before the Senate today with the strong bipartisan support of the Oregon Congressional delegation, with broad support from Oregon's law enforcement community and with strong support from the bench and bar. From all across my home state, from both sides of the aisle in Oregon politics, from judges and litigants alike, I have heard the praise accorded to this dedicated jurist, who has just recently reached her 10th anniversary as an appellate judge --at the ripe old age of 48. 
I will not dwell long on her outstanding qualifications for this position--a graduate of Wellesley College and Yale Law School, Susan Graber has excelled at every step of her fine legal career. From the moment she took the bench right up until the present day, Susan Graber remains the youngest--and I think most will agree, one of the most productive--justices of the Oregon Supreme Court. 
Through her authorship of over 300 opinions in the past 10 years, Justice Graber has garnered praise from the bench and bar as being the epitome of a careful and non-ideological judge whose centrist approach has helped promote a consensus-building and collegial atmosphere on this important court. And Justice Graber's opinions point out another fact--this is an individual who respects and understands her role as a judge. She understands very clearly the difference between being a legislator and being a judge, and her opinions reflect a firm adherence to the law as written by the Oregon Legislature. She knows the role of a judge is to follow, not to make the law, and that is exactly what we need on the federal appellate bench. 
I am certain that Justice Graber will bring to the U.S. Court of Appeals the same intelligence, thoroughness and integrity that she has brought to her work as a State Supreme Court judge and as a careful and thoughtful student of the law. I want to again thank Chairman Hatch and the Senate leadership for moving us to this point in the process, and I urge my colleagues to confirm this tremendous nominee.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, someone once said that the only thing which truly lives forever is a Government program in Washington, DC. I am introducing legislation today to rein in the growth of those big Government programs and to require the Congress to stop rubberstamping programs in this body. The sunset legislation that I put forward today will require the key programs of Government to face regular scrutiny and stand or fall on their merits. 
This legislation would give Congress a new and powerful tool to rein in the bureaucracy and create a Federal Government that would be smaller, less costly, and more accountable to the American people. 
The legislation that I introduce today would establish a special bipartisan, bicameral congressional committee which would be charged with reviewing the key programs of Government every 5 years. Any U.S. citizen of voting age could petition this committee for the termination of these programs. If the committee recommended termination and Congress failed to reauthorize that program within 1 year of that recommendation, it would then become impossible to provide any appropriation for that program without a three-fifths vote in both Houses. In other words, a sunset law would provide a mechanism for shutting the door on unneeded, mismanaged, or failed efforts in Government. 
This legislation would end the inertia which sometimes carries Federal programs forward in perpetuity. It would be a meaningful, effective check on the continual growth of Government. 
Mr. President, I think that each of us sees, as we look at the Federal budget and carry out our duties, some programs that we believe have served their purpose and can be terminated, some programs that were mistakes in the first place, some that were well-intentioned and just have not worked out. 
I look, for example, at programs like the 1872 mining statute which costs the Government about $1 billion per year; the tobacco subsidy programs where we continue to pay out vast sums year after year and then have to encourage, through public education campaigns, individuals not to smoke. I see fighter jet programs that cost billions; the $4.7 billion National Ignition Facility. The list goes on and on. 
So it is time, Mr. President, to look at new tools to put the brakes on some of this spending. The legislation that I am introducing today will do that by putting an end to programs and providing an end date for those programs that would otherwise sit on the shelf forever. Twenty-four States, including my own, already have statutes like the Federal sunset law that I propose to the Senate today. 
What has been the experience of those sunset laws? One analysis found that during a 5-year period, as many as 23 percent of the agencies reviewed under States' sunset laws were eliminated, including some legislative dinosaurs that would oversee lightning rod salesmen, septic tank cleaners, tourist guides, massage therapists, rainmakers, horse hunters, textbook salesmen, and even tattoo artists. 
Sunset laws have given the State governments the chance to streamline and rationalize the myriad of agencies that spring up as governmental bodies respond to the concerns of the moment. I am of the view that the Federal Government needs a similar process to help clean up what former President Reagan used to call `the puzzle palaces on the Potomac.' 
At its heart, the legislation that I introduce today calls for using a sunset concept on Federal programs as a tool for good and careful government. There is a tendency in Washington, DC, to focus exhaustive attention on programs before they are created and then virtually ignore them from that point out. I sat on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee as a Member of the other body, and I saw firsthand that the Congress can spend an extraordinary amount of time and effort trying to pass laws and very little to actually see if what is on the books works. 
Requiring that each and every program is periodically reauthorized would focus the Congress' attention and the attention of the media on the operations and effectiveness of individual Government programs in a way that is simply not done today. It will, in my view, increase the pressure on agency managers to perform and do so in a cost-effective fashion. I suspect that some Federal agencies will function a bit differently when they know that there is a certainty of accountability and potential termination of their program that hangs over them. 
Mr. President, when any Member of this body has a town meeting at home, they will hear from citizens who are tired of Government programs that don't work and still grow larger each year. Now is the time for the Senate to establish a system to assure that only those parts of Government are kept that work and that there is a renewed effort to terminate programs which simply take up space and waste the taxpayers' money. Our constituents deserve better. 
The States have found that sunset laws can provide them the opportunity to reduce waste while still keeping programs that work, and I believe that it is high time for the U.S. Senate to pass favorably on the sunset concept that is working at the State level across this country.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the pending business, I believe, is the Chafee-Wyden-Graham amendment. I want to take a few minutes to explain to my colleagues what we are pursuing with this amendment. Before Senator Byrd leaves the floor, I want to express my thanks to him for the very extensive input and help that he has given this Member, both on the entire bill and particularly on the provisions that relate to streamlining of the ISTEA permit process both on the transportation and the environmental side. I thank Senator Byrd.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, another way to describe this amendment, which deals with the transportation and environmental review process that is central to getting these projects on line and dealing with our transportation issues, is the `do-it-right-once' amendment. 
What we have in this country today is essentially a disjointed process for doing transportation and environmental reviews. In effect, you have one track going down the road trying to address the various requirements essential to OK'ing a project from the transportation side. You then have a separate effort going forward to deal with environmental reviews. Instead of the two efforts being combined at every step of the process, time and money is wasted as these separate undertakings go forward. So what you have is an extraordinary amount of duplication. You have duplication as it relates to the environmental side and as it relates to the transportation side, and you waste an extraordinary amount of time as it relates to getting these projects actually constructed. 
I think, as every Senator knows, for transportation projects time is money. Delays in approving transportation projects not only increase the cost of these projects; they also cause lost productivity to our economy and added stress for the commuters that are stuck in traffic. 
This bill is the result of extensive bipartisan discussion. Senator Graham and I began this in the committee many months ago. Senator Smith of New Hampshire has been extremely helpful in this effort and, of course, Senators Chafee and Byrd have been very extensively involved. We have now forged a comprehensive package that will streamline transportation and environmental reviews and bring much-needed relief for these key projects. 
The bill now will increase the funding for critical highway projects that will ensure that this money is better spent, because we will be speeding up the process for getting the projects built. 
Let me be very clear to the Senate. We are not talking about changing the environmental laws in any way. I wouldn't support that kind of effort, and my cosponsors of this amendment wouldn't support it either. This effort to streamline transportation environmental reviews, in fact, keeps every one of the environmental laws in place. It simply says that we are going to improve the decisionmaking process by building the consideration of environmental factors into transportation decisions at the front end of the process rather than at the tail end as has so often happens. 
So if we were to do nothing else in this bill, nothing else but to say at the beginning of an effort to get a transportation project built we were going to start consulting on environmental issues at that time, I think it would be a worthy endeavor. But this legislation doesn't just streamline the process; it complies with the environmental laws, and it ensures that there is early consideration of all realistic alternatives. In the urban areas, that means looking at transit, at bike paths, and a variety of nontraditional transportation solutions. But we don't require pointless consideration of these approaches in places where they don't make sense. 
Today's changes also increase the opportunities for public involvement. Many of our colleagues have been visited by transportation groups, by State officials, by environmental leaders, saying that they wanted public involvement early in the decisionmaking process. This amendment ensures that is done. In my view, it also increases the chance for early public support when the decisions are made rather than, as happens so often today, having public opposition develop later in the process, which can hold things up for many months. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, some have argued that you might do even more than this amendment envisages. They say, put transportation officials in charge of everything; put them in charge of transportation and environmental matters. Under that approach, which I think would be a mistake, I think we are not going to end up saving a lot of time in the review process. More likely, it may lead to questionable environmental decisions and considerable delay when these decisions are challenged in court. There is a better route to improving our transportation system. We can make the process faster, cheaper, and better while complying with all of our environmental laws at the same time. 
I see that the chairman of the committee has returned. I want to express my thanks to Chairman Chafee. When I and Senator Graham brought him this ISTEA streamlining amendment last summer, he gave us considerable time as we sought then to bring together the industry and environmental groups to support it. Also, the ranking minority member, Senator Baucus, who has helped me as a new Senator on a variety of issues, was involved at every step of the way. I thank Senator Baucus for that effort. 
We are here now as a result of the deliberations that began this summer. This is an amendment that saves time and money and helps strengthen our environmental laws and public support for them at the same time. I urge support of the amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, the amendment that was agreed to by the Environment Committee with respect to funding for these critical transportation programs for our country really ought to be called the `Truth In Transportation Funding Act' because it ensures that gasoline taxes collected for transportation purposes will actually be spent on those critical transportation projects. 
For too long in America, the Congress has played a budgetary shell game--pretending to put funds away in various transportation programs but actually slipping those funds into other spending accounts. 
Mr. President and colleagues, this con game has been closed down. Now Congress is on the way to making the highway trust fund sacrosanct again. Transportation taxes will, indeed, pay for transportation services. This means that the dollars will be used on the ground where they are needed, not squirreled away in some account that never seems to be spent. 
Today, the Congress will be in a position to bring much-needed relief to citizens who face transportation gridlock across our country. The Congress is adding an additional $26 billion of transportation spending to what is now in the Senate ISTEA II bill. This translates for our State into an additional $40 million per year. 
In our State, transportation dollars are now stretched so thin that the State department of transportation is not developing new projects. We have focused our efforts on merely maintaining existing roads because we did not have funding available to pay for improvements. Until now, there was little hope on the horizon that more funding would be forthcoming. 
The Environment Committee's amendment is like emergency surgery for Oregon's clogged transportation arteries. If Congress now passes this bill, it will be possible to think in terms of improving the health of our transportation system instead of how to avoid further deterioration. We will be in a position to plan improvements to reduce congestion in an already overtaxed system. We can start to think about the future and how to handle our State's growing population, and many other parts of our country will be able to do the same. 
Mr. President and colleagues, I have always believed that you cannot have big league quality of life with little league transportation systems. In the modern world, a transportation bill is about so much more than how you get from point A to point B. A strong infrastructure is one of the basic ingredients to any recipe for economic growth. It is one of the key things that our businesses look at as they consider where to locate and one of the principal contributors to our quality of life. 
I support the Environment Committee's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support the additional funding needed to build the transportation system our Nation will need to compete in the 21st century. 
Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that I intend, in the days ahead, to take to this floor to discuss other parts of this important legislation. Our State has been a leader nationally in developing an innovative approach to managed growth in our country. This legislation allocates $20 million per year to reward those States and communities that have been willing to take fresh, creative approaches to handling growth. 
I am also working, and there was discussion in the Environment Committee today, with Senator Graham, Senator Bob Smith, and others, on a way to streamline the process and ensure that the dollars that are allocated for transportation projects are spent in the most effective way. In the past, there has really been a disconnect between the way transportation dollars are allocated and the environmental permits that are associated with actually getting those projects built and on line. We have been working on a 
bipartisan basis to bring together environmental leaders, builders, and those who were involved in planning our roads, and we believe that we are on our way to coming up with a streamlined system that is going to make it possible for us to save dollars and ensure that the transportation projects are built expeditiously while we still comply with the critically needed environmental laws for our country. I intend, in the days ahead, to talk about those commendable features of this legislation as well. 
I want to conclude by congratulating my friend, Senator Baucus, from Montana, and Senator Chafee for an extraordinary bit of work. This bill is heavy lifting. There are Senators with very strong views. There are regional differences of opinion. But I think we have been able to forge a piece of legislation that is going to make a difference in the 21st century. 
I conclude my remarks by especially praising our chairman, who has entered the Chamber, John Chafee, and Senator Baucus, the ranking minority member, because it is their work that has made it possible for us to come to the floor today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we now have a seemingly permanent political campaign in America. We have an election the first Tuesday in November, people sleep in on Wednesday, and it starts all over again on Thursday. The money chase simply does not stop. I came to the Senate after a hard-fought and, frankly, less than pleasant campaign against an individual I am proud to call both a friend and a colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. In the final weeks of that campaign, we made a decision to unilaterally take off the air all television commercials about Senator Smith. I thought it was time to talk about issues, time to focus, with the voters, on the real questions that were important to their future. 
I am of the view that the American people need to know that today is the day when reform will be passed or defeated. The cloture vote on McCain-Feingold is the vote on campaign finance reform. It is the vote for a Senator who wants to address this problem of independent expenditures. It is the vote on the proposition that we need to have more time spent with voters, less time with raising money. 
Mr. President, I urge passage of the bill. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the additional time.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the American political system is profoundly broken. I experienced this in my recent campaign for this office, which was why I made it my first official act, fifteen minutes after being sworn in to the Senate, to cosponsor the McCain-Feingold bill. 
We have all seen the phenomenon, in our own campaigns and in others, where they hold the election on Tuesday, you sleep in on Wednesday, and by Thursday afternoon it has started all over again. There is no interval in which to focus exclusively on the public's business. 
I don't think that anyone in this body likes that situation. I have never heard a group of Senators talking among themselves about how wonderful the seemingly permanent campaign is. Well today we have a chance to do something about it. The McCain-Feingold bill won't fix everything, but it will be the most significant step in the right direction in a long, long time. 
This bill also takes on one of the greatest threats that has developed in recent years to the quality of our nation's public dialogue, the recent rash of so-called `independent expenditure campaigns.' 
Political campaigns ought to be an opportunity for people who want to serve in public office to not only explain themselves, but to listen and learn. I have tried when running for office to spend as much time as possible listening to what the people I meet at shopping centers and bus stops and ice cream socials have to say. I want to hear what they think and I want to talk to them in a serious way about the fights that I want to wage on their behalf, the issues that I feel passionately about, and the direction I think our country ought to be headed. 
But in the past few years, new tactics have been developed by a variety of groups on both the left and the right who seek to insert themselves in between candidates and the public they seek to serve. In these races, the candidates at times become mere pawns in some larger battle for influence. 
In the race that my colleague from Oregon and I ran against each other, there were ads that were run that were probably meant to help me, and ads that were run that were meant to hurt me. I think that Senator Smith and I would both agree that we both would have preferred if all of these ads had never been aired. The McCain-Feingold bill is the best solution available at this time to clean up the excess of these independent expenditures. 
Democracy is a precious and fragile gift that has been left to us by previous generations, Mr. President. I don't expect that the republic will collapse tomorrow if we fail to pass this bill, but make no mistake about it, the steady erosion of the public's confidence in their leaders is a dangerous trend. We can make a real beginning today. The American people want this system fixed, and they have a right to expect that it will be. Let's not disappoint them again.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, by focusing on Social Security reform, educational quality, and strengthening the rights of health care patients, last night's speech zeroed in on the issues that I have been hearing Oregonians talk about during the course of 12 town meetings this month. Certainly a budget surplus, no matter how you count to create that surplus, is not going to bring us into some sort of budget nirvana if it is followed by more years of deficits. And I thought what was especially constructive about last night's speech was it zeroed in on the critical questions of retirement and health care that clearly drive the budget and the deficit for the long-term. The fact is you cannot have long-term budget discipline unless you deal with Social Security and health care, and I think last night we heard a call to arms, to dig in on a bipartisan basis on those key issues. 
Now, with respect to Social Security--and I am sure it is the case for all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I can report that in my State more young people think that they are going to have a date with an extraterrestrial than think they are going to get a Social Security check. They look at these whopper payroll taxes that they are paying today, more than 6 percent for the worker, more than 6 percent for the employer, millions of Americans paying more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes, and they see that essentially their retirement contribution in the past has gone to a great extent to operate the budget. 
I think it is fair to say--and there has been a considerable amount of discussion of this in the last few weeks --that the budget surplus in America is to a great extent the Social Security surplus in America. I think last night we learned that the real challenge ahead--the President essentially called for what amounts to a year-long national teach-in on retirement finance in America--is to be straight with people. We are going to have to talk about the tough choices and in particular how we protect the millions of Americans for whom Social Security is a lifeline, vulnerable folks who every month are balancing their food costs against their medical bills and medical bills against their pharmaceutical bills, and the question is, how do we take care of those vulnerable folks and still get ready for this demographic tsunami--75, 80 million baby boomers that are going to retire early in the next century. 
But it seems to me that if we spend the next year working on a bipartisan basis to dig into these issues, look at a variety of different approaches--I am particularly attracted to the idea of trying to stimulate more private saving; I think there are a variety of ways in which that can be done--we will have said on our watch, on our watch, Madam President--and I have enjoyed serving with you on the Senate Committee on Aging--we will be able to say that on our watch we did not duck the tough and difficult questions. And certainly they are just as difficult with respect to health care as they are to retirement finance. 
I come from a part of the United States where we have perhaps the highest concentration of managed care in the country. In fact, in my hometown of Portland, more than half of the older people are in HMOs, are in managed care, and the challenge always is, even in a hometown like mine where we have a lot of good managed care, how do you hold the cost down while still protecting the rights of patients in those health plans. 
I am of the view that a lot of those folks feel powerless today. Frankly, they feel powerless throughout the health system, whether they are in an HMO or a fee-for-service plan or one of these hybrids that is a little bit of each. And I think that we as a body differ on lots of aspects about health care. Certainly you can differ on the role of the Federal Government, State government, tax policy, and a variety of issues, but I, for the life of me, cannot understand why any of us would not support what we heard last night with respect to patients being told about all their options in the health care system. Disagree all you want about the kind of services that ought to be part of a health plan but let us not disagree on the fundamental right to know what treatment might be available to you and what your options are. The same with the right of appeal, the right to make sure that if you felt you did not get a fair shake from the health care system you would have an opportunity to be heard and you could have another chance to make sure that your claim for services was addressed in a fair way. 
This issue, the question of protecting the rights of patients in health plans while holding costs down, is the essence of our challenge in health care. Of course you can hold costs down if you don't give people any care. That is a walk in the park. Anybody can do that. That is not the kind of health care system we want. We want one that both holds costs down and protects the quality of health care in our country. We have been able to achieve some of that success in my home State. I am convinced we can do it in every community in Oregon and across the country, but it is going to mean, as we heard last night, stepping forward, stepping up to the key issues. 
Madam President, what I was especially pleased about with respect to last night's speech was the call for bipartisanship. I think that is critical to taking on these key issues such as retirement and health care. Again, in our home State, that's the kind of government that we are trying to practice. I can tell you that my colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator Gordon Smith and I, after we ran against each other for the seat to replace Bob Packwood--of all people, we could probably have come here and quarreled about all kinds of issues. We have not wanted to make that part of our service. We wanted to make part of our service tackling these issues on a bipartisan basis, in a way that makes sense for Oregon and our country. That is why, as new members of the Budget Committee, we joined in the last session in terms of Medicare reimbursement reform. 
As the Presiding Officer of this body knows, regarding much of the Medicare reimbursement system, since its inception the program has actually rewarded folks for being inefficient and penalized States for holding costs down. Senator Smith and I thought that was particularly unfair to our constituents, who have done so much heavy lifting to get the health care system back on track. We worked with other Senators, leaders on both sides, and were able to make some very dramatic changes in that reimbursement system. It has an eye-glazing name called the AAPCC, the Average Adjusted Per Capita Costs, but it's the guts of reimbursement. And I am convinced that when, on a bipartisan basis, colleagues can work for those kinds of changes, and we were successful last session, we can certainly rise to the challenge that we were given last night and move ahead with respect to reform as it relates to health maintenance organizations--consumer rights, like the right to full information and the right to appeal. 
So I am optimistic, as we go forward in the days ahead to tackle these issues, Madam President. I think we have an opportunity on our watch to say that we did not duck, that we understand that these issues, with respect to retirement and health care financing, are the biggest issues that in the past folks in politics ducked. We cannot afford to do that any longer. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues on those questions in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of a superb State judge, a pillar in her community, a devoted mother of five wonderful sons and a personal friend, an individual who I believe will make an outstanding Federal district judge, Judge Ann L. Aiken. 
Let me begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the Senate Judiciary Committee and particularly to Chairman Hatch and the ranking Democrat, Senator Leahy. Both Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy carry an enormous workload, and I want to express my appreciation to both of them for all the time and good counsel that they have given Senator Smith and myself with respect to Oregon's needs on the Federal bench. 
I especially want to thank at this time my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, for his truly extraordinary efforts on behalf of Judge Aiken. I think this Senate can see from Senator Smith's eloquence and his commitment to Judge Aiken how strongly he feels about this appointment. He has made extensive efforts with our colleagues to ensure that Judge Aiken would be before the U.S. Senate. 
I want to express my appreciation to Senator Smith for all of those efforts on Judge Aiken's behalf and to join Chairman Hatch in saying that I do not believe we could be here today without the extraordinary work of Senator Smith. I want him to know how much I appreciate those efforts. He knows Judge Aiken extremely well. Those joint efforts date back for years, as Senator Smith has stated, and it has been a pleasure to work with him on this, dating back to the days when he was president of the Oregon State Senate. 
Also at this time, I want to thank Congressman Peter DeFazio, a personal friend of Judge Aiken's who has worked with her on many important community activities. Congressman DeFazio has been a vociferous advocate of Judge Aiken's candidacy, and he has done a good job of keeping the debate focused on getting Judge Aiken to this point. And I want to express my appreciation to him. 
Mr. President, Judge Aiken's journey to be considered on the 
floor of the Senate has been a long one, and not just in terms of the 3,000 miles she traveled from Oregon for those confirmation hearings. 
Her journey formally began in 1994, when I put together a bipartisan group of Oregonians to review her qualifications. 
In January of 1995, I recommended to President Clinton, with the strong bipartisan support of the Oregon congressional delegation, that Ann Aiken be named to the Federal bench. 
As Senator Smith has noted, Judge Aiken's support for this nomination spans the political spectrum. Liberals are for Judge Aiken, conservatives are for Judge Aiken, moderates are for Judge Aiken, Democrats, Republicans; across all political boundaries, Oregonians have lined up behind this outstanding judge. 
It is my view that these many endorsements are pouring in because of the hard work and thoroughness that has marked Ann Aiken's career to date. And I would especially like to reference her work on crime. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, this is an especially important issue to me. Before I came to the U.S. Congress, first as a Member of the House, I was co-director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, a senior citizens group. And I found that many of these older folks were afraid to have meetings after 4 or 5 at night because of their fear of crime. And so I vowed, as a Member of Congress, that I would put a specific focus on law-enforcement issues in my service in the Congress. 
As a Member of the House, I joined Senator Specter in authoring the career criminal law, a law which prescribes tough punishments and no parole sentences for career criminals. 
Last Congress, I joined Senator Hatch in his efforts, his yeoman's work, to deal with the scourge of methamphetamines. And I have repeatedly--repeatedly--voted to impose the death penalty on heinous crimes in our society. 
So I take a back seat to no individual with respect to support for tough law enforcement. And I want to tell my colleagues in the U.S. Senate that Judge Aiken did not win all that support from law-enforcement groups in Oregon by accident. She won the support of the Association of District Attorneys and the Police Officers' Association because of her toughness on crime. 
As my colleague, Senator Smith, has noted this morning, repeatedly she has sought to impose the toughest possible sentences. And because Judge Aiken has a true mastery of the Oregon sentencing guidelines, she frequently is able to impose sentences that are significantly longer than any other judge on the bench. 
She has worked for a new approach to juvenile justice that ensures that young people who commit crimes have to face consequences. It would change the juvenile justice system as we know it. Youngsters would understand that the justice system is based on personal responsibility and individual accountability when they perpetrate those offenses. And the changes that have been made came about because Judge Aiken worked on a bipartisan basis with leaders of our State like Senator Smith to get that done. 
So she did not win all that support from law enforcement by accident. And she would not have the bipartisan support of her two U.S. Senators today were it not for the fact that she took a tough and fair approach with respect to law enforcement. 
Judge Aiken is also a person who knows how to squeeze an hour out of a minute. Not only does she maintain a rigorous judicial schedule, but the list of task forces that she has chaired and the boards on which she has served number in the dozens. She has been on the board of directors of Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), a program in which we take special pride in our State because it allows us to advocate for young people in our society and focus on trying to help them get their lives on track. 
On top of all this, somehow she finds time to be a caring and involved mother for her five boys. How she manages to juggle all these activities is beyond my comprehension, but the fact that she can serve as a judge, a community leader, and a devoted mom all simultaneously is yet more evidence of her fitness and her ability to serve as an outstanding Federal district judge. 
Ann Aiken is also an expert on family law. She has been a leader in the founding of a model program for youngsters known as the Relief Nursery. In that effort, she has brought together leaders from across her community to help families that were about to crack apart. Recently in fact, the successes of the Relief Nursery in keeping families together were profiled by Peter Jennings on World News Tonight. 
I am certain that Judge Aiken will bring to the Federal bench the same fairness, toughness and integrity that she has brought to her work as a State judge and a specialist in family law. And I am certain that Judge Aiken will bring to the Federal court the intellect, intensity and drive that has made her one of our State's most respected jurists. 
Let me wrap up by saying, as Senator Smith has touched on as well, this nomination is particularly important since Oregon already has two vacancies on the district bench and will be facing a third in April of this year. Failure to fill these openings in a timely manner is going to put an enormous strain on the Federal courts in Oregon. It is time to act and time to act swiftly. 
My colleagues, you have before you a tough judge and a fair one, one committed to seeing that justice is carried out in an impartial way no matter what the accusation is. She is going to make an exceptional Federal judge. She will bring honor to her community and her country. Therefore I urge you, as Senator Smith has, that the Senate move today on the candidacy of Judge Ann Aiken. She is a judge of extraordinary ability. She has earned this post. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Let me also join in the remarks expressed by my colleague, Senator Smith, with respect to our colleague from Wyoming. I know he is sincere in his views. 
I will talk about what Judge Aiken faced with respect to that Dye case. Judge Aiken had two choices in front of her. Neither were ideal. She chose the one that in hindsight would be different than the one that Senator Smith and I would have chosen. Both of us have been concerned about the case. To her credit--in my view, to her great credit--Judge Aiken has indicated to Senator Smith and me that she would have handled that case differently. Her commitment to tough law enforcement has been proven because since that case she has been a tough judge. She has often exceeded the sentencing guidelines, and she has shown that she is going to be capable of great growth as a judge. 
I say to our friend from Wyoming, who among us as new Members of the U.S. Senate would not possibly take back a vote early in our career? We are constantly faced with tough decisions in the U.S. Senate, decisions where you have before you a couple of choices, neither of them being ideal. Judge Ann Aiken, in the Dye case, tried to make the call to the best of her ability. In my view, even more importantly, she showed great growth, she showed a willingness to evaluate the facts in light of additional time and additional opportunities to consider her decision. 
So we are then faced with the question: Do you throw out the prospect of an outstanding career on the Federal bench because of one case, one case where an individual has said, `If I could do it again, I would have done it differently'? We wouldn't say a Member of this body should be excluded from the possibility of further service in the Senate because they would have cast one vote differently had they had the choice. We evaluate Members of the U.S. Senate on the totality of their records. On the totality of her record, Judge Aiken is an outstanding individual, an individual who will be tough on crime when she serves on the Federal bench. 
Mr. President, I see Chairman Hatch is on the floor. I know he had to leave the floor during our earlier remarks. I express to him my personal gratitude for all of the help and effort he has given Senator Smith and me on this matter again and again. Chairman Hatch has about as hefty a workload as you can imagine for a human being, but he has made time to assist Senator Smith and me. We are very appreciative of all the good counsel and help you have given us as new Members of the U.S. Senate. 
In closing, I especially want to express my appreciation to him for that help and counsel. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Specter, in introducing a bill that will make it clear that this country will no more tolerate violence directed at gays, women, or people with disabilities. This legislation will end the bizarre double standard which says that hate crimes motivated by one sort of prejudice are a Federal crime, while those motivated by other biases are not. It will assure that every American who becomes a victim of a hate crime has equal standing under Federal law, because hatred and violence are always wrong. 
This bipartisan bill is based on a common conviction that this country still has work to do in rooting out hatred, prejudice and the violence they generate. Hate crimes--the threat or use of force to injure, intimidate or interfere with another person solely because of the person's race, color, religion or national origin--cannot be tolerated in our society. That point has already been enshrined in law and passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Reporting Act in 1990, followed by the Hate Crimes Penalty Enhancement Act in 1993 and the 1996 resolution condemning church burnings. 
Our bill simply seeks to offer the same protection to victims of gay bashing, woman beating and crimes against people with disabilities that has already been offered to victims of bias crimes based on racial and ethnic discrimination. 
Today, the perpetrator who hurls a brick at someone because he is Asian-American can be prosecuted under Federal law. The one who attacks gay men to `teach them a lesson' cannot. The perpetrator who burns a black church or defaces a synagogue can be prosecuted under Federal law. The one who targets people in wheelchairs or blind people cannot. This legislation would erase that double standard from the books. Hate crimes are all the same, and they are never acceptable. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in moving forward with this important legislation when we return here next year.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, then in light of the time that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has kindly yielded to me, I should like to take a few minutes to describe why I think this issue is so important. 
Mr. President and colleagues, I spoke yesterday afternoon in this body on the need to end Senate secrecy. Within an hour of my talk, three of the most senior Members of the Senate came to me and said they hoped this amendment would prevail. 
These three Members probably have an aggregate total of 60 years seniority in this body, and each of them told me that they had been frustrated by instances of this hide-and-seek process that the Senate now has with secret Senate holds. 
Certainly most of the American people are not aware of what a hold is. But the fact of the matter is, it is now possible for any Member of the U.S. Senate to unilaterally block the consideration of a bill or nomination from coming to this floor. It is an extraordinary power. It keeps the U.S. Senate from even discussing a nomination or a particular bill. It is one thing to object to something, or plan to vote against something. But in the case of the secret Senate hold, one Member of the U.S. Senate, one Member, can block the consideration of a nomination or bill. And during these last days of a session, this power is not just extraordinary, it is essentially a veto. It is a power that is unbeatable. 
I would just say to my colleagues that, as a new Member of the U.S. Senate, every day I am impressed by the greatness of this institution. And I don't think that the greatness of this institution will in any way be diminished if this body is open and accountable. I think that is why senior Members of the U.S. Senate have come to Senator Grassley and myself and said, `I hope you prevail on this.' 
We are not seeking to block the right of a Senator to impose a hold. Under what we have proposed, each Member of the U.S. Senate could still use the hold, block the consideration of a nomination or bill. All we are saying is that it cannot be done behind closed doors. This Senate secrecy doesn't smell right. It doesn't pass the smell test to the American people. What Senator Grassley and I have proposed is that within 48 hours after a Member of the Senate informs the leadership that he or she is going to put a hold on a bill, that be so noticed in the Congressional Record. 
Recently there were more than 40 holds. Outside, much of the day, has been a group of people, outside the Chamber, simply trying to keep track of all the revolving holds, where a Senator imposes a hold for a short period of time and then, in effect, another Senator comes along and imposes a hold again. Outside the Chamber throughout this day there have been individuals trying to keep track of what is going on. 
I would say to my colleagues, I subscribe to the not exactly radical notion that public business is done in public. The use of this hold in the last few days of a session is not just some small thing. It is an extraordinary power. It can affect millions of dollars. It can affect the course of the judiciary and other key executive branch appointments. I am very concerned that at a time when the public is so skeptical and so cynical about Government, that this use of the secret hold simply feeds that cynicism. It contributes to the sense that the American people have that so much in Washington, DC, is not on the level. 
So, I am very grateful to Chairman Stevens for giving me this time to explain my point of view. Senator Grassley and I have indicated that we will be back. We will be back at the beginning of next session. I have tried for almost 15 months to get this issue before the U.S. Senate. The fact is, it is most abused right at this time, which is why we saw last week more than 40 holds. It was the subject of a hilarious press conference with the Senate minority leader, who said then that he couldn't figure out where all the holds were coming from. 
So Senator Grassley and I are not going to prevail tonight. I think that is bad news for democracy. I think the secret hold cheapens the currency of democracy. But we will be back. We will be back until we make this institution more open and accountable. 
Senator Stevens has been kind to give me all this time to explain my views. I appreciate that courtesy very much and I thank him for the time.

Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman. Far be it from me to interfere with that. 
First, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and say I would very much like to work with him, to get this practice changed. I have, in fact, spent a considerable amount of time with Senator Byrd on this. He was very helpful as well. 
I would finally say to the chairman that with respect to this matter of courtesy, I and Senator Grassley have no concern about that. Of course the hold, if we are talking about a few days or a few hours as a courtesy, is not what is at issue. It is when a Senator digs in to try to block a bill that there ought to be some public disclosure. 
But to me the chairman has been very helpful, not just on matters from our committee like Internet and the like, but generally. I want to tell him I am very interested in working with him on it because I think this is an opportunity to keep the greatness of this institution and still make it more open and democratic. I thank him for all the time.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes to discuss Federal meddling in the internal affairs of my home State of Oregon. 
As many of my colleagues know, the people of my State have been discussing at length the concept of assisted suicide. In fact, the people of Oregon have spoken twice on this issue. It is a very difficult issue, and after months of thoughtful debate and intense media scrutiny, the voters of my State have voted to allow physicians to assist their terminally ill patients in ending their lives. 
Mr. President and colleagues, let me say that I have deep personal reservations about the concept of assisted suicide. I have voted twice as a private citizen against assisted suicide, and once on the floor of the U.S. Senate I voted against Federal funding of assisted suicide. But let me also say that the voters of my State in a recent ballot measure have voted no on the question of repealing the matter of assisted suicide they voted for earlier. 
My question today is, what part of no does the Federal Government fail to understand? We saw just a few hours after the Oregon vote some of the most powerful Members of the U.S. Congress and the Clinton administration looking to overturn the popular will of the people of Oregon. Within hours of the Oregon vote, a letter emerged from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Members of Congress who control the budget for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In effect, the Drug Enforcement Administration indicates they want to declare war on physicians in Oregon and those they serve by threatening to revoke the drug dispensing privileges of any physician who abides by the law that Oregon has now passed on two separate occasions. In effect, the Drug Enforcement Administration is interested in thwarting the will of Oregonians. 
Now, Mr. President and colleagues, let me repeat again, I have deep personal reservations about assisted suicide. Going back to my days with senior citizens as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, I have been most interested in looking at medical advances in pain management and hospice care, and I don't think there has even been a beginning at those efforts, and certainly those are the first efforts that governmental bodies at every level ought to be trying to support. 
But when the people have spoken, and in this case the people of my State have spoken twice, it is time for the Federal Government to back off. It is not as if this town doesn't have enough to do already on this floor. It is obvious that important legislation needs to be passed as it relates to a number of Federal agencies. Certainly, the Drug Enforcement Agency has important work to do. I don't see any evidence that they have stemmed the flow of cocaine and heroin and methamphetamine to our kids. It seems to me the Clinton administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration has plenty to do right now other than to meddle in the internal affairs of the State of Oregon. 
Now, I have great respect for the Members of Congress who are interested in this issue. A number of them are personal friends and individuals with whom I have worked on a bipartisan basis on health care legislation such as the Food and Drug Administration and health care legislation to protect our youngsters. I have great respect for the Members of Congress, the leaders of the committees that have jurisdiction over the budget for the Drug Enforcement Agency, and I respect them and have worked with them on many occasions. 
However, I say to those Members of Congress and to the Clinton administration that it is an inappropriate exercise of our responsibilities to impose personal or religious views on the voters of Oregon. Those voters have spoken. My personal views notwithstanding, I want the Federal Government to get that fairly simple concept known as `No.' The people of Oregon have spoken on this issue, and it seems to me if there were a constitutional question involved, perhaps you could understand why the Congress and the Clinton administration would be interested in this Oregon ballot initiative. But in fact, a Federal court has recently ruled against a constitutional challenge to Oregon's law, and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld that ruling. 
Mr. President, the citizens of my home State have now made law with respect to what they consider to be compassionate care on the part of Oregon physicians. It was not a rush to judgment. There were two very extensive debates in my State, and I have already indicated that my view with respect to assisted suicide is that I still have deep reservations about the concept. 
But the voters of my State have spoken. It would be wrong for those at the Federal level to meddle with that decision. It would be wrong to override the judgment of Oregon voters. And it is my view, Mr. President, that neither this Congress, nor the Clinton administration, nor the DEA, should trample on the judgment of Oregon voters on an issue that the courts have already decided is a matter that should be decided in my home State of Oregon. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Family Preservation and Support Act is important to families who are at risk or in crisis. One notable service now specifically mentioned in the act is the care provided by a crisis nursery. Crisis nurseries provide respite and therapeutic services for families with young children to assist parents in attaining self-sufficiency. One crisis nursery in particular, the relief nursery of Eugene, OR, is a model child abuse and prevention program. After involvement with the relief nursery, fewer than 9 percent of the 373 children served reported abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to the State child protection office. Moreover, 82 percent of children served by the relief nursery were living safely with their parents at the end of the year, averting foster care or other out-of-home placement. The relief nursery has accomplished these results through dedication to comprehensive family services emphasizing programs that strengthen the parent-child relationship. Does the Senator agree that crisis nurseries can play an important role in saving families?

Mr. WYDEN. I think the relief nursery is a needed member of the community, providing invaluable services to children who need them most. Crisis nurseries work because they provide intensive, personalized, and long-term services to families with children in the most vulnerable age groups. I thank the Senator for recognizing the work of nurseries, such as the relief nursery, in your bill.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in significant ways, the promotion of adoption, safety, and support for abused and neglected children represents an important step forward in Federal policy for child welfare. It parallels Oregon's best interest of the child bill in its recognition of the crucial importance of timely achievement of permanent family placements for children who must be temporarily placed in foster care. Further, it clarifies that a child's health and safety are paramount concerns in considerations of reasonable efforts for family preservation. The PASS Act also broadens support for adoptive placement, increases post-adoption assistance for families, and emphasises the link between the child's welfare and parent's well-being. Moreover, the bill's intense interest in kinship care is both wise and timely. I am particularly concerned about this complex issue and I have devoted a lot of attention to it over the past several years. 
Kinship care, the full-time care and protection of children by a relative, is in many cultures, a time honored tradition. Throughout history relatives have come forward to care for and raise children when the parents were unable to do so themselves. Recently, the decision over whether relatives may best provide for children has increasingly involved child welfare agencies. Yet, Mr. President, our country does not have a national policy to deal with relative care arrangements. In light of this fact, the PASS Act makes significant strides toward recognizing relative care arrangements for what they are--legitimate, appropriate placements--for a family. There is a precedent for this recognition; last year I fought for language in the welfare reform bill requiring that kinship care be considered first for children needing placement. 
I am pleased that many of the provisions I included in my kinship care bill, S. 822, were incorporated in the PASS Act. One such provision allows kinship providers an opportunity to be heard during abuse and neglect proceedings. I have heard from grandparents in Oregon who tell me that they can add additional information that may be helpful to the court's determination of the child's future living arrangements, but often are not aware of their grandchild's placement in foster care or where they are in the system. It is important that relative caregivers are notified when there are administrative proceedings on a child's status. 
The inclusion of a kinship care advisory panel instructed to make recommendations about kinship care policies is also included in this bill. Thankfully, relative caregivers and former foster children in relative care arrangements will now be able to sit on a panel and examine what is needed to improve these arrangements for all involved. The panel's findings must be submitted in a comprehensive report to the Department of Health and Human Services. The report will examine who kinship caregivers are, what services are provided to them and many other factors that will help us develop a national policy on this growing child welfare issue. 
Another critical provision in the bill deals with standby guardianship. Many relative caregivers are caring for families devastated by HIV/AIDS. In adoption or guardianship proceedings today, dying parents are asked to give up their custodial rights over their children in order to ensure a permanent, stable placement for their child. Under this bill, any parent who is chronically ill or near death may designate a standby guardian without being forced to surrender their parental rights. PASS encourages States who have not already passed standby guardianship laws to do so. As we seek to adequately support relative care providers caring for children, we must first ask educated questions and receive thorough answers. Ultimately, the PASS Act has made a good-faith effort to recognize and study the issue of kinship care. This is a good first step for children and families.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes to discuss the effort here in the Senate to eliminate the secrecy with which the Senate so often conducts business. Through a procedure that certainly isn't known to most Americans, it is possible for one U.S. Senator to unilaterally block this Senate from considering a piece of legislation or a nomination. This process is known as a hold. Certainly as we have seen in the last few days, a hold is an extraordinary power in the last few hours of a session in the U.S. Senate. In fact, it is fair to say in the last few hours of a session, a hold is essentially unbeatable. 
Now, originally a hold was intended as a courtesy to a Senator. If the Senator couldn't be present at a particular time--there was an illness in the family, this sort of thing--they could put a hold on a measure or nomination, and that way, as a courtesy, the Senate would make sure it was brought up shortly thereafter when that Senator could be there. 
But what has happened over the years is that the hold has been abused. At one point here fairly recently there were more than 40 holds on individuals, nominees, pieces of legislation, and it was all done in secret--all of it. At a time when the American people are so skeptical of the way business is done in Washington, DC, and so often understandably skeptical, the secret hold, the unilateral power of one Senator to block a bill or nomination and do it all in secret is something that is being abused, and abused especially at the end of a session of the U.S. Senate. 
Senator Grassley and I, on a bipartisan basis, have tried to eliminate the secrecy that surrounds these holds. We have said we are not quarreling with the proposition of a Member of the U.S. Senate to have this extraordinary power. Members of the Senate, under all other circumstances, are accountable to their constituents. But in this case they aren't accountable because they can exercise this power in secret. 
Senator Grassley and I offered what we don't think is exactly a radical idea, which is that when a Senator uses this power, it would be publicly disclosed. We said if a Senator uses this power, they should have to disclose the use of that hold in the Congressional Record within 48 hours of exercising their hold. That way, the U.S. Senate would know who is exercising this power, the American people would know who is exercising this power. If a Member of the U.S. Senate is doing the bidding of a powerful set of interests, it would be possible for everybody to know what exactly was taking place. So Senator Grassley and I were able in the last weeks of the session to attach an anti-Senate-secrecy amendment so that when the use of the hold is applied, the American people would know who was blocking this body from considering a bill or nomination. 
Now, as I understand it, there are discussions underway, in effect behind closed doors, behind closed doors without public debate, there is discussion of dropping an effort to end Senate secrecy. I will tell you, that doesn't pass the smell test. Killing a plan to end Senate secrecy behind closed doors isn't the way this body ought to be doing business. Certainly what we have seen in the last few weeks since Senator Grassley and I prevailed on our proposal here in the Senate to end secrecy, is that there has been an explosive proliferation of the use of holds once again. There are countless bills and nominations that certainly deserve consideration. You can argue whether they deserve majority support, but they certainly deserve open debate, and they can't be brought to this floor because one Senator has secretly said no. One Senator has secretly said, `No, I will not allow discussion' of that particular topic. 
The irony of all of this, Mr. President, is that often even Senators don't know when a hold has been placed in their name. I have had a number of Senators tell me since I've come to the Senate that they have been approached about holds. They were told they had a hold on a measure. It turned out the staff had put a hold on it without their even knowing about it. So it is one thing for an elected official, a Member of the U.S. Senate with an election certificate to exercise this extraordinary power; it is quite another to have those who are not elected exercise it. It highlights, again, how much this process has been abused of late. 
I thought that the minority leader, Senator Daschle, captured the spirit of this situation the other day in his morning briefing with the press. Amid what reads on the transcript like pretty raucous laughter, the minority leader walked reporters through the variety of holds that there were on dozens of nominees at that time. In fact, he said, `If you don't have a hold, you ought to feel lonesome.' The minority leader was pressed by reporters about who might be placing some of the holds, but the minority leader said he didn't know who was placing these holds. Some have said eventually you can find out who is exercising the hold. But I can tell my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate that even the minority leader is on record as saying he doesn't know who is placing these secret holds. 
This secrecy, in my view, Mr. President, is not in keeping with the proud traditions of the U.S. Senate, and it is not in keeping with the fundamental spirit of openness and accountability that is at the heart of our democratic process. I sought to serve in the U.S. Senate because I wanted to be in a position to influence policy on issues that are important to Oregonians and the people of this country. I value the extraordinary opportunity that I have been given by my constituents to serve and to use the power that they have given me on behalf of them and the American people. But it is time to say that power must be accompanied by responsibility. That responsibility is to be straight with the American people, to tell them about the actions and the policies that they are taking. It certainly is not in line with the spirit of openness and accountability for the American people to allow one Senator in secret to unilaterally block from this floor even the consideration of a bill or nomination. 
I am one who simply feels that public business ought to be done in public. Some might think that is a little bit quaint at this time in American history. But I think it is time to bring some sunshine to the process for debating these issues. I am very proud and very grateful that Senator Grassley has joined me in this effort. I think it is very unfortunate that there appears now to be an effort behind closed doors to kill our proposal to end Senate secrecy. That will be unfortunate if it takes place. If it takes place, I want every Member of the U.S. Senate to know that Senator Grassley and I will be back on this floor pressing the case again. 
It's not going to threaten the deliberative approach that this body rightly takes to consideration of issues, to have openness and accountability in the way that the Senate does business. Senator Grassley and I aren't saying get rid of the hold; we are not saying the hold ought to be abolished and a power that a Senator now has be diminished. We are simply saying that power should be accompanied by responsibility. Rights should be accompanied by responsibility. 
Now, I was very gratified when the proposal Senator Grassley and I offered in the U.S. Senate was approved by this body. I have been appreciative of the fact that the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has been willing to work with me on this matter and has indicated that he certainly doesn't want to see Senate secrecy and see important decisions made without accountability. And I felt that the Senate was moving in the right direction when, initially, our proposal was voted on, and favorably so, by the U.S. Senate. 
But I am concerned that the bill that will come before the Senate, the D.C. appropriations bill, will not contain the legislation that Senator Grassley and I offered to end Senate secrecy. I am concerned that our proposal may just disappear behind closed doors, without any public debate, without any explanation at all, and that our proposal may be put aside with the very secrecy that we sought to end. 
So I tell my colleagues, Mr. President, that this fight is not going to end today. The D.C. appropriations bill is an important part of the Senate's work and it needs to be completed. But this Senator wants to be clear that we will be back, and we will be back, in my view, with even more support from the American people, given the fact that, in recent weeks, there were more than 40 holds--40 holds--on nominees and individual pieces of legislation, and even the Senate minority leader could not tell the American people who was exercising those holds. 
Mr. President, it's time for additional openness and accountability in the U.S. Senate. In my view, continuing these secret practices cheapens the currency of democracy. The Senate can maintain its proud traditions with having openness and accountability, and each Member of the U.S. Senate will still be able to fight for their constituents and do the work they were sent here to do. 
So I am still hopeful that the D.C. appropriations bill, when it comes back, will contain the legislation that Senator Grassley and I authored to end the secrecy in the way business is done in the Senate. But if it's not, if our provision is not, I want to assure the Members of the U.S. Senate that we will be back, we will be back on a bipartisan basis. I don't believe it's possible for any Senator, at a town hall meeting in their home State, to justify these secret holds. I don't think it passes the smell test. I think it's wrong. If we don't prevail on it today, Mr. President, we will be back. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a supporter of the development of renewable energy in this country, and in the Northwest in particular, I am pleased to see our region taking a leadership role in developing renewable energy resources. 
Several years ago, two forward thinking utilities in the Northwest, along with the Bonneville Power Association, initiated an effort to site and permit a new wind project in Carbon County, WY. The focus of the project was to test a new generation of technology in Northwest climates, and develop capability and experience with a resource which the region has in abundance. Despite considerable changes in the electricity market, and challenges presented by the project, these three utilities persevered and made this project a reality. PacificCorp., the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and the Bonneville Power Administration demonstrated great leadership to create the first new commercial-scale wind project to serve the Northwest. Their commitment marks the dawn of a new industry for the Northwest, and a substantial contribution to a sustainable future for us and our children. 
Three individuals deserve special recognition in this effort: Dennis Steinberg of PacifiCorp., Ken Beeson of the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and George Darr of the Bonneville Power Administration. I thank them for their dedication and hard work in bringing this project to fruition.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Iran Missile Proliferation Act of 1997, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Lott. This legislation is critically needed because of dangerous recent developments in the Middle East, namely disturbing reports that indicate Iran is acquiring terrifying weapons of mass destruction at an alarming pace. 
Iran has become the most serious threat to stability in the Middle East and is rapidly developing the means to strike Israel. Very recently, Israeli and American intelligence have discovered that, due largely to technology obtained from Russia, Iran may soon have the capability to begin assembling and testing ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and other vital targets in the Middle East. 
Russian companies are providing Iran with crucial technologies, including wind tunnels for the design of missiles, lasers, and special materials for missile construction. There are even reports of over 9,000 Russian advisers working in Iran on a variety of military projects, and Iran earlier this year tested a Soviet-designed rocket engine. 
Iran, one of America's foremost self-proclaimed enemies, has been linked to numerous anti-Israel terrorist attacks ranging from taking hostages and hijacking airlines to carrying out assassinations and bombings. These incidents include the taking of more than 30 Western hostages in Lebanon from 1984 through 1992, the bombings of the United States Embassy and the French-United States Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the Buenos Aires terrorist attacks on the Israeli Embassy in 1992 and on the Argentine Jewish communal building in 1994. An Iranian ballistic missile capability would have enormous strategic repercussions for the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. Iran possesses chemical weapons, and quite possibly could be only a few years away from acquiring nuclear weapons. 
Clearly, the United States must adopt a stronger approach toward Russia. To its credit, the administration has tried every diplomatic effort with Russia. Vice President Gore and other senior officials have addressed this issue at the most senior levels of the Russian Government, including with President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomydrin, but these efforts have met with little success. Further discussions are set for November, however, and I believe Congress must act now to enact a more forceful policy which will ensure Russian cooperation. 
The Lott-Lieberman legislation requires the President to submit a report to Congress 30 days after enactment, providing a list of the entities that have been implicated in the transfer or attempted transfer of goods, technology, or technical assistance that has contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles. Highly targeted sanctions will be imposed on these entities 30 days after the submission of the report, unless the President waives them under limited circumstances. 
I urge my colleagues to support this vital measure which takes concrete steps to halt the spread of ballistic missile technology to Iran and to preserve peace and stability in the Middle East.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my first official act as a new U.S. Senator, taken 15 minutes after I was sworn in, was to become a sponsor of the bipartisan campaign finance reform bill that the U.S. Senate will begin to vote on later today. 
I strongly believe that political campaigns should be about people and not money. But that is not what is happening in America today. Campaign finance activity has become like the arms race--one side gets $10, the next side gets $20, the other side comes back and gets $30. It spirals up and up--spending that is out of control, spending that is simply unaccountable to voters. 
Every Member of the U.S. Senate has devoted hours and hours to fundraising. Every Member of the U.S. Senate knows that when there is an election that Tuesday in November, folks sleep in on Wednesday, and then in November it starts all over again. Every Member of the U.S. Senate knows that America deserves better. 
I don't agree with every part of the McCain-Feingold bipartisan campaign finance legislation; I would not pretend otherwise. And I think that is true of many of the sponsors of this legislation. But if this bipartisan bill passes, candidates in America are going to spend more time talking to voters in shopping malls and less time working the phones raising funds. That is going to be good for democracy in America, and I hope the Senate passes this bipartisan bill. 
I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-wyden-or-2-19970930</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I also want to thank the majority leader for his courtesy. 
This amendment involves one of the most awesome powers that a Member of the U.S. Senate has. That is the power to effectively block the consideration of a bill or nomination in secret. 
Now, it is a power that I think many Americans are concerned about. I have made it very clear that I am not seeking to abolish the right of a Senator to put a hold on a measure or matter. But I do think that if an important health or environmental matter comes before the Senate, as the Kennedy-Kassebaum measure did in the last Congress, involving health care for millions of Americans, that there ought to be public disclosure, that there ought to be sunshine. 
The majority leader, in my view, has made a number of constructive proposals in the past with respect to this procedure. I am particularly pleased that he sought in the beginning of this year, January 27, to limit Members from putting holds on blocks of legislation, in effect, blocking a whole package of legislation, from coming before the Senate. But we still have not been able to change the Senate rules to bring some sunshine in, to make sure that the American people can hold each one of us accountable. 
There have been reports that when the Senate passes the Wyden-Grassley legislation to have public disclosure of holds in the U.S. Senate, this is just going to die in conference and it will just vanish in the vapor in secret. It is especially ironic that an effort to eliminate secrecy in the exercise of awesome powers of the U.S. Senate, that would somehow take place again in secret, but I am concerned that may happen. In fact, there is a report today in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill publication, that raises concern in my mind. 
I briefly would like to engage the majority leader in a colloquy on this point. He and I have been talking about it for about a year and a half now, I think. As I said, I believe the majority leader has made a number of constructive changes already with respect to the hold procedure. I would like to have his thoughts at this time with respect to his views on public disclosure of holds, and specifically whether it will be possible on a bipartisan basis to work out this change and ensure that there is real accountability with the American people for important actions taken by Senators. 
I yield to the majority leader.

Mr. WYDEN. If the majority leader can spend another minute--these are thoughtful points that you raise, and I appreciate the courtesy--the reason for acting now is this is the season when senior Members say that the abuses are greatest. At the end of a session when there is a rush to complete the business is when this practice which, as the majority leader points out, is a long tradition, that is when this practice is abused. I think the majority leader makes a very good point with respect to the need for courtesy and respect for traditions. 
I see our friend, Senator Grassley, is here. This is a bipartisan amendment. We share the majority leader's view with respect to this tradition. We are not seeking to eliminate the hold, seeking to eliminate the filibuster, seeking the right of Senators to work matters out. What we are concerned about is secrecy. At a time when the American people are so skeptical about our Government, when they go to hearings and day after day look at practices that they question, when they look at the U.S. Senate and see these procedures that are secret, it smacks of a backroom deal. 
I think the majority leader is right, the Senate is a good institution. It is not going to suffer if a bit of sunlight comes in. This is an institution strong enough to have a bit of sunlight and to have Members held accountable. I don't want to disrupt the tradition of the Senate, but if an important health or environmental measure or other important issue is held up for months on end because a Senator genuinely objects, then it is not just a matter of courtesy, it is a matter of being accountable to the American people. 
I will interpret the majority leader's response to this colloquy as willing to work with the Wyden-Grassley effort, and I appreciate the fact that it is going to pass today. I know the majority leader has other matters that he has to attend to. I want to thank him for his colloquy and look forward to working with him. 
I yield the time now to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. Mr. President, I want to especially thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, for a fine statement and for all his help. He has long been recognized as one of the most honest, up-front Members of the U.S. Senate. I want to tell him that it is a special pleasure to be able to work with him. 
Mr. President, certainly, if you walk down the main streets of this country and ask our citizens what a hold is in the U.S. Senate, you are certainly not going to find many Americans who are familiar with this practice. But the fact of the matter is, this is an awesome, awesome power exercised by a Member of the U.S. Senate. The power to put a hold on a bill or a nomination is the power to singlehandedly, effectively block the consideration of a bill or nomination from coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
All Senator Grassley and I are asking tonight is that when a Member of the U.S. Senate exercises this extraordinary power, that it be publicly disclosed. All we are asking is for an end to the secrecy. 
My constituents look at the U.S. Senate sometimes and raise questions about how business is done here and, frankly, have some suspicions about the way the Senate conducts business. Sometimes I think they suspect that the procedures around here are a little bit like an elegant game of three-card monte. Now, my own hope is that with the passage of this amendment tonight in the U.S. Senate, and by making public the exercise of this extraordinary power by a U.S. Senator, our citizens will feel a bit more confidence and a bit more likely to see the Senate as an institution that is open and accountable. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, is absolutely right about the traditions of the Senate and, particularly, making accommodations to work out issues wherever possible. All we are saying is that when a Member of the U.S. Senate digs in with all his or her strength to block a bill or a nomination, the American people deserve to know the name of that Senator. This effort does not eliminate holds, it doesn't eliminate the filibuster; it eliminates none of the traditions that the majority leader referred to. All it does is say that a Senator is going to be straight with the American people when they exercise their enormous power to effectively block the consideration of a bill or a nomination on the use of the hold procedure. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in 1992, Congress enacted the Federal Facilities Compliance Act, which requires Federal facilities to obey key environmental laws including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and State hazardous waste laws. 
However, subsequent Federal court decisions threaten to undermine the important principle that Federal Government facilities must comply with the same environmental laws that govern the private sector. In fact, one court decision that covers the Hanford Nuclear Reservation would allow Hanford to poison the water, pollute the air and contaminate the soil for decades, and be immunized for any violations that occur before the Hanford cleanup is completed sometime in the next century. 
This court ruling allowed the interagency agreement among the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington Department of Ecology that governs the Hanford cleanup to be used as a shield to block an enforcement action against the Energy Department for violations of the Clean Water Act. 
The Energy Department's use of interagency agreement to bar enforcement of environmental laws not only undermines the Federal Facilities Compliance Act but also puts at risk the health of citizens who live downstream or downwind from Hanford, and near other Federal facilities around the country. 
Madam President, we also have a double standard here. The Superfund law only authorizes interagency agreements for Federal facilities; there is no comparable provision and no comparable immunity from enforcement for private sector sites. 
Today, Senator Allard and I are introducing the Federal Facilities Superfund Compliance Act to put an end to this double standard. Our legislation makes clear that Federal Government facilities are subject to the same environmental cleanup laws that apply to the private sector. And they are subject to the law now, not sometime off in the future. 
Under this legislation, an interagency agreement, such as the Hanford Tri-Party Agreement, can no longer be used as a means to evade other environmental requirements. 
Our legislation also makes clear that if Federal facilities fail to meet their obligations, States and affected citizens will be able to enforce against the Federal Government for these violations just as they would be able to enforce against private parties for violations of environmental laws at a private sector Superfund site. 
Our citizens who live in the shadow of contaminated Federal facilities should not have to wait years or decades to obtain the health and environmental protections our laws are supposed to provide. I urge all our colleagues to support this important legislation to provide citizens who live downwind or downstream from Federal facilities equal protection under our environmental laws.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, retinal degenerative diseases affect more than six million Americans. This number is expected to climb beyond 10 million as the baby boomers age. This is a vision timebomb and I have witnessed its devastating impact on many of our senior citizens. September 27, 1997 marks World Retina Day, a day in which organizations around the world dedicated to finding the cures for retinal degenerative diseases join together to call attention to the collaborative research that is being done internationally. 
The most common retinal disease is age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which is the leading cause of vision loss in adults over the age of 60. Individuals with AMD not only lose their central vision, but also their ability to read, drive and in many cases they lose their sense of independence. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic disease that steals the sight of the young, robbing them in the prime of their life, their night vision and then their peripheral vision. RP is a progressive disease, leading in most cases to blindness. There is no treatment to stop the progression of this disease. Usher's Syndrome is also a genetic disease and it is the leading cause of deaf-blindness in the United States. This again shows up in our young, robbing them of vision and hearing. The suffering to the patients and their families is incalculable. 
Due to the work funded by the National Eye Institute at the National Institute of Health, and organizations such as the Foundation Fighting Blindness and similar organizations worldwide, significant progress in research has been made. Just this past week a stunning research breakthrough was announced. Scientists have discovered gene mutations that cause AMD. This landmark finding offers the first concrete evidence that AMD is genetically linked. There is now hope that by the time the generation of the baby boomers reaches age 60, in about 10 years, that there will be a genetic treatment for AMD. If a treatment is found, we will see a return on our investments in eye research, and the savings to the budget in terms of health care costs will be significant. 
With the international collaboration among researchers who represent a broad spectrum of highly specialized scientific disciplines, great strides have been made in understanding AMD, RP, Usher's syndrome and related retinal degenerative diseases. International breakthroughs and collaboration in research warrant the recognition of World Retina Day. I am hopeful that there is a cure in sight. I believe that as we continue to fund medical research, diseases such as these will become eradicated and remembered only in the archives of medical history.

<TEXT>
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment today on behalf of myself and Senator Grassley of Iowa. Mr. President, one of the most significant personal powers of a U.S. Senator is the power to effectively block the consideration of a bill or nomination from coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate. This power has become known as putting a `hold' on a measure or bill that a Senator opposes. It is a power that a U.S. Senator can exercise in secret. The name of the Senator placing a hold on Senate business is now held confidentially by party leadership. 
This extraordinary power was once used rarely by Senators, usually as a matter of common courtesy. In the last 20 years, however, the hold has become a special tool for influence and leverage. It is especially valuable at this time--at a time when we are moving toward the end of the session--because it allows a Senator, secretly, to exercise an enormous amount of clout over a matter when time is short. 
Mr. President, the record is replete with statements of Members of this body who have indicated that there have been abuses of the hold, and that this is a procedure that has completely gotten out of hand. Let me read from the words of Senator John Glenn during the final hours of the 101st Congress. Senator Glenn said: 
I find it deplorable that, suddenly, anonymously, a Senator or a combination of Senators on the Republican side can stand against the strong desire of the President and the Office of Management and Budget for this legislation. 
Lest anyone think that this be a partisan matter, Senator Thurmond said: 
I think abuse does arise out of that. 
Senator Hatch said: 
We get victimized by holds, especially at the end of a session. 
Senator Leahy of Vermont, another senior Member said: 
There should not be any holds at all. 
He said we just should not have any holds. 
Well, I am not proposing anything like that. But I do think that every Member of the U.S. Senate ought to be held publicly accountable. I think when one Member of the U.S. Senate moves to effectively block the consideration of a bill or a nomination, they ought to make it clear to their constituents that they are the individual blocking this matter. 
Mr. President, as I have worked on this issue with Senator Grassley, on a bipartisan basis, for a year and a half, I have found that very few Senators are aware of how extensive some of these abuses are until it happens to them. For example, I learned last year that, often, a member of the staff places a hold on a measure and the Senator whose name in which the hold is placed isn't even aware of it. So what you have are secret holds, not just by someone with an election certificate, but by someone who doesn't have an election certificate at all--a member of the staff. 
So I believe that it is time to ensure that the rights of Senators and the rights under the Senate rules afford substantial opportunities for Senators to make sure that they are heard and, to represent their folks, are accompanied by responsibilities. I want to make it clear to each and every Senator that I, in no way, would limit the right to filibuster. I would, in no way, limit the right to ensure that they can speak at length on a motion to proceed. And, in fact, I am not even going so far as to put any limits on the right to place a hold on a measure or a matter, other than that a U.S. Senator be public about what they are doing. 
As I have talked about it with my constituents, they raise serious questions about whether one Member of the U.S. Senate should be able to effectively block consideration of Senate business at all. So I think that the American people will consider this a very modest reform. I see no evidence that citizens want this kind of information held confidential, held secret. So I want to make clear to my colleagues that what I am against is the secrecy. It is the secrecy that is wrong, not the question of whether a Senator wants to exercise their rights. 
Let me also say that I think it is particularly appropriate for the Senate to move now. I have discussed this, over the last 15 months, on a number of occasions with the majority leader, Senator Lott. Senator Lott, to his credit, has taken several steps to improve the procedures of the Senate and in dealing with the holds that I think are very constructive. But what has not been done is there has been no change in the Senate rules to deal with the issue that I bring up today. A hold can still be kept secret. A hold can still be kept confidential with the party leadership. 
So, in my view, Senator Lott's proposal and the proposal that he made on January 27 of this year is a constructive one. It puts in place a number of sensible changes, such as disallowing what are known as `block holds,' where a Senator would put a hold on a block of bills. But it still keeps this procedure and the use of one of the most extensive personal powers a U.S. Senator has secret. So I hope that as the Senate 
considers this legislation--and it is only one sentence long, it is not a complicated amendment; it is only one sentence long. I hope that the Senators will see this for what it is, which is to bring sunlight to the debate over the Senate's rules. 
I will be speaking for a few additional minutes, Mr. President, but I understand that the chairman of the subcommittee has asked to make a change in the time for the vote that he had arranged earlier. I am happy to yield to him at this time.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this effort that Senator Grassley and I have pursued for many months has been endorsed by a number of groups that are seeking to try to make the U.S. Senate more open in the way it conducts its business. Common Cause, for example, is an organization that has sought to have public disclosure of this particular procedure. 
What we are talking about here is if a Member of the U.S. Senate is going to exercise this extraordinary, unilateral power, there should be sunshine; sunshine, we all know, is the very best disinfectant. It is an opportunity for all Members of the U.S. Senate to have a chance to be part of the debate because at least they will know who they are debating with. What is the most ironic part of the use of the hold is that the Senate, in which every Member takes pride, an institution to foster debate about important issues, doesn't in many instances allow for a Member of the U.S. Senate to even know who they are debating with because one Member of the Senate has anonymously blocked the issue. So let me be clear with respect to what this legislation does. This applies to a Senator who is digging in and making it clear that they object to a measure or a nomination. 
This is not an individual who perhaps needs to know when an amendment is coming up, or perhaps have an opportunity to come over to the Senate floor to speak on a measure or matter. That is not what is being discussed here. What is being discussed here is making sure that when there is a full court press to oppose a bill or a nomination that that kind of opposition be brought to light. 
We had some recent experience with how influential polls can be. For example, we saw that in the last Congress, to quote USA Today on the matter, `A skulk of faceless Senators is using a series of parliamentary holds to dry gulch legislation extending health insurance to millions of Americans.' 
That wasn't 20 years ago. That wasn't 30 years ago. That was an anonymous hold that was used to influence an important piece of health care legislation in the last session of the U.S. Congress. The fact is, Mr. President, that this procedure, which was once a matter of common courtesy, is now so widely used that it has become one of the most frequent ways to prevent any public disclosure of Senate business. 
I hope that as we look to these last few days of this session--I bring this to the floor now because I believe that the abuse of the hold is most likely during these last few days of the session--that we take this opportunity to make the U.S. Senate more open and more accountable. 
Right now, if a Senator seeks to personally block a measure or matter, there is no cost to them. They face no disapproval because no one would know who they were disapproving of. The fact is that this is a process and a power, an enormous power, held by the U.S. Senate that is exercised in the dark. It seems to me that it carries the odor of back room deals, abuse of privilege, and a body that cares more about individual personal desires than those of the American people. 
This isn't cutting off the right of any Member of the U.S. Senate. Every Senator can still filibuster. Every Senator can still exercise their rights with respect to a motion to proceed. It simply says that it has to be done publicly. 
Let me also say that it has been the experience of Senator Grassley and myself that you can do this, and, as Senator Grassley has told me, it doesn't hurt. For example, just a week ago Senator Smith and I felt strongly, on a bipartisan basis, about issues with respect to a C-130 crash that carried Oregonians who were reservists. At that time, because we were seeking answers from the military and given the fact that the appointment of the new head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was forthcoming, I put a hold on that nomination for a brief period of time. I made it clear on the floor and in other forums that I was the Member of the Senate who did it. I published it in the Congressional Record, just as my amendment calls for. 
So, during that period, there was, over a short few days, an effort to have a public discussion about this matter. There were also bipartisan discussions with Senator Thurmond and Senator McCain, and others were extremely helpful in the efforts that Senator Smith and I made on this matter. And early the next week the hold that I had, which was public, I lifted. The needs of my constituents were addressed, and the American people saw a good man--a good man--General Shelton, confirmed to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
So, Mr. President, what we have done, Senator Grassley and I, is we have practiced what we preach. We don't believe that it abridges our rights in any way. All we are saying is that there is no reasonable place for protracted ongoing anonymous delay. That is what we think is wrong. There is no place, as the New York Times recently said, for `the hold as currently practiced.' 
So I am not suggesting today, Mr. President and colleagues, that the hold be abolished. I am not suggesting that the filibuster be changed in any way. I am not suggesting that on the motion to proceed there be any change. All I am saying is when a hold is put on a matter so that a Senator digs in to personally effectively block the consideration of a measure or a matter, that within 2 days of that time they notify party leadership that they are the individual seeking to prevent consideration of that measure or matter on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and that they just put a little notice in the Congressional Record. No big procedure, no hassle, just a notice, just a notice identifying that Senator as the Senator who has put a hold on a measure or matter. 
Mr. President, my guess is that if my amendment passes, there may be a variety of ways that Senators may still seek to vitiate the spirit of what Senator Grassley and I are seeking to do. But I do think that passage of this amendment will put the U.S. Senate on record. We will be on record for sunshine. We will be on record as being opposed to secrecy, and especially we will be taking steps so that at this time of the session as the session moves into the last few weeks when history shows that you are most likely to have abuses of the hold, we will have shown that we are willing to make changes that hold the U.S. Senate and each Member here publicly accountable for their actions. 
Mr. President, none of us got here easily. Like many other 
Senators, my campaign and my election was something of a trial by fire. No Member of this body lacks fortitude. I think we can stand some extra added light. I think we can stand some extra added sunshine. I think that we can take the secrecy out of the hold procedure and still make sure that each and every Senator is able to exercise their rights and protect their constituents. 
I believe that the passage of this amendment, at a time when millions of Americans are especially cynical and skeptical about Government, will cause citizens to say that the Senate is doing the right thing, and we will see constituents have a bit more respect for this body as a result of Senators being willing to be held publicly accountable. This amendment is not about getting rid of the hold. It is not about doing anything to a hold other than saying that a Senator has to be publicly accountable when that one Senator effectively moves to block the consideration of a bill or a nomination. 
Mr. President, I have not been here as long as some, but I read the statements of Senators who have been here for quite some time--Senator Glenn, who called it deplorable; Senator Thurmond, who said that there has been an abuse; Senator Hatch, who said that every Senator has been victimized by it; and, Senator Leahy, who went far far farther than anything I would be talking about. He said there shouldn't be any holds at all. 
In fact, in my conversations with Senators, I have been told that some Senators find this procedure so abhorrent that they will not exercise it at all, and they are especially frustrated by their colleagues who do. 
So, in closing, Mr. President, let me go back to just how great the abuse is. 
It is one thing if Chairman Faircloth or Senator Boxer or another Member of U.S. Senate puts a hold on a matter. All of the Senators are directly responsible to their constituents. What I found is a lot of Senators didn't even know that a hold had been placed on a bill in their name. 
One senior Member of the U.S. Senate came to me last session, and said, `I am for your bill. I think it is a good idea. We need some public disclosure of these holds. And the reason I am for it is a few minutes ago a Senator came up to me and said, `Why do you have a hold on my bill?' And the person who was sympathetic to what I have been trying to do said, `I don't have a hold on your bill.' It turned out that a staff person had done it in their name. 
So what we have is a situation where not just are holds by Senators kept anonymous and kept confidential, but now we have staff that doesn't have an election certificate putting holds on these matters as well. 
The hold started out many years ago. I gather from historians that it is well over 100 years old. It started out as a matter of common courtesy. It was something that Senators did to accommodate each other to make sure that an individual could be present to speak on an amendment, to ensure that they would have an opportunity to be heard if they had some sort of glitch in their time schedule. That is not what this amendment addresses. That is not what this amendment addresses at all. 
This amendment is about ensuring that when a U.S. Senator uses all of their power, every bit of their power, to block a measure or a nomination, and they exercise those extraordinary rights that each of us has, that it be accompanied by a responsibility to the American people. That responsibility to the American people is to tell them, tell your constituents, when you exercise this extraordinary power that you are the one who did it. You are the one who blocked a bill or a nomination. 
Let's bring some sunshine here. 
I will tell leadership--let me say that Senator Daschle and Senator Lott have talked with me about this. Both of them have been very gracious. Senator Daschle indicated that he is in support of this. I believe that what I am proposing in this amendment complements the useful changes that Senator Lott, the majority leader, made this January. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, implemented a number of changes that I think are constructive, but they still allow for the secrecy. They still allow for one Senator to effectively block consideration of a measure or matter. 
I gather that the vote on this amendment will be tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to be able, prior to the vote tomorrow, to speak on this amendment again for up to 10 minutes, to be able to ensure that Senators prior to the vote----

I ask only that the further discussion of this amendment take place at a time when the majority leader could be on the floor and he and I could discuss this briefly. I believe the proposals he has made with respect to holds are constructive. This proposal goes one step further, to have public disclosure of holds.

With that, I have no objection.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator Hatch in offering an amendment which will add strength, substance, and a new level of appropriate public accountability and involvement in the missions of the Food and Drug Administration. 
Quite simply, our amendment provides for real access and participation by patients and consumer groups, science and health experts, and the regulated manufacturers in appropriate policy making functions within the scope of the agency's missions. 
As my colleague Senator Hatch has pointed out, our amendment underscores the real partnership FDA must forge with all Americans as it conducts its work certifying the safety and effectiveness of so many products important to our everyday lives. 
I certainly want to acknowledge and applaud the assistance and encouragement of our colleagues Senators Jeffords and Kennedy with regard to the development of the FDA reform bill generally, and their work with us in perfecting the agency's mission statement in particular. 
I believe this legislation will help create the dialog necessary between the agency and all interested parties in order to effectively exercise all of the other far-reaching elements of this reform bill. I was very pleased to have played some part in the development of that legislation and the broader reform effort, and I know that American citizens dependent on pure food, life-saving new drugs and medical devices, and safe electronic equipment will benefit for many years to come from the work we do here, today.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, included in the manager's amendment is an amendment, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment with my colleague, Senator Smith, to provide an additional tool in the toolbox, if you will, for rural counties who have come under significant hardship in funding law enforcement activities covering National Forest lands. 
Most particularly, Mr. President, a number of Oregon counties have had their sheriff's office budgets nearly busted by the need to address illegal, occasionally violent protests related to Federal timber sales and the regular management of National Forest lands in Oregon. 
On nearly every timber sale protest, my office has worked very closely with the Forest Service to find help. We have literally shaken the Forest Service tree to find additional resources to help small counties deal with their heightened law enforcement needs when one of these demonstrations occurs. 
While the Forest Service has been helpful, it has not prevented these rural counties from incurring, in some cases, nearly their entire year's law enforcement budget on just one protracted timber protest. 
Federal receipts must be used by Oregon Counties in the proportion of 25 percent for schools and 75 percent for roads. This amendment simply allows counties to use surplus funds out of the share that is for roads, on law enforcement activities associated with the use of public roads of the county. 
The Smith-Wyden amendment simply gives these counties--Douglas, Lane, Klamath, Jackson, and Josephine--a small tool to help them deal with illegal timber demonstrations that are political, and that are related to the Federal management of Federal lands. It is patently unfair that local communities must bear this burden at all, but we believe that this amendment will help. 
I want to express my great appreciation to the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and to the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bumpers, for working with me and Senator Smith on this provision.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have asked for this time to notify my colleagues that I no longer intend to object to the U.S. Senate proceeding to the nomination of General Shelton to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Last Thursday morning, I announced publicly that I would object to the Senate proceeding to General Shelton's nomination. My colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, supported me in this effort. We did so not out of any reservation about the general's qualifications but because he is about to become the Nation's top ranking military officer. 
Mr. President, General Shelton is in a position to assure that the military--and in this case the Air Force--respond to rather than ignore the requests of the Congress and our constituents. It is not too much to ask that the Nation's top general help us address the concerns of the widows of the American airmen who have died serving our country. What they have wanted is simply to have the Air Force explain the reasons for the crash of a C-130 off the coast of California last November that killed 10 airmen on board. In April of this year, the Air Force informed the widows and families that the cause of the crash was engine failure due to fuel starvation. No further explanation was offered at that time. When the widows and families sought further explanation, they were told that the case was closed. Later that month, they came to me, and asked if we could help. I approached my colleague, Senator Smith. And, at every step of the way, Senator Smith has been exceptionally helpful in our joint efforts to work to make sure that the Air Force would provide the loved ones of these airmen an answer to what happened in this tragedy. The families, my colleagues, have a right to know. 
We asked that an independent group be allowed to review the file. We asked that information about the crash be made available to the families. We asked that the Air Force give the National Transportation Safety Board's aviation experts access to the file. 
The denying of the request to provide the National Transportation Safety Board access to the files was especially difficult for Senator Smith and I to understand, because in the interim the Air Force had allowed a private contractor to look at these materials. On September 10, the National Transportation Safety Board informed us that, based on the limited data available, the Board was unable to determine whether the Air Force had conducted a thorough investigation. 
Having exhausted all other avenues to get this critically needed information for Oregon families, it was my hope that we could command some attention at higher levels of the military by appealing to the soon-to-be most senior officer. General Shelton's staff responded quickly. The Air Force has now proposed an agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board that should provide us the information we seek. It is a solid agreement and we wish to thank the Air Force for the prompt response to this case. 
The agreement between the Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board is supported by the widows and the Oregon families, and provides for a joint, high-level review of the accident involving King-56 and other C-130 incidents. The agreement calls for the team to issue a preliminary report within 90 days. It is our hope the full participation of the National Transportation Safety Board in a manner that assures its independence of action will finally get the families and the widows the answers they have awaited for so long. 
I want to yield to my colleague, Senator Smith. Before I do, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and Senator McCain, his colleague, and Senator Levin, for assisting Senator Smith and me. In yielding to my colleague, I again express my appreciation and thanks for the opportunity to work together on this matter in a bipartisan way. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Reed amendment, I want to explain why the Senate should restore $35 million to the State Student Incentive Grant [SSIG] program. 
First, SSIG funds go directly to the students, not to Federal bureaucrats or administrators. One hundred percent of these funds go to the students. 
Second, SSIG grants go to those who need them most: the median family income for SSIG recipients is $12,000--well below the Federal poverty level for a family of four. 
Third, because every Federal dollar directly leverages State education dollars, each additional Federal dollar may make the difference whether another student gets the chance to go to college. In many States SSIG grants truly make or break a student's chance to go to college. 
Fourth, at a time when costs are limiting access to higher education, we must do everything we can to give every student the opportunity to go to college. I was an early supporter of tax credits to help middle-class families pay the cost of higher education, and this program is just as crucial for the most needy students. 
This program is especially important for Oregon. In the 1995-97 period, the SSIG Program made the difference for 49,400 students in Oregon, with an average grant of $1,060. SSIG helped account for 5-percent of the funding for the Oregon Need Grant program. And there are more than 16,700 students who did not receive the grant because of underfunding. 
The Oregon Need Grant program helps provide basic access for Oregon's most needy student population. If we cut off SSIG for the l997-98 academic year, some 620 students could be forced to drop out of college. In pure dollar amounts, the grant may not seem like much to people in Washington, DC who are used to dealing in billions of dollars. But it will enable thousands of students in Oregon to make the decision to go to college. 
It is the students, of course, who say it the best. One student who works at the U of O admissions office on work study said `My father has been unemployed for about 4 years even though he has 20 years of naval experience and a college degree. My mother works for the local school system, but her income can't even provide for our family, let alone my college education. Without the need grant that I receive, I wouldn't be able to attend a 4 year university and work towards my degree in psychiatry and business.' Another student at the University of Oregon said: `The state need grant has literally been godsend. I come from a single parent household and my mother was laid off from a [major] corporation a few years ago and has only been able to get jobs as a waitress since. If it were not for the state need grant, I would not be able to attend the University of Oregon. I have lived in Eugene all of my life and I've always wanted to attend the U of O. I am majoring in journalism and hope to graduate this year. The grant made it possible for my mother to send me to school and still put food on the table for a family of four.'

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I take the floor tonight to discuss a resolution that I have introduced with Senator Warner to permit individuals with disabilities full access to the floor of the U.S. Senate. I believe that this resolution will be approved later tonight and has been reviewed by both the majority and the minority. I anticipate that it will be incorporated into the final business of the U.S. Senate during the wrap-up session before the session formally concludes. 
Mr. President, this resolution that I offer tonight will close the book on discrimination against individuals with disabilities on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Earlier this year, after a visually impaired professional on my staff was barred from bringing her guide dog onto the floor, the Senate adopted a resolution providing for temporary case-by-case entry to the floor for those professionals with disabilities. This was a good step--an important step. But it still left some room for discrimination. 
The resolution that will be considered by the Senate tonight will ensure that as a matter of formal Senate rule there is no discrimination permitted against individuals with disabilities. There will no longer be a double standard in the U.S. Senate. Senate staffers with disabilities who have the privilege of the Senate floor will be permitted to bring onto the Senate floor supporting aids and services such as canes, service dogs, interpreters, or assistive devices. 
This is an important day for the Senate, for people with disabilities, and for our whole country because it makes clear that the U.S. Congress ought to follow the laws that apply to everyone else in our country. 
I especially want, Mr. President, to recognize the hard work of the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator John Warner, in moving this resolution forward. As every Member of this body knows, he has an enormous workload. He was extremely gracious to me in working to develop this resolution and gain bipartisan support for it. 
I would also like to pay a special tribute to the senior Senator from the State of West Virginia, Senator Byrd, whose expert knowledge of the Senate rules was of enormous benefit in drafting this new resolution. 
As a relatively new Senator, I have great esteem for the constant care which Senator Byrd uses to guard the traditions and prerogatives of this body. I am of the view that every U.S. Senator owes a debt of gratitude to the Senator from West Virginia for his constant vigilance with respect to ensuring the rights of all on the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, this is an important resolution. It is justice long overdue. Earlier this year, a congressional fellow in my office was denied access to the Senate floor because she uses a guide dog. That guide dog is a working dog; a guide dog that serves as the eyes for a visually impaired person. The people of this country were offended, and they sent a message that this type of discrimination is unacceptable to them. 
My office, like many others in the U.S. Senate, were inundated with calls, mail, and e-mail. 
There was one letter I received that recounted a bit of history that I would like to briefly share. 
The letter that was sent to me told a story about the Senate in the 1930s when there were some Members who disapproved of a guide dog coming onto the Senate floor. The individual then who needed the assistance of the guide dog was Senator Schall of Minnesota. The letter described the Senator's first entry into the Chamber with his guide dog and how the other Senators rose, one by one, and then in large numbers applauded him. The Senate galleries followed suit until the whole Senate was just one gigantic standing ovation. 
The letter goes on to say that Senator Schall stopped by his seat, turned and listened to the ovation from all around him and was touched as the ovation continued and continued. Waving to the crowd, the Senator took his seat and commanded his guide dog, Lux, to lie down. The guide dog then curled up under the Senator's desk, tucking his body so it would not be in the way of any Senator who passed by. The May 22, 1933, issue of the Congressional Record documents how strongly the American public reacted to the news of the death of Senator Schall's guide dog. The guide dog died after being separated a few days from the Senator when he thought it would be inappropriate to take the dog with him to attend the funeral of another Senator. Senator Schall said then: 
Mr. President, since the death of my good dog, Lux, last March, the mails of this and other countries have brought me hundreds of letters of regret. So many expressions of interest have gladdened and surprised me. 
It seems to me that the action that the Senate will take shortly makes it clear that we have not forgotten how important it is to stand for the principle of equal justice in this Chamber. What we do each day is set an example, and here particularly an important example, because as a result of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Congressional Accountability Act, and other statutes, we make clear that the laws of the United States are going to apply in this Chamber. 
As a result of this resolution, and particularly the extremely helpful work that Senator Warner and Senator Byrd have done, it is going to be possible to have a formal Senate rule that ensures that discrimination against individuals with disabilities is not going to be tolerated on this floor. 
This rule takes the generally accepted definition of an individual with a disability, defined as one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, and says it is not possible to discriminate against that individual in this Chamber. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to observe that there are 49 million Americans with a disabilities. Under the law, they are guaranteed the same rights as all other Americans in terms of access to jobs, insurance, transportation, and telecommunications technology. They are not guaranteed special treatment. They are guaranteed just equal access. That is what this resolution is all about, equal access. 
Finally, Mr. President, many lessons have been learned from this experience. I believe that the Senate and our country are more aware and sensitive to the many issues facing individuals with disabilities. We have seen that rules can and should be updated to meet the changing needs of our society. I believe that the Senate and our country as a whole are better off as a result of the consideration of this resolution and the strong bipartisan support that has developed here and in our country. 
Mr. President, I think this is an important day for the Senate, a good day for the Senate, because it was a day which ensures that our country is a bit more fair, a bit more sensitive to the needs of those with disabilities. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have helped me so much, particularly Senators Warner and Byrd. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Byrd, Reid, Kerry, Chafee, Akaka, Kennedy, Murray, Bingaman, Murkowski, Feingold, Hatch, Durbin, and Harkin be added as cosponsors.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass the bill H.R. 1944, authorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR. 
My colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, joined me in introducing S. 881 on June 11. The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, was extremely helpful and the bill was included in a hearing on various land exchange bills on June 18th. The U.S. House passed the companion measure, sponsored by the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Smith, on July 22. The Energy Committee reported the House bill yesterday, and I greatly appreciate the Chairman's excellent work to bring the bill to floor for final passage today. 
This legislation will go far to keep the Warner Canyon Ski Area of Lakeview, OR, in business. If ever there was such a thing as a community ski area, this is it. It is low tech. It is run by a non-profit local organization. This legislation is clearly in the public interest of Lakeview, OR, and the Nation. 
This bill has important benefits to the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge, as well. Management of our National Wildlife Refuges can be burdened when there are privately owned lands inside of a refuge boundary, and this measure allows the refuge to take ownership to more than 300 acres of county owned lands inside the refuge. With this acquisition we move closer to the permanent protection of this important Oregon wildlife refuge. 
I was pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith, and I urge its passage.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the chairman of the Rules Committee, the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for his cooperation in moving forward with such an extremely important matter. Because of its significance, I think it would be useful for us to engage in a colloquy to enlighten the Senate further as to the intent of this resolution. 
It is my understanding that the purpose of this resolution is to clarify that individuals with disabilities who have been given the privilege of access to the Senate floor under rule XXIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate may bring necessary supporting aids or services onto the floor. This will ensure that the staff of a Senator wishes to have on the floor will not be denied the privilege of the floor because the staffer happens to use a guide dog or a wheelchair. This resolution is intended to be broadly interpreted to cover all individuals with disabilities. Is my understanding correct that this is the purpose of the resolution?

<TEXT>
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first, let me say to my good friend, Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, I just want him to know how much I have appreciated the chance to be a member of his committee. I think this is a historic occasion and a chance to work very closely with him on a variety of issues. Coming to the Senate has been a special pleasure. 
I also want to commend our good friend, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, who in my view has done yeomen work in terms of keeping this whole effort together and keeping it bipartisan. 
Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement that will be passed this week has been a long time in coming. I think our challenge is to now make sure that actually getting a balanced budget takes a shorter period of time. 
I do believe that we are finally on the right track because this budget provides an opportunity for the Federal Government to get its fiscal house in order while still making a handful of extremely needed investments in the people of our country and in U.S. productivity. 
Most importantly, I am of the view that this is a historic moment because it has been achieved by working together. If ever there was an issue that required bipartisan cooperation, this is it. It seems to me that this is an example of what can happen when you put down for just a few moments the political cudgel and focus on the needs of our country first. 
Let me also say that I would like to make a special effort in the days ahead to address the Medicare provision of this legislation. In my view, in the 21st century, Medicare is not just going to be a part of the Federal budget; it is going to be the Federal budget. There is no program in America growing at the rate of Medicare. I think it is well understood that in the 21st century our country will be faced with a demographic tsunami. We are going to have upwards of 50 million baby boomers retiring, and it is quite clear that efforts must be made now to modernize Medicare and get this program ready for the 21st century. 
I sought to begin those efforts by introducing S. 386, the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act, in the spring. And the fundamental principle of that legislation was to make sure that Medicare began to introduce the kind of competition and choice and emphasis on quality for older people that is available in private sector health care. 
What we are seeing in our country today is that Medicare has essentially been engaging in purchasing practices and management practices that the private sector threw in the attic years and years ago. In much of the United States, Medicare has been rewarding waste and penalizing efficiency, and we all saw that emphasized again this week when the Inspector General of the United States indicated that more than $20 billion is lost each year in the Medicare Program due to fraud and waste. 
The issue of inefficiency and the rewards for waste that you see in the Medicare Program are particularly important to those I represent at home in Oregon. We have gone a long way to reinventing the health care system in our State, particularly in the metropolitan areas. We have competition. We have extensive choice for older people. We do not have the gag clauses in the managed care plans where physicians are restricted from telling older people about their options. We have done a lot to come up with a health plan for seniors that will be good for older people and taxpayers in the 21st century. 
The reward to Oregon for doing the heavy lifting to reform Medicare over the last few years has been lower reimbursement collection. In effect, what the Federal Government told the people of Oregon over the last 10 years is you would have gotten higher reimbursement, you would have received higher payments, if you had gone about the process of offering wasteful, inefficient health care. And so what happens in much of my State, an older person, say, in the Klamath Valley will call their cousin or their sister in another part of the United States and ask them about their Medicare. And a senior in another part of the country where health care isn't provided so efficiently will say to the Oregonian, you know, my Medicare is great; I get prescription drugs for free; I get eyeglasses at a discount; I get all these extras that are not covered by Medicare. 
Seniors in Oregon and other States where health services have been efficient say, I pay the same into Medicare as seniors in those States. Why don't I get the same benefits? 
Medicare is a national program. Why shouldn't the senior in Oregon get the same benefits as the senior in another State, which on top of everything else is offering care that is more costly and inefficient? 
The reason for this bizarre situation is a very technical reimbursement system, an eye-glazing concept known as the average adjusted per capita cost. And the long and short of it is that it rewards waste, penalizes efficiency and in parts of the country like mine has meant that many of the health programs have difficulty even providing the basic benefits to older people let alone some of the additional benefits such as prescription drugs. 
Under this legislation, because of exceptional bipartisan work--and here I want to particularly commend Senator Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of our Aging Committee, who has worked very closely with me, for his perseverance in correcting this inequity. As a result of the work of our bipartisan coalition, this reimbursement system is going to change. We will see all counties in our country get a minimum payment for these health care plans that are holding costs down while giving good quality, and over a period of time there will be a blending of reimbursement rates to consider both local reimbursement patterns and national patterns. 
What this means is that areas like Oregon that have held costs down while giving good quality will get higher reimbursement, and my constituents, older people, are pleased because they will be in a position to get better benefits. But what is especially important is this is the kind of reimbursement change that is essential to save this program in the 21st century. 
I would submit that what will happen as a result of the bipartisan work to change the Medicare reimbursement process--Senator Grassley, myself, and others have spent so much time--is we will start seeing competition and choice come to health care programs in parts of the country where there is no competition and there is no choice. So we are talking about a change that, in my view, is going to really pay off for our country and pay off greatly in the years ahead. 
Mr. President, I want to turn very briefly to the question of the other changes in Medicare that the Senate has debated and we are going to have to tackle in the days ahead. Particularly now I turn to the question of raising the age of eligibility for the Medicare Program and the question of a means test or some sort of ability-to-pay test being incorporated into Medicare. 
I have long felt that Lee Iacocca ought to be paying more for his Medicare than should an older woman who is 75 and has Alzheimer's and has an income of $10,000 a year. So I think it is clear there is going to have to be an ability-to-pay feature added to the Medicare Program. But it is extraordinarily 
important that this be done right and that this be done carefully. I and other Members of the Senate felt that to try to do this over just a few months with so many questions about how this would be administered was precipitous action. But it must be done. Let us make no mistake about it. That change is going to have to be a part of 21st century Medicare. It has to be done fairly. My constituents were concerned that at a time when already they did not get a fair shake under the Medicare reimbursement formula, they were going to be asked to pay more immediately under Medicare. 
So there are some real questions about how to do this and do it fairly. But I want it understood I am of the view that there will have to be an essential change, and I am very hopeful the Senate will not wait for a bipartisan commission to make recommendations but with the completion of this legislation will start on that issue as well. 
With respect to the question of the age of eligibility for the program, here, too, there are very important technical questions of how it is done and how it is done fairly. There have been a number of analyses of late that have shown there is a significant increase in the number of uninsured Americans between the age of 55 to 64. So if that group of uninsured individuals is growing, to then add more, those between the ages of 65 and 67, would cause a hardship. So what I and others hope will be done as this effort to examine the age of eligibility is addressed is that there will be a buy-in opportunity, an opportunity for those individuals without insurance in that age group to be able to buy into the Medicare Program on a sliding scale. 
Again, I think this is an opportunity the Senate ought to examine carefully, ought to look at in a bipartisan way, and not wait for a commission to make recommendations as to how it ought to be done. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me say that as these significant changes in Medicare are made, beginning with the reimbursement formula changes that are being made now, changes that will bring fairness and competition and choice to the program, at every step of the way we have to keep the focus on protecting the rights of the patient. In this body Senators Akaka, Kennedy, and myself have led the push to ban gag clauses from managed care health plans. Health care is a complicated issue, we could all agree. But one issue we all should agree on is that patients have a right to know all the information about the kind of medical services and options that would be made available to them. 
Under this legislation, that significant protection for patients is in place and I think it is just the beginning of the kind of new focus that should be placed on patients' rights and the protection of quality health care which older people deserve. At a time when the health care system and Medicare specifically are in transition, protection for the rights of the patients is even more important than ever. At a time when there is a focus on more competition and choice, it ought to be met with an equal emphasis of protecting the rights of the patients, and that has begun in this legislation as well. 
Mr. President, I come from a part of the country that is proud to have led the Nation in the cause of health care reform and efficiency. Under the leadership of our Governor, Gov. John Kitzhaber, we have reinvented the Medicaid Program with the Oregon Health Plan. 
For more than a decade, as a result of work done by Democrats and Republicans and older people and health care professionals, we have reinvented the Medicare Program in much of our State. So there is a new emphasis on choice and quality. What this legislation does is it removes the penalties against those programs that have been creative, those programs that have led the Nation in reforming Medicare and Medicaid. It is high time that those changes are made. 
Mr. President, I think those changes lay the foundation for the other critical changes that are going to be needed to strengthen health care services in the days ahead. I look forward to working with our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to achieve those changes. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join today in bipartisan support for this important piece of legislation. In doing so, I want to commend Chairman Jeffords, in particular, and Members on both sides of the aisle, because this bill, in my view, meets the central test for good FDA reform legislation. An FDA reform bill ought to keep the critical safety mission for the Food and Drug Administration, while at the same time encouraging innovation--innovation that is going to produce new therapies and save lives. This bill meets that twin test. 
This bill is a result of, as several of our colleagues have noted, much debate and an extraordinary effort to build consensus. I am proud to have played some part in that effort as a Member of both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, having introduced, more than 2 years ago, H.R. 1472, the FDA Modernization Act, which contains several of the key ingredients of the legislation before us today. 
Mr. President, from the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed at night, we live, work, eat, and drink in a world of products that are affected by decisions made at the Food and Drug Administration. Perhaps no other Federal agency has such a broad impact in the daily lives of average Americans. 
Food handling and commercial preparation often occurs under the agency's scrutiny. Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements, from vitamins to aspirin, are also certified by the agency. 
Life-saving drugs for treatment of cancer, autoimmune deficiency, and other dreaded diseases, are held to its rigorous approval standards. 
Medical devices ranging from the very simple to the complex, from tongue depressors to computerized diagnostic equipment, all have to meet quality standards at the FDA. 
These products that are overseen by the FDA are woven deeply into the fabric of our daily lives, and the agency's twin missions of certifying their safety and effectiveness is supported by the vast majority of Americans. 
Yet, balancing those missions against the time and expense required by companies to navigate the FDA approval system has often been difficult and controversial. In the last Congress, radical transformation of the agency, even ending the agency as we know it and replacing it with a panel of private sector, expert entrepreneurs, became a goal of some. 
At the very least, reforming the Food and Drug Administration at the beginning of the last Congress looked to be an exercise fraught with partisan political turmoil, and destined for ongoing gridlock. 
But while there was focus on the extreme ends of the argument--those folks arguing for no changes against Members demanding wholesale dismemberment of the agency--a broad, bipartisan group of Members of Congress developed. 
With the help of Vice President Gore's Reinventing Government Program, Members of Congress from both political parties developed practical, bipartisan solutions to the critical management issues that the FDA approval process presents. 
I sought to mobilize this bipartisan movement with H.R. 1472, introduced in June 1995. Some in my party thought I had gone too far, too fast. But I am gratified that many of the elements of this legislation, strengthened in this legislation, are going to be considered by the Senate. 
These include, first, a streamlining of approval systems for biotechnology product manufacturing. It is clear that the rules for biotechnology, so central to health care progress, have not kept up with the times. This legislation will allow biotechnology to move into the 21st century with a realistic framework of regulation. 
The bill allows approval of important new breakthrough drugs on the basis of a single, clinically valid trial. 
It creates a collaborative mechanism allowing applicants to confer constructively with the FDA at critical points in the approval process. 
It sets reasonable, but strict, timeframes for the approval of decisionmaking. 
It reduces the paperwork and reporting burden now facing so many small entrepreneurs when they make minor changes in the manufacturing process. 
It establishes provisions for allowing third-party review of applications at the discretion of the Secretary. 
It allows manufacturers to distribute scientifically valid information on uses for approved drugs and devices, which have not yet been certified by the Food and Drug Administration. 
Each of those areas, Mr. President, was in the legislation that I introduced more than 2 years ago, and with the bipartisan efforts that have been made in this bill, each of them has been strengthened. I am especially pleased that Senators Mack, Frist, Dodd, Boxer, Kennedy, and I could offer the provisions of this legislation relating to the dissemination of information on off-label uses of approved products. 
This provision will allow manufacturers to distribute scientifically and clinically valid information on such uses following a review by the Food and Drug Administration, including a decision that I proposed more than 2 years ago, which may require additional balancing material to be added to the packet. 
Here is why that is important. Manufacturers with an approved drug for ovarian cancer may have important, but not yet conclusive, information from new trials that their drug also may reduce brain or breast cancers. That data, while perhaps not yet of a grade to meet supplemental labeling approval, may be critically important for an end-stage breast cancer patient whose doctor has exhausted all other treatments. 
That doctor and that doctor's patient have the absolute right to that information. It is time for this policy of censorship at the Food and Drug Administration to end. I believe that, with the legislation that will come before the Senate, it will be possible for health care providers to get this critical information and do it in a way that protects the safety of all of our citizens. 
This legislation is going to save lives, not sacrifice them. It is going to mean that more doctors and their patients will have meaningful access to life-saving information about drugs that treat dread diseases like HIV and cancer. 
It will mean that biologic products will have a swifter passage through an approval process which no longer will require unnecessarily difficult demands with regard to the size of a startup manufacturing process. 
It will mean that breakthrough drugs that offer relief or cures for deadly diseases, for which there is no approved therapy, are going to get to the market earlier on the basis of 
a specially expedited approval system. 
Mr. President, legislation, indeed laws, are only words on paper. Mr. President, we must also have a new FDA Commissioner who is committed to the changes in S. 830, just as committed to those changes as former Commissioner David Kessler was committed to the war on teenage smoking. 
This bill goes a long way to making sure that the Food and Drug Administration is prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century. But we also need to make sure that at the FDA, at that agency, there is a new commitment at every level to carry out these changes. 
I believe that it is possible to keep the mission of the Food and Drug Administration--that all-critical safety mission, a mission that Americans rely on literally from the time they get up in the morning until the time they go to bed at night--while still ensuring that there are opportunities for innovation in the development of cures for dread diseases. 
Mr. President, I also want to conclude by thanking a member of my staff, Mr. Steve Jenning. For several years now, he has toiled on many of these provisions with Members of Congress on both the House side and the Senate side, to help bring about this legislation. He has, in my view, done yeoman work, and I want to make sure that the Senate knows about his efforts. I know my colleagues in the House are very much aware of him. 
So we all look forward, on a bipartisan basis, to seeing S. 830 come to the floor. It is a bill that is going to make a difference in terms of saving lives. The Senate needs to pass it and needs to pass it this week. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act. 
This bill deserves support for one primary reason. It preserves the FDA's essential mission of validating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and medical devices, while encouraging innovation and the commercialization of new, life-saving therapies. 
This bill is the result of much debate, and tremendous consensus building over the last two Congresses. I'm proud to have played some part in this as a Member of both the House and the Senate, having introduced more than 2 years ago H.R. 1472, the FDA Modernization Act of 1995, which contains several of the key ingredients of the legislation before us today.

In the last Congress, radical transformation of the agency, even ending the agency as we know it and replacing it with a panel of private-sector, expert entrepreneurs, became a goal of some. 
At the very least, reforming the FDA at the beginning of the 104th Congress looked to be an exercise fraught with partisan political turmoil, and destined for gridlock. 
But while there was focus on the extreme ends of the argument, those folks arguing for no changes against members demanding wholesale dismemberment of the agency, a broader, bipartisan middle developed. 
And with the help of Vice President's Gore's Reinventing Government Program, Members of Congress from both political parties developed practical, bipartisan solutions to the critical process and management problems in the FDA approval process. 
I sought to mobilize this bipartisan movement with H.R. 1472 introduced in June 1995. Some in my own party thought I had gone to far, too fast, But I am gratified that many of the elements of that legislation have been retained and strengthened in the legislation and managers amendment we expect to have before us this week. 
These include: It streamlines approval systems for biotechnology product manufacturing; it allows approval of important, new breakthrough drugs on the basis of a single, clinically valid trial; it creates a collaborative mechanism allowing applicants to confer constructively with the FDA at critical points in the approval process; it sets reasonable but strict timeframes for approval decisionmaking; it reduces the paperwork and reporting burden now facing manufacturers when they make minor changes in their manufacturing process; it establishes provisions for allowing third-party review of applications at the discretion of the Secretary; and it allows manufacturers to distribute scientifically valid information on uses for approved drugs and devices which may not yet be certified by the FDA.

That data, while perhaps not yet of a grade to meet supplemental labeling approval, may be important for an end-stage breast cancer patient whose doctor has exhausted all other treatments. 
That doctor, and her patient, has the absolute right to that information. 
This legislation will save lives, not sacrifice them. 
It will mean that more doctors and their patients will have meaningful access to life-saving information about drugs that treat dread diseases like AIDS and cancer. 
It will mean that biologic products will have a swifter passage through an approval process which no longer will require unnecessarily difficult demands with regard to the size of a start-up manufacturing process. 
It will mean that break-through drugs which offer relief from, or curses of deadly disease for which there is no approved therapy will get into the marketplace earlier, on the basis of a special expedited approval system. 
But legislation, indeed laws, are only words on paper. 
Mr. President, we must also have a new FDA Commissioner who is as committed to these changes as former Commissioner David Kessler was committed to the war on teenage smoking. 
The pharmaceutical industry is a robust, risk-taking, technology-driven business. But by measure of total U.S. employment growth in this industry is stalling out. While sales by U.S.-based concerns continue to increase, more of the industry's manufacturing--its jobs--is migrating overseas. Part of the reason is rising domestic development costs. According to Tufts University, the average development time for a new drug is now up to 7 years. And the cost of such developments now figures out at something close to $360 million per product. We shouldn't kid ourselves about who foots the bill for these high development and approval costs--it's the consumer, and it comes via the extraordinary high prices we pay on drugs which can spell the literal difference between life and death.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend particularly Senator Byrd and Senator Kerry for their leadership in this area and say I come to the floor as a U.S. Senator from a State that is the first State in the country to put mandatory limits on carbon dioxide, the primary manmade source of global warming. We have shown in our home State that it is possible to have a thriving, prosperous economy and take steps to limit these environmental problems that our colleagues have talked about. 
The fact is, our country can help play a leadership role in controlling global warming without causing an economic meltdown. There are, really, three approaches that the State of Oregon has used, as the first State in the country to have mandatory controls on carbon dioxide emissions. 
First, as Senators Byrd and Kerry have talked about, we give great emphasis on market mechanisms. We are not talking about a big government approach. We are talking about using the market. 
Second, we have taken steps to build these new approaches into new powerplant design. It is prospective, so that all those who are constructing our new powerplants understand the rules. 
Third, we have given special rewards, credits, for innovative approaches such as proper management of our forests. 
I conclude by saying that properly managed forests can be very effective in helping to capture greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and removing them from the air. Our Northwest forests are some of the very best carbon sinks in the world. The older forests are estimated to be two to three times as effective in capturing carbon dioxide emissions as new growth. 
I have heard several of my colleagues talk about some of the alternatives. Carbon taxes----

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney General for Anti-Trust is one of the most critical to assuring American consumers enjoy the benefits of competition. The decisions made by the individual who holds this title affect billions of dollars and the ability of our companies to compete in the global economy. They affect corporate profit and loss sheets and the course of the stock market. But most importantly, they affect the prices consumers pay for basic services, from telephone calls to transportation and television. 
No area holds more promise for competition than communications, and that was the major impetus for the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Act was intended to eliminate monopolies, spur new entrants and bring down prices. Eighteen months later, we have seen pitifully little progress. The Administration has not moved aggressively to promote competition. The vote I will cast today is meant to send a signal to the Administration that those of us in Congress who supported the 1996 Telecommunications Act want to see competition rather than concentration. 
As a member of the Commerce Communications Subcommittee, I had hoped the 1996 Telecommunications Act would unleash a torrent of competition. Instead, we have seen prices outpace inflation in many areas. Each day the paper seems to carry yet another announcement of one giant company's plans to merge with another. Companies are spending millions of dollars on litigation and negative advertising. The situation reminds me of the African proverb: when elephants fight, the grass gets trampled. The grass here is the American consumer. 
Perhaps the overwhelming array of choices has lulled the consumer into a sense of complacency. We hear about 500 channel broadcast satellite and video-on-demand. We see pages and pages of advertisements for cellular phones and CD ROM's, interactive computers and digital cameras. The pace of progress is incredible. 
But if one peeks behind the smorgasboard, there is a very disturbing trend. The trend is toward concentration and media mega-mergers. Today's competitors are becoming tomorrow's partners. 
Mr. President, this is why the position of Assistant Attorney General for Anti-Trust is so crucial. The individual who sits in that office plays a pivotal role in assuring our anti-trust laws produce robust competition rather than rogue concentration. Consumers need a champion for choice in communications. 
I like Mr. Klein personally and believe him to be a skilled lawyer. It is the Administration's failure to move aggressively to promote competition that disturbs me. I hope my vote today sends a clear message to the Administration that the trend toward increased communications concentration needs to be thorougly examined and challenged. For this reason, Mr. President, I will not be able to support the Administration on this vote.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the hour is late, and I know a number of our colleagues, Senator DeWine in particular, has been very gracious or anxious to discuss some important issues. 
I just rise for a few moments to discuss the role of Egypt in the Middle East process. I think we all understand the dream of peace in the Middle East is going to take courage, patience and commitment from all of the countries in the region. Unfortunately, Egypt, the second largest recipient of U.S. aid, has taken a number of actions of late which seem more likely to undermine the peace that grew out of Anwar Sadat's courageous decision to go to Israel. 
I rise, therefore, with several other colleagues, questioning several of these actions by Egypt, a long-time recipient of substantial amounts of U.S. foreign assistance. These actions, in my view, raise serious questions, especially when they seem to contradict U.S. efforts to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East. Specifically, I am troubled by Egypt hosting an Arab League summit in Cairo earlier this year in which Egypt supported the renewal of the Arab League boycott of Israel. This represents a clear violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. 
U.S. policy has long sought to end the boycott. Yet, in this situation there is a recipient of U.S. aid that supports it. I am also troubled that Egypt has emerged as Libyan Leader Qadhafi's most important advocate internationally. 
Egyptian President Mubarak has publicly stated that Egypt does not produce chemical weapons, that Libya does not produce chemical weapons. He has advocated easing United States sanctions on Libya, and he has violated the U.N. ban on air travel by allowing Qadhafi to fly to the Arab summit in Cairo. 
What is particularly of distress to this Senator is President Mubarak was the only leader to decline President Clinton's invitation to attend an October Middle East summit in Washington to revise the peace process and to end ongoing violence. 
Most recently, Mr. President, and colleagues, we have seen some efforts by top Egyptian officials to take actions to reinvigorate the peace negotiations. I am very hopeful that those recent actions will be a signal that Egypt intends to play a more constructive role in the days ahead, in terms of producing a lasting peace. I have been especially pleased to see the strong, bipartisan support here in the Senate for the Middle East process, and for the good work begun in Oslo, and I am very hopeful that Egypt will see that there is strong concern right now in the United States Senate about a number of their actions of late and that the Congress will be monitoring those actions carefully. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

It is our understanding that the amendment has been cleared with the managers on both sides of the aisle and will be included in a package that will be offered later today.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, last November our Nation was shocked by the terrible news that an Air Force Reserve C-130 had crashed off the California coast, killing 10 Oregon reservists. All of the people of our State grieved and rallied to the support of the surviving family members, providing what comfort could be offered at a time of tragedy. 
Mr. President, when these tragedies occur, the first question must be: What can be done for the families of the victims, and how can it be possible to make sure that these tragedies do not happen in the future to the sons and daughters of other Americans? 
What we found in our situation is that the Air Force, when they stepped in, was able to offer only limited assistance to the families. The families had extreme difficulty in learning even the most basic facts about the crash and about the subsequent investigation. 
How would you feel if anxiously awaiting the news you were to first learn important details from television news stories? This is what happened in our home State of Oregon. And it is completely unacceptable. 
What our amendment does, Mr. President, is really two things. 
It directs the Federal Government to look into the question of using a different notification process for informing the families in these tragedies. 
As a member of the aviation committee here in the Senate, I have seen that there have been improvements in terms of dealing with these tragedies on the civilian side. And I believe it is time to bring more accountability, more compassion, and more openness in terms of how the families are notified in the instance of tragedies such as the C-130 that took the lives of our constituents. 
So the first part of our amendment directs the Federal Government to looking into using the process used on the civilian side with respect to these crashes such as we had in Oregon. 
The second part of our amendment directs the Federal Government to look into the way investigations of these accidents are followed up on. 
Right now, there is a dual-track system. There is one top secret investigation of a crash that cannot be seen. There is another separate investigation for public dissemination. And I am of the view that given what has come to light about the C-130 in the last few weeks, that this dual-track investigation, this dual-track process is eroding public confidence in our system of handling these inquiries. 
I believe that it is time to look at this in a comprehensive way, to lift the cloak of secrecy with respect to these investigations, unless it involves national security. 
Under the second part of the amendment that Senator Smith and I offer together here today, there would be an effort to look into ending the dual-track system. Right now, the dual-track system, given all that has come to light about similar problems in the last few weeks, in my view erodes public confidence, and it is time for the Federal Government to look at a different kind of system and, in my view, lift the cloak of secrecy unless an investigation does involve national security. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the legislation, particularly the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Levin. They have been extremely helpful to Senator Smith and I in going forward on this matter. The people of our State are grieving about this, and they want answers. We thank them. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Smith, who has been working with me on this. We have pursued this every step of the way on a bipartisan basis. I yield to my colleague.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the managers of the Department of Defense authorization bill and the committees for their assistance and support of my amendment. 
Earlier this year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. This historic treaty puts into U.S. law a clear prohibition on the testing, production, and stockpiling of an entire class of terrible weapons of mass destruction, and we are now part of the international institutions which will enforce the treaty worldwide. 
Even with this clear ban, constituents have written me concerned that, without their consent, human test subjects are used to research chemical and biological weapons agents, or that the Government, with the consent of local elected officials and Congress, may conduct experiments on civilian populations. Very often, these concerns are based on reading existing provisions in the United States Code that appear to permit it. The provision in question, contained in title 50, United States Code, Chapter 32, Section 1520, is a relic of the cold war, and my amendment strikes it. 
Further, to make it clear that such testing is no longer permitted, this amendment spells out a clear, easily understood prohibition of the use of human test subjects in chemical and biological weapons research. To prevent confusion, this amendment spells out the distinction between weapons testing and such peaceful medical research such as the search for a cure for AIDS or developing vaccines for deadly diseases. But to make sure that even this peaceful research is not misused, my amendments adds a new reporting requirement for the Pentagon to describe in detail every year exactly what sort of medical and peaceful research is conducted and requires the Department of Defense to certify that full informed consent was obtained in advance from anybody participating in this research. Congress, and most importantly, the public must have the best possible information about these programs. 
A provision that, on the surface, appears to permit testing of chemical weapons on civilian populations has no place in U.S. law, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in striking it.

This amendment is budget neutral, but in our home State of Oregon, through the Oregon Health Plan, we have been able to serve upwards of 100,000 low-income families with an innovative approach. The administration supports these efforts. It is a chance to go forward in innovative health care, a critically important issue at this time.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Adoption Report Card Act of 1997 to redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care. 
According to the American Public Welfare Association, the population of children in foster care is growing 33 times faster than the United States child population in general. During the past 10 years, more children have entered the foster care system than have exited. Every year, 15,000 children graduate from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 40 percent of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare. 
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system--a system that too often lets down some of society's most vulnerable--our children. 
I have already introduced legislation to promote kinship care as one solution to this problem. However, more still needs to be done. Part of the problem is we simply don't have any data on where children are in the system. No one knows how long our children are languishing in the foster care system, or how long it takes a State to find adoptive placements for children. Finding comprehensive data for each State is a challenge and, until recently, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] did not collect comprehensive national data on adoption from every State. 
The legislation I offer in the Senate today will require HHS to issue an annual report card on the performance of each State in protecting children placed for adoption, in foster care or with a guardian. 
My bill will require HHS to develop outcome measures, a rating system for each State and make recommendations on how States can improve their efforts to move children from foster care to loving families. 
It is high time we started holding those responsible for children in foster care accountable for the treatment of these children. I believe an annual report card will give us the information we need to improve the care and quality of life for these children.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator D'Amato to reauthorize the Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] Program. The Self-Employment Assistance Program takes an innovative and cost-effective approach to helping eligible dislocated workers become self-sufficient: It enables them to use their weekly unemployment checks to start their own businesses. The law has helped turn the unemployment safety net into a trampoline of opportunity for thousands of unemployed. 
Today, in 38 States the unemployed who wish to start their own businesses are forced to give up their weekly unemployment compensation checks as soon as their company starts generating revenue--but before it provides enough income to support them. It is exactly this problem the Self-Employment Assistance Program is designed to correct. It gives many skilled workers the chance to get back to work faster and helps create new jobs as well. 
In a few short years, the Self-Employment Assistance Program (Public Law 103-182; title V) has enabled thousands of unemployed Americans to use their unemployment compensation to establish new businesses. Modeled on experiments in Massachusetts and Washington, self-employment programs can create jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. Using existing funds, the Massachusetts program created dozens of new businesses but actually paid $1,400 less unemployment per worker than the State average. The Washington program created more than 600 new jobs and the firms were paying an average of $10.50 an hour to workers they had hired. 
In Oregon, 122 UI claimants enrolled in SEA last year; 76 completed the program. These entrepreneurs are now running an auto repair shop, a marine maintenance and repair shop, distributing cleaning products to resorts and restaurants along the Oregon Coast and setting up a computer cleaning service. 
In Grants Pass, OR, one participant said she could not have developed her publication business without SEA. It helped keep her afloat financially while she pursued her self-employment goal. She received counseling from the local Small Business Development Center, and through the Center she was able to contact potential customers. 
In Sweet Home, OR, another woman said the SEA program gave her the chance to have an income as she was starting up her day care business. She presently cares for nine children by herself and has plans to increase enrollment and add another teacher and three aides. The Small Business Development Center at Linn-Benton Community College helped her develop her business plan and locate financial resources. 
Over the past 3 years, 10 States used the 1993 legislation to create Self-Employment Assistance programs: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island. To date, DoL has approved six States plans (California, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Oregon) and four of these--Delaware, Maine, New York and Oregon--are actually up and running. 
Here's how the program works. States are given the flexibility to establish Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] programs as part of their unemployment insurance [UI] programs. It permits States to provide income support payments to the unemployed in the same weekly amount as the worker's regular unemployment insurance [UI] benefits would otherwise be. It permits claimants to work full-time on starting their own business instead of searching for traditional wage and salary jobs. 
The law directs the DoL to review and approve State SEA program plans. In States that operate SEA programs, new UI claimants who may be eligible for SEA are identified through worker profiling--automated systems that use a set of criteria to identify those claimants who are likely to exhaust their UI benefits and need reemployment assistance. State SEA program provide participants on a weekly or biweekly basis the same amount as regular UI benefits while they are getting their business off the ground. SEA participants are required to participate in technical assistance programs--entrepreneurial training (accounting, cash flow, finances, taxes, etc), business counseling (business plans, marketing, legal requirements, insurance, etc.), and finance--to ensure they have the skills necessary to operate a business. Finally, SEA programs are required to operate at no additional cost to the unemployment trust fund: the law stipulates that the payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefits charges the unemployment trust fund. 
Individuals may choose at any time to opt out of the SEA program; they may resume collection of regular unemployment compensation until the total amount of regular unemployment compensation paid and the SEA paid equals the maximum benefit amount. States, through the title III of the Job Training Partnership Act and Small Business Development Centers, support the costs of providing basic SEA program services, like business counseling and technical assistance, but may allow participants to pay for more intensive counseling and technical assistance. 
In effect, the program eliminates a high hurdle for those who have the ingenuity, motivation and energy to start their own businesses. In those States with SEA programs, an unemployed worker no longer has to choose between receiving UI benefits and starting a new business. 
Mr. President, as we move into the global economy of the 21st century, we must adopt fresh strategies so that our skilled but unemployed workers can start anew in the private sector. Harvard Business School reported last year that from 1978 to 1996, 22 percent of the workforce, or 3 million workers, at the country's top 100 companies had been laid off, and that 77 percent of all the layoffs involved white collar workers. Many of these highly-skilled and motivated workers want to start their own firms. Congress should not stand in their way. Renewal of the Self-Employment Assistance Program will give those States with programs continued flexibility to help unemployed workers create their own businesses and should encourage those without programs to establish them. 
Our bipartisan bill promotes the spirit of entrepreneurship. It carries forward a reasonable and sensible reform of the unemployment insurance system at no cost to the taxpayer. 
I would like to thank Senator D'Amato for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. New York has a very active and successful Self-Employment Assistance Program, and I look forward to working closely with him to see this important program reauthorized.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation authorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR. I believe that this exchange project is a win-win proposition for both the Federal Government and Lake County. 
Under my bill, the U.S. Forest Service will deed about 290 acres of national forest land, comprising the Warner Canyon ski hill, to Lake County. In exchange, Lake County will deed roughly 320 acres of land within the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge to the Federal Government. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
The specific acreage offered by the county will be determined upon a specific appraisal of all the lands in order to provide for an equal value land trade. 
While there is a commonly held notion that western ski areas resemble Oregon's Mt. Bachelor or Colorado's Vail, the fact is that there are many dozens of very small, financially marginal ski hills in the backyards of many small western towns. Warner Canyon is one of them. 
The Warner Canyon ski hill has been operated by the nonprofit Fremont Highlanders Ski Club since 1938. It's one of America's last nonprofit ski hills. It has one lift--a T bar. It has 780 vertical feet of skiing. The ski area is about 5 miles from the town of Lakeview, which has a population of roughly 2,500. 
The people of Lakeview believe that this legislation is necessary to keep the ski area viable. The Federal requirements for managing ski areas are more in tune with the Vails than the Warner Canyons. I'm told that under county ownership the liability expense alone should be reduced tenfold. The forest supervisor tells us that it costs the Forest Service about $10,000 per year to administer the ski area permit, yet the area generates just more than $400 per year in ski fee revenues to the U.S. Treasury. 
I also want to emphasize the benefits of this bill to the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge. As my colleagues well understand, too many of our national wildlife refuges contain private land inholdings over which the Federal Government has essentially no control. These lands can be sold or developed at any time. If Lake County were ever strapped for cash, it would certainly be their prerogative to sell these parcels to the highest bidder. With this acquisition we move closer to the permanent protection of this important Oregon wildlife refuge. 
I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Kinship Care Act of 1997. Grandparents caring for grandchildren represent one of the most underappreciated and perhaps under-utilized natural resources in our Nation. Yet they hold tremendous potential for curing one of our society's most pressing problems--the care of children who have no parents, or whose parents simply aren't up to the task of providing children a stable, secure, and nurturing living environment. 
There is such a great reservoir of love and experience available to us, and more especially to the tens of thousands of American children who desperately need basic care giving. We provide public assistance for strangers to give this kind of care, but the folks available to do it are in short supply. 
Legislation I am introducing in the Senate today will give States the flexibility to provide the support these grandparents need, so that our seniors can fill the care gap. Last year, as part of welfare reform, Senator Coats and I were successful in passing legislation that would give preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when determining a placement for a child. My new legislation will continue the process of shifting the focus of our child welfare system from leaving children with strangers to leaving them in the loving arms of grandparents and other relatives. 
I am not noticing a new trend. States have been moving in this direction for over a decade. Over the past 10 years the number of children involved in extended family arrangements has increased by 40 percent. Currently, more than four million children are being raised by their grandparents. In other words, 5 percent of all families in this country are headed by grandparents. 
My view is that it's time for the Federal Government to get with the program and start developing policies that make it easier, instead of more difficult, for families to come together to raise their children. 
My bill has several parts. First, it would allow States to obtain waivers to set up kinship care guardianship systems where grandparents and other relative providers can receive some financial assistance without having to turn over custody of the child to the State and without having to go through the paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles of the foster care system. 
Grandparents already face a number of hurdles when they suddenly find themselves caring for a grandchild. These may include living in seniors-only housing, not having clothes or space for a grandchild, or living on a fixed income. We need to encourage States to start making their child protection systems grandparent- and relative-friendly. 
The second part of this bill requires states to give relative caregivers notice of and an opportunity to be heard in hearings or case reviews with respect to the child's safety and well-being. I have repeatedly heard the frustration of these grandparents and relative caregivers who say they never knew about or were not allowed to attend a hearing or case review affecting a child for whom they may be caring or have cared for years. Surely their voices should be heard in those circumstances where the well-being and safety of the child is being discussed. 
As we reevaluate the effectiveness of our country's child protection systems, it's time that we start developing some new ideas and new ways to use our resources more effectively to find loving environments for children who can't live with their natural parents. 
I applaud the efforts of my colleague in the House, Representative Connie Morella who has introduced the companion bill in the House, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in giving states increased flexibility to make their foster care systems more grandparent friendly.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think it is clear what some of the opponents of the Kennedy-Hatch legislation are trying to offer the Senate. They are saying that the Kennedy-Hatch bill, a health insurance program for vulnerable kids that pays for itself, is a bad idea. I submit that even Joe Camel would have a tough time selling that proposition. The fact of the matter is this is a program that pays for itself, that is fiscally disciplined. 
In my State, close to 100,000 kids without health insurance are going to be in a position to get help as a result of this tobacco tax. I think it is important that the record be set clear on this. 
Now, this morning, Mr. President, the New York Times carried an article that said that the States are going to lose revenue as a result of the Kennedy-Hatch legislation and that this should be opposed on the grounds that the States need this revenue. The fact of the matter is that attorneys general across this country are rushing to file lawsuits on behalf of their States in order to recoup some of the costs to State coffers for health care costs. That is the reality. The fact of the matter is States are losing vast sums right now as a result of our current policies. 
Without the Hatch-Kennedy legislation, I am of the view we are going to have children grow up sicker, they will be sicker adults, they are going to die sooner, and health costs in America are going to increase. This is an important piece of bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. President, I close by paying a special compliment to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith. He has been subjected to very intense criticism at home by the tobacco lobby. 
I know a bit about what it is like to be attacked by them. They sued me personally when I was a Member of the House subcommittee that investigated their practices. 
I want to make sure that people know that Senator Smith has hung in there on behalf of better health care for America's youngsters. 
This proposal is right. It is fiscally responsible. It is compatible with a balanced budget approach. 
I hope my colleagues will reject the arguments that have been advanced against this legislation. 
As I said earlier, I think even Joe Camel might have some difficulty selling the argument that a fully funded proposal that will help our kids is a bad idea. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, all children should have access to a quality education, regardless of whether they have disabilities. The importance of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] is that it enables parents to acquire special educational assistance for their children who may be fully capable of becoming productive members of society, but may need some extra help along the way. I am pleased that Members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral basis have worked out a compromise that allows us to reauthorize this important piece of legislation. 
While I generally support the compromise on the IDEA bill that is before us today, I want to touch briefly on an issue that some school nurses have raised with regard to this legislation. 
I have heard from many Oregon school nurses about the importance of including nurses in the individual education program [IEP] development process. Under current IDEA regulations, school nurses are considered qualified health professionals and are considered fully capable of assessing a student's disabilities during the IEP process. The school nurses had asked to be mentioned specifically in the statute as `related service providers' in a disabled child's multidisciplinary team. While this could not be worked out, I understand that the committee report addresses this issue, and I want to convey my support for the inclusion of school nurses as part of the IEP process. 
In this country we frequently underestimate the excellent quality of care provided by this Nation's nurses. School nurses have the training and provide the supervision to safely deliver specialized health services. For children with chronic or special health care needs, the school nurse is often a crucial member of the multidisciplinary team that enables children with disabilities to participate fully in their educational program. As long as they are fully qualified to make an assessment of a child's disability, there should be no reason that localities should discriminate against nurses. 
Again, I complement my colleagues for breaking through the logjam on this important reauthorization, and I want to reemphasize my support for the school nurses who play such an important role in the care of children with disabilities.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate those Members who have spent a good part of the last 2 days in search of a compromise on this question of how we make sure that these emergency efforts are not unreasonably hindered by compliance with the Endangered Species Act. 
I have serious reservations about this compromise. This amendment includes a provision that seeks to clarify the phrase `reasonable and prudent measures' in the context of the Endangered Species Act. Reasonable and prudent measures are those things that the Fish and Wildlife Service or NMFS may require in order to protect fish and wildlife from the adverse effects of, in this case, a specific repair or reconstruction project. 
The language directs that these measures be scaled to the scope and effect of the specific repair or reconstruction project. We are told by the amendment sponsors that their intent is to simply re-state existing law. 
This raises two important procedural questions: 
First, if the intent is simply to express a concept that is already in the law, then I see no reason to include it here. 
Second, the question of how we define the scope of section 7 consultations under the ESA is a major issue in our work to reauthorize the Act. It strikes me as imprudent for the Senate to go on record on this question in this disaster supplemental, when at the same time the same issue is under intense negotiation in the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Having said that, there are several basic reasons to oppose the bill's existing provision allowing a broad exemption of all facilities with flood control functions from the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. 
First, the financial resources that this legislation brings to bear on the extensive damages caused by this year's disastrous flooding are immediately threatened and unreasonably delayed by using the bill as a vehicle to broadly amend the Endangered Species Act. It seems clear to this Senator that the bill would be vetoed and we would be back to the drawing board in trying to direct Federal resources toward the people who have faced awesome difficulties in dealing with this year's flood waters. 
Second, I firmly believe there is precious little support on either side of this issue for continuing to seek slam dunk, back door riders as a method of changing basic environmental laws. Reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act is already a complex and difficult chore, and we should set about that business within the regular committee process. 
And third, I am convinced that this provision is a case of Washington trying to fix a problem that simply does not exist. Let me talk more about this third concern. 
We have shown in Oregon--which has no shortage of endangered species issues--that we can get the dredges and cranes going quickly in response to the widespread damage we suffered in this extraordinary flood year. And we did it without sweeping aside the law. 
We went down an almost identical road here in Congress in responding to last year's flooding. We provided emergency funding to address major problems, and that effort, I'm pleased to report, was successful. Since Oregon's 1996 floods, literally thousands of actions have been taken to repair flood damage and restore natural resources. These include more than 400 emergency projects of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, more than 150 projects of the BLM, and more than 350 Forest Service projects on the Mt. Hood National Forest alone. None of these has been stopped or significantly delayed by the Endangered Species Act or other environmental laws. 
Oregon's experience once again is a model for the rest of the Nation. In fact, I'm told that it was Oregon's experience that has led to the much more efficient response to the floods in Idaho this year. 
The record in my State is clear: when we need an emergency response to flood damage, we can do it efficiently under current statutory authority. 
I want to talk for a moment about one example of our innovation--the cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that ensured that these 1996 reconstruction projects went forward in a way that protects fisheries and aquatic resources. Early coordination with the Service led to the preparation of a manual that guided early project design work. We got the Service some extra money last year to put staff directly on the reconstruction projects. These efforts allowed the various agencies to essentially pre-approve various flood projects that may be funded by this year's supplemental flood response request. 
The bottom line is, of course, that the process enabled the highest care to be taken in protection of fish and wildlife, but without delay to the projects. 
Idaho has now benefitted from the Oregon experience. Already this year, I'm told that the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Idaho has processed three times the volume of flood repair projects as were done in all of last year in that State. 
Finally, I believe the interests of the American people are advanced best when we address major issues in their proper forum and context. All of us support an appropriate streamlining of the Endangered Species Act to ensure the efficient reconstruction and maintenance of critical river facilities damaged by this extraordinary flooding. 
This is not the time to begin a major overhaul of the Endangered Species Act. This bill would waive Endangered Species Act compliance in a broad range of nonemergency situations, including the routine operation and maintenance of Federal flood control facilities--flood control being one of the many benefits provided by virtually every dam, levee, and dike along our rivers. 
I cannot imagine that we now want to take a sledgehammer to the requirements that Federal river facilities comply with the act and operate in a manner that is as protective as possible of the various salmon species that are in real trouble in our region.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and want him to know I very much appreciate the chance to join him and Senator Ashcroft on this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, it is very clear that the juvenile justice system today in our country is very much like a revolving door. A young person can commit a violent crime, a series of violent crimes, be apprehended, visit the juvenile justice system--and that is really an appropriate characterization--and be back on the street virtually immediately. In fact, in our newspaper, the Oregonian, it was recently reported that a child committed 52 crimes, 32 of which were felonies, before the juvenile justice system took action to protect the community. 
I felt--and I think this is the focus of the legislation that the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Missouri and I bring to the floor today--that there should be three principles for the new juvenile justice system for the 21st century. 
The first ought to be community protection; the second should be accountability; and the third should be restitution. The principle of accountability is especially important with young people. I even see it with my own small kids, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old. If they act up, there needs to be some consequences. 
I am particularly pleased that the legislation the Senator from New Mexico brings to the floor today puts a special focus on trying to deal with offenses perpetrated by young people that have not yet risen to that level of violent crime and, in effect, try to send a message to young people that there will be consequences. 
The last point that I will make, because I know time is short and we have much to do today, is that this legislation is particularly important in such areas as recordkeeping. We have found across the country that it has not even been possible to keep tabs on the violent juveniles, because there are so many gaps in the recordkeeping in the States. Both the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Missouri have done yeoman work in this regard. 
This is a balanced bill; it is a bipartisan bill. It moves to update the laws dealing with juveniles for the 21st century. 
I thank my friend from New Mexico and the Senator from Missouri for allowing me to be part of this bipartisan coalition. They included a number of provisions that are important to our State in the drafting that went on in the last week. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last month, I talked about the importance of the innovative `Community Justice' model for juvenile justice being developed in Deschutes County and Multnomah County, OR. Today, Senators Domenici and Ashcroft and I are introducing legislation that incorporates many important pieces of this Oregon model and also represents an effort to bring some new, bipartisan thinking to the issue of juvenile justice. 
Oregon's idea is that the juvenile justice system should weave the community into the very fabric of juvenile justice. This entails treating the victim as a customer of the juvenile justice system and realizing that when a crime is committed the whole community is the victim. There is a reciprocal obligation in communities--first, to give children the values and tools to ensure that youth crime is prevented and second, to look for at-risk children and try to form a net of services to keep these children from getting into trouble. However, once a young person steps over the line and commits a crime, part of the reciprocity involves the youth making the community whole through restitution and community service. 
I was pleased to work with Senators Domenici and Ashcroft to include some of these Oregon ideas into this bill. In particular, I think that the second tier of incentive grants will help encourage States to come up with ways to integrate the community into the juvenile justice process. In particular, the bill promotes consideration for victims and restitution for all crimes. It will also ensure that this restitution is collected. The legislation encourages States to look at mentorship programs, parent accountability, and ways to bring together service providers to form a network of information sharing to prevent juvenile crime. 
One of the key aspects of the Deschutes County model that is so impressive is the coordination between schools, juvenile justice services, child protection services, police, district attorneys, judges, and others. Not only does this build a broad base of support for the juvenile justice system, but it allows these agencies to identify the most at-risk youth early, to see whether efforts to divert them from delinquency are effective and to concentrate resources on them. 
When I began working on this issue in 1995, I laid out three principles for a new juvenile justice system: community protection, accountability, and restitution. We need to keep our streets safe, punish criminals, and make sure victims--including the community itself--are repaid. This legislation will encourage States to develop systems based on these principles and to add to the the important ingredient of community involvement in the juvenile justice system. 
I thank the Senators from Missouri and New Mexico for their bipartisan effort to develop juvenile justice legislation that takes a balanced approach to juvenile justice.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the people of Oregon have firsthand knowledge of the dangers of chemical weapons. Stored at the chemical weapons depot at Umatilla in the eastern part of my State are millions of pounds of chemical weapons. Mustard gas and nerve gas sit in concrete bunkers, a constant reminder of the need for action. 
We see and hear constant news reports about the dangers facing children in eastern Oregon every day those weapons sit in those stockpiles. 
There is no place in a civilized society for terror weapons like these, and it is not right to have stockpiles of these weapons that put our children at risk. Passing the Chemical Weapons Convention is the most important vote in this Congress for a safer future for our children. This is a time in my view for the United States to lead rather than to retreat. When Presidents Reagan and Bush negotiated this treaty, they fully understood that U.S. leadership was needed to complete it. They knew that full U.S. participation was essential for its work. 
Not only will failure to ratify this convention put us in the position of being followers on the world's stage but the provisions built into this treaty to isolate and in fact economically punish those nations which refuse to ratify the treaty are going to apply to the United States if the Senate does not ratify this treaty. 
In my State, we believe that we prosper from trade, cultural and other exchanges with the rest of the world and that there would be a threat if we failed to ratify this treaty. 
If the Senate allows America to become an outlaw nation, the effects would be felt by every farmer, software engineer, timber worker and fisherman who sell the fruits of their labor overseas. 
I would like to for just a brief few minutes review the arguments against this treaty. Some say that it represents a loss of sovereignty, but there is no greater threat to our sovereignty than to run away from our role as a world leader. Some say that this treaty would open our essential industries to espionage, but there is no question that the American chemical companies were consulted on this treaty. They worked closely on the key verification issues and there is enormous support, enormous support among those in the chemical industry to approve this treaty. 
Finally, there are those who say verification is unworkable because rogue nations will refuse to ratify it. 
But the fact is that ratification of the treaty gives our country new access to information about the chemical weapons programs of other nations. If we are denied access to this vital intelligence, then we will be forced to spend even more on our own intelligence to track the chemical weapons threat. 
The world is watching the Senate now, watching the greatest nation on Earth and hoping that we will lead the way to ridding our planet of these poisons. I urge my colleagues to join across party lines and approve this treaty, because when it is approved, our world will be a safer place. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, watching Ms. Shea enter the Chamber today makes me feel very proud. It is a good day for the Senate because ensuring equal access to opportunity is what the U.S. Senate is all about. Ms. Shea has been assisting my office in a number of matters, particularly nuclear waste legislation and legislation with respect to the rights of the disabled. 
Yesterday, I attempted to bring Ms. Shea on to the Senate floor to assist me in debate on the nuclear waste bill. Ms. Shea is a respected economist and energy policy expert who has worked for the Federal Government for more than 20 years. She was denied access to the Senate floor yesterday because she requires the use of a guide dog as a result of a genetic condition which significantly impairs her vision. 
Today, Mr. President and colleagues, I thank the majority and minority leaders as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee for moving so expeditiously to ensure that this body extend equal opportunity to citizens who are visually impaired. 
Today, a resolution was offered by the majority and minority leaders and referred to the Senate Rules Committee that seeks to permanently address this issue so that an individual with a visual impairment will not need to seek case-by-case approval just to use their talents on this Senate floor. I intend to work with Members on both sides of the aisle and with Ms. Shea to make certain that the U.S. Senate provides appropriate access to those citizens with disabilities and that the access complies with the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that what the Senate is saying today is that a double standard will not be allowed here. In the private sector, for example, Federal law is very clear. In the private sector where you have an individual with Ms. Shea's talents and abilities, and if a guide dog or a white cane is needed to carry out those duties in the private sector, Ms. Shea would have a legal right to have that guide dog with her. 
Now, I close by thanking several of our colleagues for their help in rectifying this situation. I particularly thank Senator Reid of Nevada, the lead cosponsor of my resolution, as well as chairman Frank Murkowski for his support yesterday. In addition, Senators Wellstone and Bryan and, in fact, all Members of the Senate who were on the floor yesterday during discussion of this issue moved to be cosponsors of this legislation. I thank Senator Ford who also, for years, has worked for the rights of the disabled. Finally, I thank our Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Greg Casey. He has been extraordinarily patient and conscientious in working with myself and our staff. I thank him for helping to bring justice to the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has done the right thing today by standing up for full legal rights and equal opportunity for those like Ms. Shea who have a visual impairment. The Senate is sending a message across this country that we are not going to leave our citizens behind. I am very proud that the Senate has taken this action. I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the resolution that I submit today would change the Senate rules that deny floor access to those individuals who are visually impaired and need to use guide dogs to carry out their official duties. 
By denying floor access to Ms. Shea and her guide dog, the Senate, in my view, is violating the Congressional Accountability Act, which requires that Congress abide by the requirements and intent of the Americans With Disabilities Act. A guide dog is a person's vision. A guide dog is a working dog, not a pet. This guide dog is with Ms. Shea all the time. He is with her in meetings in my office. He goes with her to energy committee hearings and has even gone with her to nuclear weapons facilities. 
Mr. President and colleagues, I had hoped that there would be no need to offer this resolution, but I am forced to because discrimination still persists here. Ms. Shea is being treated differently simply because she is visually impaired and needs to use a guide dog. 
Now, some may believe that the Senate fulfills its obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act--

Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleagues. 
Mr. President, some believe that the Senate is fulfilling its obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act if they provide someone to accompany Ms. Shea to the Senate floor. But let me say that an unknown staff person is no substitute for a working guide dog. 
The relevant language from the Americans With Disabilities Act says that an employer must provide reasonable accommodation for an individual with a disability. The Equal Employment Opportunity Office has said, `reasonable accommodation [is] when an employer permits a person who is blind to use a guide dog at work.' 
Let us put ourselves in Ms. Shea's situation. Imagine that you need to go on the Senate floor to carry out your official duties, but, wait, you must first check your ability to see with the doorkeeper, or go to the Rules Committee to get a resolution. I fail to see the logic of this, and I fail to see the justice behind it. Miss Shea's situation doesn't require extra financial resources nor special treatment. She just wants to do her job as a professional. 
A large part of the problem seems to be a lack of understanding. So let me tell the Senate a little bit about what guide dogs do. They are working dogs, not pets. A guide dog is that person's vision, an integral part of that person's essential activities and professional responsibilities. A blind person or a visually impaired person, such as Ms. Shea, has learned to turn over her diminishing sight to her dog and trusts that dog with her safety. This guide dog has blocked Ms. Shea from oncoming traffic. He knows his left from his right. He is a marker to others that Ms. Shea is visually impaired. She has gone to the Senate Energy Committee hearings and nuclear weapons facilities. This dog has even met more just access with respect to the Soviet Union. 
Yet, here in the United States, on the Senate floor, where we passed the ADA and the Congressional Accountability Act, we are refusing access to someone who needs to use a guide dog. This guide dog has a serious job, and, I might add, the dog performs it very well. This is the tool that Ms. Shea uses to be a productive member of the work force, and today we are denying her the ability to do her job to the best of her ability. Ms. Shea is part of a growing work force of persons who want to be independent, who want to be productive, and who have been raised with a can-do attitude. 
Let me conclude by describing how the guide dog would work on the floor. Ms. Shea would most likely tell him to `follow me,' and as they walked down the aisle, the dog would alert Ms. Shea to each step by stopping. Then Ms. Shea would say to him `find the chair,' and then Ms. Shea would sit down and the dog would lay right beside her. We would all forget that the dog was even here. In leaving, Ms. Shea would tell the dog to `find the door' once again, and the dog would alert her to where all the steps are and take her right to the door. 
Mr. President, that is all there is to it. It seems to me that the Senate should change its rules to ensure that there is justice for people like Ms. Shea. To tell someone like Ms. Shea that she cannot come to the Senate floor with either a white cane or a guide dog and only with an escort is demeaning. You take away her right to decide what is the best method for her to carry out her job as a professional. You take away her sense of independence. You take away her dignity. You make her dependent on others. That is not what the Americans With Disabilities Act is all about. 
Ms. Shea has Usher's Syndrome. That is the leading cause of deaf-blindness in the United States. She has struggled and worked hard to get where she is today as a professional. She is independent and self-sufficient, and she told me that she can cope with losing her eyesight, but she should not be forced to face blatant discrimination. 
It is time for the Senate to change its rules. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Rules Committee to do this. It is time to ensure that the visually impaired in our country have justice, and have justice in the way that Congress envisioned with the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Congress Accountability Act. I thank my friends from Minnesota, Nevada, and Alaska for joining me as cosponsors this morning on this resolution.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me time. 
Transportation of defense- and commercial-grade nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste is a great concern to the people of Oregon. Virtually every shipment to and from the Department of Energy's Hanford site requires at least 200 miles of transport on the roads in our State. As we have heard these past several days, the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste is a major concern to many Senators on both sides of the aisle in this debate with respect to how to handle nuclear waste in the next century. 
During the Energy Committee markup on S. 104, my amendment on transportation safety of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste was adopted. A key component of that amendment is the no shipments if no training provision. It literally means what it says, that there will be no shipment of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste through the jurisdiction of any State or reservation lands of any Indian tribe eligible unless technical assistance and funds to implement procedures for the safe routing transportation are available for at least 3 years prior to any shipments. 
This provision was carefully crafted to ensure safe transportation while also preventing anyone from using this provision to obstruct shipment by refusing to accept the grants or by failing to use the grants for training. 
Senator Wellstone's amendment further tightens this requirement, and, it seems to me, Mr. President, that our Government, built on checks and balances, ought to be ensuring this kind of mechanism, the kind of mechanism envisaged by the Senator from Minnesota, to ensure accountability and to ensure public safety. 
I also point out that it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel to transport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. What this amendment does, as did the amendment that I offered in committee, is to essentially build on the good system already in place to provide for the safest method possible for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. That is the system now being used for the transportation of plutonium from the Hanford nuclear reservation and other Department of Energy facilities to the WIPP facility in New Mexico. 
For the past 5 years, the Department of Energy has worked cooperatively with States and Indian tribes to develop the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act transportation system. It has been applied with success to a variety of shipments of nuclear materials moving literally from coast to coast. The Department of Energy has been working well with Western States in preparing shipments of transuranic wastes to the WIPP facility. 
I believe the WIPP Act, which the Senator from Minnesota builds on with his amendment, takes the right approach to address issues such as advance notification to the States of shipments, agreement of avoiding adverse weather conditions, qualification of carriers and emergency training and response of emergency responders. I do believe that this issue is one of bipartisan concern. 
In the Senate Energy Committee, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, joined me in offering the amendment that was adopted in committee, now strengthened by the Wellstone amendment. 
I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me this time, and I am very hopeful that it will be possible on a bipartisan basis to accept the Wellstone amendment, which I believe builds on the progress that was made in committee with respect to tightening safety measures, to proving accountability for moving these dangerous wastes across the country. 
I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me time. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as you know, I have come to the floor each day this week to talk about what I think is the critical need for the Senate to move forward with bipartisan Medicare reform. I believe there is a unique window of opportunity now for action, a window built around the proposition that our economy is moving forward in a positive way. Certainly, we are a few years away from the demographic earthquake that is coming, and I believe it is possible to fashion a bipartisan package that will also achieve real savings to advance the cause of enacting a balanced budget. 
I come to the floor today to reflect for just a few moments on some of the discussion over the last few days as it relates to Medicare and the budget. It is my view that Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said it very well a number of weeks ago when the Budget Committee first began hearings on this year's budget, when Senator Domenici said, with respect to Medicare, policy must drive the budget numbers. Unfortunately, that has not been the case in the past, and I am concerned, based on the discussions that have gone on in the last couple of days as well, that we are moving away from the need for structural Medicare reform that is in the interests of both seniors and taxpayers. 
In the last Congress, I think we did see a numbers-driven approach to Medicare. Over in the other body, there was a judgment made that spending for Medicare had to be reduced $274 billion. Others in my party proposed reducing Medicare spending by a smaller sum. In both instances, I do not think enough attention was paid to the need to come up with sensible policies that would really show how you could get to those kinds of budget savings proposed by either party in a way that was good for both seniors and for taxpayers. 
If we look at the debate over the last couple of days, we see some of the discussion again moving just to the question of a budget number. I am convinced that it is possible over the next 5 years to save about $100 billion as it relates to the Medicare Program and do it in a way that protects the interests of older people and also will help to reduce the deficit. 
But I think it is even more important--even more important, Mr. President--that this body understand that the big challenge is to lay the foundation for 21st century Medicare and that that challenge goes far beyond the question that has driven discussions the last couple of days. What we have to do is start bringing choice and competition to the Medicare Program. That is what is driving progress as it relates to health care reform in the private sector, and, obviously, choice and competition is what Members of this body enjoy through the Federal employee plan. 
I think it is possible to do this in a way that protects the rights of patients and makes sure that as we look to the future with more choice and more competition, that it is a future that does not involve health plans with gag clauses, does not strip seniors of their rights to appeal a denial of benefits, makes sure that their grievance procedures include what are called `report cards' so that our country can find out if people who sign up for health maintenance organizations drop out a few months later because service is unacceptable. 
The Congress now, as we move to try to develop a budget resolution, I think can find an opportunity to generate real savings. 
I do not want to, in any way, minimize the importance of that task in getting a budget. But we can do it in a way that will also ensure that the kind of structural changes in Medicare are made and we put this program on a solid footing. If that is not done, Mr. President, we will see a continuation of the kinds of problems that Chairman Grassley demonstrated this morning at the Senate Committee on Aging. 
Senator Grassley held a very important hearing as it related to accountability in the Medicare Program and particularly as it related to managed care. What Senator Grassley's hearing pursued was making sure that older people could have access to good information so they could make choices in their Medicare. 
In this country, we have, unfortunately, because Medicare has not been modernized, a situation where older people either have no choices, which goes on in rural parts of the United States, such as the area that the Presiding Officer represents and I represent, or, as we saw this morning in Chairman Grassley's hearing, places like Los Angeles where there is kind of a blizzard of information offered and it is not possible for older people to compare the policies that are offered to them in an intelligible kind of way. 
I said at Mr. Grassley's hearing that as we go forward with Medicare discussions let us make sure that his work, which is designed to empower consumers and is certainly not going to be a budget buster because it is largely an effort to try to force disclosure and comparability of these various plans--I urged that Chairman Grassley's work be included in a final bipartisan package. 
Suffice it to say, you do not hear much discussion in terms of the budget discussions about the work that Chairman Grassley is doing or about the role of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. And, unfortunately, there has not been enough focus on how the Medicare Program rewards waste and penalizes frugality. The private sector consigned that kind of approach to the attic years ago but that is how Medicare does business today. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, I think that as these discussions go forward--and certainly yesterday they dominated the debate about the budget--we have to remember that it is critical that Medicare be part of an effort to help address the financial challenges that our Government faces. I think that that can be done in a way that is good for seniors and good for taxpayers, but that it is even more important that the bipartisan changes in Medicare focus on the structural and underlying concerns that are plaguing this program. 
In much of the United States, the Medicare Program is a bureaucratic Tin Lizzie. It is clunky. It is inefficient. It is volume driven. And it is doing all the kinds of things that if another agency, such as the Pentagon, was doing, there would be a vast outcry. 
But we are not making the changes that the Medicare Program needs so as to make it secure for the 21st century, so as to make it secure for both seniors and for taxpayers. And that is why I come to the floor today, to say that this debate that we have seen in the last couple of days about budget numbers is important, but it is even more important to talk about the underlying and structural changes that the program needs for the 21st century. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I think that this debate about Medicare has been a bit like a high school sock hop where in effect everyone looks at the dance floor and no one really wants to go first. And I believe that now, if we put a focus on bipartisan structural changes in Medicare, a focus that says that the old debate about just trying to find a budget number for purposes of the budget resolution is not the way to proceed, but that we have a bigger challenge which is to get this program on track for the 21st century, that that kind of approach will allow us to make real progress. 
I have enormous admiration for Chairman Domenici who has made it very clear that he wants to proceed in a way that does help to reform Medicare policy for the 21st century. I think it is very clear that the Clinton administration has in some of their Medicare proposals reforms that would also help to advance a bipartisan compromise. 
I tried to take, in my legislation, the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act, some of the key principles that both political parties had advanced in recent years. I believe that if the Congress does not get stuck in the old debate about just finding a budget number, regardless of the implications for the program long term, we can, in this session of Congress, get the Medicare Program ready for the 21st century. 
That is what I am committed to doing, Mr. President. It is a bipartisan challenge. And I intend to come to this floor on an ongoing basis, as I have done today, to talk about the key issues with respect to Medicare reform. And the events of the last couple of days, which take us back, in my view, to just a budget question rather than making sure the policy changes are made, are exactly what we have to tackle. There is the opportunity now to get Medicare on the right course for the 21st century. 
As I have said, Mr. President, I have visited the floor each day this week to talk about Medicare reform, and the brief window of opportunity I believe this Congress may have to effect strong, stabilizing, and sensible structural reforms in this program. 
This should be about more than saving a targeted number of dollars in spending over the next 5 years, or adjusting the Medicare part B up or down to accommodate short term fiscal goals. 
To quote my friend Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, this should not be about numbers driving policy, not for something as important as the long-term integrity of the Medicare Program. 
We have the opportunity in the 105th Congress to begin turning this 30-year-old, Tin-Lizzie style program into a 21st century, comprehensive seniors health system, employing the tools and the innovations that have already marked much of the rest of American health care for the better. 
The reformed Medicare Program I envision, and which I believe is within our grasp, is a health plan that is about choice, quality, and access, and also about the efficiencies that characterize much of our Nation's private health care marketplace. 
Over the last few days, the conversation about Medicare reform has for the most part revolved around the negotiations between the White House and the congressional budget committees, and whether we can get close enough on a 5-year savings figure in order to proceed with marking up what we all hope will be a bipartisan budget resolution for 1998. 
I hope we can. 
And I commend all the parties involved in trying to hammer this out. I know it is tough. It is obvious from my limited involvement in this process that the determination of the Medicare piece may be the single most important function of putting together a Federal budget, or failing in that effort, this year. 
But I would go beyond that. 
I believe that my colleagues and I will be spending years together talking about Medicare as the major piece of the Federal budget process. I say this because Medicare threatens to be the monster that devours the budget, and with it the prospect of a health and secure future for millions of future retirees. 
And quite obviously, the longer we wait to put the brakes to the run away spending aspects of this program, the greater the political crunch we face in terms of dealing with the economic impact of the 75 million baby boomers--this demographic tsunami--that is set to begin hitting the program in the year 2013. 
During the next 30 years, we will see a society shift from the current four taxpaying wage-earners supporting each retiree to just two workers for each retiree. 
You do the math. The prospect is far from pretty. 
And that picture doesn't get better by merely formulating a number for spending reductions over the next 5 years. We can and must do better. 
If we focus merely on the short-term problems--and I agree that they are substantial--we risk losing the chance to change Medicare's essential structure to deal with the long-term, and much tougher problems to come. 
And that is why I must say that I am disappointed in certain aspects of the President's budget--I think this Congress can do better. 
Specifically, we are given in the President's Medicare reform ideas a method of adjusting rates in our payments to Medicare managed care plans which will No. 1, not focus a significant and targeted reduction in the rates of payment that we make to vastly over-paid plans in many of our large metropolitan areas, and No. 2, continues the `starve-'em, and kill-'em' approach to paying for coordinated plans--and for encouraging choice, in rural areas around the country, and in areas of high health care efficiency like my home State of Oregon. 
I've said it before, earlier this week. 
I will say it again. 
This is not the way to bring 21st century medicine to our Nation's 38 million Medicare eligible citizens. 
It is not the way to begin the long-term restructuring of the Medicare necessary to establishing a humane, cost-efficient and choice-rich program that will maintain financial equilibrium well into the next century, and not for just the next half dozen years. 
Mr. President, we must look to what is happening in the private health insurance market in this Nation in order to chart the new course for Medicare. Over the last decade, run away cost-growth 
in that market has been reduced to rises in per capita spending that are now just about steady with the increase in the consumer price index--a massive, massive change. 
No employer, now, will tell you that health care is cheap. But certainly, far fewer employers are now saying that the cost of health care provided to employees is putting them out of business. 
Our business is the Federal budget. 
We have a fiduciary responsibility to keep the Government solvent. 
I ran my election campaign on the promise that I would work my hardest--and bear my share of the heavy lifting--to balance the budget and end deficit spending. 
And I know that all of us, every one of us, Democrat and Republican, realizes that balance can't be bought cheaply or painlessly. 
Addressing Medicare's long-term financial problems in ways that maintain the program's long-standing commitment to a defined package of benefits, no matter how sick or poor the senior, must be at the top of our Federal budget agenda. 
Mr. President, today I want to conclude my floor statements this week with a short list of basic principles which I believe must under-line Medicare's restructuring effort this year, and which I am convinced a broad, bipartisan consensus may be reached. 
I am not arguing that this is the entire reform menu. 
And many will note that there's a lot of spinach on the bill of fare before you get to the desert portions. 
But I do believe that this is a square-meal reform agenda: 
First, I believe that we have to agree in a bipartisan fashion that Medicare remains a defined benefits program, first, last, and always. 
We should never turn Medicare into an exercise where elderly and frail beneficiaries, most often single women living on their own on limited fixed incomes, are given a check once a month and told, `here's your benefit, your voucher--go out and buy health care you need and if the benefit runs out I hope you can find help, elsewhere.' 
This would be an egregious retreat from a basic social contract with our Nation's senior citizens, and one for which I think there is little justification given the kinds of savings we can extract from the program by requiring better management, better plans and more choice. 
Second, we must develop spending controls that guarantee access, but at the lowest possible cost to the program and the beneficiaries. Medicare must employ prospective payment systems, putting providers on a daily reimbursement diet, for skilled nursing facilities and for home care, and for other portions of fee-for-service Medicare as opportunities present themselves. 
I have introduced a bill that would in part save approximately $20 billion over 5 years from these kinds of management systems in home care and skilled nursing facilities. Similar gatekeeping ought to be considered for other portions of Medicare that are now driven totally by volume. 
Third, the current system of paying for Medicare managed care plans, based primarily on the local cost of fee-for-service Medicine, makes no sense, and we've got to fix it. 
We have the strange situation where the highest-cost, volume-driven portion of the program determining how we pay, or reimburse, the part of the program designed to operate as a managed, cost-efficient model. 
Our purpose is defeated by trying to marry two completely antagonistic systems. And there are very unwholesome results in the form of beneficiaries in vast numbers of counties where Medicare managed care payments are either dramatically too low, or horrendously too high. 
In California alone, the U.S. General Accounting Office has estimated that this leads to over-payments to plans as high as $1 billion per year. 
We have to de-couple the cost of fee-for-service medicine from the formula we use to determine payments to Medicare managed care plans. 
Fourth, in a world where we hope that Medicare beneficiaries will have many more choices for health care, Medicare must work much harder to empower those consumers to make appropriate choices. 
And this is about better information about the plans available to them, and tools by which consumers can make informed choices about which plan is best for them. 
Mr. President, today I spent some time at a Senate Select Committee on Aging hearing that focused on this very issue. We heard testimony on the horrendous difficulty beneficiaries had in places where choice currently exists, trying to figure out what each available plan might provide. The plan brochures are confusing and filled with technicaleeze. And most importantly, it's obvious that there's no way most consumers are going to be able to sit down at a kitchen table and compare one plan against another. 
That's got to change. We need a system for Medicare beneficiaries not unlike the system we have in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program where plans are required to present themselves using conforming language so that comparisons can be drawn. 
And we need qualitative analysis by HCFA regarding how well individual plans perform--report card grades, if you will, on items ranging from disenrollment, to how long doctors stay with plans, to how many grievances are filed by beneficiaries. 
Fifth, beneficiaries must be reassured that improving consumer protection is still a front-burner issue. 
Appeals processes on denial of services must be streamlined. Medicare supplemental insurance laws must be reformed to guarantee issue of Medigap policies to seniors. 
HCFA should employ more ombudsmen to help seniors navigate through a Medicare system that will offer more choices, and necessarily will be somewhat more complicated than traditional Medicare. 
Five points--a modest agenda. But one that can begin creating huge dividends for our most important social program if we begin our work, now. 
There is, I know, a great deal of attraction in subcontracting the job of reforming Medicare to a bipartisan commission. I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues who have made this argument. 
Indeed, the conventional wisdom is that Congress simply does not have the political will to tackle this tough question. 
I have had a number of conversations with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, however, and surprising as it may seem there appears to be a hunger to attempt Medicare reform, now. I think there's a general recognition that we enjoy a window of opportunity that is characterized by rapidly falling budget deficits, strong employment and a growing economy, and that the general environment for fixing Medicare may not get much better for an awfully long time. 
And finally, let me remind colleagues that the ideas offered here today are not radical, and are really not out of left field. 
This model of a competitive, choice-rich Medicare that is efficient while maintaining quality has been road-tested--indeed it exists today--in Oregon, where low-cost, high-quality, coordinated care Medicare now embraces almost 60 percent of the Portland metropolitan area market, and where the highest reimbursement rates for such care are still almost 20 percent below the national average. 
We have seen the future. 
It works. 
It is time for this Congress to begin implementing changes in Medicare that transforms the national program along the lines of what has worked for thousands of seniors in Oregon.

Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I suspect that there are some who now think this whole discussion is sort of a question of `not in my backyard' run wild. I submit to my colleagues, that is not what is at issue. In fact, Hanford is in Washington State. It is not in the State of Oregon. But I care greatly about this because there is already more high-level nuclear waste now stored at Hanford than at any other Federal facility in the Nation. There is no place in the United States where nuclear materials are stored under worse conditions than at Hanford. So, the fact is, if there are to be tens of 
thousands of tons of additional nuclear waste parked at Hanford, even though it is not safely storing the waste it now has on site, there will be great problems for the Pacific Northwest. So, I tell the Senate today, and Senator Smith also joins me in this effort, that I think this is a critical public health and safety question that when, in fact, you have high-level nuclear waste stored there already and you cannot deal with that safely, you certainly should not put additional waste there. 
I thank Chairman Murkowski for yielding to me. I want to say to the Senate, this is not, in my view, a question of not in my backyard run rampant, but that there are really public interest reasons for ensuring that additional problems are not foist upon the Pacific Northwest. I thank the chairman for yielding.

The reason that it is important to include Hanford in this legislation is that there is no place in the United States where nuclear materials are now stored under worse conditions than at Hanford. In fact, there is already more high-level nuclear waste stored at Hanford than at any other Federal facility in the country. I offered this in the committee with Senator Smith of Oregon.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor each day this week to talk about what I think is the critical need for the Senate to develop a bipartisan plan to reform Medicare. Medicare is a lifeline for millions and millions of American families, and I think it is understood by every Member of this body that this is a program that faces financial crisis as we look to the next century. 
Today, as part of the effort to build support for a bipartisan Medicare reform effort I will look specifically at the Medicare reimbursement formula. I think it is important to take this subject up because I believe today's Medicare reimbursement system in many instances overcharges taxpayers on costs and shortchanges older people who need and deserve good quality care. 
Now, Mr. President, as we all know, there are essentially two major types of health care in America. There is traditional health care, what is known as fee-for-service. It means just what it sounds like. Providers get paid on the basis of the number of services that they render. This, unfortunately, can encourage waste. If, for example, an older person in traditional health care receives 10 medical tests and 4 would have been sufficient, under traditional health care the provider gets paid for 10. The other type of health care is what is known as managed care or health maintenance organizations. This is essentially a prepaid kind of arrangement. It creates incentives to hold down costs. But as we know, in some instances, tragically, it has also been used as a tool to hold back on needed health care that older people depend on. 
The Federal Government, looking to the great demographic changes, the demographic earthquake that our country will face in the next century, has sought to try to change this system of reimbursement and, in particular, try to encourage the availability of good quality--I want to emphasize that, good quality--managed care or health maintenance organizations. 
They set up a plan for reimbursing these organizations known as the average adjusted per capita cost, or AAPCC. Now, I am the first to admit that discussion of this topic is pretty much a sleep-inducing, eye-glazing issue, but certainly for folks in rural Wyoming, rural Oregon and across this country, the low-cost areas, it has great implications, but also it has great implications for the system as a whole. 
I believe that the Federal Government has botched the job of handling this reimbursement system, and it is time to make some fundamental changes. Under this reimbursement system, Medicare pays health maintenance organizations 95 percent of the estimated cost of treating a patient under fee-for-service plans in a particular county. What this very often means is that in an area where there has not been an effort to inject competition, where there has not been an effort to drive out waste, you have wasteful, inefficient fee-for-service health care being offered, and it is being used, essentially, as a path to guide reimbursement for the HMO's, the health maintenance organizations. 
I brought a couple of charts to the floor today. The first is one that shows that many, many of our counties across this country that have tried to hold down costs are reimbursed for health maintenance organizations, or the competitive part of the Medicare system, in a way that is below the national average. Certainly, Mr. President, you and others like myself who represent rural areas see how critical this issue is because our providers have difficulty providing the defined benefits under Medicare, let alone some of the extras such as reduced drugs, eyeglasses and hearing aids that are available in many of the high-cost areas. 
For example, as my next chart illustrates, in 1997, one of the very high-cost reimbursement areas was in Florida, in Dade City, FL, with $748 a month received there, whereas in Arthur, NE, they receive $221 per month. So the question, essentially, is to our colleagues, again, on a bipartisan basis, our colleagues from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey and Senator Hagel: Is it true that a typical 72-year-old Nebraskan is that much healthier than a typical New Yorker of the same age? Well, Medicare thinks so. That is how the Federal Government does business. The Federal Government conducts its affairs that way. I think it is wrong. It is that way not just for folks in Nebraska but many other parts of the country like ours that, again, we share on a bipartisan basis, and as a result our seniors get a much thinner Medicare benefit package than they would if they were in an area that was much more costly. 
For example, in my home community of Portland, OR, we have the highest concentration of HMO's in the country, the highest level of penetration of HMO's in the United States, just about 60 percent, and we are reimbursed at a level significantly below the national average of $467. We get reimbursed at a $387-per-month level. What happens is a senior who lives in 
Dade City, FL, or in southern California or parts of New York State calls seniors I represent in Oregon and asks them how Medicare is going, and seniors in the high-cost areas say, `It's going great because we can get prescription drugs, eye glasses and hearing aids all at essentially little or no cost,' and seniors in Oregon get none of those things, and, in fact, many of their providers in rural parts of our State have difficulty providing basic services. 
So the question then becomes, what are some of the fundamental ways in which to change this system which so often rewards waste, penalizes the frugal and, in effect, creates an incentive for various parts of the country to do business as usual, even though the General Accounting Office and other bodies are saying that business as usual will be bad news for both seniors and for taxpayers. Several practical suggestions are at hand, Mr. President, and suggestions that I believe ought to be adopted on a bipartisan basis. I think for the long term, it is time to separate out, to literally cut off the link between HMO's, the managed care, and fee-for-service, because I think what we are having today is a situation that literally creates incentives for wasteful health care. 
Second, it seems to me there ought to be a new minimum payment floor that brings up all the counties that have been low cost, and especially those in rural areas, and certainly the President of the Senate, just as I see in rural Oregon, understands the importance of that. 
Third, it seems to me that the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ought to begin a gradual effort to move to a national reimbursement level, a blended kind of level, and do it gradually so that areas that have been more inefficient are not going to face all of the changes overnight, 
but are going to understand very clearly that with an effort to move to a blended or national reimbursement rate, Congress is not going to tolerate what we have today, which is a system that rewards waste. 
Finally, Mr. President, it seems to me that the Federal Government should be trying to promote competition, serious competition, as the private sector does, in areas of high-cost managed care or significant penetration of health maintenance organizations. There is no question in my mind that some HMO's are overpaid. We do need to produce competition in those areas. I believe that that can be carefully targeted. That, in my view, is the guts of reimbursement reform, Mr. President. 
I would like to conclude my remarks today by saying that going to the next level of Medicare reform after we take care of the reimbursement issue is a logical step because it flows from what needs to be done with the reimbursement formula. By getting good data and more logical data about the various counties, the Health Care Financing Administration will be in a position to make information available to older people and their families across this country about how to make better choices with respect to their health care. Today, what we have is a situation where many older people get no choices at all. We see that in many rural parts of our country because of the reimbursement formula. The reimbursement formula is so low that many plans won't come in, so seniors in those areas get few choices. In the high-cost areas, the Federal Government has put out a mishmash of information which makes it impossible to choose between the various services that are available to them, and that is absolutely key because in those high-cost areas we have exactly the places where it is most important to get competition. 
Yesterday, I brought to the floor--I am going to blow it up in the days ahead so that it's possible for the Senate to see it in more detail--an example of what it is like for an older person in Los Angeles to try to navigate through the various health choices available to her. In fact, it takes one full wall, in a picture that the General Accounting Office took, just to put the various pieces of information that that senior would have to wade through. So I want to see us now have the Federal Government look to what the private sector is doing to empower seniors and their families to get understandable, clear information about Medicare so that they can make appropriate choices. This involves details on the way different Medicare choices and plans work, data on the experience of seniors with similar health and income backgrounds, the methods and the decision steps used by plans to pay participating practitioners and health care facilities and providers. And, Mr. President, certainly, Members of this body should understand that this is doable because this is largely the kind of information that is available to Members of the Senate and other Federal employees who participate in the Federal employee health plan. 
So in ensuring that seniors can receive a full list of plans available to them, enrollment fairs are an approach that has been looked at in the past, and there may be other ways to do that, such as publishing appropriate performance data on plans. These kinds of steps are approaches that the Federal Government has pursued and have related to Senators and members of the Federal service. It seems to me that there is no reason to further delay making this kind of information available to those who depend on Medicare. Older people ought to be in a position to enroll and disenroll from a plan at any time. 
Certainly, this kind of approach will encourage competition. Perhaps at some point there ought to be incentives to try to keep people in plans that are cost effective, and I think that the Federal Government can look to this kind of approach. But, certainly, significant rights of older people to enroll and disenroll in plans is critical. 
So these kinds of rights, like appeal rights when you have been denied benefits, a good grievance procedure--in effect, a patients' bill of rights--is what is fundamental to making sure that older people are in a position to get the kind of information they need in order to make choices about their health care and, at the same time, inject competition into this system. 
We have made many of these decisions already as it relates to Federal employees and Senators. We have made them as it relates to the private sector and, in fact, we have even made them in areas that have parallels to this program--for example, in the Medigap Program. I and others were involved in this to try to make sure that seniors who purchased supplemental coverage would be in a position to make sure they could get full value and have a place to turn to for their questions. We can take a lesson from the Medigap Program, and the Federal Government ought to make available troubleshooters to answer questions from older people as we move to competition. 
So, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I think every Member of this body understands that business as usual with respect to Medicare is unacceptable. I will tell you, if you don't like the program, if you really dislike Medicare, keep it the way it is, because the way it is is going to be a path that 
will cause, in my view, great calamity for families and seniors. If you believe Medicare is a program that has made an enormous difference in the lives of older people, I think that is the best argument for a bipartisan Medicare reform effort, a bipartisan Medicare reform effort that would ensure that seniors got guaranteed, secure benefits, not some check or some sort of voucher that just said, well, maybe this will be enough for your care and maybe it won't. 
Seniors deserve guaranteed, secure benefits. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been absolutely right in saying that much of Medicare across this country is an outdated tin lizzy kind of program, a program that the private sector consigned to the attic years ago. So let us try to bring the parties together around the proposition that there ought to be defined, secure, guaranteed benefits, around the proposition that it is time to bring the revolution in the private sector to Medicare, and do it in a way that protects patients' rights--no gag clauses or limitations on what older people can know about plans, grievance procedures, appeal rights. Those are the kinds of issues I think that both parties can agree on. 
I intend to come to the floor day after day to bring the issues of Medicare reform to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of the public, because I believe this is going to be the issue that is going to dominate the debate about our priorities, particularly our domestic priorities, for the next 15 to 20 years. 
I believe that every Member of this body in the next century is going to be asked: What did you do in 1997 to get Medicare on track? 
I believe there are opportunities now, as we move to the budget, as we move to efforts to have a bipartisan balanced budget, to start the changes that will put Medicare on track for older people and taxpayers. 
Senator WYDEN. Mr. President, to reiterate, the heart of the Medicare Program is the 38 million beneficiaries now dependent on this health care system as an essential social lifeline. 
Any changes we make to Medicare must, first and foremost, consider the likely effects those reforms will have on these beneficiaries, many of whom are frail, infirm, and low-income. 
As I've said every day on the floor of the Senate this week, I'm going to be talking today about the choices and access those beneficiaries ought to have, but who in too many parts of the country have no choices and poor access to health care. 
I'm also going to be talking about the window of opportunity we have in this Congress to enact significant changes in the program to cure the half-trillion-dollar shortfall we can expect in this program by the end of the coming decade, and to bring new choices, new access and new efficiencies necessary to save Medicare for not just the next 5 years, but into 2010, 2020, and 2030. 
As I said yesterday, Medicare is a 1965-model tin-Lizzy health care program showing little resemblance to the rest of American health care. Various out-dated, out-moded and bureaucratic features of Medicare practically encourage practitioners in the greater part of the Medicare system to drive up unnecessary care and resulting over-billing--actions which over-charge the Government on costs, but short-change beneficiaries on good health care. 
Beginning in the last decade, the Government's partial solution to this was to institute coordinated care in Medicare. We encouraged health insurers to begin offering plans that managed service Medicare beneficiaries received, and we offered encouragement to beneficiaries to participate in the form of lower out-of-pocket costs and, we anticipated, a broader package of goods and services. 
And we would determine how each plan, in each city, would be paid for each beneficiary in the plan according to an arcane formula called the average adjusted per capita cost--or the AAPCC. 
Now, before your eyes glaze over, let me give you a very simplistic idea of how the local AAPCC payment rate is determined, and how this formulation really penalizes beneficiaries living in places where medical costs are relatively low. 
The AAPCC is any given county is formulated on the cost of providing medicine, per 
beneficiary, in the most costly portion of Medicare--the traditional sector known as fee-for-service. This is the portion of the program where beneficiary can elect to see just about any doctor they want, whenever they want, and the individual care providers in those situations can be reimbursed for just about any services they deem necessary for that beneficiary. 
No questions asked. No oversight. 
This may sound like a pretty good deal for the beneficiaries. But it doesn't always mean they get the care they need or require. For example, there's nothing to stop an individual provider in fee-for-service for ordering up 10 or 12 tests for a beneficiary, when only 3 or 4 really are required. 
This is one of the reasons why fee-for-service Medicare is growing at a much more rapid rate than the rest of the program--and it's one of the reasons we find ourselves in such a deep financial hole. 
It is also clear that the rapid growth of fee-for-service Medicare seems endemic to certain large metropolitan regions of the county. 
As my colleagues may be able to see, the areas in blue and white represent portions of the country where the AAPCC rate is below the national average. 
The areas in red and orange represents areas where the payments are above the average. 
And just for the record, the variation is huge. The 1997 high-reimbursement county is Richmond County, up in New York, at $767 per month, per beneficiary, while the lowest paid county was over here in Arthur County, Nebraska, at $221 per month. 
Now, I'd ask my colleagues Bob Kerrey and Chuck Hagel whether they think a typical 72-year-old Nebraskan is that much healthier than a typical New Yorker of the same age? 
Medicare seems to think so, and I think they're wrong. 
And unfortunately for folks in Nebraska and other low pay States--my home State of Oregon is certainly one of them--the difference is that they get a much thinner Medicare benefit package in coordinated care plans, if they have access to such plans at all because their monthly reimbursement rate is so abysmally low. 
Let's talk about some examples of how this hurts beneficiaries in cost-efficient counties where the reimbursement rate is particularly screwy. 
In Mankato, MN, where the average payment is $300 per month, beneficiaries in coordinated plans get their basic managed care coverage under Medicare rules--but nothing else. No discounts on prescription drug purchases, no additional preventative care, no hearing aid discounts, no coverage for eyeglasses. 
In Portland, OR, my home town, the rate is a little better at $387 per month, but that's still well below the $467 national average. That means the best additional benefit received by these folks, who have the highest managed care penetration rate in the country at about 60 percent, is a 30 percent discount on prescriptions up to a $50 maximum. 
Now, let's go up to the high end of this wacky AAPCC payment system. In Miami, FL, where the payment rate is all the way up to $748 per month, seniors in these programs get unlimited prescription drug reimbursements, a $700 credit for hearing aids, and dental coverage--all add-ons that are virtually unheard of in most of the rest of the country. 
Mr. President, I wish I could say that this is the kind of cost-accounting that's going to add stability and integrity to the Medicare Program into the next century. Unfortunately, all this payment formula accomplishes is: First, huge overpayments in some counties, with resulting extravagant profits to insurance companies, and second, payments to other counties which are obviously too low, and which result in either no coordinated care offerings to beneficiaries in those communities or bare-bones plans that for millions of beneficiaries to incur higher out-of-pocket costs purely as a matter of geographic accident. 
I believe we can transform Medicare from an aging dinosaur insurance program into a comprehensive seniors health care system while maintaining our historic commitment to a basic package of benefits for every beneficiary, no matter their health or income status. 
But that transformation necessarily will involve providing seniors with many more choices with regard to their health plan selection. 
The current formula used for paying Medicare in rural counties and in other places where communities have worked hard to reduce general health care costs is precisely antagonistic to that purpose. 
This system denies folks choice because it necessarily results in poor quality health plans, high out-of-pockets expenses, or no managed care choices--or a combination of all three--for vast numbers of beneficiaries. 
And again, an accident of geography seems to be the deciding factor in the current state of affairs. 
I believe Medicare reform has to include remedies for these problems. 
This is not just a matter of increasing the benefit package for folks in low pay counties. More fundamentally, this is an issue of providing more choices, to encouraging the entry of more plans, into large areas of this country where the current AAPCC formula creates reimbursement rates which are so low--which are so nonsensical--as to completely discourage anything but fee-for-service Medicare in those communities. 
I believe reimbursement reform include several important features: 
A new minimum payment floor that brings all counties up to 80 percent of the national average, immediately. 
A new annualized reimbursement increase formula that shifts adjustments away from localized fee-for-service medicine costs, and toward actual cost increases in coordinated care. 
A systematic imposition of financial controls reimbursement growth in high-reimbursement counties in order to squeeze out what have to be monumental over-payments to plans in those communities, and huge losses to the Medicare Program. 
Mr. President, reforming Medicare isn't just about reforming payment systems, however. 
It's also about helping beneficiaries to become smarter shoppers in a new Medicare environment that we hope will offer many of them many more choices and options for care. 
Therefore, it is critical that we change the program in way that will empower seniors to make the appropriate choices. 
At the bottom, this means developing and executing a much better system of informing beneficiaries about their rights in managed care, and about the most important provisions of the health plans available to them. This information must be given to seniors as `news they can use'--data that is in clear and accurate layman's language, and which conforms to standardized reporting practices so that consumers can compare one plan against another in a traditional kitchen-table-assessment. 
Indeed, these tools if we had them would be useful, today, with 80,000 beneficiaries per month choosing to leave fee-for-service Medicare for Medicare managed care organizations. 
According to Stanley Jones, chairman of the National Institute of Medicine's committee on choice and managed care:  
Many elderly are making these new choices without enough information to judge which option is best for them, what the plan they choose will actually cover, or how the plan will operate. 
Jones said that many seniors misunderstand the basic structure of HMO payment and care 
practices. He criticized Medicare managers for providing information to beneficiaries about differences in available health plans that `appears primitive' compared with what's available from private purchasers. 
Mr. President, last year I asked the General Accounting Office to look into this problem, and the GAO auditors came to similar conclusions: 
Though Medicare is the nation's largest purchaser of managed care services, it lags other large purchasers in helping beneficiaries choose among plans. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has responsibility for protecting beneficiaries' rights and obtaining and disseminating information from Medicare HMOs to beneficiaries. HCFA has not yet, however, provided information to beneficiaries on individual HMOs. It has announced several efforts to develop HMO health care quality indicators. HCFA has, however, the capability to provide Medicare beneficiaries useful, comparative information now, using the administrative data it already collects. 
The kind of data HCFA collects, now, of use to beneficiaries includes performance indicators such as: First, annual disenrollment rates, second, cancellation rates, third, so-called rapid disenrollment rates--the percentage of enrollees who disenroll within 12 months of signing up, fourth, rate of return to fee-for-service Medicare from the plan, and fifth, disenrollments tied specifically to sales agent abuses involving, among other things, marketers who mislead enrollees about what a plan may cover. 
I think we can go beyond these quality indicators. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP], for example, includes a graded system of reports on the quality of key services in federal employee health plans. There is no reason why Medicare beneficiaries, who must make these decisions on their own without benefit of employers or corporate benefit managers, shouldn't have at least the kind of qualitative analysis available to members of Congress who are covered by FEHBP plans. 
Mr. President, I am heartened by the announcement earlier this year by HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck that the program would begin offering beneficiaries some qualitative information on managed care plans through the Internet. I think that's great for seniors that use the Internet in their homes or have access to that technology somewhere else. 
I think it's clear, however, that we need to step up efforts going beyond the limited information that eventually would be made available at a HCFA website. 
Here's the bare minimum of information that seniors need in a revamped Medicare program which empowers them to make appropriate choices: 
Details on the way different Medicare choices and plans work. 
Data on the experience of seniors of similar health and income background in those plans. 
The methods and the decision steps used by plans to pay participating practitioners and health care facilities and service providers. 
And here are the steps we need to take to insure seniors receive that information and the other tools they need to prevail in an increasingly more complex and choice-intensive Medicare marketplace: 
First, Medicare managers must ensure that every senior, in every county, receive a full list of plans available to him, with a detailed description of what each plan offers. These submissions must be written in a way that allows a consumer to make easy comparisons between plans. 
HCFA should require annual `enrollment fairs,' giving seniors a chance to review all plan materials at least once a year in order to determine if alternative Medicare offerings might be more suitable to the individual enrollee. 
Second, Medicare must collect, evaluate and publish appropriate performance data on every plan. Using independent quality review organizations like the National Council of Quality Assessment, Medicare must devise and publish qualitative analysis--consumer report cards--on each Medicare plan, further enabling seniors to make appropriate choices among offerings. 
Third, consumers must be allowed to enroll and disenroll from plans at any time during their first 12 months in a plan. After the first year of enrollment, disenrollment with guaranteed enrollment in a new plan would be limited to a first opportunity after six months in the second year. 
We would make it somewhat tougher to disenroll after the first year because we would expect plans to make investments of preventative health services for new enrollees in the initial few months of their enrollment. 
Fourth, health plan enrollees need a patient bill of rights that by Federal statute protects certain baseline issues fundamental to their good health. At the top of this list would be a Federal statute absolutely protecting the free and unfettered communication between patient and doctor on that enrollee's health condition and any appropriate services and procedures necessary to treat the patient. 
Fifth, give Medicare beneficiaries a certain and sure grievance and appeals process, and the information they need to use it. Medicare must streamline the current process, allowing beneficiaries to by-pass certain bureaucratic roadblocks in the present system--most especially those that force time-delaying procedural exercises when the outcomes already are known. On an initial enrollment, and at any time a beneficiary changes plans, an explanation of new or amended appeals procedures must be part of the enrollment exercise. 
And as with Medigap insurance, HCFA should hire and train ombudsmen and trouble-shooters tell help beneficiaries both understand provisions in plans, generally, and appeals and grievance procedures specifically. 
Sixth, every Medicare risk provider should offer at least one plan in his portfolio that includes a point-of-service provision, so that those seniors who would try plans if they could keep going to a particular practitioner would be allowed to do so. 
Mr. President, I have spent quite a number of years talking with seniors about their health care. Before I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980, I was cochairman of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I know that seniors are deeply suspicious of any changes to Medicare, in particular, and many of them view the current debate over the shape and direction of the program with a good deal of alarm. 
But many more who I've talked to recognize the need for changes and, indeed, want to see this debate begin. 
And on the basis of those conversations I am convinced that seniors will feel a lot better about anything we do if we give them more decision-making power to fashion the health care they receive through the program. 
Fundamental to that is making sure they have the information and tools to make the right decision, at the front end, and to protect themselves in the case of disputed decisions while they are enrolled in plans. These changes would go a long way toward providing seniors with that kind of empowerment, and in the long run strengthening and improving Medicare as a critical government program. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday, I intend to come to the Senate floor each day this week as part of an effort to build bipartisan support in the Senate for Medicare reform. It is very clear to me that there is a rare window of opportunity now for the Senate to act on this issue, a window, an opportunity I think would be a serious mistake to not exploit. 
We know that the Federal deficit is a bit lower than was anticipated this year, in the vicinity of $108 billion. We are seeing that there is a fairly benign economic environment. Certainly, there are still folks hurting in our country, but, overall, the economy has been positive. We know that we are a few years away from what I believe is sure to be a demographic earthquake, with many more older people in our country, and older people who need and deserve good quality health care. 
Yesterday, I tried to outline what I thought were the central principles of comprehensive Medicare reform. Beginning today, Mr. President, I intend to try to outline some of the specific aspects of what Medicare reform ought to consist of and how to get this program on track for the 21st century so that it operates in a fashion that is good for both older people and for taxpayers. 
Right now, in much of the United States, the Medicare Program is a 30-year-old, `Tin Lizzy'-style operation that rewards waste and penalizes frugality. This is particularly unfortunate since the end result is that in communities like my own in Portland, OR, that hold down costs, the end result for all the heavy lifting is simply a smaller reimbursement check. I believe what we have today under the Medicare Program is a situation where because of the reimbursement of formula, a sleep-inducing, eye-glazing concept known as the average adjusted per capita cost, you have a situation where in much of the United States there are few, if any, choices for older people under Medicare because health plans are reluctant to come to those markets, or you have a situation where it is almost impossible for an older person to navigate the system simply because they cannot obtain understandable, coherent information about their Medicare choices. 
Mr. President, it would be impossible for you to be able to see this chart, but I intend in the days ahead to blow this up because it makes my point with respect to how Medicare has made it difficult to have true competition like the competition that exists in the private sector for health care. This chart, which obviously is going to be difficult for you, Mr. President, and those who may be watching to see, involves a wall that has been set up in Los Angeles with all of the information that an older person has to go through in Los Angeles to make choices about choosing a health plan. It clearly illustrates, in my view, what we have seen with the Medicare Program over the last few years. 
Because the reimbursement formula encourages waste and penalizes frugality, we will have, in many areas, few choices for Medicare, discouraging competition, or, as I have shown through this chart and picture developed by the General Accounting Office, you will have just a blizzard of information 
that older people find it very difficult to navigate and make sense out of, thereby making it hard for them to have real choice in their health system. 
The irony, of course, is that every Member of the U.S. Senate knows what a competitive health system could look like, and a competitive health system that avoids the kind of problems I have just demonstrated with this chart from the General Accounting Office. Mr. President, 21st century Medicare could really be modeled around the very program that Members of the U.S. Senate participate in, known as the Federal employee health benefits plan. The Federal employee health benefits plan offers enrollees a portfolio of plans, each one with somewhat different service offerings. Consumers are helped to make appropriate, independent choices because the managers of the Federal employee plan pay attention to the details, including the way plans develop written explanations presenting what individual policies will or will not do. 
So for Members of the U.S. Senate, it is possible to get understandable, coherent information about what is available for Senators and their families. But if you are an older person who wants to compare and shop for health care, you have to try to figure out how to make sense of this incomprehensible picture that I just showed, demonstrated by the General Accounting Office. 
In addition, in the Federal employee health system, policies are inspected and reviewed on performance, and Federal employee plan participants are then given what amounts to report card grades on many of the important care provisions so that average consumers can sit down at their kitchen table and make plan-against-plan comparisons when they choose their coverage. 
Again, the difference between what is available to older people in many parts of the United States for Medicare and what is available to those Federal employees and Members of the U.S. Senate is striking in its contrast. Members of the Senate and Federal employees are going to be in a position where they can make plan-against-plan comparisons so as to inject some competition in the system. Again, the General Accounting Office tells us that no such features exist in much of Medicare. 
Finally, the Federal employee benefits managers look for high-quality service at competitive rates for employees. They work on a competitive basis to upgrade the quality and prices for the plan, while keeping premium rates at the lowest possible level. At the same time, these managers work to diminish risk selection by the plans, so that the older individuals who are part of the Federal employee plan, or persons with disabilities or chronic conditions, will not be eliminated from coverage when they want to enroll. 
Again, we see an effort to deal with the central questions that face health care reform in America, making sure that people are in a position to compare their plans so that there is real competition, and to make sure that nobody is left behind just because they are older or they suffer from a chronic condition. 
So, in addition to these very positive features, in recent years, average Federal employee health plan premium increases have stayed below 3 percent per year per enrollee, while the Medicare Program has seen average annual increases of almost 9 percent during the same period. 
So, Mr. President, what we are seeing is that well-structured competition, like in the system that Members of the Senate belong to, can work. It can work for patients and consumers in making sure they have good quality care. It can work for taxpayers in that it holds costs down, and it, for all practical purposes, is very similar to the system that we have in my hometown of Portland, OR. 
In my hometown, Portland, we have the highest percentage of older people in the Nation now participating in managed care. It is about 60 percent. Certainly, while not perfect, it avoids much of the set of problems that we have seen in other parts of the country. You don't see the gag clauses, for example, in our plan. And, hopefully, the U.S. Senate will pass the legislation this session that Senators Kyl, Kennedy and myself have introduced to make sure that, as we go to the 21st century, all patients understand their options and all of them know about the various services that are available. But we don't have those gag clauses in Portland, and we do have high-quality managed care, and we are able to do it for substantially less than much of the rest of the Medicare system. The per capita rate in my hometown, the per person rate for Medicare participants, is still $60 to $80 below the national average for Medicare. 
One of the things that I hope the Senate will do, on a bipartisan basis, is lift these penalties against towns like my home community that have done the heavy lifting and have ended up being penalized for it. I think, on a bipartisan basis, the U.S. Senate should make changes in Medicare to lift the reimbursement for low-cost counties, particularly in rural communities, and by doing so, benefit both seniors and taxpayers. Seniors will benefit from having the opportunity to get good-quality health plans in their areas, and it will also bring real choice and real competition for the first time to those areas. The fact of the matter is, many of those communities haven't been able to unleash entrepreneurial and competitive forces into their health systems such as we have in the private sector, because Medicare isn't paying those low-cost communities a fair rate. I have made changes in that discriminatory reimbursement proposal in my Medicare reform plan, and I hope the U.S. Senate will accept that in this session. 
I was pleased to see that, in the last week or so, the head of the Health Care Financing Administration, Dr. Vladeck, has indicated that there is a significant backlog of needed changes required to bring Medicare up to date. I hope that we will see more discussion of that in the days ahead. I felt that it was positive news to see those comments from the head of the Health Care Financing Administration. 
Mr. President, finally, let me say that I think, in addition to promoting competition, using the model of the Federal employee health plan, it's time for Medicare to look to the Federal employee health plan and the private sector for ways to improve quality in our health system. Again, there is nothing partisan about the agenda to improve health care quality, but this is an area where Medicare has also lagged, both in relation to Federal employees and the private sector. 
In other parts of our health system, it's possible, for example, to get good statistics on disenrollment, people leaving because they are not satisfied with the plan. It is possible to get information about providers who leave a system because they, too, feel it doesn't adequately address the needs of patients in providing good-quality health care. 
In other parts of the health system, there are grievance procedures, and we know, for example, how long it takes people to get through a grievance procedure, or how long it takes to get a referral, or what happens when you are denied benefits. In each of these areas so central to providing quality health care in America, Medicare is lagging behind the Federal employee health system, and Medicare is lagging behind much of the private sector. In my legislation, we would change that. We would require that these critical measures of quality be made available through report cards and other measures. I emphasize that today, Mr. President, because I think that, as we look to the 21st century of Medicare, we have an opportunity over the next few years to redesign the system and try to get it on track for the next century when we will have many more older people depending on Medicare. 
So the alternative is very clear: A bipartisan effort to bring competition and choice and a new focus on quality in the Medicare Program, or to continue business as usual and face what the General Accounting Office has told us will be a program that has simply run out of money when we hit the next century. I believe that, after years of bickering and partisanship on this issue, there is an opportunity now to address Medicare reform in a bipartisan way. Democrats have been right in the Senate to call on making sure that benefits are defined, that older people have guaranteed, secure benefits. Republicans have been correct, in my view, in calling for more competition and more choice in the system. Today, I have tried to talk about how that competition and choice exists in the program that Members of the Senate belong to and is also available in much of the private sector. 
Mr. President, this issue is so important that in the next century I believe that the public is going to ask every Member of the U.S. Senate, `What were you doing to try to get Medicare on track?' This program isn't just an important part of the Federal budget. It is going to be the Federal budget for the next 15 or 20 years. So now is the time to act to get the program on track. I believe that this can be done in a bipartisan way.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I have said, I intend to come to the Senate floor each day this week part of an effort to help build bipartisan support in this body for Medicare reform. 
Not via an independent commission. Not in the next Congress. But now, and by us, the Members of the 105th Congress. 
I think we have an historic opportunity to transform Medicare from a 30-year-old, tin-Lizzie style social welfare program into a 21st century, comprehensive seniors health care system that is humane, cost-efficient and sustainable. 
The reformed Medicare Program I envision, and which I think is within our grasp, is a health plan that is about choice, quality and access, and also about the efficiencies that characterize much of the Nation's private health care marketplace. 
But changing Medicare will require tough decisions, tough votes and, as in turning a battleship in mid-ocean, a good deal of time and patience on the part of beneficiaries and health care providers. 
We must start by making the right moves, the right changes, today, before some 75 million baby boom generation retirees begin swamping the Medicare Program in 2013. 
In my private conversations with colleagues, I've been arguing that this is the classic pay-me-now, or pay-me-later situation. Structural changes enacted in the next year or two will not be easy. But in the face of what Congress would have to overcome beginning early in the next century, these changes will seem like child's play. 
Medicare's problems are a snowball rolling down hill, picking up speed and mass on almost a daily basis. Now is the time to slow-down that snowball, if not stop it because in a few more years the program will be crushed by its weight. 
Each year without structural reform makes the task that much harder, and the risk to balanced Federal budgets that much more significant. 
And assigning the task to a bipartisan commission without first doing our best to solve Medicare's problems is a retreat not just from our responsibility, but from opportunity as well. I think there's a fervent desire among my colleagues to try to fix Medicare in the current Congress. 
I think we gain little by assigning that job in the first instance to a bi-partisan committee, only to have to try to make tough votes on their recommendations in 1998, an election year for those who need to be reminded. 
The path to reform is not easy. Fortunately, however, there are sign posts and trail markers along the way, offering meaningful models for changes and reform. 
I think we see these possibilities for a 21st century Medicare program in systems as diverse as the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which serves many Members of this body, to the Medicaid Program which now operates in my home state of Oregon under a special Federal waiver. 
The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program offers its enrollees a portfolio of plans, each one with somewhat different services offerings. Consumers are helped to make appropriate, independent choices because the managers of FEHBP pay attention to the details, including the way plans develop written explanations presenting what individual policies will or won't do. 
Further, those policies are then inspected and reviewed on performance, and FEHBP beneficiaries are then given what amounts to report card grades on many of the important care provisions so that average consumers can sit down at their kitchen tables and make plan-against-plan comparisons when they choose their coverage. 
Finally, FEHBP smart-shopper managers negotiate high-quality service at competitive rates for enrollees. These government managers work with their plans on a continuous basis to upgrade the quality and range of services offered by the plans while keeping premium rates at lowest possible levels. At the same time, these managers work to diminish risk selection by the plans, so that older FEHBP members, or persons with disabilities or chronic conditions aren't eliminated from coverage when they want to enroll. 
In recent years, average FEHBP plan premium increases have stayed below 3 percent per year, per enrollee, while the Medicare Program has ballooned to average annual increases of almost 9 percent during the same period. 
Oregon's ground-breaking Medicaid plan also helps mark our way toward an improved national Medicare system. 
In Oregon, we've expanded the traditional Medicaid Program to cover not only the federally qualified participants but also tens of thousands of working poor Oregonians who can't afford private insurance, but whose incomes would disqualify them for traditional Medicaid. 
The result has been a tremendous reduction across the State in unreimbursed hospital charity care, more preventative medicine for youngsters and young mothers, and a per capita Medicaid cost rate that is 10 percent below the national average. 
More care. 
Less cost. 
Efficient, preventative services that keep children and adults out of the hospital. 
Managed care has played a dominant role in this success story, as it has in Oregon's Medicare experience. 
Oregon's Medicare-qualified seniors have the highest penetration rate in the Nation in coordinated care. In Portland, nearly 60 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care. 
And in this, the State's highest reimbursed city for Medicare beneficiaries, the per capita rate is still 60 to 80 dollars below the national average for Medicare. 
I suggest that we may be doing some things right, out West and in the FEHBP program. And sad to say, these good things we see happening in Medicaid and Medicare are almost in spite of a Federal regulatory structure that hamstrings Medicare and Medicaid in terms of increasing both efficiency and quality, and expanding enrollment to the uninsured and under-insured. 
This is a problem that is recognized even within the bowels of the Medicare management structure. 
Mr. President, I was heartened to see the comments of my good friend Dr. Bruce Vladeck in the trade press last week. Specifically, Bruce acknowledged that there is a tremendous backlog of needed statutory changes required to bring Medicare up-to-date. 
Gail Wilensky of Project Hope, puts it even more succinctly:  
In sum, the present structure of Medicare hardly makes it surprising that it is facing financial problems. The elderly have limited options in the health care plans available to them. Medicare pays most of the costs for services it covers and almost all of the elderly have coverage that is supplemental to Medicare, either privately purchased Medigap or Medicaid. 
That means there is little reason for an elderly person to seek out cost-effective physicians or hospitals, or to use lower cost durable medical equipment, laboratories or outpatient hospitals. 
Dr. Wilensky goes on to say that there is little reason for practitioners to provide cost effective care `if there is any medical gain to be had from providing services and some reason to fear legal repercussions if they do less than they might have done and the patient has an adverse outcome.': 
And because payments to capitated plans now follow payments for local fee-for-service Medicare, Medicare HMO's in many high-cost counties are extravagantly over-paid, while in low-pay counties plans and HMO enrollment languish because of under-reimbursement. 
We throw money at fat health plans in big counties, while we starve the system of both choice and access--and I would argue quite probably quality as well--in counties where the payments are below the national average. 
This current state-of-affairs is precisely antagonistic to our goal. 
Let me postulate that it is nuts to reimburse Medicare HMO's in high-cost counties at the same level, more or less, of the highest-cost fee-for-service practitioners in those counties. That fact alone is one of the big reasons why, quite rightly, the administration has argued that we have a general HMO over-payment problem. 
But the administration's argument that every HMO should be cut, however, to cure that problem is like saying amputation is an appropriate treatment for bunions. 
Holy Dr. Kildare. In any other economic model or sector, a proposition like our current average adjusted per capita cost [AAPCC] formula would seem nuts. But that's the way it works in our creaking, inefficient and decidedly consumer unfriendly Medicare system. 
Clearly, we must provide incentives for beneficiaries to choose just the cost-effective health care they need, and to demand that physicians, hospitals and other providers limit practice to cost-effective medicine. 
This can be done while preserving the Medicare guarantee of a basic, good quality package of health services to every eligible senior, no matter what their health status or income level. 
Here are components of a new Medicare system that provides both choice and quality, with cost efficiency: 
First, radically reform the formula by which we determine how Medicare managed care programs are paid so that reimbursements are geared to the actual costs of managed care among elderly populations in a particular county, or region, rather than the local cost of fee-for-service medicine. 
At the same time, scale-back payment increases in our high-reimbursement counties, and accelerate payments in the low-reimbursement counties where, because payments have been too thin, beneficiaries have only fee-for-service Medicare to choose from. 
In other words, give millions of disenfranchised Medicare beneficiaries a real choice. 
Second, require Medicare managers organize open bidding between plans in high-pay counties where profit margins are exorbitantly high. 
Make the plans that are currently, hugely over-paid bid against one another, on price, for Medicare beneficiaries in those counties. 
I believe such competitions should take place in every county where the average adjusted per capita cost--the AAPCC--is 120 percent of the national average. 
In sum, make adjustments in the HMO payment formula that decrease reimbursements in counties that we know are substantially over-compensated; increase payments in counties that are so under-compensated as to discourage HMO entry and competition; and resist proposals to reduce all county payments, alike, from 95 percent to 90 percent of the local AAPCC rate--a crude tool that will hurt the cost-efficient counties much more than the `fat' counties. 
Mr. President, I believe that accelerating the growth of good quality managed care, such as we have in Oregon, can be a major factor in curing Medicare's financial ills. Changing this AAPCC formula in a way that makes sense--in a fashion that does not kill our efforts to bring Medicare into vast areas of this country where no choice but fee-for-service medicine exists for beneficiaries--must be a high priority piece of the solution. 
Third, put our two fastest growing portions of Medicare--home health care and skilled nursing facility care--on a financial management diet. 
That regimen is called prospective payment, and it means that in much the same way we control hospital costs we would create a schedule of daily maximum service costs for different aspects of care in each of these important areas. 
In my bill, S. 386, the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act, prospective payment provisions for home health and skilled nursing facilities would, together, save approximately $20 billion over 5 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
Eventually, but quickly, I think we ought to impose these kinds of financial management tools on other aspects of fee-for-service Medicare. 
I see no reason why, as a matter of global budgeting, that practitioners in this field ought not be held to the same kind of case management that HMO's require as part of their plans. 
One method might be to require all Medicare fee-for-service practitioners to join a Medicare-sponsored provider network, which has at its core a case management system that ensures all participating beneficiaries get the care and quality they need, but that practitioners and other providers don't over-bill or overprescribe. 
This kind of PPO management would bring case gate-keeping into fee-for-service Medicare, ultimately producing reasonable price and cost controls in the system. 
Fourth, require competitive bidding for durable medical equipment purchases and eliminate what Dr. Vladeck has termed the `current silly inherent reasonableness' process. 
I know many of my colleagues may not have looked hard at this bit of Medicare arcana. But let me say that this is all about getting medical equipment paid for by the program at the lowest possible cost as determined by the market. 
At the same time, we need to know more about what procedures and services work, and which don't, so that we can save money for the program and ensure that beneficiaries are getting optimum care. 
The Health Care Financing Administration must be required to collect, analyze, and act on more of the available data, in this regard, and that admonition needs to be part of comprehensive Medicare reform. 
Fifth, require HCFA to do local service-provider report cards for beneficiaries. This sort of qualitative analysis should extend both to HMO's and their practitioners, and to local fee-for-service doctors and other providers. 
This needed reform would include authorizing the program to demand and collect all relevant data from Medicare participants. 
Sixth, the program must move much more aggressively in establishing special plans and services for the sickest, frailest enrollees; these are the Medicare beneficiaries who are usually qualified for both health and income reasons to receive benefits from Medicaid as well. 
These enrollees are the fastest growing group of Medicare beneficiaries, and the most expensive with costs to both programs amounting to about $100 billion per year. 
Lack of systems to deal with the huge comprehensive care problems these folks face has resulted in the worst possible scenario; much money is wasted while many folks don't receive the type or quality of care they need. 
Fortunately, there are a number of highly specialized programs called social HMO's or PACE programs, that provide coordinated care--using both Medicare and Medicaid bucks--for populations of these beneficiaries in less than two dozen communities. One of those programs, ElderCare at Providence Hospital in Portland, is up and running in my hometown, and it is serving these frail elderly at well below the national average cost for the so-called dual-eligibles. 
Why don't we have more? HCFA currently requires each of these programs to apply on a waiver basis every time an individual community wants to start a social HMO or PACE program. This is expensive and time consuming, and it limits the reach of a very good, cost-effective system. 
And again, something that takes about 5 minutes to start up in the private sector, takes about 5 years through the Federal Government. 
For this group we must create greater access for highly specialized, dual-eligible programs by giving organizers clear and certain and uniform rules of entry through the Medicare Program; eliminate the so-called 50-50 rule, requiring 50 percent non-Medicare enrollment for any HMO serving Medicare beneficiaries, based on enhanced performance and quality standards; develop tougher restrictions on adverse risk selection making it harder for plans to deny enrollment to sicker, frailer beneficiaries; and set up a so-called outlier fund within Medicare, a special pool of cash fueled by reimbursement withholds from overpaid HMO's, to appropriately compensate plans that demonstrate they are serving sicker, more costly beneficiaries. 
Seventh, reform our Medicare supplemental insurance laws--the Medigap regulations--to guarantee that every Medicare beneficiary can enroll in a Medigap program at any time. I believe this change is crucial to encouraging more seniors to try HMO's, knowing that if they decide they must return to fee-for-service medicine they will be able to get back into Medigap coverage. 
About a dozen States, including my home State of Oregon, already require guaranteed-issue. The Medigap market has not been destroyed in those States. There must be a universal Federal standard protecting beneficiaries. 
Eighth, ensure better treatment and more appropriate treatment for Medicare beneficiaries by capturing the service and efficiency offered by telecommunications technology. 
An important aspect of this is expanding the terms and conditions under which Medicare will pay for services via the fiber-optic lifeline, and working with both the Federal Government and the States to knock down anticompetitive licensure practices and restrictions that hamper the ability of physicians and other practitioners to practice via this new technology. 
I can tell my colleagues that Oregon, like much of the west, is looking hard at telemedicine as a way of getting better quality medicine to folks who live way out in the country; and there are lots of places falling under that definition, west of the Mississippi. 
Medicare needs to help in that effort, not build walls against 21st-century medicine. 
Ninth, Medicare must unleash the quality and efficiency promised by a rapidly growing cadre of alternative health care providers. 
The program can save money and deliver to beneficiaries better, more targeted services by identifying and incorporating appropriate assignments for nurse practitioners, PA's, druggists, chiropractors, and other licensed professionals within the health care network. 
Mr. President, these nine items are not the whole solution to modernizing Medicare. But I do believe that together, they represent an appropriate jumping off position for real Medicare reform that can be accomplished in this Congress. 
I know colleagues from both sides of the aisle will be talking about their own ideas in the weeks and months to come. I urge them, I urge all of us, to move these issues through the congressional process beginning this year rather than expect a bipartisan commission to cure Medicare's problems for us. 
Mr. President, tomorrow, I will go on to talk about other fundamental principles of Medicare reform. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the process of making public policy, like much of life, is about opportunity, risk, and reward. That proposition is clearly demonstrated when the Senate looks at the critical issue of Medicare reform. 
I take the floor today, as I plan to do every day this week, to talk about a tremendous opportunity that the Senate has before it, the opportunity to finally remake Medicare for the 21st century in a bipartisan way. The Senate ought to seize this opportunity to act now and act boldly so that Medicare can be preserved for future generations of Americans. 
As Senators return from visiting their respective States today, we begin a legislative period that I believe can be a critical few months in Medicare's history. There is an opportunity to engage this issue as serious debate begins on the fiscal year 1998 budget. I believe that there is now a unique window of opportunity for reforming Medicare that would come along in only rare instances. 
Three factors combine to make this a special opportunity to try to set Medicare on track for the next century. The first is that the Federal deficit is less than was anticipated for this year, just over $108 billion. Second, we have a fairly benign economy. Surely, there are too many folks still hurting, there are too many folks falling between the cracks, but overall the economy has been strong. Third, it is very clear that our country will face a demographic earthquake in the next century with so many more older people, and we have a window of opportunity now to act before those demographic trends are set in place. 
My view is that Medicare does not need to be reformed because it has failed but because it has been such a great success that it cannot be allowed to deteriorate. I argue that only enemies of this program would want it to stay exactly as it is, because the status quo, the Medicare status quo that encourages waste and discourages user-friendly innovation, in my view, consigns Medicare to very difficult times. 
The General Accounting Office, for example, has estimated that the gap between expected revenues for the program and the enormous service demands is going to produce a gap of almost a half trillion dollars at the end of the next decade. This program, which is a lifeline to 38 million senior citizens, faces very serious, if not calamitous, financial circumstances by the end of the decade. There are a variety of reasons for this, as I am going to outline this week. 
In much of the United States, Medicare is engaging in wasteful practices that the private sector consigned to the attic years and years ago. In much of the country, Medicare is inefficient, volume-driven, clunky health care, and it is one of the first things that needs to be changed. 
I believe that there are substantial opportunities for this Senate to move on Medicare reform, and I think there are some special areas that we should be careful to avoid. I say, Mr. President, and colleagues, that I think it would be a great mistake to appoint yet another bipartisan commission to study Medicare. A number of our colleagues have proposed that. I have great respect for them, but if there is another bipartisan committee that studies this issue, I believe we will see bipartisan inertia for Medicare for years and years to come. The first question a bipartisan commission would face is should they report before the 1998 election. Then there would be a question about whether they would report before the year 2000 election. 
I do not think that a commission can create a forum for avoiding the tough choices. That is why I come to the floor today, as I will this week, to outline first why it is so important to act and why I believe that finally, after a substantial period of sharp and acrimonious debate on Medicare, it ought to be possible to act in a bipartisan way. 
I have had a number of private conversations with my colleagues on this issue over the last few months. I believe that despite some of the political backbiting that has gone on on this issue, every Senator understands that this program has to be reformed. In some measure, the U.S. Senate and the Congress have become like a bunch of reluctant seventh graders at a junior high school sock hop, standing on the gym sidelines, all waiting for the first brave soul to hit the dance floor. 
In an effort to try to move the process forward, to jump-start the debate, I recently introduced S. 386, the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act. 
I offered this legislation not as a be-all and end-all solution to all of the financial challenges we face with Medicare, but rather as a direction to build on some of the progress that has been made in areas of the country like my own in Oregon. Much of Oregon is already operating 21st century Medicare services, operating Medicare in a way that is good for seniors and good for taxpayers. So when people tell me it's not possible to get this program on track, I invite them to come to my own State, because in my own State we have been able to do it. 
Mr. President, I would like to outline briefly a few of the specific items in my Medicare legislation that I will go into further detail on throughout this week. 
The first initiative in any responsible Medicare reform effort has got to be to bring more choices and more competition to the program. We have to see Medicare reform in comparison to what the private sector has done. Members of the U.S. Senate should not have too much difficulty grasping this concept because a model, the Federal employee health benefits plan, exists. Members are part of it, and surely it can be a central plank for any bipartisan Medicare reform to look to the model of the Federal employees health benefits plan to produce more choices and more options. 
The second plank of any Medicare reform effort should be to eliminate the rewards that the program has for waste and eliminate the way it penalizes the frugal. As incredible as it sounds, that's exactly what happens in the Medicare Program as it relates to health plans. If a plan holds down their costs, they end up getting penalized, and very often it is tough for providers, particularly in rural areas, to make a go of it. If a plan or part of the country sits on its hands and does not make an effort to hold down costs, they get bigger reimbursement checks. That's not right. The private sector consigned that kind of approach to the attic years ago in eliminating the rewards for waste and penalties. Efficiency should be a central component of any Medicare reform. 
Third, Mr. President, it seems critical, in my view, to protect the rights of patients. I believe that when there is a modernized Medicare Program, there will be more managed care available under the program across this country. Many of our citizens, seniors and others, have had legitimate questions about managed care, and I believe it is important to put in place strong patient protections to safeguard the rights of older people. This would include provisions such as a ban on these gag clauses that keep older people from knowing their rights in managed care plans. It would include stronger appeals procedures, grievance procedures, and also the right of patients in managed care plans to get data through report cards about how their plan stacks up on key issues. I believe that part of the effort to reform Medicare ought to be to protect patients' rights, and this should be a central component of Medicare reform as the effort to promote more competition goes forward. 
Fourth, Mr. President, I would change the reimbursement system that is used in Medicare, known as the average adjusted per capita cost. This is a sleep-inducing, eye-glazing concept by any calculus, but it is the guts of Medicare reform. To reform this system, we ought to gradually increase the reimbursement levels for low-cost areas, many of them in rural areas, and we ought to inject more competition in high-cost areas. There have been a number of recent analyses indicating that some managed care plans have been overpaid, many of them in the high-cost areas. Introducing more competition in those high-cost areas through changes in this Medicare reimbursement formula is a sensible way to enact bipartisan reform. 
Then, Mr. President, it is critical that the Senate tighten up efforts to fight fraud in Medicare. The General Accounting Office recently indicated that about 10 percent of all of the costs of Medicare are lost due to fraud. In a $200 billion program, $20 billion lost to fraud and abuse has plagued the program. Stronger penalties ought to be imposed for defrauding Medicare. If someone engages in a flagrant, reprehensible fraud, they ought to be kicked out of the Medicare Program for all time, not just some sort of slap on the wrist in a resolving door situation. For flagrant frauds, there ought to be lifetime debarment. 
Next, Mr. President, in my legislation we would expand the role of alternative health care providers. Nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and chiropractors, among others, have shown an ability across this country to deliver good quality, affordable health care to older people. They ought to be allowed to play an expanded role in the Medicare of the 21st century, both because these alternative professions will help us to hold costs down through more competition and also because they offer good quality care. 
Next, Mr. President, I would unleash the power of new telecommunications technologies in the health care field. A number of Senators on both sides of the aisle have sought to expand the role of telemedicine, which is already delivering good quality, low-cost care, particularly in the preventive area. It is time for Medicare managers to employ these tools. But as we see in so many parts of Medicare, the Federal 
Government program, which is relied on by millions of seniors and their families, lags behind the private sector. The Federal Government hasn't even taken baby steps in terms of trying to set out a policy to utilize telemedicine. So my legislation tries to ensure that Internet access, which at least will help our rural communities, is available. And, Mr. President, Senators on both sides of the aisle have done good work that could be incorporated into a Medicare reform bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, I propose in my legislation to clear away the regulatory underbrush that needlessly and expensively fragments our system of care for the older folks who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These are folks on a low, fixed income. They are the so-called dual eligibles. Right now, they are a big factor in major cost increases in both Medicare and Medicaid. It is time for some more creative approaches for dealing with those older people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. My legislation proposes that, and I intend to outline that further in the week. 
Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced can save about $100 billion in hard savings over the next 5 years to provide short-term financial stability for the program. I submit that our challenge now is to lay the foundation for the next century. My legislation doesn't, in any way, deal with all of the tough questions that the Senate is going to face on Medicare. Medicare is not just an important part of the Federal budget; Medicare is likely to be the Federal budget for the next 15 to 20 years. When we look at the technological explosion and the extraordinary technologies that are available, when we look at the demographic tsunami that is coming in the next century with so many older people, the challenge now is to lay a bipartisan foundation to build on in the years ahead. The program that I have described and the legislation I have introduced takes from the efforts of both political parties over the last few years on Medicare. 
For example, my legislation protects defined, secure, guaranteed benefits for older people under Medicare. A number of Senators, led by Senator Kennedy, have made this their priority, and I am of the view that they are absolutely right. I think it would be a great mistake to say that the future of Medicare ought to be to just involve handing a check to an older person and say, `Well, ma'am, buy health care until your money runs out. If the cost of your care is greater than your check, well, so be it.' I think it is important to have guaranteed, secure, defined benefits. Many Senators have stood for this principle. It is at the heart of my legislation. 
Let me also say that I believe that many Senators on the other side of the aisle have been absolutely right in saying that it is time to bring more competition and more choice to the Medicare Program. Many Senators on the other side of the aisle have made the case that competitive models--be it the Federal employee health plan or be it the private sector--ought to be the kind of approach that we look to for 21st century Medicare. I believe they are right. I believe, in addition, that it is now possible to forge a bipartisan coalition on Medicare between the two parties, where those who have advocated for guaranteeing secure, defined benefits can work with those who have called for more competition and more choice and the kinds of changes that have come to the private sector. 
What it comes down to, Mr. President, is, will the Senate have the political will to do it? Will the Senate have the vision to see beyond the next electoral ridge? I believe that there is an extraordinary opportunity now to set out a foundation for the next century. We know that in the next century we are going to have to be dealing with the question of whether, hypothetically, Lee Iaccoca ought to be paying more for his Medicare than should a woman who is 75 years old and on a low income who suffers from Alzheimer's. I didn't address it in my legislation, but I happen to think that ought to be done. Senators will have different views on that issue. 
Mr. President, I am not convinced that's the issue that has to be tackled right now. The issue that has to be tackled by the Senate right now is to come up with $100 billion of hard savings to deal with the budget resolution and the short-term financial challenge of Medicare and then to lay the foundation for the next century. The foundation for the next century can build on some very good work being done by Senators of both political parties. I have been meeting with those Senators privately. 
I will have more to say during this week, Mr. President, for I intend to go into further detail on my comprehensive Medicare reform legislation every day this week. I will close with one last point. This issue is so important to our country and so important to the Senate that I believe in the next century--2010, 2020, 2030--people are going to ask everyone in public life today: What did you do to try to get Medicare on track? 
I believe the legislation I have introduced opens up the opportunity for bipartisan discussions toward Medicare reform. I have had a number of those already with Chairman Domenici, Chairman Gramm on the other side of the aisle, and have been very gracious in that regard. I have had a chance to talk to the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and Senator Kennedy, who have done so much good work. 
Mr. President, I close by saying that my concern is to make sure that the Senate, after years of bitter and acrimonious discussions on Medicare, now tries to approach it in a different way, in a bipartisan way, in a way that will allow us to tap the revolution of private sector health care, in a way that is good for patients, and in a way that is good for seniors and for taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week my colleagues, Senators Kyl, Kennedy and Hutchinson, and I have introduced S. 449, the Patient Right to Know Act of 1997. This legislation outlaws so-called gags in contracts between managed care companies and their licensed practitioners which have limited what doctors can tell patients about their medical condition and all treatment appropriate to their care. 
Plain and simple, such gags have been used to limit appropriate medical care. While this is a dollars-and-cents issue for health care organizations and insurers, for patients and their doctors such restrictions on the usual free flow of communication--held sacred since ancient times--literally may be a matter of life or death. 
I was pleased to join Mr. Kennedy in offering legislation on the floor last session which would have ended such restrictions. I also wish to thank Mr. Kyl for his support of our legislation last year, and for his diligent efforts in the intervening months to prepare this bill for re-introduction. 
I also wish to acknowledge support for this legislation from organizations including the Consumer's Union and the American Medical Association. 
We have this broad range of support because the need for this legislation is clear and documented. Three in four Americans now covered by private health insurance receive their care from managed care organizations. Increasingly, Medicaid enrollees and seniors in Medicare are covered by managed care plans through their respective Federal health insurance programs. 
Residents of my home State of Oregon boast the highest penetration of managed care in the Nation. The State's Medicaid Program for the most part is organized through private managed care companies. And in Portland, managed care plans service almost 60 percent of the Medicare population. 
In Oregon and elsewhere, the managed care presence has grown for reasons that are quite wholesome. Managed care helps enrollees stay healthy through illness prevention programs. They assure coordination of services for persons with multiple ailments. And through systematic, quality-conscious gate-keeping, they work to reduce unnecessary treatments which drive up health care costs. 
At the same time, however, some managed care providers have tried to enhance their profit margins by limiting what doctors may tell patients regarding all appropriate treatments, thereby reducing services patients may actually receive. These gags in my view are outrageous. The President through administrative order during the last few months has made such gags illegal in managed care plans operating under Medicare and Medicaid. He has pledged his support for legislation eliminating these restrictions in private health plans as well. 
Mr. President, while I am convinced that we need a single Federal standard on this matter to protect patients in managed care plans I am much encouraged by the voluntary efforts to end such gags recently announced by the managed care insurance industry. My long association with these companies has convinced me that coordinated care providers as a group often are on the cutting edge of developing both efficient and high-quality care for their enrollees. It is entirely appropriate for this provider group to try to police their members on the issue of gag provisions and the protection of doctor-patient communications. 
I ask that the text of the bill be printed in today's Record.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my home State of Oregon has long been known for being innovative in a variety of important public policy areas. The Oregon Health Plan, for example, is a pioneering effort. We were the first State to protect our beaches, to go forward with recycling, to look at innovative ways to protect our land, air and water, and we are clearly out in front in terms of welfare reform, a key issue to our citizens at this time. 
Today, I take the floor to talk about how Oregon would like to lead the country once more, this time in the critical area of juvenile justice. It is very appropriate that this matter be pursued at this time because, according to the National Center on Juvenile Justice, 47 out of 50 States have legislation in their State legislatures that would literally wipe out the State juvenile court system. It is not hard to be surprised about why these kinds of things are happening, because we know that our citizens are angry about the juvenile justice system in our country. 
For example, there are many who come to my townhall meetings and say, `Ron, 20 years ago we left our car doors unlocked, we left our windows open, and we were safe. But today, it's not that way any longer. I'm an older person, and I'm concerned about going out after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I'm frightened. I'm frightened by what the thugs in my neighborhood might do to me.' 
These citizens are not going to sit around and have debates about diversion programs, which is one approach for juvenile justice, or probation programs. They just want to make sure that they are protected, that they and their families are secure in their homes, and that their right to be free, their civil right, if you will, to be free from crime in their neighborhood is protected. It is not hard to see why State legislatures around this country are proposing bills to get rid of the juvenile justice system altogether. 
So I come to the floor today to talk about an effort that is underway in Oregon to literally turn the juvenile justice system on its head and make it vibrant again. What we are seeking to do--and it is an effort that is being pioneered in central Oregon and Deschutes County, specifically--is to turn the juvenile justice system on its head and move from a model that was based on prevention and treatment to one that is based on accountability. We call this model community justice. 
It is community justice because we feel that when a crime is committed, our community loses something. A person is harmed economically, physically, or emotionally, but also the community is harmed. Our community loses a sense of security. It loses funds that are needed for police work, and funds that are involved in incarceration and in probation. All our community suffers. 
We believe it is first the responsibility of the system to avoid crimes being committed in the first place, but it also is critically important that if a crime is committed, the offender must be held accountable for making the community whole--the offender must earn their way back into the community. Prosecutors and police, and others, in Deschutes County, OR, have begun a new system built around accountability so that if, for example, you have a first-time offender, a nonviolent first-time offender, who has robbed the home of a senior citizen, what you are going to see 
is that this young offender is going to be required to pay back the community. My sense is that this notion of accountability, accountability for juvenile offenders so that there are consequences every time a juvenile offender commits a crime, is the direction that we ought to be going. 
In Deschutes County, we look at this as part of what we have come to call the Oregon option. The Oregon option has been an approach that we pioneered with the Federal Government which stipulates that when local government is freed from some of the bureaucratic redtape, in return, we will make sure there are actual results; in other words, that we can prove that in return for relief from some of the bureaucratic constraints, we can meet the requirements of a particular community service program. 
What we are saying in Oregon is that when there are dollars that are now earmarked for, say, prison beds for young offenders, we will commit, under the community justice kind of approach, to making sure those young offenders are held accountable and repay the community. And if, in fact, we can't do it, then the community is going to make sure, with community resources, that the goals of the juvenile justice system, and holding youthful offenders accountable, is met through buying back the prison beds. 
My view is that this model of community justice is the kind of approach that the Congress should look at this year when we consider the juvenile justice statute, which is up again for reauthorization. We ought to say, as part of that law, that any juvenile justice system should require young offenders to complete accountability contracts to ensure that they make amends for their offense. We ought to make sure that, as part of the reauthorization of the juvenile justice system, local programs receive high marks from victims--and here the Chair has done yeoman work, in my view--that victims become the central customer of the criminal justice system. 
I believe that using these kinds of principles, principles of accountability, principles of community involvement, principles of ensuring that victims become the customer of the system, we can build a new system. 
Not long ago, I went to Deschutes County to learn about their community justice program. What I saw was a coalition of police officers, district attorneys, those who work in the juvenile justice system, Democrats, Republicans, all at a table saying, `We believe that this new approach for community justice is the kind of approach that the Federal Government should support as part of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act reauthorization.' 
Mr. President, I would say that if we can hold youthful offenders accountable, if we can ensure that there are consequences each time an offense is committed, if the Congress and local communities redesign these programs so as to work with families, we can have a new set of principles that would define juvenile justice for the 21st century--a set of principles that puts the community's needs first and makes the victim the principal customer. 
I submit, Mr. President, that as the Congress goes forward with hearings on the juvenile justice system and the consideration of the juvenile justice statute, eyes should focus on what is being done with community justice in Deschutes County, OR, because I believe those kinds of principles, the principles that represent our community values, is what we should build the juvenile justice system around for the 21st century. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Boxer as a cosponsor of the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act. With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in the 1994 crime bill, Congress addressed the need to educate law enforcement, judges, and prosecutors about how to deal with situations of domestic violence. However, in this important piece of legislation, Congress overlooked a major resource in the battle against domestic violence--our health care professionals. Doctors, nurses, and others in health professions are often the first to see the effects of battering and are often in the best position to stop the cycle of violence before it goes any further. 
While domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women, many doctors, and nurses are unaware or unsure of the symptoms, treatment, and means of preventing domestic violence. In 1992, a Surgeon General's report cited a study showing 35 percent of the women who visit hospital emergency rooms were there because of ongoing abuse. Additionally, the study found that only 5 percent of the abused women were actually identified as such. A 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA] determined that little had changed since the earlier study and that doctors still failed to identify women who were injured as a result of domestic violence. 
In a June 17, 1992, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association Dr. Richard F. Jones III, the then-president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], related how for years he had missed the obvious signs of physical abuse in women patients. He had been asking the wrong questions and failed to elicit the true cause of their injuries. Only when he started asking these women directly if they were victims of physical abuse did the truth emerge. 
Similarly, according to an article in a November 1995 issue of American Medicine, 60 percent of those graduating from medical schools felt that an insufficient amount of attention within the medical school curriculum was given to the issue of family and domestic violence. 
Since Senator Boxer, Representative Morella, and I introduced the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act in 1992, the medical community has taken many steps to increase outreach and education on the issue of domestic violence. However, as these studies show, the fact is that when it comes to domestic violence, the bruises and abrasions get dressed, but the cause goes unaddressed. Doctors miss the signs of domestic violence early on and then often miss them again when they have become catastrophic. 
The Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act provides incentives for medical schools to provide significant training in identifying, treating and referring victims of domestic violence. The legislation will give preference in awarding grants under the health professions education titles of the Public Health Services Act to schools that have incorporated training in domestic violence into their curriculum. 
The title VII and title VIII grant programs, singled out in the bill, are demonstration grants and makeup but a small part of the hundreds of millions of Federal dollars that go to medical schools for state-of-the-art medical education. It seems to me to be self-evident that if we give medical schools this sort of funding, they should at least give some time to addressing the No. 1 cause of injury to women. 
In drafting this legislation we worked closely with doctors, nurses, medical schools, and domestic violence groups. The Association of American Medical Colleges, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's Association, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, AYUDA, NOW Legal Defense Fund, American Nurses Association, National League For Nursing, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, and the Family Violence Prevention Fund, among others, have voiced their support for this legislation. 
I thank the many groups that assisted in drafting this legislation and Senator Boxer for her leadership in this matter. I urge the Congress to pass this important piece of legislation this year.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I met with a group of small business folks at an Internet cafe in Portland. We talked about the promise electronic commerce holds for businesses and consumers. The Internet can give a small businessperson in Astoria, OR access to the entire global marketplace. It can give consumers, especially in rural areas, entry to a supernational shopping mall. 
For governments, the Internet offers a different type of promise--the chance to be a new cash cow. As Federal funds decrease, States and local governments are looking to the Internet as a new source of revenue. Some have already begun building tollbooths on the information superhighway. For sales taxes alone, there are nearly 6,500 different taxing authorities in this country. One businessman at the Internet cafe told me he is wary of getting into electronic commerce because of the prospect of as many as 30,000 different pairs of hands reaching into his pockets to collect taxes. If current trends continue, State and local levies will transform the Internet from a bright and exciting new frontier for commerce into a dark jungle of foreboding taxes. 
Under today's mishmash of State and local Internet taxes, everyone is puzzled. Take a customer at his home computer who purchases an item from a virtual catalogue. With the click of his mouse, the purchase is logged, his account billed and payment made by wire transfer and the order sent. The vendor is in another State, or even another country. His bank is in a third State and the purchase is a gift being sent to a relative in another State. Where did this transaction take place? Where was there nexus for tax purposes--the vendor State? The customer's State? The bank's location? Or the State where the gift is being sent? Is the answer all of the above, some of the above, or none of the above? 
The enormity of the problem is underscored by the fact that the hottest selling software today is software to help entrepreneurs and companies figure out various State tax policies. 
When a consumer in Corvallis, OR uses an Internet search engine in California, is that search a taxable service? When a housewife in Houston uses Virginia-based America Online to make a virtual purchase from a furniture company in North Carolina, what gets taxed where? Is an Internet service provider a public utility, as one State has ruled? Even if a State has enacted an online tax law, collection and enforcement are often haphazard. This system rewards ignorance and punishes the boy scout businesses that play by the rules. 
The purpose of the bill I am introducing today with Congressman Chris Cox is to allow everyone to step back and take a deep breath. It says let's suspend this crazy tax quilting bee so that everyone can come together in a rational way to figure out what policy makes the most sense. 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act has three parts. First, it would impose an indefinite moratorium on subnational taxes on electronic commerce. Where States and local governments have already imposed taxes on electronic commerce, their taxes would be grand fathered to the extent that they are net income taxes, fairly apportioned business license taxes or where the tax is collected in an identical way for mail or telephone orders. This will assure uniformity and 
fairness, while targeting inequitable technology taxes. Our intent is that the new tax moratorium apply to all Internet and interactive computer services, regardless of the technology--such as cable systems and wireless networks--being used to deliver those services. It will give us a functionally equivalent and technologically equitable tax policy. It will assure equity and fairness among all business entities and across technologies. 
Second, the bill would call upon the administration to bring together State and local governments, businesses and consumers, and any others with a stake in the Internet and online commerce to develop policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet and use of the Internet to deliver products and services. The Executive would have 2 years in which to prepare policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet. 
Third, the bill directs the executive branch to seek an international agreement making the Internet a duty-free zone. Just as we seek a rational policy on electronic commerce taxation here in the United States, our businesses cannot be expected to compete overseas if they faced more than 160 different foreign tariff policies covering global electronic commerce. Although about 75 percent of Web users live in North America, most electronic commerce is between companies, rather than companies and consumers. Forrester Research of Massachusetts predicts business-to-business commerce will soon be worth $67 billion a year. 
Trying to find out exactly which States and local authorities are imposing taxes on electronic commerce and what types of taxes they are imposing is a daunting--if not outright impossible--task in itself. The Vice President for a good-sized Internet service provider in California said he would need a whole department to untangle the various Internet tax laws around the country, `It's in my nightmare pile,' he observed. If this has stumped some of the best accounting firms in the country, how in the world can a small business that wants to sell over the Internet figure out its various tax liabilities? The difference between States in electronic commerce tax policy is mind-numbing. 
Twenty States and the District of Columbia impose one or more taxes on electronic commerce. New York levies taxes on gross receipts on the `furnishing of information,' but not on personal or individual information. Ohio taxes electronic transmissions and real estate data bases because they provide objective data but exempts news services because they provide analysis. Texas taxes the transmission of electronic information and software in whatever form, but does not tax software sent out of State on a disk. Alabama's Revenue Department ruled last fall that a utility tax applies to Internet service providers, forcing them to pay a 4-percent public utilities tax. 
Last year in Florida a small Internet service provider asked the State's Department of Revenue whether he should add a sales tax to his customers' monthly bills. He was certain he wouldn't have to since all net surfers there already pay 10 percent or more in taxes for the telephone service they use to link to the Internet. To his surprise, the Revenue Department said his customers should have been paying a 7-percent service tax under a decade-old telecommunications law. Then, adding shock to surprise, the Department told him his company was subject to an additional 2.5-percent tax on its gross annual receipts. The uproar from users and providers led the Governor to suspend the taxes until a panel could study the implications. 
The legislation is constructed in such a way as to set up a dynamic and productive tension. It gives those that seek revenue from electronic commerce--the States and local governments--an incentive to work with the administration in developing policy recommendations on Internet taxation. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote me on February 21 that they have been `working with a number of other State organizations as well as the impacted private sector industries to find the common ground which will lead to the coordination and uniformity of State tax structures which the draft legislation desires.' And an official with the Federal of Tax Administrators observed last summer that `States need to figure out how to tax it [the Internet] and to make it a level playing field with other services.' I will also continue to work with the Multistate Tax Commission to assure their efforts move forward. 
But the question remains: Will the simple imperative for good public policy outweigh the desire of cash-strapped States to tap a new source of revenue? Without a moratorium, as proposed in this legislation, I fear those State and local governments hungry for new sources of revenue have little, if any, incentive to work for a fair and equitable Internet tax policy. 
I want to thank a number of groups that have helped us craft this legislation, and which have indicated their support for this bill: the American Electronics Association, the Software Publishers Association, the Association of Online Professionals, the Committee on State Taxation, the Direct Marketing Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Telephone Association, the California State Board of Taxation, the Massachusetts High Tech Council, CommerceNet, the Silicon Valley Software Industry Coalition, IBM, AT&T, and other companies. 
I view the legislation being introduced today as the beginning of a process, not the end. It remains a work in progress and will hopefully continue to be refined throughout the congressional hearing process. 
There is a great deal to learn in these unchartered waters. All of us--Congress, State and local governments, businesses and consumers--must educate each other about how this new electronic medium works. We must all work together to help it achieve its full potential as a marketplace of ideas, products, and services.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as this Congress moves forward to strengthen and secure the Medicare Program for future generations, three issues are crystal clear. 
First, we must have the political will to modernize Medicare to reflect both the quality and the efficiency of private health care plans now serving most working Americans, and in particular the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program which many Members of Congress, their staff and families, and other Federal employees enjoy. 
Second, we must maintain our commitment to current and future Medicare beneficiaries by preserving a basic, high-quality portfolio of health services for all enrollees, irrespective of their income, where they live, or their particular health circumstances. 
Third, we must begin the transformation of Medicare financial foundations in a way that is first fair to all beneficiaries, and second insures that Medicare will be there for our children and their children, and that it will not bust the Federal budget in the bargain. 
I believe that the legislation I introduce, today, The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act of 1997, meets all three of these primary goals. While fully preserving traditional, fee-for-service Medicare, this legislation also will create an array of new, high-quality, cost-efficient health plans for Medicare beneficiaries, and offer those enrollees positive incentives to try them. It will provide new protections and consumer rights to Medicare beneficiaries in capitated health plans. It will mandate new penalties and enforcement mechanisms to eradicate fraud and abuse now stripping billions of dollars per year from the program. And it will create new support systems for some of Medicare's most desperately ill and poor beneficiaries, and their families. 
Finally, through new cost-conscious management systems and a firm fiscal control mechanism, this plan will reduce Medicare cost growth by approximately $100 billion over the next 5 years, and with financial constraints that will continue to control runaway spending growth after fiscal year 2002. 
The Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act will offer seniors more health plan choices by eliminating the huge variability in capitated payments to health plans in counties around the nation. At the same time, it will raise the minimum payment to 80 percent of the national average payment, leveraging higher reimbursements and I believe more plan offerings in up to 20 percent of our counties. 
This proposal also establishes an outlier fund, an account fueled by withholding up to five percent of payments to Medicare health maintenance organizations. Medicare managers would have discretion to withhold those payments from plans which are being over-compensated by the HMO payment formula, and disburse those funds in the form of extra payments to plans which have avoided risk selection in their beneficiary recruitment and as a result are providing services to sicker enrollees with above-average health care costs. Compared to the meat-cleaver approach of reducing all plan payments from the current 95 percent of local average health care costs, to 90 percent, this is a surgical solution to two significant Medicare managed care plan problems: (a) plan overpayments and (b) plans which avoid enrolling older, frailer beneficiaries because they cut profit margins. 
At the end of the year, any funds remaining in this account would be rolled back into the Medicare hospital insurance budget. 
At the same time, this bill reforms current rules for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap policies, requiring that such policies must be issued to any eligible beneficiary at any time. This change will encourage more seniors to try capitated plans, because they know the Medigap safety net always will be available to them. 
Seniors would be protected from unfair denial of service decision and other health plan abuses through a strengthened and streamlined appeals process. Also, seniors would receive more informative and easily comparable information on health plans in their communities, and through the mail on a regular basis through annual enrollment fairs. 
The legislation also would require the collection of customer service and satisfaction data, and performance information to be used in qualitative analysis by Medicare to produce published report cards on plan performance, and help consumers make kitchen-table assessments of their plan options. 
By Federal statute, plans also would be barred from muzzling doctors and other health care practitioners in their conversations with patients about their medical condition and all treatments appropriate to their case. 
New criminal and civil penalties are created for practitioners and plans who rip off the system. 
Programs for hospice care, Alzheimer's respite care, and prospective payment for both home care and skilled nursing care are added to Medicare. The legislation requires Medicare to study and make recommendations on the more extensive and appropriate use of community pharmacy, telemedicine and so-called social health maintenance organization plans for dual eligibles in its portfolio of services to beneficiaries. 
The fiscal integrity portion of this bill would set overall part A and part B spending limits for each of the next 5 years. These overall spending limits would include target spending allotments for each of the several major areas of Medicare activity: doctors, hospitals, diagnostic services, nursing homes, and the like. 
Typically, Medicare has sought to control costs in these areas in the past by rolling back reimbursement rates for goods and services. Providers, however, have watered down Medicare's attempts at thrift by increasing volume in the face of lower per-service payments. Too often this has led to waste and inefficiency, with providers ordering procedures and services that beneficiaries really don't need, crippling Medicare with unnecessarily high costs. 
With $100 billion in cumulative savings expected in 5 years, my proposal would require that Medicare practitioners live within the budget's ceiling by mandating reduced reimbursements if cumulative billings otherwise would bust an individual service sector's annual spending plan. 
Despite these restraints, Medicare fee-for-service providers will enjoy generally healthy annual increases under this proposal. Beneficiaries should see no change in the level or quality of care they receive. Expensive, unnecessary care, however, could be sharply curtailed. 
Mr. President, I believe that this Congress should not as a first step relinquish Medicare restructuring to a special commission. I think most of us have an acute awareness of what is needed to fix the program for the long term. Some steps will be harder than others. But as the old Chinese proverb reminds us, a trip of a thousand miles begins with the first step. 
I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection Act is that good first step, and join with me in co-sponsoring this legislation.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when a certified public accountant provides an opinion on a company's financial statements, investors and consumers rely on that statement. This role is vital to the efficient workings of our capital markets, which are the envy of the world. To keep our markets the best, investors must have confidence in them. That is why I have worked over the years for stronger rules to protect investors from corporate fraud. 
In recent years, corporate fraud has been perpetrated in the health care arena, military contracting and in the savings and loan fiasco, costing taxpayers billions of dollars. As a Member of the House and as a new Senator, I have worked to put in place clear procedures for early detection of fraud and illegal acts so as to protect the public from huge losses of their hard-earned tax dollars. 
To strengthen the fight against fraud, I worked as part of a bipartisan coalition that was successful in adding a new Section 10A to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I wish to take a moment today to update my colleagues on the status of that section's implementation. 
Since the enactment of this law in December 1995, I have been interested in how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the accounting industry would respond to the new requirements and the spirit of the law. I am pleased that both the industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission have taken positive steps to assure that both the letter and the spirit of the law are fully adhered to. Within the industry, I would note that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) last year issued a revised statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) Number 82 `Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit.' The new SAS supersedes Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) Number 53 relating to `The Auditor's Responsibility to Detect and Report Errors and Irregularities.' The previous AICPA Statement of Auditing Standards Number 53 required auditors to report errors and irregularities. The new SAS takes an important step forward by making clear for the first time an auditor's responsibility to detect material fraud in financial statements and by offering various fraud risk factors to be considered in planning and performing all audits. The new revised SAS, read in conjunction with the AICPA's SAS Number 54 relating to an auditor's responsibility to detect illegal acts, is not only consistent with Section 10A but also promotes the intent of that provision to put procedures in place to help detect fraud early. 
To date, the SEC has only limited experience with Section 10A because it becomes effective in two stages. For companies that file selected quarterly financial data with the SEC, Section 10A applies to annual reports for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. For companies that do not file these reports, the provision applies to annual reports for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1997. Many financial reports are filed at the end of the calendar year, meaning that most company audits for the 1996 fiscal year have not yet been completed. The SEC has assured me that it will evaluate and report on its experience with implementation of Section 10A in a timely manner. 
In addition, I wrote SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt seeking his views on whether the AICPA's new SAS Number 82 and existing SAS 54 relating to illegal acts are consistent with the 
purpose and intent of Section 10A. In his reply, Chairman Levitt states: `We believe that both these standards improve the ability of auditors to detect management fraud and are consistent with the purposes of Section 10A.' 
Mr. President, the vast majority of accountants are honest, capable professionals. The number of audit failures is actually quite low compared to the amount of work they do. The AICPA's new revised SAS No. 82 and section 10A are added protection for investors and corporations against such failures. 
I am pleased with both the work of the AICPA in clarifying the role of auditors in detecting fraudulent acts and with Chairman Levitt's reply assuring us that the SEC and AICPA procedures should work well together to promote the early detection of corporate fraud.

 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I introduce private relief legislation for Ms. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn. Senator Hatfield championed Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's cause in the 104th Congress, and at his request and the request of many in the Portland area, I and Senator Smith are now picking up the legislation to make Ms. Barbeau-Quinn a citizen of this country. 
Ms. Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, is a long time member of the Portland community and resident of Oregon. She lived in Portland with her now deceased husband, Mr. Michael Quinn since 1976, and together they ran the Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and respected restaurant in the Portland area. While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband lived together for over 16 years, they did not actually marry until shortly before Michael Quinn's death in 1991. 
Since Oregon does not recognize common law marriage, and Ms. Barbeau-Quinn was not married the 2 years required by immigration law, she has not been able to file for permanent residency in this country. While I do not intend to introduce many private relief bills, because of Senator Hatfield's involvement in this matter and Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's compelling case, I think it is appropriate that the Senate pass legislation to ensure that Ms. Barbeau-Quinn remains a member of the Portland community for many years to come.
