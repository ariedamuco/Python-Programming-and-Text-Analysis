   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me make it clear that without the Schumer amendment this bill does not help women. It would be the leading dagger in keeping a woman's right to choose. 
   If women support this, why do 16 of the leading women's groups sign a letter saying vote against the bill without the Schumer amendment. Why would we allow those who committed such crimes as posting the Nuremberg files and virtually urging people to harm doctors to escape under the cloak of bankruptcy? 
   We will go back to the days when 80 percent of the clinics are closed in America and a woman's right to choose is gone. 
   Whatever you feel about the particulars of the bankruptcy bill--and I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts about that--whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, people ought not take the law into their own hands and then hide behind the cloak of bankruptcy. 
   Members must vote no on this bill until the Schumer amendment is added back. It passed 80-20 originally on this floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I augment what my friend from Minnesota said about the bill. Aside from the procedural problems, I have never seen anything like this in the 20 years I have been in this Congress. Aside from the other provisions, I want to talk about the amendment I have added to this bill. Let's not forget, Senators, 80 Members voted for that provision. I think 17 voted against the provision. 
   The bill that comes back is a different bill. The provision that I wrote into the bill which is so important deals with the use of bankruptcy as a way to violate the laws of this country. 
   Very simply, we passed a law a while ago called a face law. It gave women who sought to have abortions the ability to actually have what their lawful rights are. Blockaders started blockading the place. Then they actually used violence to stop the right to choose, a constitutionally given right. 
   The face law simply said the clinic could sue those who used violence or threat of violence against them--not people peacefully protesting; that is their American right. I defend that no matter how much I disagree with their position. All of a sudden, the right to choose was restored. It had not been available in 80 percent of the counties in this country because of the blockaders who believed, since they were getting their message from God, they superseded the rest of us. That, of  course, is dangerous thinking. Any one could believe if we have a message from God we ought to impose it on someone else, and we all have different views of what God is telling us. 
   In any case, now they have found a new way to violate the law. That is to declare bankruptcy. Let me inform my colleagues of one case, the so-called Nuremberg files. The group put together on the Internet names and addresses of doctors, of their wives, of their children. When a doctor was killed, as Dr. Slepian, in my home State of New York, near Buffalo, NY, they put an ``X'' next to his name. If a doctor was injured, his named was shaded. 
   Those people were sued under the face law. Of course, the Oregon court in which they had the trial ruled they had violated the law. To not pay judgment, each of them went back to their own States and declared bankruptcy. Whether the bankruptcy issue is held or not, this little clinic does not have the ability to go back to 12 or 13 different States and pursue the same litigation all over again. 
   All our provision says is that you can't use bankruptcy for this. It was never intended for this, just as you couldn't use it as a shield if you were sued because of drunk driving. It is not pro-life or pro-choice. 
   My lead cosponsor is HARRY REID, my friend and colleague, who believes as strongly in the pro-life movement as I believe in the pro-choice movement. 
   It is not partisan. Immediately, Senators SNOWE, JEFFORDS, and COLLINS joined us in cosponsoring the amendment. It passed in this body, supported by both pro-choice and pro-life Senators, 80-17. 
   This new little provision--it was taken out. To me, it is the most important provision in this bankruptcy bill. Yes, we need to change our bankruptcy laws for the better. I do not disagree with that. But to do it and do it in this way and not give the Senate its voice says to me: Let's go back to the drawing board and scrap it. 
   This is an issue that relates to the Constitution of the United States itself, the rule of law. This is an issue that says if the Constitution grants you a right, we are not going to let cowards use the bankruptcy law to hide behind, avoiding their just civil punishment. As the Senator from Minnesota said, you will hear from us on this. If the people who were managing this bill cared so much about passing it, they should have kept the so-called Schumer amendment in there. It would have been a lot easier to get things done. But that did not happen, they could not and would not. 
   Because the amendment I have added addresses head-on this 
   fundamental use of the bankruptcy system, I will not rest until we do everything procedurally possible to make sure that a bankruptcy reform package without it fails. 
   I yield the floor and yield back my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 25, 1999: 
   Haeng Eom, 57, Seattle, WA; 
   Jeong Eom, 60, Seattle, WA; 
   Jamal Johnson, 18, New Orleans, LA; 
   Joe Leavitt, 65, Kansas City, MO; 
   Lanette Macias, 34, Kansas City, MO; 
   Solomon McGruder, 30, New Orleans, LA; 
   Irving E. Varon, 51, Seattle, WA; 
   Alfonso Vilmil, 53, El Paso, TX; 
   Walter Williams, 35, Nashville, TN; and 
   Unidentified Male, 16, Chicago, IL. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of a bill that will grant permanent residency status to a small group of Syrian Jews who fled the brutal dictatorship of Hafez Assad almost a decade ago. 
   In 1992, through negotiations between our State Department and the Syrian regime, President Assad allowed the last remnants of Syria's Jewish community to leave Syria. For years, this community faced religious persecution, restrictions on the right to travel and emigrate, and other forms of harassment. When Assad finally agreed to let them go, he insisted that they come to this country as tourists, rather than as refugees fleeing religious tyranny, in order to avoid the appearance that his repression had driven out a considerable number of his own citizens. We permitted this fiction in order to rescue people desperate for freedom, but obviously, the 2000 Syrian Jews who came here in 1992 were never tourists--they were seeking a permanent home and a life free of religious and political oppression. 
   Once safely in the United States, the Syrian Jews had no choice but to request asylum, and asylum was granted. But because of the long delays that asylees face in obtaining permanent resident status, the Syrian Jews still have not become permanent residents and gotten green cards. If they had come to the United States as the refugees they truly were, instead of as tourists, they would have become permanent residents years ago because there is no annual cap on the number of refugees permitted to move to permanent residency. 
   The Syrian Jews have suffered for years because of this situation, imposed on them by the terms of the secret 1992 deal with Assad. Without green cards, those among them who are doctors and dentists, as many are, are unable to practice their professions under the New York State licensing system. As asylees, the Syrian Jews face restrictions on their right to travel abroad. Finally and most important, the Syrian Jews have been stalled for years in the efforts to become full citizens of our country, something all of them ardently want. 
   This legislation corrects this anomaly and directs the Attorney General to grant permanent resident status to the Syrian Jews who came here in 1992. This will give this small group of people the immigration status they should have had years ago, but for the fiction that they were coming to the United States as tourists. It will permit them to begin practicing their chosen professions and moving toward full citizenship. It will finally effectuate the agreement by which they emigrated from Syria in the first place. Most of all, it will guarantee the full blessings of liberty to people who want nothing more than to live in peace in a land where the government doesn't mistreat you simply because of your religion.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from Michigan. He is gracious as always, and I appreciate the opportunity to briefly interrupt this proceeding. I also compliment him and Senator WARNER on the bill they have put together. As was mentioned, the whole Chamber admires the bipartisan way in which the Senators from Michigan and Virginia have worked together. 
   I rise today to say I am stunned and saddened by the violence which has erupted in the Middle East. I am saddened by the loss of four innocent and brave American sailors, victims of malicious, malevolent, maddening terrorism that has no rationale, no justification. 
   My prayers and thoughts are with their families, as well as with those who have been injured and those who are missing, and their families as well. Terrorism can strike anywhere at any time. We have to be doing all we can in this Chamber to deal with it. 
   I am stunned also that after 7 years of good faith negotiations all too many Palestinians still see violence as the means to achieve their ends. The violent pictures we saw of the two Israeli reservists being thrown from a window and brutally beaten is enough to turn anyone's stomach. Pictures such as that and so many other pictures that we have seen are not only very disturbing to us, but it lessens the chances for peace in the Middle East. 
   I am disappointed and sad that Chairman Arafat has failed to stop or even condemn the violence. Yasser Arafat says he is for peace and he has signed agreements for peace. Yet violence has erupted in the Middle East and not only has he failed to stop it, you don't hear a word of condemnation. Instead, one may feel that he misguidedly thinks violence is a means to an end. I am saddened that a peace process which saw the courage and sacrifice of leaders such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak may be crumbling before our eyes. The prospect for peace, at least in the near future, has been shattered by today's events. 
   I have been a supporter of the Oslo peace process because I truly believe that peace is the only realistic, long-term alternative for Israel and Israel's Arab neighbors. It will be through peace that they achieve strength and security. It will be through peace that Israel will have its future aglow with possibilities. But now, to be honest, I am not so sure what will come of the Oslo peace process, let alone how much more Israel can sacrifice in the name of peaceful compromise which may never come to be. Prime Minister Barak went further than anyone dreamed he could go, and even those exceedingly generous and courageous offers were rejected. 
   Peace has to be a two-way street; otherwise, it is just empty promises. 
   Chairman Arafat must be called to task for his inability to control the violence and to embrace peace. The sad truth is that while Israeli leaders were preparing their citizens for peace by bringing them to accept the compromises necessary for peace, Arafat was doing the opposite. He was making false promises to his people and raising false hopes. 
   If there is to be real peace in the Middle East, Chairman Arafat has a responsibility to prepare his people for peace, not violence. That means changing Palestinian textbooks which still call for the destruction of Israel. It also means stopping the rhetoric of hate concerning Jewish claims to Jerusalem's holy sites. Most of all, it means telling his people, as Ehud Barak has, that compromise is the way to attain a fair and just settlement, and that violence is no longer an option. 
   As a result, today, sadly, extremists on both sides have been strengthened. Who has benefited from what has happened in the last 10 days? Ideologues, and only ideologues; not average people, whether they be Jew, Arab, Christian, or Moslem. 
   I believe Mr. Arafat will rue the day he let this genie out of the bottle. He  has let forces loose and he now has a tiger by the tail, and I even wonder whether he can survive. 
   To the Israelis, I say: Stay the course, even at this painful moment. It will be very easy to throw up one's hands and give up. Yes, be strong, and make sure that when a horrible 
   thing such as happened to the two in Ramallah happens, there will be a price paid. But don't give up on the course to peace; don't give up to those who will tell you there is another solution. There is not. 
   To my fellow Americans, I say: First, we are so saddened, again, by the loss of innocent lives--people defending America as Americans have for more than 200 years. I also say to my American brethren that we can't isolate ourselves, that this conflict in the Middle East is not one on which we can turn our backs. Just look; not only are four Americans dead; several more are missing and many more injured, and oil prices are up. We are carefully watching movements of troops in Iraq and Iran at this moment. We are worried about terrorism even on our own shores. No, we all must stay the course. 
   As I mentioned, the prospects for peace in the Near East have been shattered by today's actions. Only by strong, courageous but careful and judicious action by people of good will--Americans, Israelis, and Arabs--can those pieces be put back together. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank you as well as the chairman of our committee, Mr. HATCH, and the ranking member, Mr. LEAHY, for yielding me a brief amount of time to talk on the Violence Against Women Act. 
   I commend our leader on Judiciary, Senator LEAHY, for his diligent work on so many of the issues contained here. I know there are some differences on a few. I commend Senator BIDEN, who has worked long and hard on this issue for many years. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his strenuous efforts. I also thank the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER. When Senator BIDEN first introduced the bill in the Senate, Senator BOXER, then Congress Member BOXER, was the House sponsor; I was the cosponsor. When she moved on to the Senate, I became the lead House sponsor and managed the bill as it was signed into law. 
   When it was first enacted in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act signaled a sea change in our approach to the epidemic of violence directed at women. Until the law, by and large it had been a dirty little secret that every night hundreds of women showed up at police precincts, battered and bruised, because they were beaten by their spouse or their boyfriend or whatever. All too often they were told by that law enforcement officer, who really had no education, no training, or no place to send the battered woman: Well, this is a domestic matter. Go home and straighten it out with your husband. 
   So deep were the traditions ingrained that it was very hard to remove them. In fact, the expression ``rule of thumb'' comes from the medieval law that said a husband could beat his wife with a stick provided that stick was no wider than his thumb. 
   The Violence Against Women Act took giant strides to take this terrible, dirty secret, bring it above ground, and begin really to cleanse it. The new law acknowledged that the ancient bias showed itself not just in the virulence of the perpetrators of violence but in the failure of the system and the community to respond with sufficient care and understanding. Shelters grew, police departments were educated, the VAWA hotline--which we added to the law as an afterthought, I remember, in the conference--got huge numbers of calls every week, far more than anybody ever expected. The increased penalties for repeat sex offenders did a great deal of good. 
   In my State alone, for instance, the act provided $92 million for purposes such as shelter, such as education, such as rape crisis centers, and such as prevention education for high school and college students, and victims' services. But, as impressive as the advances were under the original VAWA, we still have a long way to go; this horrible activity is ingrained deeply in our society. Building on the success of VAWA I, VAWA II--the Violence Against Women Act II--is now before us. It is still the case that a third of all murdered women die at the hands of spouses and partners and a quarter of all violent crimes against women are committed by spouses and partners. Indeed, the latest figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics actually show an increase of 13 percent in rape and sexual assault. 
   So we have a long way to go. The battle continues. It is why the Violence Against Women Act is so important and will make such a difference in the lives of women across America. I will not catalog its provisions. That has been done by my colleagues before me. I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. 
   In conclusion, let us hope this law will hasten the time when violence against women is not a unique and rampant problem requiring the attention of this body. Let us pray for the time when women no longer need to live in fear of being beaten. 
   I yield my time and thank my colleagues.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me the time, and my good friend from Nevada, the assistant minority leader, for arranging our ability to speak. 
   First, I say, as well, that I enjoyed the debate last night. I thought most Americans got to see, for 90 minutes, the candidates unfiltered. It was good for the country, whatever side one came down on. It is just one more step in the process of all of us educating ourselves about the very difficult problems this country faces as we move along. 
   I would like to talk about one aspect of the debate which is very relevant to what we are doing here as we end our final 2 weeks on the budget. What we heard from the Vice President and from Governor Bush last night about the budget, about Medicare, and about taxes is exactly what the Senate is focused on as we move to wrap up the session. So I thought it would be a good idea for us to actually look at the numbers instead of the rhetoric. 
   Last night it seemed to me Vice President GORE talked about a lot of numbers. Governor Bush did not answer any of his statements. He did not answer Jim Lehrer's questions. Instead, he resorted to this sort of catchall of ``fuzzy numbers,'' ``fuzzy math,'' ``fuzzy Washington numbers.'' I guess when you do not have the ability to answer or you are stuck, you go to rhetoric. 
   I would like to examine those so-called ``fuzzy numbers.'' I do not think anyone who has examined them looks at them as ``fuzzy.'' But it is just that Governor Bush's plans for America are so skewed, and the numbers do not add up, that he cannot answer the questions directly and instead starts talking about ``fuzzy numbers.'' 
   I will admit, to the average American this is all sort of confusing. People are so busy with their jobs and their families and their hobbies and their avocations, they can't take out a magnifying glass and look at all the details. They have to go, as we always have in this Republic, with their instincts. Who is really right? 
   But today I thought I might spend a few minutes of our time on the floor, which I am grateful for, to actually go over those numbers in as clear a way as I can. 
   It is clear, once you look at the numbers, that what the Vice President was saying is true: That if we use Governor Bush's plan, a largely disproportionate share of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest people; that there is no room for Medicare expansion, in fact Medicare must be cut, if we use Governor Bush's plan; that, in fact, you do go back to the old days of not only eating up the surplus but of deficit spending--if we do all of the things that Governor Bush has proposed. 
   So let's look at the math. 
   Let's start out with the basic foundation of our budget, the surplus projections. We all know they may not be accurate, but they may not be accurate on the low side or they may not be accurate on the high side. These are the best numbers we have from the Congressional Budget Office, which is generally regarded as fairly nonpartisan. 
   They estimate that the surplus, over the next 10 years, will be huge, $4.6 trillion. I think that is because we finally have gotten it here in Washington that we can't go spending money we do not have. That is good. There is a consensus--I think both Democrats and Republicans agree--about that. 
   There is a second agreement. We all agree right now that 
   the money ought to go to Social Security first, that we ought to take the Social Security surplus, the amount of money that is in FICA, that you pay in in FICA, that every American worker pays in--their hard-earned dollars; and they pay what I guess many would think is a high percentage--my daughter had her first job over the summer. She is 15. She was amazed how much came out in FICA from her little meager paycheck. But we say all that FICA money should stay with Social Security; that no one in Washington should get their sticky little fingers on it and use it for something else. You take away the Social  Security surplus and that gives us a total, over the next 10 years, of $2.2 trillion to spend. 
   Last night, the Vice President said Governor Bush's plan would not only use all that but return us to deficit spending when you added everything up. He focused on the tax cut as much too large, if you wanted to do the other things. 
   The Governor did not respond in point. He said: These fuzzy Washington numbers. This chart shows the numbers are not fuzzy. They are as clear as the nose on the Governor's face. 
   You start with the $2.2 trillion, non-Social Security surplus. Both parties agree we have to preserve the Medicare trust fund, although last night the Governor did refuse to come out for his lockbox. But as you preserve the trust fund, if you do not cut into Medicare, which he says he will not do, you lose another $360 billion. Then you go $1.8 trillion. 
   Then there is the $1.3 trillion tax cut. We will discuss later to whom it goes. That was the No. 1 contention in the debate. But Governor Bush, by his own words, takes $1.3 trillion. He says it is a small portion of the total Government budget. It is. But it is a very large portion of the surplus that we have. Of the $2.2 trillion that is left after you save Social Security and preserve Social Security, he would take $1.3 trillion of that--more than half of it--and put it into tax cuts. That brings us down to $500 billion left over the 10 years. 
   Then there are the other tax breaks that the Governor has supported which have been talked about on this floor. He supports cutting the marriage penalty. He mentioned that last night. He supports the estate tax reduction. He has mentioned that at other times. You take that, that is another $940 billion. So now we are already in deficit by $400 billion; no longer having the surplus that we struggled to attain after so many years of deficit spending. So then we are in deficit. 
   But he doesn't stop there. Then there is spending. The Governor proposes some spending for education and for other things. Every day we hear of a new program he is coming out with. I support some of them, as I support some of the tax cuts, but not all because together, when you add it up, it is too much. 
   He has proposed $625 billion in spending. That brings our deficit to $1 trillion. Then he proposes that we take $1 trillion out of Social Security and let people invest that in the stock market or whatever else. Of course, he said, it will go up three times; that is, if the stock market triples. I don't put my daughter's college money that my wife and I save each month in the stock market for fear, even though it might triple, it might go down. And then how are we going to pay for her college? 
   He takes the money out, wherever you put it, and that is another $1.1 trillion. Now we are at a $2.1 trillion deficit. Finally, because you are not getting interest on all this money; you are spending it, so to speak, in terms of tax breaks and in terms of spending programs, you lose another $400 billion of foregone interest. When you add it all up, the deficit, with the Governor's plan, is back to the bad old days of $2.5 trillion. 
   This is not fuzzy Washington math. These are not fuzzy numbers. These are the numbers the Governor has proposed. No wonder he didn't answer Vice President GORE'S retort about going back and where all the money is coming from. No wonder he had to use this rhetoric. The only people these numbers are fuzzy to are the people who don't want to add them up because they lead to deficit spending: the Governor of Texas and his supporters. 
   The other big issue was where does the tax cut go. Again, Vice President GORE said seven, eight, nine, ten times--I lost count--that the top 1 percent of the people in America get a huge proportion of the tax cut. And Jim Lehrer asked Governor Bush whether that was true, and Governor Bush would not answer the question. Do you know why? Why didn't Governor Bush answer the question as to where the tax cuts go? Because he knew the Vice President was right. He knew it went disproportionately to the wealthiest people in America. 
   Here are the numbers, plain and simple. This is data from Citizens for Tax Justice, not a Democratic or Republican group. 
   The top 1 percent of America, those are people--I wish the Vice President had said this--the top 1 percent is not you or even me, and I make a good salary as a Senator. You have to make $319,000 to be in the top 1 percent. If you average it out, the income of the top 1 percent is $915,000. These people are not just millionaires; they make almost $1 million a year on average. They get 42 percent of the tax cut. Almost one of every $2 we are cutting in taxes goes to people whose average income is $1 million or close to $1 million a year. How many Americans want that? If I were confronted with that fact, I would ``rhetorize,'' as they say, I would give what the Governor himself might call Washington rhetoric and say: That is fuzzy mathematics. 
   It is not fuzzy. Here it is, Governor Bush: The top 1 percent get 42 percent of the tax cuts. The people whose average income is $915,000 get $46,000 back in tax cuts. 
   Let's take the people in the middle, the middle 20 percent, people making between $25,000 and $40,000 a year. They get about 8 
   percent of the tax cuts or $453. Of course, low-income people, the Governor said, they are going to do better--yes, $42 a year better. So it is true, as the Governor said, everyone gets a tax break. He wants to give the money to everyone. The trouble is, he wants to give most of the money to the wealthiest few. 
   He is right. The wealthiest people have most of the money, and they pay a lot of the taxes. That is true. But we have a policy choice, Mr. President. Do we want the wealthiest of people to get most of the money back or do we want to do targeted tax cuts for the middle class and spend more of the money than the Governor does on education, on a prescription drug plan, on health care? 
   This is not fuzzy Washington math. These are facts. I don't blame Governor Bush for running away from them and hiding behind rhetoric. 
   One final point. Vice President GORE, in the debate, said that he wanted targeted tax cuts for the middle class. And George Bush said: You need an accountant to figure this out. Well, tell a family who is making $50,000 a year, whose oldest child is 17, and the husband and wife are up late at night worrying: How in the heck are we going to pay for Johnny's college. How the heck, on an income of $50,000 a year, are we going to come up with $10,000 a year after paying our mortgage and buying the food and payments on the car? How are we going to do that? 
   Well, you don't need an accountant with what Vice President GORE talked about. You simply need to put on your tax return that your child is going to college, that you are paying $10,000 a year, and you deduct that from your taxes. It is as simple as deducting your mortgage interest. It is as simple as deducting your health care costs. You don't need an accountant. 
   We all believe in tax cuts; I do. Is it better for all of America to give that wealthiest family $46,000 a year, when their income is $915,000, or is it better to say to middle-income families who are struggling with the cost of college that we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, a proposal that has had bipartisan support in the Senate? The Senator from Maine, OLYMPIA SNOWE; myself; the Senator from Indiana, Mr. BAYH; and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. SMITH--two Democrats and two Republicans--have championed that. I learned how much people struggled with that when I ran for the Senate 2 years ago. It is one of my passions to get it done. 
   You don't need an accountant. Those are not fuzzy Washington numbers.

   Mr. SCHUMER. It is not fuzzy math. It is plain and simple. 
   The bottom line is, last night Governor Bush could not argue facts. He could not argue the merits. So he ran away from the argument by claiming fuzzy numbers. 
   The debate was a great success for the Vice President because, as people examine what I have talked about--the huge deficit spending the Governor would have us engage in, again, the fact that a disproportionate share of  the tax cuts go to the wealthy; the fact that the middle-income tax cuts proposed by the Vice President are very simple and easy to use and desperately needed by the American people--the Vice President will score points. 
   More importantly, he will win the election on that basis, and America will finally spend our surplus on the priorities we need and return taxes to the middle class who need them more than anybody else. Our country will continue the prosperity that, praise God, we have seen in the last 8 years. 
   Mr. President, these are not fuzzy Washington numbers. These are facts. They are facts that show that the Vice President is far more in touch with what the average American wants and needs than is Governor Bush. 
   I don't believe in class warfare. I respect people who have made a lot of money. That is the American dream. I hope my children will. 
   But when you do deep tax cuts, who should get it when you only have a limited amount? When you have a surplus, why should it be squandered? Governor Bush, these are not fuzzy numbers but hard, cold facts that help the American people. 
   I yield back my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Before I get into the substance of my remarks dealing with honoraria for judges, I echo the words of my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, as well as our leader on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, about the holdup in judges. Senator LEAHY has laid it out quite carefully; that is, that we have not appointed as many judges, on a percentage basis, as when Democrats controlled the Senate during the Reagan and Bush years. 
   I particularly add my voice to those who are asking that Bonnie Campbell be added to the Eighth Circuit. 
   The reason I rise is not only as a member of the Judiciary Committee, not only as somebody who believes we ought to fill the vacancies in our courts--and I am appreciative that Senator HATCH has worked with me to fill those vacancies in New York. Neither the Second Circuit nor any of the New York district courts have vacancies, and we did manage to fill at least six judgeships this year. I thank the chairman for that. But that doesn't mean the rest of the country should have things unanswered. 
   I worked with Bonnie Campbell. I was the sponsor in the House of the Violence Against Women Act. It was authored originally by Senator BIDEN and Senator BOXER, when she was a House Member. She carried it between 1990 and 1992. When she was elected to the Senate, she asked me to take the reins, and we did. We passed the law. As somebody greatly interested in the Violence Against Women Act, of bringing that dirty little secret, the amount of violence in our families, out into the sunlight so we could deal with it, I believed very strongly the right person should be appointed to be in charge of the act. 
   Bonnie Campbell did a fabulous job on an issue of great 
   concern to all Americans. I think it is just unfair to ``reward her'' by letting her sit there in limbo when she so deserves and could be such a great addition to the Eighth Circuit. I plead with my friend, the Senate majority leader, my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--who, as I say, has been fair and good to New York on this issue--to bring the names of all four judges before the Senate, or all the judges who are waiting in the wings--there are more than four--but particularly Bonnie Campbell. 
   On an issue related, as well, of debating a number of nominees to be Federal judges, I want to address an issue that affects the entire Federal judiciary: The ban on honoraria. Under current law, as we all know, Federal judges are not allowed to accept honoraria. That is how it should be. The framers of the Constitution designed article III to keep judges outside of politics and above influence. Read the Federalist Papers. One of the great debates was that Federal judges, in article III, achieve life appointment. 
   There was one reason for it: So they would be unfettered, so they would be uninfluenced; they could make their own decisions, knowing that no sanction could be taken against them for decisions they made, and, just as importantly, so the public would know it. 
   Because the judiciary has neither the power of the sword, as does the executive, nor the power of the purse, as does Congress, it is essential that the judiciary maintain its power--and it has, thank God--for these 211 years since the Constitution was written, through an untainted reputation for integrity and impartiality. The Federal judiciary has had it. It has frustrated us at times. It frustrated Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. It has frustrated some Members today on issues where we disagree with the majority. There is nothing we can do about it, thank God, because an independent judiciary is vital. 
   I believe the public, if the surveys I have seen are correct, believes the Federal judiciary is independent--far more, I might say, than State and local judiciaries where there are either elections or appointments of term so that judges believe they have to please either an individual or even the whole electorate to make up their minds. 
   Nothing could do more to undo the justified reputation so much wanted by the founders and sustained in this Republic as the provision that has been inserted into H.R. 4690 that would allow judges to accept honoraria. The repeal of the ban would create a significant loophole in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 which bars high-ranking Federal officials of all branches of Government from receiving speaking fees for 11 years. This prohibition has limited real and perceived corruption. It has limited real corruption and, probably much more widespread, perceived corruption. The conflicts of interest among Members of Congress, Federal judges, and senior members of the executive branch have been limited, as well. 
   I, for one, opposed honoraria for Members of Congress. I don't believe in a standard for the judges and a different one for Members. While honoraria were allowed in the Congress for most of the years I served in the House, I refused to take them. I remember my first speech, right after I was elected. A leading financial institution in New York asked me to speak. I had just been appointed to the Banking Committee, which regulated a lot of their activities. After the speech, they 
   handed me a check. I was sort of surprised; it sort of knocked my socks off. I looked at the check. I said: This is wrong; this is not a check for the ``Reelect Schumer Committee''--which I  would have believed would have been untoward to give me right after a speech anyway--but this is for me. They said: Yes, that is your honorarium. 
   I felt bad about it, returned the check, and vowed not to take any honoraria in the future. 
   It is even more important for judges because, as I said, they are not sanctioned to election; they are not supposed to be sanctioned to the whims of either the people or of special interest groups. It would simply lower the standard for the very officials for whom standards should be the highest. 
   Thousands of U.S. citizens go before Federal judges every year and expect impartial justice. That is why judges have, as I mentioned, life appointments. That is why the rules so assiduously guard against even the appearance of impropriety. And that is why we spend so much time debating the appointment of these judges. We know once they are appointed, that is it; they are in for life. 
   Lifting the ban will only leave litigants wondering whether the integrity of the judges has been undermined by speaking fees from groups that have a stake, or may have a stake, in the case before them. 
   The Federal judiciary, it is said, is underpaid. If you believe it, raise the pay; budget the money. But don't, please, allow judges to moonlight as talking heads. 
   That demeans our independent Federal judiciary. To simply give them leave to forage for speaking engagements is nothing less than an abdication of our responsibility. Moreover, exempting judges from the honorarium ban will give the biggest benefit to those who are in high demand for speaking engagements--likely the most famous, the most high ranking. Presumably inadequate compensation is a problem for all Federal judges, not just those who can garner the largest fees or even who are the most eloquent. We don't hire our judges, we don't appoint our judges, on the basis of eloquence. 
   Additionally, if judges are underpaid, then they may be more susceptible to influence from outside income--even more reason to maintain the honorarium ban. 
   In conclusion, the issue boils down to one simple, simple nugget: The faith of the people in their government. We have a great Republic. The more I am on Earth, the more I believe that the Founding Fathers were the greatest collection of practical geniuses history has ever known and the more I believe that our country is, as they put it, a noble experiment. It was when it started, and, God bless America, it still is today. 
   Honoraria for judges strike a dagger right in the heart of what the Founding Fathers wanted--a totally independent judiciary, perceived as independent as well as actually being independent. Inserting this nefarious provision into the thick of an appropriations bill in the dark of night ruins that image. Unfortunately, the sneaky addition of this provision matches the substantive effect of it. It will only enhance the public's perception that those in government should not be trusted. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the International Academic Opportunity Act introduced by Senator's LUGAR, FEINGOLD, COLLINS and me. This bill provides $1.5 million in scholarships to low income college students to finance their study abroad. It is estimated that this program will help over 300 students in its first year. I believe that this legislation will provide needed resources to help low income students compete in today's global marketplace. 
   In this era of globalization, it has become imperative for America's students to be prepared to operate in an international environment and economy. By studying abroad, students will be exposed to different languages and cultures that will help them become the successful leaders in the future. 
   This scholarship, otherwise referred to as the Gilman Scholarship Act, because it was the developed by the Hon. BENJAMIN GILMAN of New York, will provide up to $5000 per student for their study abroad. Mr. GILMAN targeted these scholarships to low income students who otherwise would not have been able to consider a study abroad program. I believe that by increasing the number of students that will benefit from an international education we can only enhance the capacity of our citizens to participate in a global society. 
   This legislation passed unanimously in the House and I hope that we will be able to pass it in the Senate before the end of session. I urge leadership and my fellow Senators to support a swift and unhindered passage.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am prepared to support PNTR for China, but I still have reservations about China's willingness to fulfill its previous trade commitments particularly as it pertains to insurance. 
   First, I want to express my appreciation to President Clinton and Ambassador Barshevsky who have been forceful advocates in ensuring that China keeps its end of the bargain and fully implements the 1999 bilateral agreement between our two nations. Last week, President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin held a frank and detailed discussion about China keeping its commitment to allow U.S. insurers to expand in China under the grandfathered right to operate through their current branch structure. 
   In response, President Jiang pledged that China will ``honor its commitments to further opening its domestic market'' to grandfathered insurance companies. This is a positive, but still ambiguous statement which I hope the Chinese president will clarify. And in clarifying his position, I hope President Jiang understands that should U.S. insurers be denied the grandfathered rights to branch in China, it would result in a serious degradation of the ``terms and conditions'' for insurance that were negotiated by USTR last November. 
   The problem extends beyond insurance to the heart of the PNTR agreement. Should PNTR become law, the President must certify:  
   ..... that the terms and conditions for the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization are at least equivalent to those agreed between the United States and People's Republic of China on November 15, 1999.  
   Anything less than full compliance in honoring China's commitment to grandfather U.S. insurers' branching rights will inhibit the President's ability to certify that the equivalent requirement has been met. 
   Every business that trades with China is looking to see how this matter is resolved because they need to know that trade agreements will truly be followed. If China wants to engage in the free market, its leaders must know that trade agreements are not arbitrary documents but ironclad commitments.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. September 13, 1999: Jonathan Holmes, 32, Detroit, MI; Edward Luckenbill, 51, Louisville, KY; Adrian Offutt, 19, Louisville, KY; Finnis Parron, 31, Houston, TX; Sherlyn Robinson, 37, Houston, TX; Unidentified Male, 29, Norfolk, VA; and Unidentified Male, 43, Norfolk, VA. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator HARKIN for modifying his amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The original amendment would have eliminated construction money for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) which is an essential component to our Stockpile Stewardship Program. Any elimination of funding for the program would negate the nearly $1 billion Congress has spent on this project thus far, and would cripple our nation's arms control and non-proliferation efforts. Still, the amendment agreed to does limit the amount of funding for Fiscal Year 2001 which will make it increasingly difficult to meet the goals of the project. 
   The United States has made a strong commitment against underground nuclear testing. In order to meet this goal and maintain the nuclear deterrent of the United States, we must have a safe, reliable, and effective science based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). 
   As a key element to the SSP, NIF will be the only facility able to achieve conditions of temperature and pressure in a laboratory setting that have only been reached in explosions of thermonuclear weapons and in the stars. It is expected to provide important contributions to the goals of stockpile stewardship in the absence of nuclear testing and to contribute to the advancement of inertial fusion energy and other scientific research efforts. 
   I am proud that institutions and contractors throughout New York State have provided valuable services and tools for this project that are essential to its completion. Because New York companies and research institutions provide laser, optics, and other tools, underground nuclear testing will no longer be necessary. That would be a huge benefit to the entire world. 
   I understand that DOE has recognized that there are some problems with NIF, but DOE is working hard to take the necessary steps to correct these issues. Project management has been restructured and has demonstrated over the last six months that it is capable of managing a project of this scope. It has already been determined that the underlying science associated with NIF is sound. 
   Until DOE's investigation is complete, it is premature to cut funding for this program. The cost increases should not override the importance of this project in our goal to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. 
   Any repeal of this funding will cripple the valuable science and knowledge that is coming together from around the world in our effort to maintain the United States nuclear deterrent.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, due to severe budget constraints in the Fiscal Year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations, additional funding has not been made available for the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The President's FY2001 Budget included $3 million for upgrades and enhancements to the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratory under the Basic Energy Science (BES) account. The NSLS facility at Brookhaven, bringing 2,300 scientists annually is used for a whole host of issues, ranging from the first images of the AIDS virus attaching itself to a human cell; landmark progress in understanding the structure of the ribosome, the most complex component in each living cell; pivotal work on the Lyme disease bacterium, leading to a vaccine; and pioneering studies on hepatitis. These additional funds will allow Brookhaven to begin construction of two experimental stations and to hire additional staff members, which are essential in handling the growing demand of this facility. 
   I ask the Senator from Nevada that if additional funds are made available for the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, that the enhancements to the NSLS be added to the current funding for Brookhaven.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill prepared on behalf of myself, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator LAUTENBERG, and Senator TORRICELLI, that would dedicate $53 million and $5 million, respectively, for the Kill van Kull and Arthur Kill channel deepening projects in the Port of New York and New Jersey. These are the amounts that the President's Budget requests for the vital navigation projects. I will withhold from offering the amendment at this time. 
   I would just like to ask the Chairman and ranking Member, who are working hard to stay within their allocations, if they agree that the redevelopment of the Port of New York and New Jersey to accommodate modern container vessels is in the national interest. I would also like to inquire whether they will grant both of these projects priority consideration in the event that additional funds become available under the Army Corps accounts.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to echo the remarks made yesterday by Chairman ROTH and also to concur with my friend and senior colleague from New York, PAT MOYNIHAN, regarding China's compliance, or lack thereof, with the U.S.-China bilateral agreement signed as part of China's admission to the World Trade Organization. 
   I am concerned that after laboriously working out a bilateral trade agreement that addressed myriad economic issues, China seems to be picking and choosing which aspects of the agreement to follow and which to ignore. A prime example is insurance. Under the bilateral agreement signed last November, China agreed to preserve the existing market access currently enjoyed by foreign insurance companies. In other words, under the agreement, a foreign-owned insurance company in China would be able to continue to operate and to add new branches and sub-branches as a wholly-owned company once China entered the WTO. Less than a year after this historic and painstaking agreement was signed, China is unilaterally rewriting the rules and treating these grandfathered companies like new entrants into the China  market. This puts the very companies that invested in China's economic growth at a competitive disadvantage to new entrants. 
   Fundamental to the foundation of the U.S.-China bilateral agreement, to China's ascension into the WTO, and to the possible establishment of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China is the belief that agreements will be honored, not on a piecemeal basis, but fully. This ``interpretation'' by the Chinese government on insurance begins to cast doubts about whether ironclad agreements with China will truly be completely and totally honored. 
   I still intend on supporting PNTR for China, but I am disappointed that China appears to be backsliding on its agreement regarding insurance. I hope that the Chinese leadership will adhere to the agreements signed last year on insurance, and absent that, I hope the Administration continues to apply forceful pressure to see that China keeps its end of the bargain. That is the essence of free, fair and open trade. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from New Mexico and Nevada for making time. I am proud to join with Ms. COLLINS, the Senator from Maine, in offering this amendment. 
   The amendment is a very simple one. It calls for a Presidential commission to study and propose, hopefully, consensus recommendations on how to deal with the impending crisis we have in energy. 
   The crisis is easy to document. U.S. inventories of natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and diesel fuel are all at or near 25-year historic lows. Motorists in my State of New York and throughout the country are paying gasoline prices that are hovering near record highs in absolute terms and are increasing at record levels. 
   The current price of heating oil is higher than consumers typically pay in the dead of winter. Natural gas prices are at twice their typical price and are the highest in history at a time when warm weather keeps demand for natural gas low. 
   We are on the precipice of the most serious, most expensive, and most economically devastating energy crisis since spiraling prices sent our economy into a tailspin in 1976, and, of course, in terms of electricity as well. We have real problems with greater and greater demand and not enough supply. 
   Alan Greenspan said last July that the high price of oil has been putting inflationary pressure on our economy and that any further market impact ``would pose a risk to America's economic outlook.'' 
   With crude oil selling for more than $33 a barrel and natural gas selling for a record nearly $5 per billion cubic feet, we are at the point that Chairman Greenspan warned about. 
   This is on top of a very expensive energy season where American consumers spent more than $75 billion on energy costs over the previous year. 
   Everyone has their own solution to the energy crisis. I have listened to the chairman of the Energy Committee and some on that side who say we should simply pump more oil. And, in the opinion of others, we should do that despite what we do to the environment. 
   I have heard many on this side say we have to do many things to reduce demand, such as raise CAFE standards and include SUVs and minivans under the designation of automobiles and raise the average miles per gallon. 
   I have heard others talk about new types of energy sources and how we need to explore them. Probably every one of the 100 Members in this Chamber, particularly after the last 6 months, has an idea. There is one problem. Our ideas are so fractured and so lacking consensus that we have done nothing. This is not blame on the Democrats or Republicans, on the White House or the Congress. Basically, there is enough blame to go around so that everybody can point a finger. 
   The bottom line is simple: Our demand for energy is increasing. Our supply of energy, particularly domestic supply, is decreasing. Unless we come to some kind of national consensus, the problems we faced last winter with home heating oil and this early summer with gasoline will cause new problems. 
   I have a great deal of respect for the Secretary of Energy. I think he has  done a very good job under trying circumstances. I don't blame him. I don't blame the President. I don't blame the majority leader. I don't blame the chairman of the energy committee. But we have a problem. Thus far, we have been unable to deal with it. 
   The amendment Senator COLLINS and I have offered to the energy and water appropriations bill will create a national energy commission. The energy commission will be established jointly by the President and the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate and will bring together representatives from the energy producing States, energy consuming States, oil and natural gas industries, consumer groups, environmental groups, and experts and analysts in the energy field. It is just the kind of group needed to bring about the consensus we so sorely lack. There may not be a consensus, but I believe we ought to try. 
   I, for one, am dubious of many commissions. In this case it is needed because of the paralysis in Washington in terms of addressing this issue, because of the lack of consensus throughout the land in how to deal with something that at the very least is going to cost Americans a lot more money and at its worst could take our fine economic recovery and send it into a tailspin. 
   The commission was designed by the Senator from Maine and myself to have a broad consensus of parties, branches of government and views and constituencies. It will conduct a study and provide a report to us on the following: the status of inventories of our energy sources; the cause for and consequences of energy supply disruption and energy product shortages nationwide and in particular regions; ways in which the United States can become less dependent on foreign oil supplies; ways in which alternate energy sources can be used to reduce demand on traditional energy sectors; ways in which the U.S. can reduce energy consumption; and ways to improve refinery capacity, utilization, and storage in the United States of natural gas, crude oil, and distillate fuel. 
   The commission shall provide a report within 6 months of enactment that shall include an assessment of our problems and recommendations on how to solve them. 
   In conclusion, last year New Yorkers and New Englanders paid more than $2 a gallon for heating oil. Home owners paid up to $1,000 more to heat their homes in my State, not because of weather but because of shortages. Motorists, people going on vacation, people driving cars and trucks for a living also paid hundreds if not thousands of dollars more out of their pockets this year. 
   As Chairman Greenspan warned, this is one of the few things that looms on the near horizon that could throw our economy off kilter. 
   Let us not get caught unprepared again. This amendment is the start of an energy policy that will protect consumers and protect our economy. 
   I thank the Chair and my colleagues from New Mexico and Nevada for their generosity and most particularly the Senator from Maine who is always a pleasure to work with on these and other issues.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator MCCAIN, to offer an amendment that phases out the Federal sugar program. 
   The current sugar program is one of the last vestiges of a centralized, subsidized U.S. farm sector which has mostly gone by the wayside. This is a special interest program that benefits a handful of sugar barons at the expense of every man, woman and child in America. 
   Several years ago, the GAO estimated that consumers paid $1.4 billion more at the cash register because of the sugar price support. Today, because the world price for sugar is lower and the price paid in the U.S. is higher, the cost to consumers could be twice as high. 
   And, and let's not forget that the sugar support system has already cost America thousands of refinery jobs. Why? Because the sugar program is such a bitter deal, refiners cannot get enough raw cane sugar to remain open. In Brooklyn and in Yonkers, we have lost one-third of our refinery jobs in the last decade. And it has already cost the Everglades hundreds of acres of pristine wilderness. 
   Four years ago, when we came within five votes in the House of terminating the sugar program, the world market price for sugar was about ten cents and the U.S. price about 20 cents. Today the world price is less than a nickel and the U.S. price is almost a quarter. In other words, the gulf between the free market and the sugar program is getting wider. 
   Under any reasonable and rational measure the sugar program should be repealed. If the issue is jobs, the environment or the consumer--then we have no choice but to repeal. Standing with me are liberal, moderate and conservative members of Congress. Standing with us are liberal, moderate and conservative public interest organizations. At all ends of the political spectrum the answer is the same--it's time to repeal the sugar program.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I had the honor and privilege of working with former Representative Floyd H. Flake during my tenure in the House and it gives me great pleasure to join Senator MOYNIHAN and my House colleague Congressman GREG MEEKS in introducing a bill to name a Federal building in Jamaica, Queens, New York, after the man who served that district with the utmost honor and dedication. 
   Floyd was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986 to serve the 6th Congressional District of New York. He served his constituents admirably for 11 years until his retirement in 1997. He is most remembered for his service on the Banking and Financial Services Committee, a committee we served on together. 
   In the House, Floyd distinguished himself as a leader in the fight for the revitalization of urban communities. He worked tirelessly to pass the Community Development Financial Institutions Act of 1993 and to ensure passage of the Community Reinvestment Act. These two acts, along with Floyd's countless other efforts to help urban communities, illustrates his commitment as a true public servant. 
   Since his retirement, Floyd has continued his service to the public. He is currently the Pastor of the Allen A.M.E.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   July 18: 
   Sabino Cornejo, 39, Memphis, TN; Ronald Dowl, 24, New Orleans, LA; Steven Gardner, 45, Miami-Dade County, FL; Gregory Irvin, 17, St. Louis, MO; Willie Love, Detroit, MI; Iddeen Mustafa, 17, Detroit, MI; Phet Phet Phongsanarh, 20, Detroit, MI; Roberto Ramirez, 15, Detroit, MI; Ronald Regaldo, 19, Denver, CO; Lenou Thammavongsa, Detroit, MI; Jorge Vasquez, 18, Dallas, TX; Dawamda Withrow, 20, New Orleans, LA; Unidentified male, 25, Norfolk, VA. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned was Sabino Cornejo, a 39-year-old Memphis man who was a beloved and highly respected member of his community. One year ago today, gunmen burst into his home and ordered him and his family to the floor. Sabino was shot and killed in front of his four children. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The time has come to enact sensible gun legislation. Sabino's death is a reminder to all of us that we need to act now.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment, the Schumer-Biden amendment, cosponsored by Senators BAYH and LANDRIEU, boils down to a simple question. 
   The simple question is this: Would you rather give tax relief to those whose incomes is above $8 million as they pass down their estates or would you like to give tax relief to people who make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year and are struggling to send their children to college? That is the amendment. It is plain and simple. It will determine which side people are on. 
   This estate tax debate is not in a vacuum. There are very simple choices, and this choice is a simple one. 
   Tuition costs, as this chart shows, have gone up more than any other cost--more than health care and certainly more than double the Consumer Price Index. Average families who are very poor get help, as they should, to send their kids to college. Families who are wealthy do not need it. But the middle class struggles. They know that a college education these days is a necessity, but they also know that it is harder and harder to afford. 
   The Schumer-Biden amendment is simple. It says if a family is struggling to send their child to college, the Federal Government ought not take its cut on top of that struggle. The amendment is simple. It says it is more important for America to educate its young people in the best institution available than it is to give tax relief to people who are multimillionaires as they pass on their estates. 
   The Schumer-Biden amendment is simple. It says every time a young man or a young woman does not go to college because they cannot afford it or goes to a college that is not up to their intellectual capabilities simply because they do not have the money to afford tuition, not only does that child lose, not only does that family lose, but America loses as well. 
   This is a crucial amendment. It is about middle-class tax relief. It is about targeted tax cuts for the middle class in what is perhaps their greatest struggle: affording tuition. 
   I make a good salary as a Senator. My wife works as well. We have two beautiful daughters, the rocks of our life, age 15 and 11. We are up late at night trying to figure out how we are going to afford our daughters' college education. Imagine those millions of middle-class Americans who are in a worse predicament. If you make, say, $60,000 because husband and wife work, and you have $20,000 or $25,000 in tuition bills, you are, in effect, poor because after you pay your taxes and your mortgage and all the other expenses, you just cannot afford that college tuition. 
   This amendment is simple. It says which side you are on because we do not have unlimited money. Are you on the side of those multimillionaires who make over $8 million a year as they pass their estates down, or are you on the side of middle-class Americans who are doing what we tell them to do, struggling to send their children to college? 
   From one end of my State to the other, the public is asking us to do something to help them. We know that tax relief should be targeted to the big financial nuts that middle-class people face because they are the ones who struggle the most. The Schumer-Biden amendment does just that. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I beg to differ with my friend from Delaware. 
   This amendment is a simple one. He said the flaw in this amendment is that  the estate tax relief doesn't go up high enough. 
   This amendment is an amendment of choice: Very simply, do you prefer to give the very few wealthy in our society even more tax relief or with those same dollars do you want to help middle-class families pay for the ever-increasing costs of tuition? It is that simple. Does someone making $40,000 or $50,000 a year, who is struggling to send their son and daughter to college, deserve relief first or does someone who has an estate over $8 million deserve relief first? It is that simple. 
   We are in an idea society. We are in a place where a college education is a key to the future. Yet millions and millions of American families cannot afford to send their children to college or they have to send their child to a college that is not up to that child's intellectual ability because the cost is so expensive. The Schumer-Biden amendment says that is the group that needs relief more than those whose estates are over $8 million. 
   The choice is stark and clear. Which side are you on? We don't have unlimited money. Do you support middle-class families sending their kids to college or do you support the wealthy in tax relief? 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I am here to talk about the estate tax and what we ought to do about it. I want to make a couple of points. 
   First, I give the person who named it the ``death'' tax a lot of credit. I don't think this issue would have the velocity it does if it were not called that. At certain times, words somehow convey things. Sometimes they are correct; sometimes they are incorrect. I believe if ``junk'' bonds had been called high-yield bonds, we would have a different economic history. As we have learned, junk bonds play a useful role in the economy. For a while, when they were called ``junk,'' people changed their views. Words have a funny way of working. When we say death tax, people say that sounds horrible. It almost sounds like something from Star Wars. 
   Second, I am not one who says that this is a great thing and we must have it in place. In one particular area I think there is great resonance for eliminating this. That is, that any organic business--a farm, a small business, and frankly a large business--that would have to be broken up because of the extent of the tax should not be. A business is an ongoing organism. It employs sometimes 10 people and sometimes 10,000 people. To have to break that business up to pay any tax, to me, is counterproductive. That is why I have floated a proposal to my colleagues that eliminates this for any ongoing business that is passed down through the family and delays the payment of the tax until that business is broken up, either by the next generation or the generation after that. That makes sense to me. 
   If we were in a world of unlimited dollars, I would be for immediate repeal of the whole thing--not just the family part. But we are not. We have to make choices. That is what this is all about. If you had to make one argument about what the debate concerns, it concerns choice. What are our choices? It has been well documented by many of my colleagues that 98 percent of the American people right now do not pay the estate tax. It has been documented that the amount of income is going up and up and up. You have to be millionaire before you pay that tax. Soon you will have to be--whatever the word is--a ``dual'' millionaire, have at least $2 million before you pay the tax. Only 2 percent of Americans are affected. Of the 2 percent who pay, the very wealthiest, the billionaires, pay a huge proportion of that tax. 
   Do they resent it? I guess they do. I give them credit for having built up their businesses and earned all this money. They say they pay taxes all along; why should they pay it again. By that argument, no one should pay taxes any time. We pay a sales tax. We pay an income tax. We pay corporate taxes. We pay property taxes. They often hit the same people more than once. That is unfortunate. 
   Why do I say this is a choice issue? You have to compare. Since we don't have unlimited money, we have come to a consensus. We ought to buy down the debt and save Social Security which takes the majority of the now projected $4 trillion surplus. What do we do with the rest? I agree with my friend from Wyoming that tax cuts should play a part. We shouldn't have all spending proposals. I believe there ought to be a mix. Once we buy down the debt, we ought to have some tax reduction and some necessary spending proposals. Education and health care and transportation would be my priorities. 
   When we do tax cuts, who do you want to help? What best helps America? I am here to talk about a proposal that I think 95 percent of all Americans would prefer rather than what is being proposed here; that is, to make college tuition tax deductible, particularly for middle-income people. 
   College is a necessity in America these days. We know that. We know the old-time way of a job being handed down from great-grandfather to grandfather to father to son or great-grandmother to grandmother to mother to daughter is gone. We know that only people in America whose income level has actually gone up during this prosperity are those with the college education. So college is a necessity for families, for parents, for individuals. 
   It is a necessity for the individual's well-being, but it is also a necessity for the well-being of America. Because as we move into an ideas economy, we surely will not stay the No. 1 country in the world if we do not have the best educated people. Praise God, so far we do. But that could flow away. 
   One of the main impediments to us staying No. 1 and continuing to have the best educated people in the world is the high cost of college tuition. If you are a family who is solidly in the middle class--let's say you make $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year--you get no help with those tuition bills. If you are poor, we give you a lot of help. We should. I love seeing ladders where poor people can walk their way up and establish themselves in America. If you are rich, you don't need it. You can afford that high college tuition. But if you are a middle-class person, if you are that hard-working majority of Americans right there in the middle--let's say the husband and wife work and let's say their total income is $65,000, $70,000; that is pretty good until the tuition bill hits; until they see they have to pay $10,000 or $15,000 or $20,000 or even $30,000 to send their child to the best possible school--you don't get any help at all. 
   We can. We can next week when we debate the estate tax. I ask my colleagues, where would it be better spent? To help the very wealthy in America not pay the estate tax--again, all things being equal why not--or is it better to help the middle class pay for their children's college? Why, when people struggle to save their $10, $20, $50 every week to pay for college, does Uncle Sam then take a cut when we know that this is good for America? When you send your child to college, you are not only helping that child and your family, you are helping America. You are helping us achieve the best educated labor force in the world. So why, when families struggle, and struggle they do, does Uncle Sam take a tax cut? 
   I make a good salary as a Senator. I have no complaints. God has been good to me and my family. But we have two daughters, beautiful daughters, the love of our lives, 15 and 11. We are up late at night figuring out how we are going to pay for their college education. 
   There are millions of American families whose children do not go to college because it is expensive, too expensive.  There are millions more--I was in Niagara Falls this Monday, 2 days ago. I heard of a family, the Maskas, with seven children. They are trying to send each one to college. A few of them are in college at the same time. But do you know what they had to do? They had to tell one of their young children, even though he was doing very well in school and had good boards, that he had to go to a nearby junior college because they couldn't afford the college he deserved to get into. 
   So it is not only people who can't get into college; it is people who scale down the college they choose because they cannot afford the more expensive schools. Tuition has gone up more than any part of our budget. The cost of health care, from 1980 to 1995--which everyone talks about having a huge amount of increase--went up 175 percent; 250 percent is tuition. 
   The bottom line to all of us in this Chamber is simple. It is not whether we are for or against removing the estate tax in the abstract. It is a choice--choice--choice--choice: Do we take these hundreds of billions of dollars, which I believe I 
   agree with my colleague from Wyoming should be sent back to the people--and send them to the very wealthiest people or do we give some back to the middle class to help educate their children and get them the best college education possible? 
   I daresay the vast majority of voters in every one of the 50 States believes it is better to vote for the proposal that I will make on the estate tax bill. I have done it jointly. I do not know if we will be offering it together, but the proposal was put together by myself, the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. BAYH, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. SMITH. It is bipartisan. I urge my colleagues next week, when the estate tax bill comes to be debated, if it does, to decide the choice. Do we return the money to the wealthiest 2 percent, especially those who do not have ongoing farms or businesses--because we are going to deal with them--or do we send it to the millions of middle-class Americans who are up late at night, worried about whether they can afford to send their children to school, and who right now get virtually no help from Washington? 
   Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Nevada.

   Mr. SCHUMER. In Fiscal Year 2000, Congress provided a 1.2 percent inflationary increase to the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants program, which is distributed through a statutory formula using population and per capita income data. In October of 1999, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released new estimates of per capita income resulting in a drastic change in the funding allocation to states. Under these comprehensive revisions, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, and the District of Columbia lost funding to a level below that of their Fiscal Year 1999 funding. This shift was both unexpected and severe, leaving these states' agencies unable to assist hundreds of physically or mentally disabled men and women needing assistance toward gainful employment. In my own state of New York, we lost $1.6 million from our initially expected amount. 
   Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator HARKIN for committing to add report language during the conference committee negotiations of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 that will enable the Department of Education to give priority status under Fiscal Year 2000 re-allotment funds to States who received less under the formula in Fiscal Year 2000 than in Fiscal Year 1999, and who are able to meet the criteria outlined in Section 110(b)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I support his amendment, and I want to reiterate how important this will be to our State. Because of ISTEA, our State gets a huge amount of money for road building. The Governors make that decision. We are desperately short in terms of help for rail in many parts of our State. In fact, in some of the rural areas they are looking for rail help now which they were not several years ago. 
   As I understand the Senator's amendment, it will simply 
   allow each Governor to make that choice so that in my State of New York, if Governor Pataki decides he has enough, or at least a higher priority than the bottom of the rung in terms of his highway decisions and wants to put some of this money into passenger rail service, he will be allowed to do it. It is simply his decision, no mandate, and will not affect any other State if this amendment is adopted. And that would apply in each of the States; am I correct in assuming that?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Maine for her leadership and her comradeship on this issue. 
   We have been working for a long time. We are not going to rest until something is done. If what we propose is not the right course, come up with some other strategy. But clearly, as the Senator says so correctly, something is not working. 
   The bottom line is simple. Last year, the Senator from Maine and I predicted home heating oil prices would go through the roof. We were told by the Energy Department and others: Oh, no, don't worry. You are being alarmist. 
   Unfortunately, for many of our constituents and millions of Americans in other States, home heating oil prices went through the roof. 
   Then in the early winter, we said: Now, gasoline could go to $2 a gallon this summer if nothing is done. We had studied how much oil OPEC was putting out. We looked at rural demand. We looked at the fact that our former friends, or friends who had always been helpful--Mexico and Norway, non-OPEC Members that expanded the supply of oil--would not help anymore. 
   They said, as the Senator from Maine indicated, let's try some quiet diplomacy. We are not the fount of all wisdom. Why not? 
   On March 27, when the OPEC members met, they said they were going to prevent oil from going to $28 a barrel on the spot market. And if it went over $28 a barrel for more than 30 days, they would release additional oil and bring the price back down. In fact, they set a range, not just a ceiling. There was also a floor, $22 to $28. It was high but within the bounds of being 
   livable for the consumers in our States who, if nothing was done, would pay $1,000 more each year for gasoline and home heating oil. That number is no different than for most of the constituents of my colleagues from other States. 
   If we look at what Chairman Greenspan is doing in raising interest rates, he cites oil pressure on the economy as one of the great problems we face. He said if OPEC will do this on its own, maybe that is a better way. 
   Oil has been above $28 for more than 30 days and the OPEC nations are saying they are not going to do anything. 
   Maybe swapping SPR reserves, as we are urging in the bipartisan letter we are releasing today, signed by about a dozen of our colleagues, as well as ourselves, is not the only way to go, but nobody has presented a better alternative. 
   If we were to release a relatively modest amount of oil from the SPR, prices would come down, the fragile unity that OPEC has shown would be broken, and there would be new cheating on OPEC's part, and the price would come down further.  
   We have 570 million barrels of oil sitting there. If we were to release, say, a million barrels of oil for a 45-day period, it would not deplete the reserve. Figure it out using simple mathematics. It is less than 10 percent of the reserve. Furthermore, because the market is what is called ``backwardized,'' we could actually require that we would lock in a price, that we could buy oil next April at $25 a barrel. It is simple arithmetic. 
   If we sell at $31 and we can buy it back next April by buying futures on the oil market for $25, not only do we achieve our main goal, which is to bring the price of oil back down and help the consumers throughout the country who are paying through the nose for gasoline, we could also actually make some money. The Government, for once, would be behaving as a private business. That is not our goal, but that would be a side benefit. 
   Here we are. Everything that has been said has not worked. Home heating oil did go through the roof. The price of gasoline is, in parts of the country, already above $2 a gallon. The average, as of yesterday, was $1.60-something in the rest of the country. And mark my words, heating oil next year, if we do nothing, will be much higher than it was last winter, 
   when our constituents in the Northeast and Middle West faced unprecedented home heating oil bills. 
   So this resolution--I wish the point of order didn't lie against it; it does--is what is needed. I agree with my friend and colleague from Maine we ought to withdraw it. But make no mistake about it; this policy is the only policy left on the table. To those who say it may not work--which is the only argument left. They first told us it was not legal, but it was, as we proved. They had done it three times before. They told us it was unnecessary. Prices show it is necessary. Now they are saying it may not work. Guess what. It cannot be worse than what is happening now. 
   So I strongly urge my colleagues, if they cannot vote on our resolution because of this point of order, to sign the letter Senator COLLINS and I have authored and continue to make our case that swapping oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the best policy we have to bring the all-too-high cost of energy down and keep our economic prosperity on track. 
   With that, I will yield to the Senator from Maine to conclude.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator SHELBY, and Ranking Member, Senator LAUTENBERG, for their diligence and patience in moving this vital legislation forward. The difficulty of crafting such a comprehensive appropriations bill is considerable and they deserve congratulations. While I plan to vote for this bill, I would like to state my reservations about one particular provision--Section 335--which would preclude the Secretary of Transportation from expending any FY 2001 funds on the completion of a Federal rule pertaining to motor carrier ``Hours of Service.'' As my colleagues prepare for conference with their House counterparts, I hope they will recede to the House on this particular provision. 
   Mr. President, Secretary Slater recently wrote to the Appropriations Subcommittee stating his opposition to such a provision. The Secretary points out, rightly I think, that heavy trucks are a major source of accidents on our roadways. Driver fatigue often plays a major role in these accidents. 
   I feel that since the Department has not yet begun responding to comments on its ``Hours of Service'' Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, it is premature to terminate DOT's review. Highway Safety is one of Congress' foremost transportation priorities, as evinced by the recent creation of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the Israeli soldiers captured by the Syrians during the 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon. 
   On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit in the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. The Syrians succeeded in capturing Sgt. Zachary Baumel, 1st Sgt. Zvi Feldman and Cpt. Yehudah Katz. Upon arrival in Damascus, the crew and their tank were paraded through the streets draped in Syrian and Palestinian Flags. 
   Since that terrible day in 1982, the Israeli and United States Governments have been working to obtain any possible information about the fate of these missing soldiers, joining with the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, and other international bodies. According to the Geneva Convention, the area in Lebanon where the soldiers first disappeared was continually controlled by Syria, therefore deeming it responsible for the treatment of the captured soldiers. To this day, despite the promises made by the Syrian Government and by the PLO, very little information has been forthcoming about the condition of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, and Yehudah Katz. 
   June 11 marks the anniversary of the day these soldiers were reported missing in action. Eighteen pain-filled years have passed since their families have seen their sons, and still the Syrian Government has not revealed their whereabouts. 
   One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen from Brooklyn, NY. An ardent  basketball fan, Zachary began his studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved to Israel with other family members and continued his education at Yeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army service. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his military service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew University, where he had been accepted to study psychology. But fate decreed otherwise, and on June 11, 1982, he disappeared with Zvi Feldman and Yehudah Katz. 
   Zachary's parents Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in their pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have worked closely with the Baumels, as well as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the American Coalition for Missing Israeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. These groups have been at the forefront of their pursuit of justice. I want to recognize their good work and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting their efforts. For eighteen years, these families have been without their children. Answers are long overdue.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding this time and for the leadership on this issue. I also praise my friend from Arizona who has, throughout, been courageous on this issue as on many others, as well as the Senator from Connecticut, whose proposal it is and who has stood as a beacon, in terms of reform. 
   If you wanted to design a corrupting statute that would blow over our body politic, you would come up with a statute like 527. Although it was inadvertently drafted, and was never intended for this purpose, its effect eats at the very core of our Republic.  
   Imagine if someone came to you and said: Let's make political contributions tax deductible, unlimited, and secret. Most people, if they were given that case de novo, would say: What? We could not do that. That would be the most pernicious violation of the kinds of things we stand for in this democracy that one could imagine. 
   Yet that is where we stand today. If this statute is not changed, anyone can give unlimited amounts of money and get tax deductions for them. 
   Organized crime could contribute to a candidate--not to a candidate, but organized crime could contribute to one of these funds, put ads on the air, and dramatically influence elections. Drug dealers, criminals, could set up funds and affect candidacies. Foreign governments, people from afar, could do this, and there would be no way to track them down or find it out. If the American people knew with some degree of precision what is happening with these accounts, these 527 accounts, they would be shocked. Again, if you were to choose a way of corrupting this democracy, you would design a system similar to these accounts. 
   Here we are with the Senators from Arizona, Wisconsin, and Connecticut. Their amendment and mine and others simply says: Don't limit the amount of money--although I would like to do that; don't take away the tax deductibility--although I find it absurd that you should get a tax deduction for this but the person who gives $25 aboveboard to the candidate he or she believes in gets no tax deduction, but a large special interest does and influences an election just as profoundly. But we are not doing that. All we are saying is disclose. 
   I am looking forward to hearing from my colleague from Kentucky. I respect his view on the first amendment, which is, frankly, at least in this area, more absolute than mine, but he put his money where his mouth is when he opposed, for instance, the flag burning amendment. 
   But disclosure does not violate free speech in any way. If it did, all the disclosure regulations that we have should be abolished. Why is it that, for these accounts which benefit politicians and political parties, there should be secrecy, but for any other kind of account there should not? It is clearly not a first amendment argument. 
   Mr. President, today is the 211th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. It is the most farsighted document dedicated to freedom and humanity that has been created. We should consecrate that birthday by cleaning up one part of the campaign finance system that would offend the Founding Fathers. 
   When we see what these accounts do, imagine a Jefferson or a Hamilton or a Madison looking down and saying: These accounts are being defended in the name of the Constitution and of free speech? 
   Just when we think our campaign system could not possibly get any worse, along comes the discovery of this new loophole, section 527. Section 527 is the largest, most disturbing, and most pernicious loophole in a system rife with backdoor ways to influence Government through hidden money. Mark my words, I say to my colleagues, if we do not close this loophole, or at least expose it to the sunlight of disclosure, the 527 accounts will dominate our elections. The so-called hard money will become unimportant. Even the disclosed soft money will become unimportant. All kinds of people, none of whom we would want to see contributing to campaigns and influencing elections, will come above ground. The effects on our democracy will be profound and profoundly disturbing. 
   The upshot of the crazy system we have, done by accident almost, is that any group can spend any amount on ads that anyone can see are designed to sway elections, all without disclosure of any kind. 
   The Judiciary Committee spent months examining whether the Chinese Government improperly funneled money into the 1996 elections. Many of my colleagues on the other side are saying this was improper. If they had used one of these accounts, they never would have known about it, and it would have been perfectly legal. The 527 loophole is an open invitation to foreign governments, or anyone else, to secretly pump as much money as they want into this election. To me, it would be contradictory--no, hypocritical--for those who correctly inveigh against the abuses of the 1996 election not to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona because if my colleagues want to stop foreign government influence and have contributions open and not secret, we must close this loophole. 
   The amendment offered yesterday would end the system of secret expenditures, hidden identities, and sullied elections. It would prevent not only foreign governments but organized crime, money launderers, and drug lords from contributing. 
   When this election is over, the sad fact of the matter is that we will not even know if the Chinese Government sought to influence our elections through 527 accounts unless this amendment is adopted because there is no disclosure at all. All we want to do is let the people see the groups, who is paying the tab, and how the contributions are being spent. 
   The Supreme Court, on this anniversary of the Bill of Rights, has said the right to vote is the most important right we have because in a democracy, the right to vote guarantees all other rights. That basic freedom is tarnished when we prevent the American people from seeing who is trying to influence their vote and how. 
   One of our great jurists, Justice Brandeis, wrote famously that sunlight is the best disinfectant. The bottom line is simple: Do we want to disinfect a system which has become worse each year, or do we want to, under some kind of contrived argument, keep the present system going for someone's own advantage? 
   Finally, I stress this amendment is not an attempt to advance the fortunes of one party or another. It is bipartisan, and it is far more important than that.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator LUGAR, Senator HARKIN, and all the conferees for their hard work in producing a fair final crop insurance package that will provide $100 million in targeted programs for Northeastern farmers who have struggled in recent years, facing low prices and severe damage by drought, flooding, and freezing. 
   Speaking on behalf of the farmers of New York State, I especially thank my esteemed colleague, Senator PAT LEAHY, and his hardworking staff--Ed Barron, J.P. Dowd, and Melody Burkins--for their creativity and persistence in defending the interests of our region which have all too often been neglected in agricultural debates. 
   Back in March, I joined Senators PAT LEAHY, BOB TORRICELLI, and JACK REED in a spirited and successful effort to amend this bill to include, for the first time in the history of crop insurance, funds targeted specifically to help our region. 
   Northeastern farmers have historically low participation in crop insurance for several reasons. Many grow speciality crops that are not eligible for Federal crop insurance, or find that, while they are eligible, the Federal crop insurance programs do not fit their needs. Many are simply not aware of available crop insurance options or have no agents located nearby to sell them policies. 
   The results have often been catastrophic. When a disaster such as last summer's drought strikes, our farmers have no safety net to fall back on, unlike so many of their Midwestern and Southern counterparts. 
   As such, these provisions--a $50 million program to promote risk management practices tailored to Northeastern farmers, $25 million for crop insurance education and recruitment targeted at areas traditionally underserved by crop insurance, and $25 million for research into better crop insurance programs for the Northeast--will go a long way to helping the farmers of New England and the Mid-Atlantic region. 
   Our farmers will especially benefit from the removal of the area trigger for crop insurance policies. This will benefit farmers located in areas isolated by valleys or mountains by allowing them to collect crop insurance for their localized disasters. 
   Further, specialty crop farmers, as so many of the fruit and vegetables growers in New York State, will benefit from the $200 million USDA purchase of speciality crops as directed in the emergency agriculture package attached to this bill.  
   I also echo Senator LEAHY's remarks on our understanding of the Agriculture appropriations bill, which we have been assured will contain several additional critical provisions, particularly the assistance for our Nation's dairy farmers who have suffered terribly from low prices, and for apple farmers who have been hard hit by low yields and low quality after 2 years of unavoidable weather extremes, from hurricanes to drought. 
   I have visited regularly with dairy and apple farmers in my own State and can say they desperately need our help. 
   I thank, once again, the conferees for crafting a bill that for the first time truly takes into account the unique needs of Northeastern farmers. I voted for the package, and I am glad so many of my fellow Senators voted for it as well.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN to introduce legislation that would authorize renovations to the Bronx VA Medical Center's research facility.  
   This facility, when renovations are completed, will serve as a center of excellence for VA research on neurodegenerative diseases that are more prevalent in our veterans population than in any other group of Americans. Specifically, the research would focus on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and brain and spinal cord injury. 
   Major neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's tend to occur later in life and are progressive lifelong afflictions. Some 20 million Americans have been diagnosed with one of these diseases and the costs of their treatment have reached over $100 billion annually. US Census Bureau statistics indicate that because of our aging population, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and the associated human and economic costs will increase four-fold by 2040. Veterans, an aging population are disproportionately affected. Traumatic brain and spinal cord injury are also highly represented in the veterans population. Over 200,000 individuals in the US are living with spinal cord injury today, and another 2 million suffer traumatic brain injury annually. 
   The bill I introduce today would authorize $12.3 million for renovations to an aging facility on the campus of the Bronx VAMC. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers there, are in desperate need of modern, state-of-the-art laboratories to continue efforts to understand, treat and develop new methods of care for all Americans afflicted with these horrible diseases. This legislation represents an important step in ensuring that the quality of care provided to veterans in New York and across the country reflects our highest esteem for those who answered their country's call. We owe our veterans no less than the best medical care anywhere--and the research and treatments that come from this renovated facility will help ensure that happens. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and enacting this critical legislation.

Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago today. Before I read the names, these are names, just letters in black and white, but every one represents a life living and breathing, loving and was loved. Every one leaves a family and friends who will never be the same, as well as the tragedy for all of us that someone is untimely taken from us: 
   Rodney Autry, 30 years old, Dallas, TX; Aaron Baskin, 28 years old, Chicago, IL; Shawn Blake, 24 years old, Detroit, MI; Eddie Espinosa, 17 years old, Miami-Dade County, FL; Keith Gales, 19 years old, Pittsburgh, PA; Rodney J. Graham, 25 years old, Chicago, IL; Gaberiel Herrea, 22 years old, Detroit, MI; Francisco Horta, 33 years old, Miami-Dade County, FL; Eddie JOHNSON, 17 years old, New Orleans, LA; Goodman Jones, 55 years old, Concord, NC; Brian Sentelle Hill, 20 years old, Macon, GA; Harvey Meyers, 23 years old, Philadelphia, PA; Tarvis E. Miller, 25 years old, Chicago, IL; Cleophis Ramsey, 41 years old, Miami-Dade County, FL; Jesus Rodriquez, 22 years old, Houston, TX; Luther Faye SMITH, 45 years old, Tulsa, OK; Thomas Tyler, 20 years old, New Orleans, LA; Frederick Williams, 19 years old, Detroit, MI; Jamal Williams, 18 years old, Philadelphia, PA; unidentified female, 12 years old, Chicago, IL; an unidentified male, 24 years old, Norfolk, VA; an unidentified male, 60 years old, Portland, OR. 
   I hope and pray the reading of these names importunes us to act. Would all of these deaths be prevented with better laws on the books? Maybe not. Would some of them have been prevented with better laws on the books? Most likely. But even if there is a chance that one of the lives I have mentioned might be living, breathing, living under God's sunshine on this Earth, being the kind of person we can all be just by the gift of life, then there is no reason not to act. 
   I hope the understanding that every day, every year, there are names such as these from every part of this country who are killed by gun violence will finally move this body to act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield to myself as much time as I may consume from Senator LEAHY's time on the nomination of Mr. Gerard Lynch to become a district court judge for the Southern District of New York. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-schumer-ny-3-20000523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority leader for coming together on an agreement that allows for a number of vital votes on judicial nominees. I also thank Chairman HATCH for, again, tending to our judicial needs in my State and in so many States, and for the fairness with which he has tried to move this process forward. 
   It is with great pride and pleasure that I rise in support of the nomination of Gerard Lynch to be district court judge for the Southern District of New York. At my recommendation, President Clinton nominated Professor Lynch to fill a vacant Federal judgeship in the Southern District. 
   Professor Lynch's experiences and accomplishments as a prosecutor, as a private lawyer, as a professor of law, and as a public servant make him a superb candidate to be a Federal judge. I have never, in my days, seen such high recommendations from people from all parts of the political spectrum simply about this man's intellect and accomplishments. 
   Professor Lynch's background and career accomplishments are, frankly, staggering. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, a place near and dear to my heart. He then attended Columbia 
   College, where he graduated first in his class--a highly competitive school--followed by Columbia Law School, where he also was No. 1 in his class. 
   After law school, he accepted two judicial clerkships-- first, with one of New York's great jurists, Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the Second Circuit, and then with Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court. He was at the top of the legal profession as he went through his education and his clerkships. You could not have a better record. 
   Since that time, he has had a multifaceted career, mostly as a prosecutor and professor, and that is as impressive as any judicial candidate I have seen in years. 
   Since 1977, he has served as the Paul K. Kellner Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, where he teaches criminal law and criminal procedure, as well as constitutional law and other courses. 
   He is a leading expert on the Federal racketeering laws and has written numerous articles on the subject. He has also published articles on other aspects of criminal law, constitutional theory, and legal ethics. 
   Maybe most importantly, he is considered one of Columbia Law School's outstanding professors, winning a number of awards for excellence in teaching and serving as a guide and mentor to countless students over the years. 
   Professor Lynch, however, has not only been a professor, he also spent many years as a Federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, one of the premier U.S. Attorney's Offices in the country. He tried numerous cases, including white collar and political corruption cases, and eventually rose to be the chief of the appellate division. 
   In 1990, after a stint as a professor, he was asked to return to that office as chief of the Criminal Division under U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier. In that capacity, he supervised more than 135 prosecutors and oversaw all of the office's criminal cases. Mr. Obermaier, a Republican appointee, handpicked Professor Lynch to serve as his lead criminal prosecutor. I know he has been outspoken in support of this nomination, and Mr. Obermaier was known as a hardnosed, rather conservative prosecutor in the Southern District. 
   Professor Lynch has also served as counsel to numerous city, State, and Federal commissions, and has worked with a number of special prosecutors investigating public corruption. Moreover, from 1988 to 1990, he served as a part-time associate counsel for the Office of Independent Counsel. 
   More recently, Professor Lynch has been counsel to a top New York law firm, primarily handling white collar criminal matters and regulatory matters, while still maintaining a full courseload teaching at Columbia. 
   So, intellectually, he is at the top of the list. Experience-wise, he has done it all. He is also a wonderful, wonderful person. He loves Latin and Greek and he knows them well. He loves theater, art, and ballet. 
   Just to let my colleagues know what a fine man he is and what an honorable man he is, when Gerry went to Columbia College, the Vietnam war was waging. He came from a working-class background and he knew that many of his classmates in high school would be drafted. He, by being a college student, was not eligible for the draft, but he thought that was unfair. 
   He thought it was unfair that those lucky enough to get into college should have special advantages over working-class young men being called for the front line. So he refused to pursue an exemption. He was not called. But that shows you the mettle of the man. 
   I will close by admitting that I am very excited about the prospect of Professor Lynch becoming the next member of the Southern District bench. I know his wife and his son are proud of him, and rightfully so. 
   He meets the criteria I have set for myself in choosing judges, which are: 
   No. 1, excellence. There is no doubt; 
   No. 2, moderation. I try to avoid judges who are extreme in either case; 
   And, No. 3, diversity. While Gerard doesn't quite qualify in that, I think I fulfill that in some other nominations. 
   Gerard Lynch has the rare combination of intelligence, practical experience, judicious temperament, fairness, and devotion to hard work that makes for truly great judges. He is just what the Founding Fathers and all others throughout have wanted for a Federal judge. All too many people of his qualification don't ask for and don't aspire to the bench. He does. We should take this opportunity and support him wholeheartedly. 
   I yield to my senior colleague and friend from the State of New York, Senator MOYNIHAN. Is that the proper procedure, Mr. President? Should I yield to Senator MOYNIHAN, or should I yield my time?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield? I am happy to yield to him some of my time. 
   I ask my colleague if he was aware that Professor Lynch is for the death penalty. In fact, he was questioned by Senator THURMOND, on our committee. I will read the question for the RECORD: 
   Do you have any personal objection to the death penalty that would cause you to be reluctant to oppose or uphold the death sentence?  
   And Professor Lynch answered:   
   No, Mr. Chairman.  
   So I submit to my friend that, while Justice Brennan may have had a more broad--I tend to agree with my colleague. I am for the death penalty myself, but I tend to agree with my colleague on that issue. That is not Professor Lynch's philosophy. In fact, when one becomes a Clerk for the Supreme Court, high honor that it is, you are chosen simply on your scholastic ability, not on your ideology. I thank the Senator for yielding and letting me add that to the record.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama for his heartfelt remarks. I understand the passion from which he comes and, while I do not agree with him completely, as those on my judicial panel will tell him, one of the things I always cross-examine them about is, Is this person going to go off and make their own law? Because I do not like that either. As I said, my three watchwords in appointing judges in my first year, and I think I have lived up to them with every nominee, are: Excellence, moderation, and diversity. 
   Let me just say I think Judge Lynch is clearly a moderate and he clearly is not the kind of activist that my good friend from Alabama is saying. In fact, he has criticized Justice Brennan for being ``activist'' in some of his interviews. Judge Posner noted the same about Judge lynch. Judge Posner is someone who probably agrees with the Senator from Alabama more than he agrees with the Senator from New York. 
   But the two quotes there that my friend from Alabama cited are snippets of articles. Two paragraphs later Professor Lynch expostulates further and greatly narrows what he has said here. Let me read a quote from the first article. I think it is important the record have it for the edification of my good friend from Alabama. 
   Admittedly, Professor Lynch is a professor. He has written a lot more than a lot of the other judges and, given as many writings as he has, I guess you could take two paragraphs and say: This man is a judicial activist. 
   If you look at the entire warp and woof of his work, as well as what he actually meant even in the two paragraphs my good friend from Alabama has mentioned, I think the Senator is not correctly stating Professor Lynch's view. 
   I will read a paragraph from the same article from which the previous quote  the Senator from Alabama had mentioned appears. This is what Professor Lynch says a few paragraphs later:  
   It is the text itself that embodies and defines what has been agreed on. What survived the rigorous ratification process to become fundamental law, after all, was not what Madison or Bingham believed in his heart, or even what they said on the floor of the Convention or the House, but rather what was contained in the text of the ratified provision. Thus, the text is not merely evidence from which the mind of the (perhaps partly mythological) lawgiver should be deduced; rather, the text is the definitive expression of what was legislated.  
   I will repeat that again for my colleague from Alabama:  
   ..... the text is the definitive expression of what was legislated.  
   That is hardly the writing of somebody who wants to go far, far afield. As I mentioned, the example my good friend from Alabama keeps hearkening back to is the death penalty and the way Justice Brennan interpreted it. If Professor Lynch agreed with that, I would say the Senator from Alabama had a point, but he explicitly disagrees and has criticized Justice Brennan as being too active. 
   The second quote Senator SESSIONS focuses on, the quote before us on the chart, comes from a tribute to the memory of Justice Brennan that Professor Lynch, who clerked for Justice Brennan after graduating from law school, wrote in 1997. Again, in the context of the whole essay, Professor Lynch's point is noncontroversial. He is writing here about what a judge is to do when the broad language in the Constitution does not speak to a modern-day issue. We are not talking about expanding but interpreting the spirit of the Constitution. 
   I say to my colleague from Alabama, when the fourth amendment speaks of unreasonable searches and seizures and says nothing about wiretaps of telephones or the Internet, it does not mean the judges are unable to interpret what search and seizure means in the context of telephones or wiretaps. That is all Professor Lynch is saying. 
   He is saying judges must look at the text and the values underlying the text and interpret both in light of developments of the present. Do not expand what unreasonable searches and seizures are, rather interpret them in light of new changes in technologies, such as telephones. Otherwise, the Constitution--and I am sure my colleague from Alabama can admit this--would be largely irrelevant to today's legal problems. 
   Moreover, Professor Lynch was asked at his nomination hearing about this article by Senator THURMOND. Here is what he said. His response was unequivocal:  
   I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the starting place in interpreting the Constitution is with the language of the document. As with the legislation passed by the Congress, it is the wording of the Constitution that was ratified by the people and that constitutes the binding contract under which our government is created. 
   In attempting to understand that language, it is most important to look to the original intent of those who wrote it and the context in which it was written.  
   It seems to me, and I did not realize it until I read this paragraph again, those are the exact words my good friend from Alabama mentioned as his views of what the Constitution is all about: Not some document that expands at the whim, wishes, or ideology of the judge but rather a written contract, words, black and white with the American people. Judge Lynch--I do not want 
   to presume anything here, particularly in this Chamber--Professor Lynch makes, in fact, the same point that my good friend from Alabama did.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank Senator LEAHY in absentia for allowing me to do that. I hope he is not upset. 
   It is certainly the prerogative of my good friend from Alabama to interpret snatches of text from book reviews and tributes to conclude that maybe Professor Lynch has a judicial philosophy with which he disagrees, but this is the definitive and current statement on the issue by the nominee, and I think it prevails. 
   In conclusion, if Professor Lynch is confirmed, I believe Senator SESSIONS and I--and I have enjoyed working with him on so many issues--will look back 5 or 10 years and both approve of the work Judge Lynch has done, admire his faithfulness to the words of a document we both regard as sacred--and I believe he does as well--the Constitution, a document we are all sworn to uphold. I yield back any time and thank my colleague for the dialog and for making us think and explore as he always does.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for yielding the time and the Senator from California for, as always, her intelligent and heartfelt remarks. She is able to combine both, intelligence and direct from the heart, and it is great to listen to her. 
   I rise in support of the Daschle amendment. Let me make a couple of points here. I do not think we should even have to be debating whether to close the gun show loophole or these other modest measures because we all know they are the right thing to do. We all know they have the overwhelming support of the American people. We all know it is a small group of people--heartfelt, truly concerned--who hold this place in logjam on the issue of guns. 
   Not to close the gun show loophole? Not to have a Brady check every time a gun is passed from one hand to another? I go around my State and I ask gun owners: Has the Brady law interfered with your right to bear arms? Not one person says yes. If it does not interfere when you go to a gun shop, why will it interfere when you go to a gun show? 
   I had wanted to have a colloquy with my friend from New Hampshire, but he is not here now. But he is talking, with great erudition and great passion, about the Founding Fathers and what they had put in the Bill of Rights, a document we both revere. ``Revere'' is almost the right word. It is almost a godly document. 
   I would have liked to have asked him if he believes the second amendment is absolute. Nobody much does. I believe in the first amendment. I believe strongly in the first amendment. Blood is shed for it. But when Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes said you can't scream fire in a crowded theater, he was putting a limit on the first amendment. 
   We put limits on every amendment. What some of my colleagues seem to fail to realize is, the one amendment on which they do not want to put any limits is the second amendment. I am not one of those who belittles the second amendment. I think there is a fair argument that it deals with individuals bearing arms as opposed to just militias. But I just as strongly believe that reasonable limits can be placed on the second amendment the way we place them on the first. 
   Freedom of religion is sacrosanct, as it should be. But you can't avoid taxes because you say it is your religion. You can't avoid service in the Army--you can modify it but not avoid it--because you say it is against your religion. Why is it that the only amendment we hear from the other side should not have any modification whatsoever--even a modest modification such as the Brady law applying at a gun show--is the second amendment? I argue it is a misreading of the Constitution. 
   I argue to some of my friends on the left, when we demean the second amendment, we are not playing fair because it was put there in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers and by the Thirteen Original States just as the other nine were in the Bill of Rights. But I would argue with my friends from the other side of the aisle that when they say it is an absolute right, as they seem to be saying today because these changes are so modest, they are just as wrong as the people they oppose on the 
   left who demean the second amendment or who want to repeal it. 
   I would like to make one other point. The second-degree amendment by, I believe it is the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. LOTT, talks about enforcement. Again, I challenge my colleagues to put their money where their mouth is. I believe in enforcement. I try not to let ideological barriers get in the way. I have stood shoulder to shoulder with NRA members in New York State as we have implemented Operation Exile in Buffalo, in Rochester, in Syracuse, in Albany, and it has worked. It is an enforcement proceeding, and it works. But in so many other enforcement areas we get no help. In this resolution, No. 7 says it is a Federal crime for any person to knowingly make a false statement in an attempted purchase of a firearm. It is a Federal crime for convicted felons to purchase a firearm. Then it goes on to say that 500,000 people have tried to buy firearms at gun shops and very few have been arrested. 
   Do you know why very few have been arrested? Because of amendments supported by people on the other side that do not let an ATF agent stand inside a gun shop; because of amendments supported by the other side that the records must be destroyed; because there is actually a law on the books that says there can only be one unannounced visit on a gun shop a year. 
   You want enforcement? I would love to have enforcement. I am a tough-on-crime guy. I am for throwing the book at these folks who use guns in crimes and who have guns illegally. But you cannot enforce the law if you are going to put obstacles in the way. 
   We found out by a survey done by my staff that only a small number of these gun shops sell most of the crime guns. Fewer than 1 percent of the gun shops sell 50 percent of the crime guns. So if the ATF were given permission by this body to enforce the law, you could shut down those few bad gun shops and let the others flourish. I welcome the opportunity to work with the Senator from Idaho, the Senator from Montana, and the Senator from New Hampshire on an enforcement bill that would do the things we have to do. I welcome that opportunity. Enforcement is a good idea. 
   But as the Senator from California said, we can do both. One is not a substitute for the other. Enforcing the law is not a substitute for closing the gun show loophole. The two are not contradictory in intellectual concept or in implementation. I think it is somewhat disingenuous to put the two in contraposition, one to the other. 
   I thank the Senator for the time she has yielded.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I would have objected, but I spoke to our minority leader and I follow his leadership. I cannot state how strongly I feel about the inability to have open debate in the Senate. I simply say, with all due respect to the majority leader, a man I respect and admire, the feelings on this side, and our inability to debate issues we think are important--whether they be gun control or education--are reaching the boiling point. I fear if we are throttled any further, the whole order and comity of this body will break down. 
   I plead with the majority leader that we think of a better way to do things than close down debate on issues some Members think are vitally important to debate. I say that with great respect and love for this institution.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 1 minute. I hope I am not too succinct. 
   The bottom line is simple: Why, for the first time in 16 years, are sense-of-the-Senate resolutions being refused? Because the other side does not want to vote on guns. 
   Why, for the first time, is ESEA not being debated fully? Because the other side doesn't want to vote on guns. 
   Guns is the issue--not the efficiency of the Senate. 
   I think it is a shame. Eighty percent of the American people want commonsense gun legislation. The Republican majority is afraid to vote on it and instead twists the rules, the procedures, and the beauty of this body in a knot because they do not want to vote on guns. 
   The issue is not about moving the Senate efficiently; the issue is the fear of voting on guns, plain and simple. I regret the inability of the other side to have the courage of their convictions to vote the way they feel and let our side vote the way we feel.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for yielding. I thank him for not only his generosity in yielding time but for his leadership this year and last year on this issue, and in the 18 years he has been in the Senate. We will really miss him in many ways as he goes on to other things, but one of the most important reasons we will miss him is as the leader in this fight to bring sensibility and rationality to gun laws. 
   I hope we will pass the resolution the Senator from New Jersey is offering and that it will not be blocked. I hope people will let us vote because we are voting in the shadow of a momentous movement that is taking place in America. 
   I have been fighting in the Congress for gun control for 20 years. I have seen the various ebbs and flows in public opinion on guns. I have seen modest gun control measures, such as this one, bottled up in committee and picked to death by those who do the NRA's bidding. I was on the front lines when we scratched and clawed our way through a few victories such as Brady and the assault weapons ban. 
   We are on this floor now because the world changes on Mother's Day. On Mother's Day, the political landscape will undergo a seismic shock. There is a classic sign in the movie ``Network'' where a TV commentator shouts, ``I am mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.'' And that leads to a spontaneous reaction where families heave their TV set out the window. 
   That is what the Million Mom March is. It is a spontaneous assemblage of ordinary citizens who are not going to take it anymore. It is bigger, more passionate, and more widespread than any movement we have seen in years. It is a movement more 
   powerful and more numerous than any of us could ever have hoped. 
   When the mothers of this Nation gather on Constitution Avenue, their collective footsteps will sound like a shot heard around the world. They are not going to put up with lame excuses from Congress about why the Lautenberg amendment is bottled up. They are not going to put up with any more reasons about why we can't pass the most basic, commonsense gun measures. 
   Let me say to George Bush, and anyone else who is standing in the way of closing the gun show loophole, that our mothers are watching. On Mother's Day, the mothers of this Nation will give us the gift of common sense. There is a new force in the country today and its name is Mom. Today we are simply giving this body a chance to not make Mom too angry. 
   I thank the Senator and yield any time I have not used to the Senator from New Jersey.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Saul B. Katz; an outstanding member of the New York health care community. 
   Mr. Katz has the distinction of serving as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the North Shore--Long Island Jewish Health System. After serving in various leadership capacities within the health system for over a decade, Mr. Katz lead the development of a system that now includes 13 hospitals, 2 skilled nursing centers and numerous ambulatory programs which span across the New York Metropolitan area. 
   As Co-founder, President and Chief Operating Officer of Sterling Equities, Inc., a diversified investment and operating company, Mr. Katz was a member of the governing Board of the Community Hospital of Glen Cove, which became North Shore University Hospital at Glen Cove in 1989. Mr. Katz served as the First Vice President of the Board of Trustees, as well as a member of the Finance, Planning, Development and Building committees. 
   In addition, Mr. Katz serves as a Director, Trustee and Member of numerous trade and charitable organizations including the Jewish Association for Services for the Aging, the Brooklyn College Foundation and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. 
   The Katz family is a close-knit one. Saul and his wife Iris have enjoyed 40 years of marriage and spend as much time as they can with their grown children and their spouses: Heather Katz Knopf and Dan Knopf, Natalie Katz D'Amore and Al D'Amore and David Katz. Iris and Saul recently celebrated the arrival of their first grandchild Carly Frances Knopf. 
   The North Shore--Long Island Health System will certainly miss the exemplary leadership that Mr. Katz provided all these years and I applaud the significant improvements he has made to the state of health care in the New York Metropolitan area. 
   Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr. Katz on his retirement from the Board and wish him and his family well in his golden years.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will use 5 minutes and then yield to my senior colleague from New York for 5 minutes. 
   It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. As you know, His Eminence was a man of immense honor and conviction, a man who dedicated his entire life in service to our Nation and the betterment of humanity. He was completely loyal to Catholic doctrine but was able to reach out to New Yorkers of all races, religions, and ethnic and economic backgrounds. His loss is New York's loss, America's loss, and humankind's loss. 
   Today, all New Yorkers mourn this profound loss. And while today will be one filled with great sorrow, I believe that during this period of grief, many will find moments of joyous reflection in thinking about the innumerable ways this servant of God was able to touch the lives of millions. 
   Earlier this year, I rose alongside a number of my colleagues in the Senate and called upon this body to support legislation to honor the enormous contributions made by the Cardinal to religion, humanity, and service to America, by bestowing upon him the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   The measure passed unanimously, and I had the honor to personally present His Eminence with a framed copy of that legislation, and although he was weakened, you could see a man of peace. He believed he had accomplished much of his life's goal and was proud of what he had done, although in his own modest way. It is my prayer that all of us, when our time comes, may feel just that way. 
   The Cardinal cared about the poor, the sick, and the elderly. He would be giving a speech on Catholic doctrine at the cathedral one hour and the next hour would quietly slip off and minister to an AIDS victim in a hospice. He was a man of great intelligence and of great passion. He was a man who believed and didn't flinch from those beliefs but at the same time had a unique ability to reach out to others who might not believe what he did. He served, of course, as a military chaplain and at the same time was a voice for the poor. He cared about working people and spoke up for the union movement repeatedly. 
   He loved all of God's children, and he will be forever cherished and remembered by people of the Jewish community for bringing Jews and Catholics closer together. I truly believe that much of the Vatican's rapprochement with the Jewish community worldwide started with His Eminence Cardinal O'Connor. 
   He served as an international ambassador, traveling the world over, to: Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Russia, as a messenger of peace, humanity, and freedom. Wherever war, oppression, and poverty have threatened to weaken the human spirit, he has been there--a tireless servant of the Roman Catholic Church and as an American citizen. 
   John Cardinal O'Connor was an institution in New York, a beacon of hope and inspiration who, from our cherished St. Patrick's Cathedral championed the simplest of causes--the betterment of humanity. He was a man that I respected a great deal because of his unwavering commitment to his convictions, even when we disagreed. 
   So, last night, Mr. President, New York, America, and the entire world lost one of our greatest treasures. This morning, the earthly world is a bit poorer for the passing of this great man and the heavenly world a bit richer. I thank you and my colleagues for allowing me to express, on behalf of all New Yorkers, the profound sense of sorrow we feel today with the loss of Cardinal O'Connor. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the senior Senator from New York.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few brief remarks to underscore several of the points that my colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, made when he introduced the ``Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000,'' a bill I gladly cosponsored. 
   The first point is that Governors Island is truly a national treasure. It has played a significant role in nearly every American battle from the Revolution through World War II. During the War of 1812, it is credited with preventing a direct British attack on the City of New York--then the Nation's principal seaport. It served as the Union's foremost recruiting depot and as a Confederate prison during the Civil War. 
   The second point, Mr. President, is that its historical structures have been placed in no small degree of danger by the statutorily mandated Fiscal Year 2002 sale date. If the Island should be sold then ``at fair market value,'' there simply is no guarantee the Castle Williams, Fort Jay, Building 400--a McKim, Meade & White masterpiece thought to be the largest single Army barrack ever constructed, the 1708 Governor's house, and the entire Governors Island National Historic Landmark District will be protected. When the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was being negotiated, Congress faced seemingly intractable, structural deficits. We had to make a great many difficult and, if I may, extreme choices to bring the Federal budget into balance. Three years later, our circumstances are quite different. Fiscal austerity has paid its dividends and we are approaching an era of surpluses much sooner that we might have otherwise imagined. Should we still be proposing to sell off such an important piece of American history? 
   Finally, Mr. President, my colleague mentioned the issue of fairness. New York gave Governors Island to the national government in 1800. No complaints. The British and the French were then poised to attack our young nation. Now the Federal government has no use for Governors Island--the Coast Guard found it too expensive to maintain--it is only right that the people of New York get their property back. The Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000 will do just that. In addition, it will establish the Governors Island National Monument which will provide all Americans--for the first time--with the opportunity to learn of the Island's rich contributions to American history while experiencing the spectacular views of New York Harbor from this idyllic setting. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for their unanimous support of S. 2370, a bill to name the stunning Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street in Manhattan after Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, the champion of this project and an esteemed Member of this body. I also rise to honor Senator MOYNIHAN, who against the wishes of his fellow New Yorkers, myself included, plans to retire at the end of this year. I honor PAT MOYNIHAN for all he has accomplished throughout his 47-year career in public service as legislator, scholar, reformer, teacher, and last, but definitely not least, builder. 
   It is especially for his role as builder that we honor him today. The Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street embodies the same spirit as Senator MOYNIHAN's previous architectural endeavors--an extraordinary work of art, inside and out. Completed in 1994, the Courthouse was designed by the distinguished architectural firm of Kohn Pederson Fox with a dignity worthy of the weighty judicial matters considered within its walls. It is a magnificent structure of solid granite, marble, and sturdy oak, built to last 200 years, adorned with public art from notable contemporary artists Ray Kaskey and Maya Lin. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has always been an important force for architecture in New York. He was responsible for the restoration of the spectacular Beaux-Arts Custom House at Bowling Green in 
   Lower Manhattan and beloved in Buffalo for reawakening that city's appreciation for its architectural heritage, which includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and the Prudential Building, one of the best-known early American skyscrapers by the architect Louis H. Sullivan--a building which MOYNIHAN helped restore and then chose as his Buffalo office. MOYNIHAN has also spurred a powerful popular movement in Buffalo to build a new signature Peace Bridge over the Niagara River. 
   But the project for which he is best known is his beloved Pennsylvania Station. In 1963, PAT MOYNIHAN was one of a group of prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our City's spectacular Penn Station--a glorious public building designed by the nation's premier architectural firm of the time, McKim, Mead & White. 
   It was PAT MOYNIHAN who recognized years ago that across the street from what is now a dingy basement terminal that functions--barely--as New York City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office Building, built by the same architects, in much the same grand design, as the old Penn Station. MOYNIHAN recognized that we could use the Farley Building to once again create a train station worthy of our great City. I had offered a bill last year to name that new train station after him, but Senator MOYNIHAN, with characteristic modesty, asked that the station keep the Farley name. And I, with characteristic persistence, introduced another bill to name the new Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street after him. 
   Not coincidentally, the Courthouse's presence and elegance befit Senator MOYNIHAN, who was most responsible for its creation. Senator MOYNIHAN toiled for nearly a decade prodding the Congress, General Services Administration, three New York City mayors, and anyone else he needed, to see this spectacular Courthouse built. The Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street will serve as a fitting tribute and provide an enduring monument in the heart of the City that PAT MOYNIHAN and I both love so dearly, a monument for the millions of New Yorkers and their fellow Americans who love and admire Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to denounce--in the strongest terms possible--the sham trial of 13 Jews in Iran accused of espionage. And I want to thank my colleagues for voting unanimously for a Concurrent Resolution urging President Clinton to condemn this mockery of justice and violation of fundamental human rights, and make clear to Iran that the United States and the world is watching the fate of these men very closely. 
   Leaders in Tehran must know that the treatment of the Jews on trial will go far in determining the nature of Iran's relations with the U.S., and its standing in the community of nations. 
   The 13 Iranian Jews, mostly community and religious leaders in the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested more than a year ago by the Iranian authorities and accused of spying for the U.S. and Israel. These espionage charges are, of course, preposterous. 
   Indeed, how could they be true? Jews in Iran are prohibited from holding any positions that would grant them access to state secrets or sensitive materials. And most of these men live hundreds of miles from Tehran. 
   This mockery of truth and justice reached new lows this week. After a year in prison--isolated, no contact with family or friends, no contact with even a lawyer--three of these men were dragged from the darkness of one of Iran's harshest prisons and stuck in front of cameras to publicly ``confess'' to their charges. 
   No-one is fooled. In fact, the world is appalled. 
   These men were presumed guilty before their trials even began. That's because they are in the hands of the hard-line Clerics in Iran, who run the Revolutionary Courts. And, as we know, In Iran, the Clerics are never wrong. 
   This is an Inquisition, not a trial. 
   What we are really witnessing is a high-stakes attempt at a bait and switch. After forcing confessions to capital crimes, the Revolutionary Court judge--who, by the way, also serves as prosecutor, chief investigator, and jury--may dole out ``light'' sentences on the 13 men, to show how ``forgiving'' the Clerics are. 
   Our Resolution makes it perfectly clear that these innocent men should not be used as pawns in a shifty battle of egos in Iran. They should be released immediately. 
   The case of the 13 Jews is showing the world how far Iran needs to go before they may even begin to expect to be welcomed into the community of nations. 
   That is why countless nations and all leading international human rights organizations have expressed their concern for the 13 Iranian Jews, and have denounced the abuse of their fundamental human rights. 
   The United States recently presented Iran with goodwill overtures, such as lifting restrictions on many Iranian imports and easing travel restrictions between our two countries. We learned this week that goodwill gestures are meaningless. 
   Truth be told, Iran has continued to display nothing but hostility and contempt for the United States and everything for which we stand. 
   At a minimum, Iran must show signs of respecting human rights as a prerequisite for our improving relations with them. I am pleased that Secretary of State Albright has identified the case of the 13 Jews in Iran as ``one of the barometers of United States-Iran relations.'' 
   The same standards should hold true for international financial institutions. Iran's quest for $130 million from the World Bank must not be taken seriously unless and until Iran begins to show a basic understanding of basic rules of justice. 
   Much has been made of President Mohammad Khatami's popular reform movement, and there is significant optimism that a kinder, gentler Iran is slowly emerging from the darkness of a 20-year hardline clerical dictatorship. Indeed, Khatami has received a huge mandate from the people of Iran over the past four years. 
   However, Iran must fully understand that normalized relations with the United States is only a pipedream if persecution such as that enacted upon the 13 Jews accused of spying goes unchallenged. If it does not, then what kind of reform movement are we really witnessing? 
   Colleagues, I thank you for supporting this Resolution urging the President to use all his resources to convince President Khatami that this farcical trial leading to a pre-ordained outcome will send US-Iran relations back to ground zero. Three of these men have already been tried and convicted without a shred of evidence. There are 10 more left to go. They should not spend one more day in prison. They should be released right now. 
   Today, the voice of the United States Senate has spoken. And we have said unanimously: ``Iran, the world is watching.''

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington not only for yielding the time but for her leadership on this issue. I am so proud of the package that she and the Senator from Massachusetts have put together under the sponsorship of our minority leader, the Senator from South Dakota. 
   I think this debate is one of the most important debates we will have on the floor of the Senate. It is the issue of education about which we probably need to do the most. America is in very good shape overall, but the greatest trouble spot on the horizon is the fact our educational system is not up to snuff. You can't be the No. 1 economy with the No. 15 educational system in the world. 
   This debate presents two stark choices. The Republican bill, S. 2, basically revolves--and I use the word advisedly--around block grants, vouchers, and an alternative approach, which I am proud to have worked on with my colleagues on this side of the aisle. Again, I want to particularly salute my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague from Washington for their leadership, as well as my colleagues from New Mexico, Iowa, and Connecticut, who worked on this so diligently. 
   The block grant approach is a two-way street of folly. From the congressional standpoint, it is an abdication of responsibility. We send blank checks to the State and wash our 
   hands of the educational crisis. Waste always accompanies block grants. We learned this in area after area when we gave the money to local politicians who had not done a good job. It is also enthusiastically contradictory. My colleagues on the other side say our system isn't good enough. It has been in the control of local school boards. 
   What are we doing? We are giving more money to local school boards, no strings attached. 
   If you think our educational situation is in great shape and needs a little more money, you do a block grant. I, for one, don't think just giving a little bit more money to the status quo is going to improve our system. Block grants are an abdication of our responsibility to set national goals and figure out what programs work. When we separate the taxing authority from the spending authority, as in a block grant, unless you have some restrictions, it is a formula for waste because it is free money. 
   I am utterly amazed my conservative friends on that side of the aisle are for a fundamentally profligate concept--free money, no taxing authority, no strings attached, do what you want. 
   The issue is not the Federal Government dictating in a block grant because we are not dictating. If you don't  want the money, you don't have to take it. If you don't want to improve teacher quality, don't take the money. I agree with some on the other side that we have had too many mandates. But we are not mandating here. There is not a mandate at all. 
   To say the National Government, which has the responsibility of leading us into the 21st century, should not set any goals--and again, give money to the very local districts we are criticizing for not doing a good enough job--no strings attached, to me is utterly devoid of reason. 
   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and some on this side of the aisle to examine the principle of block grant. Don't let your anger at Federal control, which in some cases, in my judgment, is justified, mar your ability to see that a block grant makes no sense. It is an abdication of accountability. 
   My colleagues have talked very well about the 5 years of complete freedom to do what you want. The result is flawed because States only have to demonstrate statewide performance, effectively allowing States to ignore failing schools. We focus on a few schools that excel and bolster the State average. 
   Under this proposal, States could use Federal funds for any educational purpose under State law. As we discussed during yesterday's debate, what was then a title I State block grant of 1965, studies demonstrate educational purposes can be band uniforms, swimming pools, sewage disposal. I talked about that last night and won't go through those arguments again. 
   If my colleagues like block grants, they would be better off going by conservative principles and not having the block grant but reducing taxes by that amount. I, for one, don't like separating the taxing authority from the spending authority. That is as conservative a principle as we are going to get. 
   Fortunately, we don't have to go down the path of a block grant. The Democratic alternative targets scarce Federal dollars to the Nation's most important priorities: Teacher quality, high standards for our children, accountability for students in school performance, safe and modernized schools, 
   smaller class size, technology, and parental involvement. Under our proposal, schools would be required to ensure that all students meet or exceed State proficiency standards within 10 years. We prevent States from masking an achievement gap by requiring schools to determine academic progress by using disaggregated student performance data. 
   Under our proposal, we build 6,000 new centers, giving 1.6 million school-age children access to before-school and after-school programs. Under our proposal--this is the part I will dwell on because the Senator from Massachusetts has enabled me to play a little bit of a role in this, along with the other proposals--we recognize the urgent and vital need to have a qualified teacher in every classroom. We guarantee funds to communities to recruit qualified teachers. That is the greatest crisis, in my judgment, that education faces. 
   Last night, I mentioned on the floor more than half the teachers will retire in the next 15 years. For math and science, even in affluent districts, we have a great deal of trouble finding teachers now. If we could only accomplish one thing, if we could make only one change to our schools to raise quality, in my judgment, it would be to improve the quality of our teachers, make the teaching profession more attractive to young people and mid-career professionals alike. 
   In the past, we were able to attract teachers of high quality because we had set cohorts of people who went into teaching. Depression babies in the 1930s and 1940s wanted a secure, if not a well-paying job; women in the 1950s and 1960s who had no other opportunities, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, my generation, had young men who went into teaching because they were given draft preference. 
   Today, however, to choose to teach is to choose to sacrifice, at least economically, as fulfilling a job as teaching is. Teacher salaries could not compare with other possible options facing college graduates. Over the past 4 years, salary offers for college graduates in all fields have grown at twice the rate of those for new teachers. Computer programming, $44,000; accounting, $37,000--these are starting salaries--market research, $34,000; a paralegal, $45,000; teaching, $26,769. 
   For the millions of young men and women who would consider the idealistic profession of teaching young people--I have done it, not as a professional, but when I have been invited as an elected professional to teach eighth grade social studies in Cunningham Junior High school or 12th grade American History in Madison. 
   Just one other point on the teacher crisis. We face a teacher shortage of 750,000 teachers. One-third of the Nation's teachers are eligible to retire in the next 5 years. The largest number of teachers is about 49 years old through 55 years old. We desperately need new teachers. 
   I have been working on a program, which is included in this alternative, to address the shortage and quality concerns through a teacher scholarship program: Inviting New Scholars to Participate In Renewing Education, called INSPIRE, a brilliant work of an acronym by my staff. 
   Under this proposal, the federal government would pay 80 percent of the costs of awarding annual INSPIRE scholarships to highly qualified high school seniors, undergraduate students and college graduates/mid careers interested in committing to teach. 
   In exchange for having educational expenses (either college, graduate school or an alternative certification program) paid for, awardees would commit to obtain teacher licensing and agree to teach in a ``high need'' area--those regions with high poverty and a high number of uncertified teachers. 
   My proposal would require new teachers to have an academic or work related concentration in the subject in which they intend to teach. When so much is riding on a teacher's ability and mastery, it is unacceptable that one-fourth of the math and science teachers in 1998 had not majored in the field they were teaching. 
   The deal would be one year for every $5,000 in assistance received. The awards would not exceed $20,000 and a portion of the scholarships would be reserved for shortage subject areas, such as math, science and special education. The total federal contribution would be $500 million over five years. 
   Some states are already leading the way; Massachusetts runs a Tomorrow Teachers Scholarship Program, Mississippi supports a Critical Needs Scholarship Program. States are innovating in a time of great need. Federal dollars should be used to replicate this on a broader scale. 
   In addition, my amendment also provides local districts money to set up mentoring programs for new teachers. $250 million over five years to ensure that the best local teachers will be trained to evaluate and guide new teachers during their first critical years in the classroom. 
   We want to attract qualified, motivated, committed new teachers and provide them the resources to stay teaching. 
   Currently, only 12 states pay veteran teachers to be mentors. We've just got to do better than that. 
   So, the choice seems to me to be simple. Do we provide federal dollars to do the hard work of ensuring quality, standards, accountability? Or do we just walk away? I think the answer is just as simple.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words as we embark on debating ESEA. I hope not to be very long. First, I am glad we are debating this bill, because education is such an important issue to America as we move into the 21st century. We have moved into an economy that is based on ideas. Alan Greenspan put it best. He said that high value is added no longer by moving things--when you make a car with moving things, such as putting in a carburetor here or brakes there--but, rather, by thinking things. All the new technology, such as the Internet, information systems, allow an idea to be transported quickly and inexpensively, which gives ideas so much more power. 
   In that kind of society, we can't afford to have an educational system that is even second. As we all know, our education system, at least elementary and secondary, isn't even in the top 10. If we want to stay the leading economic power of the world, which I think we all do, we have to make our educational system better. 
   In the past, the Federal Government has stayed away from education. I argue that there is a national imperative for us to be more involved, not to dictate to the localities what they have to do--that has been a mistake this Government has entered into far too much in the past--but certainly to help and aid in education. 
   I note that education in America is funded by the property tax, by and large. That is the least popular tax in America, and it puts a real cap on what can be done. Education is done locally, and so there isn't too much ability, when you have thousands and thousands of school districts, to have people think beyond the day-to-day need of providing teaching and other educational services in schools. 
   The need of the Federal Government to be involved with resources and just as important, if not more important, taking ideas and helping spread them, ideas that have worked in one corner of the country but don't spread to the rest of the country because it is not a capitalistic system--usually we spread ideas because somebody makes money by doing that, but that doesn't happen in public education--is vital. 
   So when the Federal Government says we should have higher standards, that is a good thing. I believe and I agree with those who believe in higher standards. I don't believe in social promotion. If you are reading at a third-grade level, you should not be in the seventh grade. I agree with my conservative friends in that regard. But I think my more liberal friends are right in that we have to help keep the bar high, and conservatives are right about that, but we ought to help people get over that bar. If education were completely left up to each locality, that probably would not happen. The bar would not be set high enough and the effort to help people get over the bar might not be forthcoming. So, in my judgment at least, we need more Federal involvement. I think the American people share that judgment. From the data I have seen, that is pretty clear. 
   Another problem we face is that our system is probably going to be under more stress, not less, in the future. The number of people enrolled is expected to increase by 11 percent. The schools age; the same exact school was in better shape in 1990 than in the year 2000. I have recently visited school districts, fairly affluent ones, on Long Island where the facilities were simply a mess. They had been built during the baby boom in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, and, quite frankly, even those rather affluent districts didn't have the money to fix the schools. They were sort of a mess; they were not great places to look at. Paint was peeling from some of the ceilings. 
   Most importantly an area I have chosen to focus on, which we will talk a little bit about, is the fact that we are going to have a crisis in teaching. We don't today, but we will in the next 5 or 10 years because so many of our teachers are over 50 years old and they are going to retire. Quite frankly, many of the new teachers who take their place are not up to speed, or at least not of the same quality as the old teachers. 
   When we have a starting salary of $26,000, which we do for teachers in America, and the private sector can pay double that, particularly in certain areas such as math and science and technology, we are not going to be getting the best. 
   In the past, we had captive audiences with cohorts of groups who would teach in the 1930s and 1940s. There were lots of Depression babies. ``Go get a civil service job so you will never risk that horrible feeling of being unemployed and unable to provide for your family.'' In the 1950s and 1960s, women taught; they didn't have other opportunities. 
   I had so many great teachers when I went through New York public schools. 
   The last cohort which is now retiring in large numbers is my generation--I am 49--the Vietnam war generation, as you may recall. Young men were given a draft exemption if they taught and hundreds of thousands did. They made very fine teachers. But we don't have those captive audiences, so we have a crisis in having quality teaching. 
   I will be talking more about that when we do our Democratic amendment. I am happy to have the Inspired Scholarship Program as part of it. We will talk, hopefully, about other amendments that are on this floor, including some of mine which would allow teachers, if they taught for 5 years, to forgo repaying their student loans--we would provide a test in math and science--to give teachers a $4,000-a-year stipend so they would continue teaching. We have some true excellence. I will be talking about all of those later. 
   What I would like to talk about now is just two things, one on this bill. I truly pray that the majority leader will not cut off debate quickly. We have debated education. We debate it only once every 5 years. The last time we did I believe was in 1994--6 years ago. Originally it was 5. 
   In the area where about 37 percent of Americans consider the most important thing the Federal Government can do, to have a 1- or 2-day debate really doesn't make much sense. It doesn't live up to what this body is about, which is helping people in need. 
   To say that because we passed Ed-Flex--a nice program but really rather minor in what it does, and only one new State has joined since we passed again the bill last year, or earlier this year--and to say that educational savings accounts, which I believe the President might veto, but even if he does not, don't deal with the hard-core issues of higher standards, better teachers, better classrooms, and smaller class size--to say, having done those two things, that we have done enough and sort of wash our hands of it and walk away would be nothing short of disgraceful. Yet that is the talk. 
   We should be debating amendments that will make our schools better. There are lots of them. Some of the proposals will pass; many will fail. To have that debate not only helps educate America but it also helps educate each of us. It helps educate one another of us and helps us come to consensus because I believe we will not wait 5 years to do another education bill. I believe within the next 2 or 3 years the crisis, which is looming largely on the horizon now, will be so upon us; whether the new President is AL GORE or George W. Bush, we will be talking about education with frequency. We had better get used to it, and we shouldn't delay that now. 
   A number of us have gotten together and agreed to do an amendment about school safety dealing with guns. We don't want 
   to have 20, 30, or 40 amendments. There is no attempt whatsoever to delay or bog down this bill. We want to see this bill moved and passed. But school safety is an important issue. 
   The fact that so many of us believe strongly in gun control and have come together and put together one amendment which will be offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, who has been such a leader on this issue, is no attempt to divert us or to slow this bill down. If we wanted to do that, we would have asked for many amendments. 
   If the majority leader, in his wisdom, should decide to pull the bill because there is that one amendment, I think most Americans would believe we really do not want to debate education and that it was just an excuse. 
   The second thing I would like to talk about a little bit is the block grant,  which is really the main debate we will be having. 
   Is the Federal Government going to be involved in education and just giving the money unfettered--how I would characterize it--to the States or to the school districts or, rather, we should say: Here is a need and here is some money; We are not forcing you to use it; This is not a mandate; But if you want the money, you have to meet certain rules, certain standards, and apply under certain standards. 
   The greatest area I have experience with in this realm is the issue of crime. We tried the block grant route with crime. It was a fiasco. Governor after Governor, locally-elected official after locally-elected official--the LEA program, the law enforcement assistance grant, a block grant devised by Jimmy Carter and certainly supported by many Democrats--just wasted the money. 
   We had instances of a tank being purchased by one State. I think it was in the State of Indiana where the Governor purchased an airplane under LEA so he could fly to Washington to discuss crime issues. Money was wasted. 
   A few short years after LEA was passed and the money was appropriated, it was withdrawn with its tail between its legs. That issue could be repeated in education. I wasn't around. I was actually in high school when we passed the block grants in 1965. Again, this was done by Democrats. Imagine it is 1965--it was a Congress that was overwhelmingly Democrat--and the same thing that happened to crime happened in education; money was just wasted. 
   Here is an example. There were blank checks: $35,000 was spent on band uniforms, $2,200 was spent on football uniforms, $63,000 was spent to purchase 18 portable swimming pools, and $16,000 was spent on construction of two lagoons for sewage disposal. 
   Do we want to repeat that? Do we want to see that kind of waste and patronage when we give a locality money? They don't have to sweat to raise the taxes for it. They are getting free money, and we say, basically, spend it on what you want. It is a formula for disaster. That is what it seems we are headed towards. It is just incredible to me. 
   There is an even deeper point, which is this: 
   We are all critical of our present educational system. We say it is not working the way it should. Instead of changing, instead of trying to improve it, instead of saying here are ways, such as reducing class size, or making classrooms better, or having better teachers, or having standards, or having some accountability, we just give the money to the very same school districts we criticize and say: Do whatever you want with it. It is illogical. 
   The only way there should be a block grant is if we think the school districts are doing a great job and simply don't have enough money. 
   That is not a conservative argument. You hear more of that from the liberals. Yet the conservatives in this body are supporting block grants--no standards, little accountability, no direction, spend it on what you wish. I am utterly amazed. 
   I think there are a lot of good debates we can have. I understand the desire to keep schools locally controlled. But a block grant, a formula for waste, and much of it going to the Governors so that money doesn't even trickle down? 
   If you ask the American people if they prefer a block grant or prefer tethered money to reduce class size, or to raise standards, or to improve the quality of teachers, there is no question what they would desire. 
   I hope my colleagues will listen to the debate we are going to have on this bill. As I said before, I hope it is a fulsome debate. I hope it is a long debate. We cannot spend time on any issue that is more important than education. 
   I hope they will look at the proposals I have brought forward to improve teachers. They are not ideological. Some involve tax breaks, some involve raising standards. I hope we will decide that the role of the Federal Government should be to raise the bar--because enough localities have not--and help people get over that bar rather than just give them a sack of coins and say, ``Do what you will.'' 
   I look forward to this debate. I think it is one of the most important we can have. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, second, I thank both Senator KYL and Senator FEINSTEIN for the passion, the erudition, the conviction, and for the cause. It is, obviously, wise to delay this. I know we may be back for another day. Maybe we can all come together. I plead with them to consider a proposal of making this a Kyl-Feinstein statute, as opposed to a Kyl-Feinstein constitutional amendment, where I think it might get close to unanimous support on the floor. 
   I thought the debate we were having and may well continue to have, at least to my young years in the Senate, was one of the best times of the Senate, where we each talked about the issue with our concerns, our intelligence, and our passions. We tried to meet the issue head on. I thank both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California for their good work on this and hope we can come together on some sort of compromise on an issue about which we all care so much.

   But I know that for years and years she has been concerned about victims. I know also of the passion, hard work, and diligence she brings to the debate. I commend her for that. Our strong disagreement on the issue does not in any way lessen my respect for her or the Senator from Arizona for the job they have done in moving this amendment to the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. There is no ``but'' about my respect for the Senator. However, there is a ``but'' about Professor Tribe's remarks in the whole. What bothers me most about this amendment--and I have expressed this to the Senator--is as follows. Of the five criteria Professor Tribe lays out, I think I would agree with four of them. I think that amendments should not be done lightly. But I think there are times when we have to amend the Constitution, although reluctantly. I certainly believe the rights of victims are extremely important. As the Senator knows, we worked on the crime bill of 1994 together. I worked diligently in the House to add the right of allocution and other things to the bill. I understand why the statute didn't work in Oklahoma City although I would like to debate another point. 
   But Professor Tribe, I think, goes off base when he says a statute would not take care of this problem. So I have a two-part question. First, why is it not better, if this particular statute does not work, to redesign it? Why is it not better to take the basic amendment that the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California have offered and make it a statute, given the fact that we have not had a single State supreme court--in some States, such as mine, they are not called a supreme court--but the highest court of any of the 50 States throw out a victims' rights amendment on the basis of unconstitutionality. Given the fact that the Supreme Court has not rejected such an amendment, it seems to me that given that the language proposed--which is still being worked on, so it may change--is longer than the entire Bill of Rights and is not the language of a constitutional amendment--at least any that I have seen--why don't we try to refine the statute rather than move to a constitutional amendment with such alacrity? 
   Professor Tribe said a statute would not work. I have not seen that. I have seen, in my State and many others, victims' rights statutes work and work very well. That is my question to the Senator from California. I thank the Senator for her graciousness.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her answer, and I simply make three points. Before I do, I want to refer to a letter from Chief Justice Rehnquist in opposition saying that a statute would be far preferable to a constitutional amendment. This letter is to Judy Clarke, President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. I will read it:  
   I have received the letter of March 21, commenting on various measures pending in Congress relating to the judiciary. The Judicial Conference has recently taken a position in favor of making provision for victims' rights by statute, rather than by constitutional amendment; this would have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which appeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act of Congress.  
   It makes the very point. The Senator admitted that negotiations are still ongoing. We are debating a constitutional amendment that must be passed by two-thirds of each Chamber and then three-quarters of the States. We are still debating the language.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I will in one second. I want to finish my statement. 
   First, the kind of definitions that the Senator has talked about of appeals procedures has never been in the U.S. Constitution. In fact, what happened before is there would be a two- or three-line sentence that the rights of victims should be protected, and then we would work out by statute what the details were. 
   I have never seen a constitutional amendment such as this. It is the 21st century. I agree with that. But that doesn't mean the elegance of thought and language in the Constitution of the 18th century should be thrown out the window, and we are doing that here. 
   I ask the Senator, why, if she believes in a constitutional amendment with a two- or three-line amendment talking about victims' rights, would she not be far more in keeping with constitutional thought and theory than a 15-page document which clearly is written in statutory and not constitutional language? Second, if the detailed definitional language that the Senator is talking about works, it will work as a statute. 
   The reason the Oklahoma City case didn't work is the statute was poorly drafted, at least in terms of what the Senator is saying. I will have more to say about that later. I don't want to occupy her time on this, but if the language works 
   as a constitutional amendment, the very language that we have before us admittedly being rephrased or redrafted, why doesn't it work as a statute? 
   The problem that is pointed to in the Oklahoma City case is not the amendment. If the very same language were a constitutional amendment, God forbid, it still wouldn't have been applied because the judge didn't throw it out on an unconstitutional basis. He basically ignored it, which meant it wasn't clear enough. 
   No. 1, do we have any amendment in the Constitution that compares in detail and outlines procedurally what we have here? 
   No. 2, if this language works as a constitutional amendment, why wouldn't it work as a statute? 
   No. 3, if a constitutional amendment is necessary, although again it has not been thrown out by the Supreme Court, or any lower court, why wouldn't we have a simple, elegant three-line statement talking about the rights of victims, and then let the details of legislative engineering be worked out in statute as it has been done in this country, regardless of whether Democrats, Republicans, Whigs, or Free-Soilers, or anybody else has been in charge? 
   I thank the Senator for her patience. I feel as passionately on our side as she does on her side.

   Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I think this should be a debate that goes on for some time. That is what we are having here as opposed to everyone making speeches periodically. I very much appreciate that and would be happy when I come to the floor to yield time to opponents of the bill to continue this debate. 
   But I would simply say to my good friend from Arizona that a statute is no less the law of the land than a constitutional amendment. The idea that a constitutional amendment should be taken into account more than a statute doesn't hold up in terms of jurisprudence. I am sure even my good, mistaken friend in this case, Larry Tribe, would agree with that. But for whatever reason, one judge ignores a statute. The Senator is right. It is murky. It is hard to figure out why. We then leap to a constitutional amendment, one with almost as many words as the entire Bill of Rights. It doesn't make any sense to me. 
   I ask the Senator: Because a judge in Oklahoma City, a case I care very much about, ignored statutory language, why don't we try once again? Why don't we try, whether that case was on appeal, or in another way, to make sure that judges can't? You could easily write a statute that says the right of allocution is not granted. You can't proceed with sentencing. If some judge somewhere--I doubt there would be one--should refuse to apply that law, you would win on appeal, pardon my saying, in a ``New York minute.'' A constitutional amendment doesn't give any more authority for a judge to apply than a statute. The whole reason  we have constitutional amendments, as laid out by Larry Tribe, is for restructuring the Government. It is guaranteeing a basic right that couldn't be guaranteed otherwise. 
   I yield to the Senator from California to answer. But because a judge ignores a statute in one case, how do we then leap to a constitutional amendment?

   When the Senator asks, why is there such passion against this amendment, please do not mistake it for the substance of the amendment. There may be some who believe that, but not me, and I don't think that is the mainstream of the opposition for both Republican and Democrat.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, passion is passion. There is not a lack of passion for victims' rights but a passion for this wonderful, noble document, the Constitution of the United States. I say this in all due respect. 
   I think if this amendment were added, it would cheapen the Constitution--not cheapen the issue of victims' rights, which is important, but we have never done this before. The passion goes to the beauty of the Constitution, to the fact that we have never added a constitutional amendment, because two judges failed. 
   The Senator was good enough to mention that 1990 case. One lower court judge said it might not fit with article III. Again, don't leap to a constitutional amendment. If we were to have constitutional amendments every time a lower court judge ruled that something was unconstitutional, we would have a Constitution of the United States that would be 10 volumes long. We would spend all of our time revising that Constitution. I daresay the structure of government could fall because we need two-thirds, two-thirds, three-quarters to do it. 
   The passion here is on a fundamental difference about what the Constitution of the United States means. I would be the first to join the Senator if the U.S. Supreme Court said the same thing that lower court said in 1990. But one lower court in 1990, one lower court in 1997, and now we say let's double virtually.

   Mr. SCHUMER. A circuit court in 1990, two lower courts, but no U.S. Supreme Court. 
   I would join the Senator if the Supreme Court said the same 
   thing. I agree with her that victims' rights should receive a higher elevation in the pantheon of criminal justice. But now the issue is not ripe. The Supreme Court hasn't ruled defendants' rights trump victims' rights. We have had two poor attempts to draft legislation. 
   To their credit, the Senator from California and the Senator from Arizona have come up with a better proposal. They have still not addressed, to my satisfaction, why we need to do a constitutional amendment when I think a statute would do exactly the same job and could be passed more quickly. One would not need the two-thirds. We could get this done. If then someone fought the statute and the Supreme Court of the United States ruled it unconstitutional, we would all be on the floor supporting this amendment. 
   The passion, to answer the Senator, was a passion for the way of the Constitution, a passion that we do not amend the Constitution unless we absolutely have to. That does not go to the need to give victims more rights. That goes to the fact that none of these victims' rights laws has been declared unconstitutional by the highest court of this land or where it would still be legitimate by State supreme courts. 
   I think my 3 minutes have expired. I will continue the debate with the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. Again, I respect their motivations, I respect their substantive position, but please, God--please, God--let us not be precipitous in amending this great U.S. Constitution when there is another, quicker, and just as efficacious way to accomplish the well-thought-out goal of our Senators. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. What I was proposing--I think the present statutes are not working. I think they were poorly done. One way to get enforcement, a good way that we have used in this body over and over again, which has not even been tried yet, is to say the State would not get crime money, whether it be for Cops on the Beat, for building prisons, for Byrne money for the DAs, if they don't notify the victims. The State would do much better than 40 percent. 
   The reason this statute has not worked is no one has put any teeth into it. Why do we not put some teeth into it before jumping to the Constitution? I yield.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his eloquent words, his passion and leadership on this issue. I join with him, helping in any way I can to see that we get to finally pass the Lautenberg amendment which the country so much wants. I thank him for his doggedness. We will prevail, I do believe. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
   I am here to address S.J. Res. 3, the constitutional amendment for victims' rights. As I guess my history in the Congress shows, I have been very concerned about crime issues. If one would have to say they had a signature issue, for me, that has been it. I came to the view when I came to Congress--and am still of that view--that particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s, the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of individual rights and not enough in the direction of societal rights. I spent a good portion of my time in the Congress trying to bring that pendulum to the middle, joined by Democrats and Republicans. I am very proud of that work. 
   I come to the floor because nothing in my time in the Senate has troubled me more, has bothered me more, than the amendment we are beginning to debate. I greatly respect the Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, and the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, for the work they have done on this issue. Frankly, my views are not dissimilar to theirs on the issue of victims' rights. I helped write the law for right of allocution, for the victim to stand up at sentencing and say his or her piece. I have been extremely supportive of victims' rights. 
   Then why would I find this amendment so troubling, more troubling than any other bill we have debated? Because I revere 
   the Constitution. I consider America to this day the noble experiment the Founding Fathers called it when they had written the Constitution. I believe the Constitution is a sacred document. The more I am in Government, the more I almost tremble beside the wisdom of the Founding Fathers. Someone called them the greatest group of geniuses. There may have been other individual geniuses who were greater than any single member who wrote the Constitution, but their collective genius was the greatest group assemblage of genius the world has known, a person wrote. I tend to share that. 
   Amending the document they put together is an awesome responsibility, something that should not be taken lightly, something that should be done with the utmost care and forethought. One should only debate constitutional amendments when there is no other way to go. We should not mess with the Constitution. We should not tamper with the Constitution.  
   Yet here we are today debating a victims' bill of rights, a constitutional amendment on victims' rights, when not a single State supreme court, and certainly not the U.S. Supreme Court, has declared any victims' rights statute unconstitutional. I repeat that amazing fact for my colleagues. For the first time we are here debating a constitutional amendment with the other 19 amendments and with, of course, the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights being different, where not a single State supreme court and not the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled any part of victims' rights unconstitutional. 
   What is called for here is a statute. I would support making a statute, a law, almost the exact amendment, perhaps even the exact amendment, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California are proffering. But a constitutional amendment? Why? Why? Why amend the Constitution when no law has been declared unconstitutional? We have never done that in the over-200-year history of this Republic. We have never taken something we believe in and said, let's immediately make it a constitutional amendment. 
   We have debated constitutional amendments here because statutes were thrown out. We just did it on the flag burning amendment. People believe strongly that the flag should not be burned. The U.S. Supreme Court said it was under the aegis, the penumbra, of the first amendment. So we did our duty on this floor and debated whether we should amend the Bill of Rights. For the first time ever, we would do it to say that flag burning was prohibited. It was what the Founding Fathers thought the constitutional process should be. It was an amendment that had been thought about. It was an amendment that had been debated. It was an amendment that went to the core of great constitutional issues. 
   My guess is if a Washington or a Jefferson or a Madison were looking on the floor during that debate, they would have smiled, they would have said that was the Senate they hoped to have. 
   If a Washington or a Jefferson or a Madison were looking on the floor as we debate this, I believe they would recoil, not because of the issue of victims' rights but because of the thought of passing a constitutional amendment, only the 20th since the Bill of Rights, when no law had been declared unconstitutional, when no aspect of the Constitution itself needed to be clarified. 
   I ask my colleagues--and I will ask them when they are here because this debate will go on for some time, as it should--why not a statute? I have heard my colleague from California say: Because we have to show how important victims' rights are. With all due respect, we can show that importance with a statute. 
   I believe in the rights of working people. I have worked for laws such as minimum wage and protecting rights in the workplace. I would not put in the Constitution that we must protect the rights of working people, unless, of course, there were a series of statutes about working people that had been thrown out by the courts. Even in the early 1900s, when the wage laws and child labor laws were thrown out as unconstitutional, we didn't amend the Constitution--when there might have been reason to. But here? Now? As the lawyers say, no stare decisis, no final opinion. It doesn't make sense. 
   I have to tell my colleagues, if we were to pass this amendment, we would be fundamentally changing constitutional history, the way the laws of this country are made, because we would say that the new Constitution is open to things we believe in and feel strongly about, even where a statute might have solved the problem. 
   My colleague from California and I--I regret that she is not here--had this conversation after our caucus. She said to me, well, there have been two Federal courts that ignored victims' rights even though we passed statutes. Well, that means the statute was poorly drafted. A judge cannot ignore statutory law. I asked her, ``Well, why wouldn't that be appealed if it wasn't well drafted?'' It wasn't appealed. But to rush to a constitutional amendment? 
   This amendment has been below the radar screen. It has crept up upon us stealthily. It hasn't gotten the airing and debate it needs, and already we are rushing to judgment, attempting to pass a constitutional amendment. Again, it was said that the constitutional amendment is still being negotiated by one of the chief sponsors. What is this? We are negotiating a constitutional amendment at the same time we are debating it--something that if it becomes part of the Constitution cannot be changed without huge movement? You don't do that. The Constitution is a sacred document. The greatest group of practical geniuses in the world put it together. It is not something willy-nilly, if somebody feels strongly about it--and I respect the energy and passion--that we just go ahead and amend the Constitution. This is a dispiriting day in a certain way, in my judgment, because we are debating whether to take that great document, the Constitution of the United States, and cheapen it by saying when we feel passionately about something, we skip the statutory process, the judicial process, and we go right to amending the Constitution. 
   I am not debating the merits of the provisions. As I said, I believe in almost every one of them. But every one of these could be accomplished by statute, by law. And then, if we found out one was poorly drafted, we could change it; then, if we found out there was something people didn't take into account--and that happens when we write laws--we can change it. Not so with a constitutional amendment. 
   If you look at the amendment that has been drafted, it is longer than the entire Bill of Rights. If you look at the language, it is not the language of the Constitution of the United States, which talks about great concepts. Victims' rights is a fine concept, but the language, which I have here, is the language of a statute. 
   Again, I have not received an answer--a good answer--from my colleague from Arizona and my colleague from California as to why not a statute. You can pass it more quickly and more easily. It fits the amendment. It fits what you are trying to 
   do. No court, no supreme court, no final authority has thrown it out. And to say there were two Federal cases where the judge ignored a statute, and we immediately go to a lower court judge, and we immediately go to a constitutional amendment, again, cheapens the Constitution. 
   I intend to debate this amendment at some length. I know some of my colleagues will, too. As I said, this has not gotten airing. In fact, a month ago, if you talked to most people, they shrugged their shoulders and said, ``Don't worry, this won't come up.'' Well, it is here and it is being debated. We are on the precipice of changing what an amendment to the Constitution of this great country means. We ought not to do it lightly. We ought not to do it simply because we feel a need, as I do, to say that victims have rights in the courtroom. We ought to do it because there is no other alternative. And here there is. We ought to do it because the judicial and legislative processes have been exhausted and the Constitution hasn't anticipated a new change. This clearly is not that case. We ought to do it because this issue has reached its fulsomeness. 
   My colleagues, I believe if this body were to pass this amendment, we would regret it shortly thereafter. We would experience, as we never have, debate about what specific little clauses in the Constitution mean--not the interpretation of what is freedom of speech, but how do you define a victim. How do you deal with certain phrases and clauses? It is a troubling day. It is a troubling day because almost without debate, almost without national focus, we are thinking of changing what an amendment to the Constitution means. It is not simply supposed to make us feel good. It is not simply to make a political statement to the people back home. It is to fundamentally change the rights, privileges, and obligations of the Government and the citizenry. 
   Again, to my colleagues, why can't we try to pass this very same language as a statute? I am going to introduce that as an amendment if we are allowed to--the exact language they have but make it a statute. I have not heard a good argument and, until I do, I urge every one of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to refrain from the understandable desire to do something quickly and instead do something correctly.  
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the hour that has been ceded to me to debate this amendment.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise on the eve of the trial of 13 Iranian Jews charged with spying on behalf of the United States and Israel to ask my colleagues to support a Concurrent  Resolution urging President Clinton to do everything possible to ensure that the accused men receive a fair and open trial. As it stands right now, the Revolutionary Court judge has made a mockery of any pretense that the men will receive a fair hearing. Ten of the 13 have, for nearly a year, been denied their legal right to choose their own lawyers, and have only recently been appointed lawyers by the judge in the case--just days before the trial was set to begin. Furthermore, the trial is scheduled to be closed to any outside observers or media. 
   These facts do not bode well for the accused. However, I believe that strong pressure from the United States will help convince the Iranian government that should these men experience anything less than a fair outcome in this preposterous case, Teheran would face serious consequences. 
   The 13 Iranian Jews, mostly community and religious leaders in the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested one year ago by the Iranian authorities and accused of spying. No evidence has been brought forth to substantiate the arrests. Indeed, how could it be? Jews in Iran are prohibited from holding any positions that would grant them access to state secrets. 
   What I find most troubling is that the United States recently presented Iran with goodwill overtures, such as lifting restrictions on many Iranian imports and easing travel restrictions between our two countries, but we receive no assurances that these gestures would be reciprocated in any way. In fact, Iran has continued to display nothing but hostility and contempt for the United States and everything for which we stand. At a minimum, Iran must show signs of respecting human rights as a prerequisite for our improving relations with them. In fact, Secretary of State Albright has identified the case of the 13 Jews in Iran as ``one of the barometers of United States-Iran relations.'' I urge the President to make perfectly clear to Iran that the stakes in this trial are exceedingly high, and need to be taken very seriously. 
   Now, much has been made of President Mohammad Khatami's popular reform movement, and there is significant optimism that a kinder, gentler Iran is slowly emerging for the darkness of a 20-year hardline clerical dictatorship. Indeed, Khatami has received a huge mandate from the people of Iran over the past four years. However, Iran must fully understand that normalized relations with the United States is only a pipedream if persecution such as that enacted upon the 13 Jews accused of spying goes unchallenged. If it does not, then what kind of reform movement are we really witnessing? 
   Colleagues, I strongly urge you to join me in co-sponsoring this Resolution to send a message to the President that he must use all his resources to convince President Khatami that a farcical trial leading to a pre-ordained outcome would send US-Iran relations back to ground zero.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and for his leadership on this amendment. 
   This is an amendment on guns but one on which we can all come together because it simply deals with increasing enforcement. It would add 500 new Federal ATF agents and inspectors and 1,000 Federal, State, and local prosecutors, at a cost of $284 million, and should be included in the budget resolution. 
   It is no secret we in this Chamber have had many disagreements on the issue of guns. The one place I think we can all come together is on a view that there ought to be more enforcement. I, for instance, in my State, have worked with the National Rifle Association on something called Project Exile, which is a forerunner of what we are proposing here, in many ways, because what we do is give money to prosecutors at the Federal and State levels, as well as ATF agents, whose sole job is to prosecute gun crimes.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would love to call him majority whip, a job he would perform as admirably well as he does the job minority whip. I thank him for his friendship and leadership. I also thank my friend from West Virginia. It is always a pleasure to sit on the floor and listen to his words and his wisdom. 
   I rise in support of the amendment of Senator REED, my good friend from Rhode Island, who has done such a fabulous job with his leadership on this budget, on closing the gun show loophole, the Lautenberg amendment, which passed this body a while back. I will address one point. My colleagues laid out very well the many reasons to be for the Reed amendment. I want to add an additional reason. 
   The only argument that we have heard from the National Rifle Association, and others, against closing the gun show loophole is that allowing for a 3-day waiting period would effectively shut down gun shows because they are weekend operations. They argue if somebody bought a gun on Saturday morning and it took 72 hours to check, by then it would be Tuesday morning and the gun show, which predominates on the weekend--something that I stipulate is true--would be closed. 
   Fortunately, one of our colleagues--somebody with whom I disagree, Senator CRAIG THOMAS of Wyoming--asked the GAO to do a report on purchases at gun shows. This is what the report said, and I urge my colleagues to read it. It didn't get much publicity, but I think it is dispositive in this debate. The report debunks the myth that the 3-day waiting period will shut down gun shows. This is what the report showed, colleagues, and I hope people will listen because I think it is important: ``Seventy-eight percent of all the instant checks are completed within 3 minutes.'' That means 78 percent of those guns checked at gun shows--because we believe they would be no different than others--would be purchasable within 3 minutes. And 95 percent are completed within 2 hours. So the person would go to a gun show and be able to buy the gun in 2 hours. That is 19 of every 20 purchases. And only 5 percent take more than 1 day to complete. 
   Now, you say, what about those 5 percent? Why should we hold them up? Well, let me tell you why, my colleagues. Those 5 percent are far and away the most likely Brady checks to turn up a felon. In fact, it is 20 times more likely that the 5 percent of the checks that take more than 1 day will show up a felon than in the 95 percent where the check takes 3 minutes or 2 hours. 
   The background check won't affect gun shows more than a pittance. Ninety-five percent of all guns will be able to be purchased by people who have the right to purchase those guns having passed the Brady check within 2 hours. 
   My colleagues, there is no reason why we can't pass the Lautenberg amendment, as the Reed amendment exhorts us to do, because very simply it is not going to close down gun shows. 
   Will it stop a good number of felons from receiving guns? By all means. That is the purpose. I don't think anybody in this body would challenge the fact that we don't want felons to receive guns. 
   Second, perhaps tomorrow, probably in the vote-arama, the Senator from Illinois and I will offer an amendment on enforcement. I know he will address that at great length. But that amendment does just what many who disagree with us on gun control have asked us to do. They said: Why don't we enforce the present law? 
   The fact is, that every time we try to increase enforcement by adding ATF agents and giving those agents more authority, we have been opposed by the very people who are asking us for enforcement. 
   But there is real hope. Something called Project Exile, supported by the NRA and by CHUCK SCHUMER, has now sprung up and has done well in three cities, including Rochester in my State. 
   Last year on this floor, when we debated the budget, we added some $50 million to Project Exile. And now four cities in my State of New York--Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany --will get the advantage of Project Exile. 
   The NRA and gun control advocates such as myself have agreed on this issue. Perhaps we can agree on more. I hope we will get universal support for the Durbin-Schumer amendment. 
   Getting back to the other Reed amendment, I hope my colleagues will listen to the facts that I gave out. If we would agree to the Reed amendment, we would ratify the Lautenberg amendment as passed out in the conference, and we would move forward on an issue that is so vital for the safety of Americans and for the future of our country. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his generosity. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with 61 of my colleagues to introduce a bill to name the beautiful Federal Courthouse located at 500 Pearl Street in Manhattan, after my esteemed colleague and champion of this project, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   When I think about the many accomplishments of the distinguished Senator or the numerous accolades that he has received, I am left with very big shoes to fill and very few words that have yet to be used to describe the man and his legacy. His roles throughout his 47-year career in public service include legislator, scholar, reformer, teacher and last, but definitely not least, builder. In New York, PAT MOYNIHAN has taught us the value of beautiful public works. 
   It is especially for his role as builder that we honor PAT MOYNIHAN today. The Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street embodies the same spirit as his previous architectural endeavors--an extraordinary work of art, inside and out. Completed in 1994, the Courthouse was designed by the distinguished architectural firm of Kohn Pederson Fox with a dignity worthy of the weighty judicial matters considered within its walls. It is a magnificent structure of solid granite, marble, and sturdy oak, built to last 200 years, adorned with public art from notable contemporary artists Ray Kaskey and Maya Lin. 
   Not coincidentally, the Courthouse's presence and elegance befit the man who was most responsible for its creation--Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, who has been an enduring champion of excellence in 
   public architecture, both here in Washington and at home in New York. Senator MOYNIHAN toiled for nearly a decade prodding the Congress, General Services Administration, three New York City mayors, and anyone else he needed, to see this spectacular Courthouse built. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has always been an important force for architecture in New York. He was responsible for the restoration of the spectacular Beaux-Arts Custom House at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and beloved in Buffalo for reawakening that city's appreciation for its architectural heritage, which includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and the Prudential Building, one of the best-known early American skyscrapers by the architect Louis H. Sullivan--a building which MOYNIHAN helped restore and then chose as his Buffalo office. MOYNIHAN has also spurred a powerful popular movement in Buffalo to build a new signature Peace Bridge over the Niagara River. 
   But the project for which he is best known is his beloved Pennsylvania Station. In 1963, PAT MOYNIHAN was one of  a group of prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our City's spectacular Penn Station--a glorious public building designed by McKim, Mead & White, the Nation's premier architectural firm of the time. 
   It was PAT MOYNIHAN who recognized years ago that across the street from what is now a sad basement terminal that functions--barely--as New York City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office Building, built by the same architects, in much the same grand design, as the old Penn Station. PAT MOYNIHAN recognized that we could use the Farley Building to once again create a train station worthy of our great City. I, along with many of my colleagues, offered a bill last year to name that new train station after him, but Senator MOYNIHAN, with characteristic modesty, asked that the station keep the Farley name. 
   Fortunately, the Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street will serve as an equally fitting tribute and provide an enduring monument in the heart of the City that PAT MOYNIHAN and I both love so dearly, a monument for the millions of New Yorkers and their fellow Americans who love and admire Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank our Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Massachusetts and so many others who have put together this outstanding amendment. This amendment is one of the most important amendments we will vote on this entire year. 
   We have moved into an economy where ideas matter. As Alan Greenspan puts it: High value is added no longer by moving things but, rather, by thinking things. We cannot afford an educational system that the OECD--the 22 developed nations in North America, Europe, and Japan--ranks, in America, 15th, 16th, or 17th. 
   I think Americans have come together on two types of issues: One, that we are willing to spend more money on education. We have to. When a starting salary for a teacher is $24,000, when we have such shortages of classrooms, when we don't have the kinds of things we need for afterschool and computers and all the things that make a modern education worthwhile, there is only one answer. It is money. 
   We all know the local property taxpayer who from the beginning has funded education in this country is up to here in property taxes. The choices are simple: Let education stagnate or let the Federal Government play a more significant role. Most Americans want us to do that. It is unfortunate the budget that is put before the Senate does not do that. 
   The second issue I think we all embrace in general is that we must have standards in education. A student who is not reading at a third-grade level should not be promoted from the fourth to the fifth grade. A teacher who is not certified in a subject should not be teaching it. We need real standards and real accountability. Put that together and I think we can come up with a significant education program that can bring Americans together and do the job our country needs. 
   Mark my words, if our educational system stays at the present level, we will not be the leading economy in the world in the year 2025 or 2050. This is a crisis that demands some dramatic urgency. 
   The amendment put forward by the Senator from New Mexico and others, including myself, makes a difference. Let me go over again what it does. First, it puts a qualified teacher in every classroom. There is $2 billion for recruitment, mentoring, and professional development of qualified teachers. Many of the things I have been working on, a Marshall Plan for teachers, are included in this amendment. We desperately need it in New York. Nationally, for instance, we face a teacher shortage of 2.2 million over the next decade. New York faces a teacher shortage of 80,000 men and women over the next 5 years. How are we going to get qualified teachers? Currently, only 10 States require and fund programs for new teachers, 12 pay veteran teachers to be mentors. This amendment provides those kinds of resources. 
   Second, it helps communities modernize our schools. My children attend the public schools in New York City. I will never forget the day I went to open school day for my little one, Alison's kindergarten class, a few years back. There were two classes in that one kindergarten room. You could not hear above the voice of the teacher of the other class in the other corner of the room; you could not hear what Alison's teacher was saying to her students. 
   Left alone to the localities, left with the tremendous burden the property tax puts on so many Americans, we will not modernize our schools. But our amendment comes to the rescue. It provides $1.3 billion in grants and loans for the much needed repair of 5,000 public elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas. It leverages an additional $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help build schools. 
   New York currently has an unmet funding need for school construction of $50.7 billion, one-sixth the national need of $307 billion. We desperately need this part of the amendment. 
   The amendment supports tough accountability for results. To put money into a program without having it be accountable, as it would be in the private sector, has been one of our failures in education--lack of accountability. 
   I disagree with some of my friends on the left who say that accountability is wrong or unmeetable. I plead with my colleagues to do two things. First, keep the bar high. That is the only way we are going to stay a leading country. But help provide the resources to let those get over that bar. The other two choices are unacceptable: to lower the bar or to not help people get over it. Neither is good. The tough accountability for results in this amendment--$116 million over last year to $250 million for accountability--is vital. 
   This amendment rejects the cuts that have been proposed in impact aid. We have, in New York State, districts such as Indian River near Fort Drum and Highland Falls near West Point which would be devastated by the cut actually in the President's budget because he eliminates $94 million in impact aid. This amendment restores that. 
   Not least important, this supports a commitment to smaller classes; $1.75 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size in the early grades. My daughter has seen class size grow in her public school, P.S. 230. She is one of millions of American children who see that. 
   We expand afterschool opportunities for children. I participated in afterschool programs and played basketball. It kept me in good shape. Many students do not have that opportunity. We increase it. 
   We increase support for children with disabilities, and we make college more affordable by increasing the individual Pell grant by $400. 
   These are all important things to do. Compare this with the budget that has been proposed by my friends. The problem is twofold. No. 1, it does not provide those resources. We can talk and talk and talk about education, but, unless we provide resources, we are not going to achieve our goal. 
   Most Americans support that wish. I think the other side is being penny-wise and pound foolish to not support increasing aid for education. Ask Americans what is their No. 1 priority, above any other spending program, above tax cuts and above retiring the deficits. It is education. The budget proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle does not recognize that need. It is woefully inadequate. It actually cuts, by $1.4 billion, from what the President did. I am the first to say what the President did in his budget was not enough in this important area. It is the spending area where we most need an increase. 
   No. 2, the budget envisions this block grant procedure, which I know my colleagues on the other side want to move forward, in the ESEA bill on which we will vote. In their budget, under function 500, it says:  
   This bill will give States greater flexibility in delivering hundreds of elementary and secondary education programs and will place more decisionmaking in the hands of States, localities and families.  
   It is good rhetoric, but I will tell you I don't think we should take the Federal taxpayer dollars and let it be 
   frittered away in the same way we have seen money wasted in the past. We in this Congress should set our priorities for education. We should certainly not mandate on the locality that they have to take our priorities. But if they want some money, they better improve and reform their systems. 
   Crime is the area in which I have the most expertise. I remember when we had a crimefighting block grant very similar to this proposal. One locality bought a tank. Another State bought an airplane so the Governor could fly from Washington to Indianapolis--it was the Governor of Indiana--all under the block grant process. 
   I do not get the logic. Our friends on the other side say the system is not  working well enough. I agree. Then they give money to the same exact people to spend in the same exact way. What sense does that make? We are trying to get the localities to reach to a higher goal: Lower class size and we will give you some dollars; increase accountability and we will give you some dollars; make better classrooms and we will give you some dollars. But we are not going to give dollars--I ask the Senator from Nevada, may I have an additional 2 minutes?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we set out goals. A block grant is a continuation of mediocrity. A block grant does not give families the power to spend the money. It gives money so the same local institutions, many that have been mired in mediocrity, can do the same thing as they have been doing before. Sure as we are sitting here, if we have a block grant, do you know where it is going to end up? Administrators' folderol. 
   The programs in the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico are designed to do specific things that all Americans support and, more importantly, even that our educational experts tell us are needed to improve education. So the fact that the budget is pusillanimous, is stingy in the area where we most need help--education--and the fact is, instead of laying out a specific guidepost based on careful analysis and what the experts say is needed, it just takes a ball of money and throws it to a locality or throws it to a State, separating the taxing authority from the spending authority. That is probably the greatest problem in block grants because when you separate the taxing authority from the spending authority, you almost always get wasted money. It is free money to others. Those are the two great problems in education, our most important priority with the budget that is put before us. 
   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to look at that budget; when they go home and make speeches about how important education is, to then ask themselves how they can vote for a budget that actually cuts from the President's budget by approximately $1.4 billion, not including IDEA. 
   I ask my colleagues on the other side who criticize the present system, why just give, in a mass block grant, money to the same States and same localities that have not measured up now? Why not increase the amount of dollars but only allow them to go into the classroom, whether it be teachers or new classrooms or standards for those classrooms that everyone, when they go back home to give speeches, seems to say we need? 
   I salute the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Washington, and all the others who have put together this amendment. It is a marvelous blueprint, a well-thought-out blueprint of where we need to go in education. Let us stop simply giving the American people rhetoric. Let us put together a concrete plan that makes a difference in the areas where we need to make a difference, such as reducing class size, modernizing and building more classrooms, improving the quality of teachers, and improving accountability. 
   This amendment does it. I urge my colleagues to support it and reject the present budget. The budget before us is a pusillanimous and unfocused approach towards education. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gil Hodges on his 25 year career in Major League Baseball. Gil Hodges served 18 years as a major league player and 7 years as a manager, during which he distinguished himself through exceptional performance, success, professionalism and personal achievement. 
   At the conclusion of his playing career in 1962, Gil Hodges was the leading  right handed home run hitter in National League history; hitting 20 or more home runs in 11 seasons, surpassing the 30 home run mark four times and the 40 mark twice. For the 11-year period between 1949 and 1959, he averaged more than 30 home runs and 100 RBIs per season. Those are some impressive statistics. A vital part of both the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Mets franchises, Gil appeared in 8 World Series, winning 1 as a player and 1 as a manager. During his tenure, Gil Hodges led the 1969 Miracle Mets to one of the most memorable and remarkable World Championships in the history of baseball, bringing pride to Mets fans all across the city. 
   Beyond being a great major leaguer, Gil Hodges was a great humanitarian. He played a major role in the success and acceptance of his teammate, Jackie Robinson. Jackie's eventual success was facilitated by the leadership and courage of Gil Hodges. A life long New Yorker, his memory lives on in the minds of the many Dodgers and Mets fans that got to witness his greatness. His number 14 has been retired by the Mets assuring that his legacy will be preserved for generations. In closing, I would like to say that Gil Hodges was a great baseball player, a great manager, and more importantly a great man. He was a hero to many and I am taking this time to pay tribute to his legacy. Thank you, Gil.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of myself and Senators KENNEDY, DURBIN, LAUTENBERG, REED, TORRICELLI, LEVIN, ROBB, MOYNIHAN, BOXER, DODD, and Mr. DASCHLE, the Effective National Firearms Objectives For Responsible, Commonsense Enforcement Act. This bill, I believe, bridges the gap between those who reflexively support the gun lobby and those who strongly support gun control. 
   The ENFORCE Act is the culmination of years of research into gun tracing and gun trafficking. It is the next phase in stopping gun violence. It is a bill and an approach to gun crime that works smarter and works harder. 
   This bill works smarter by ridding us of many of the laws that have shielded illegal gun traffickers and dirty gun dealers from prosecution. It uses the latest in gun tracing data and ballistics technology to make it possible for law enforcement to zero in on the bad apples, throw the book at them, and leave the rest alone. It works harder by finally giving ATF the street agents they need to crack down on high crime gun dealers and to prosecute more gun crimes. 
   Let me outline a few provisions in this legislation. First, this bill will fund 500 new ATF agents and inspectors to crack down on dirty gun dealers. These new agents will target high-crime gun dealers who supply firearms to criminals and juveniles and crack down on violent gun criminals and illegal gun traffickers at gun shows, gun stores, and on the streets. 
   ENFORCE will also give ATF the authority to investigate high crime-gun stores. Under current law, the ATF is only allowed to conduct one unannounced inspection of a licensed dealer a year. The bill would allow the ATF to conduct four compliance inspections annually of licensed firearms dealers, importers, and manufacturers. 
   In addition, this legislation will authorize funds to hire an additional 1,000 local, state and federal prosecutors to expand the Project Exile program in high gun-crime areas. In cases where federal law enforcement authorities defer to state prosecutors, this funding would ensure that state prosecutors have sufficient resources. Furthermore, ENFORCE authorizes funding for federal prosecutors and gun enforcement teams to coordinate efforts with local law enforcement and to determine where federal prosecution is warranted. 
   ENFORCE will also create a comprehensive ballistics DNA testing network. The Act would triple current funding for ballistics testing programs to support the deployment of 150 ballistics imaging units, helping to link bullets and shell casings to the crime-guns they were fired from. 
   ENFORCE will expand to 50 cities and counties the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII), which would dramatically increase tracing of crime guns to find sources. Participating cities and counties' law enforcement agencies would submit and share identifying information about crime guns and conduct law enforcement investigations regarding illegal youth users of firearms and illegal traffickers of firearms to youth. The Secretary of the Treasury would provide an annual report on the types and sources of recovered crime guns and the number of investigations associated with YCGII. 
   The bill would also fund $10 million for smart gun technology research and development. New state-of-the-art innovations could limit a gun's use to its owner or other authorized users--and could therefore prevent accidental shooting deaths of children, detect gun theft, and stop criminals from seizing and using the guns of police officers against them. 
   ENFORCE is a comprehensive package of measures that will strengthen the enforcement of existing gun laws and target high crime-gun dealers to reduce gun violence and to keep firearms out of the hands of children and criminals. The gun lobby has been calling for more enforcement. This is as tough and effective an enforcement bill as ever drafted. Gun rights and gun control supporters ought to step up to the plate and pass it.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again address an issue I have been talking about since last September, that of global oil supply and prices. Back in September, I was talking about the possibility of an impending oil crisis due to OPEC's manipulation of global supply. As we moved into the fall, I joined with the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, and we started talking about the likelihood of a crisis. Well, now it is a certainty. 
   As we all know, that crisis struck early this winter as home heating oil prices in the Northeast pierced the $2-a-gallon level --something unheard of in the past. What began as a heating oil supply and price shock in the Northeast this winter is now rolling as thunder across our entire Nation. It is affecting the farmers throughout America in the cost of diesel fuel for their planting season. It is affecting truckers who are having a very difficult time making a living because they are so dependent on the cost of diesel fuel. It has affected airlines with the $20 surcharge. It has affected blue chip stocks. Yesterday, an analysis read that one of the predominant reasons Procter & Gamble stock had sunk so was the high price of oil. 
   Yet, unfortunately, things could--and are likely to--get worse if nothing is done. It is likely to get worse with the price of gasoline. Gasoline, in my judgment--and I have been saying this for several months--could hit $2 per gallon this summer and maybe more if nothing is done. Perhaps worst of all, this oil shock could very well throw sand in the gears of our high-flying economy as the Federal Reserve, worried about inflation, raises interest rates and the wonderful growth we have experienced now for a record number of months could be thrown into doubt or even jeopardy. 
   The numbers present a very dim outlook for us. Oil inventories are at a 20-year low. Global supply is 2 million barrels below daily demand. Coming off home heating oil prices that set records and defied gravity, we are heading straight into a gasoline supply and price debacle this summer. 
   We have now reached the point where rising oil prices are no longer a nuisance but, rather, a crisis for our economy. Two days ago, Procter & Gamble, as mentioned, lost $34 billion in market value--nearly one-third of the entire worth of a company that spent decades and decades building up its value; boom, down one-third. It was because of profit worries due in large part to oil prices. 
   In fact, analysts are attributing the 15-percent drop in the Dow since the beginning of the year directly to oil prices and the inflationary effects. I understand the Nasdaq index continues to go up, but you can't have the industrial and traditional part of the economy without it affecting the tech parts of the economy, soon enough, unfortunately. If all of this doesn't wake us up to an economic crisis, I don't know what will. 
   Gas prices are now about $1.50 a gallon. They have set another record. That is the national average. Of course, in certain parts of the country, particularly on the West Coast, they are considerably higher, but $1.50 is about the average in my State--a little higher in downstate areas, and a little lower in some of the upstate areas, although some, such as Binghamton and Utica, have pierced $1.50 as well. But this summer by Memorial Day, as the summer driving season is upon us, if no further oil is released, we will likely hit $2 per gallon, self-service regular, average in the country. 
   This will do dramatic damage not only to people's pocketbooks and wallets but to our economy. New York--both upstate and downstate--depends on tourism. In the summer season people are more likely to drive. They are less likely to curtail their vacation. 
   Of course, the continued problems in agriculture, in transportation, and in manufacturing will get worse if oil prices continue to rise. They rose about 44 cents today on the market, and not as high as the $34 a barrel they were 4 days ago, but that is scant relief. Given the laws of supply and demand, it is quite likely they will exceed the $34 rather shortly. 
   We are going to hear about this from our constituents. The upcoming impending gasoline crisis will be a major issue in the campaigns this summer and fall, if nothing is done. 
   I don't blame our constituents for asking us to do something because we have not acted resolutely with OPEC. We have not used the one ace in the hole that we hold in our hand to compel OPEC to increase production--our well-stocked, 570-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve. OPEC, by the way, cut back on supply, my friends, 5 percent last year, and their revenues have increased 59 percent. That is how tight the oil market is. 
   For the last several weeks, Secretary Richardson, doing his best, has met with various OPEC and OPEC-aligned ministers to try to get them to increase production by their March 27 meeting. It seems very plausible and likely that Secretary Richardson's efforts have helped move some members of OPEC, and it is likely production will increase somewhat. But there is also too good a chance, unfortunately, that ``somewhat'' will not 
   be enough. There is too good a chance that while OPEC will increase production, the amount they decide to increase production won't avoid the impending crisis in gasoline prices and oil prices this summer. 
   The chart to my left shows the various OPEC scenarios. If we don't see at least a 2-million-barrel increase in production right away, and see that 2-million-barrel increase continue into the third quarter, the prices we have now--much too high already--will look like the good old days. 
   This chart is conservative. Here is what it shows. If there is no change in OPEC output, if they keep oil production as they have it--they have talked a good game, but they haven't done anything--the price will go way above $40 a barrel to $41. 
   Let's say they do what most people think is likely, that they will try some palliative measure with a 1-million-barrel increase in the second quarter. Then the price still goes up from what it is now to about $35 or $36 a barrel. 
   Let's say they pledge to increase oil by 1 million barrels a day in quarters 2 and 3. It still goes up from what it is today. And even if they pledge the 1-million-barrel increase permanently, the price goes up but not on as great a slope. The worst thing about this chart is that with 1 million barrels a day, even permanently, the price of oil continues to go up, which means the prices today will be lower than in the future. 
   Today, the New York Times reported the stock market rebounded yesterday due in large part to a dip in oil prices stemming from rumors that the Saudi Arabian and Iranian Governments agreed in principle to increase supply at the March 27 meeting. 
   Look how dependent we have become on oil speculation from OPEC ministers. When these ministers mumble about supply increases, our economy signals relief. When they mention maintaining the quotas, or not increasing supply enough, economic indicators begin heading south. 
   What this means to me is simple. It means OPEC has won. Its 18-month cutback in supply has succeeded in giving it significant leverage over the U.S. and world economies. Even if OPEC chooses to increase supply on March 27, which they in likelihood will do, the hard truth is that global inventories are so low that even a moderate increase will still allow the cartel to manipulate supply and increase prices at a moment's notice. They have us, quite simply, by the neck. 
   We cannot allow our economy to become beholding to the decisions of OPEC ministers--plain and simple. My suggestion to the administration is this: We need to use the SPR as leverage. And we should make a promise to OPEC. We can make it privately or we can make it publicly. But we should tell them in no uncertain terms that unless they decide to increase production by 2 million barrels a day by March 27, we will use our reserve to make up the difference. Whether we make that promise publicly or privately, as I mentioned, is immaterial so long as they understand the consequences of squeezing supplies to the point of hurting our economy. And a comprehensive SPR-swaps policy, which means selling now and promising  to buy back later, makes good sense because the price will be lower later and we can replenish the reserve. That needs to be put in place now. 
   Some have argued that we shouldn't use the reserve except for national emergencies. When oil is at $34 a barrel, when gas 
   prices are headed towards $2 per gallon, when major companies in America lose dramatic parts of their value because of the price of oil, and when the economic expansion that has made this country smile from one coast to the other for so many years is in jeopardy, to me that is an emergency. If for some reason some in the administration have doubt about whether they have the legal ability to sell the reserve--I believe they do--we can easily in this body pass legislation that Senator COLLINS and I have sponsored which makes it clear that they do. 
   No one is looking to go back to $10-per-barrel oil. But oil trading over $30 per barrel is clearly going to affect our economic growth and severely impact the global economy. 
   We have a perfect tool to reduce the inordinate power of OPEC and protect our economy. That tool is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is high time we used it. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for allowing me to speak for a brief period of time before him. I saw those books piled up on his desk and realized if I did not get my words in now, I might not ever get them in. 
   I very much appreciate his graciousness. 
   I also thank my colleague from Vermont for, as usual, his intelligent and considerate words. I also thank the chairman of our Judiciary Committee for bringing this nomination forward and for, just as importantly, announcing he will support the nomination of Judge Paez. 
   Mr. President, first, I rise in support of the nomination of Judges Paez, Berzon, Fuentes, and Dyk. But, more importantly, I rise to talk about the process very briefly. For instance, we do not have any problem with the Senator from New Hampshire debating, to the end, whether Judge Paez should be a judge. We have a problem that he had to wait 4 1/2 years to do it. 
   The basic issue of holding up judgeships is the issue before us, not the qualifications of judges, which we can always debate. The problem is it takes so long for us to debate those qualifications. It is an example of Government not fulfilling its constitutional mandate because the President nominates, and we are charged with voting on the nominees. 
   The Constitution does not say if the Congress is controlled by a different party than the President there shall be no judges chosen. But that is sometimes how the majority has functioned. 
   Second, by not filling vacancies, we hamper the judiciary's ability to fulfill its own constitutional duties. 
   Our courts--my own in New York State--have large backlogs. We have three vacancies in New York: One in the eastern district; two in the southern district. We had four, and I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for approving George Daniels last week. But we still have vacancies. 
   I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with alacrity--vote them up or down. But this delay makes a mockery of the Constitution, makes a mockery of the fact that we are here working, and makes a mockery of the lives of very sincere people who have put themselves forward to be judges and then they hang out there in limbo. 
   Judge Paez, Judge Berzon, Judge Dyk, and Judge Fuentes are extremely qualified. I urge all of my colleagues, at long last, to vote for their confirmation. 
   Again, I very much appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire for allowing me to speak for this brief moment. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to offer my amendment, the Teachers First Act, to the education bill we are currently considering. 
   If you had listened to the debate over the last 2 days on this bill as I have, there is not a single Senator who is satisfied with the quality of education in our public schools. We have different prescriptions, but we are unanimous in our belief that U.S. schools must do better in this globally competitive and idea-based world. 
   In my own State, at the end of the last fiscal year, New Yorkers were shocked to learn that half of the State's fourth grade students could barely handle written and oral work. Over the past 8 years, the number of New York schools cited for poor performance has more than doubled. This is simply unacceptable. 
   I am concerned, of course, as a Senator from New York, but I am even  more concerned as a parent because my two daughters attend public schools in New York City. 
   For me, if we could accomplish only one thing, if we could make only one change to our schools to raise the quality of education for all kids, it must be to improve the quality of our teachers and make the teaching profession more attractive to young people. 
   In the past, America was able to attract high-quality young people to teach--top-quality women who were locked out of other professional fields, talented men because of the promise of stable employment, or as an alternative to the Vietnam war draft. Today, very unfortunately for our country, to choose to teach is to choose financial sacrifice. And quality has become less important than filling vacant teacher slots. This has to change for a whole bunch of reasons. 
   First, today's economy depends more on the quality of the minds we provide in our schools than the minerals we dig in the soil or the wealth of the fields. 
   Two, we have an enormous teacher shortage on the horizon. 
   Three, studies tell us that teacher qualifications account for more than 90 percent of the differences of students' reading and math scores. 
   Let me repeat that because it is an astounding fact. 
   Studies tell us that teacher qualifications account for more than 90 percent of the differences in students' reading and math scores. So quality and training count. 
   The bad news is that more than 12 percent of all newly hired teachers enter the workforce with no training at all, and 37 percent of all new teachers nationwide lack full certification. 
   I was at a reception of the North Carolina Community Bankers. I had not had lunch and I wanted to smell the crab cakes. I told them about the amendment I was submitting because much of the idea of this amendment came from the work of Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina. One of the bankers said: Why should we have any teachers who are not certified? I said: We shouldn't. He said: Why do we let them teach? 
   The answer is very simple. We do not have enough qualified teachers applying for the jobs at existing salary levels. Given the working conditions of a teacher, given that the starting salary of a teacher in America is $24,000 a year, schools--particularly in rural and inner-city areas, but now in other places, too--are facing a Hobson's choice: no teacher or an unqualified teacher, an uncertified teacher. 
   There is no other choice. The number of people who are certified doesn't fill the need for the number of teachers. 
   I think it should be a given in this great democracy of ours that every American child deserves to be taught by a highly qualified and motivated teacher. Scarce Federal dollars should be used to support and help replicate successful programs to recruit and retain high-quality teachers. And we should have standards in accountability to ensure that we are doing right by our children. 
   I am proud to have worked with Senator KENNEDY, and I compliment Senator KENNEDY's tremendous leadership on his qualified-teacher-in-every-classroom amendment. This effort, unfortunately, failed this afternoon. It would have included mentoring and professional development programs, provided resources and ongoing support to teachers, particularly in the subject areas of math and science where they are desperately needed. The number of teachers, by the way, in math and science who are qualified and certified overall is very low for the simple reason those individuals can make virtually double in the private sector with a background in math and science. 
   Second, that accountability measures for States and local districts to improve teacher quality be real. 
   Third, that recruitment efforts to attract the best and brightest continue. 
   As a complement to the fine work of Senators KENNEDY, BINGAMAN, WELLSTONE, MURRAY, REED, and others, I am introducing an amendment that will provide funding for teachers to complete a 1-year intensive program to become board certified. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is the gold seal of certification. We want doctors, accountants, and architects to obtain board certification. We must have the same for teachers. 
   I am one who believes strongly in standards and accountability in the educational system. I do not believe we should be lowering the bar for teachers or for students. To lower the bar is the end of a great American tradition of meritocracy; that is, no matter who you are or where you come from, if you meet certain standards, you get the job. 
   On the other hand, if we are not going to lower the bar--and we certainly shouldn't, and I support many of my colleagues in that viewpoint on both sides of the aisle--we then have to make sure people can get over the bar. 
   If there are too few teachers right now who meet certification, we can have uncertified teachers in the classroom or we can help more teachers become certified. That is the nub 
   of this program. 
   Board certification requires teachers to undergo a rigorous regime of testing and assessments based on actual classroom teaching, lesson plans, and student work samples. This is not some abstract test that one takes. This is real on-the-job training. Teachers seeking board certification are also required to pass written exams designed to test subject matter knowledge, curriculum design, and student assessment techniques. The process takes nearly a year and costs $2,000. 
   My proposal provides $50 million a year in grants for 5 years to cover 75 percent of the costs of certification in those districts with the highest concentration of teachers who are not certified or licensed. The local district would match the remaining 25 percent and teachers would agree to remain within the school district as master teachers for at least 2 years after certification. 
   Why don't we just simply allow localities to do this on their own? Because they don't. They are strapped for funds, they have day-to-day needs and concerns, and they will take an uncertified teacher and put them in the classroom because they are faced with the choice of no teacher. 
   This is just the type of program the Federal Government should initiate. We shouldn't mandate a program on the school districts. No school district has to participate in this. Rather, we ought to focus on the pressure points and pinpoint where a little financial incentive will encourage school districts to do things that we think we need. 
   As my colleague, Senator DODD, said in a private conversation the other day, we do have national values. To give money to local school districts and say, do whatever you want with it, ensures the same old situation with which we are not happy. If we agree that we should raise the bar for who should be teachers, what better method than to give dollars to local school districts that wish to help certify more teachers? Not all dollars; they have to match it 25 percent so it means something to them, but it gives them help. 
   The bottom line is that we have to make teaching an exalted profession in the 21st century as the professions of law and medicine have been in the 20th century. My amendment is a step in the right direction. 
   Today, only nine States have over 90 percent of their teachers who are nationally board certified. My own State has 61 board certified teachers; 61 out of 205,000 teachers in New York State. That ratio is abysmal. It is time to make a change. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw this amendment in the interest of time. It is a very simple amendment. We have a real shortage in America of certified teachers. I was visiting with the Community Bankers of North Carolina looking for a few crabcakes. One of the fellows came over and asked why we would have a teacher who was not certified. The answer is very simple. Because many school districts--particularly poor, inner-city districts and rural districts--have a choice: Uncertified teacher or no teacher, because there are not enough qualified teachers, given salary levels, working conditions, et cetera, who will go into the classroom. 
   This amendment helps certify teachers. We would pay 75 percent of the cost of training them. It is $50 million a year. It is a very good amendment to help raise the quality of teachers. I have always believed we should not lower the bar but help people get over it. That is what this amendment does. I hope my colleagues will support it at some point.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yesterday, crude prices closed just below $32 per barrel--the highest price since a brief spike during the Persian Gulf War. At this level, it is very likely that gas prices will reach $2 per gallon by Memorial Day. 
   The price of oil has reached a point where it is no longer a nuisance, but a crisis for our economy. We have called on the President and the Secretary of Energy to release some of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in order to bring this price spike under control. And today, we are introducing a concurrent resolution to again request that the Administration use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bolster our rapidly dwindling oil inventories, stabilize prices, and to convince OPEC that America is ready to use leverage to protect our national economic interests. 
   During the past two weeks, Secretary Richardson has met with OPEC ministers to encourage them to increase production. They discussed a 1 million barrel per day increase, but according to experts, that will still not be sufficient to meet America's demand. In fact, even if OPEC increased production to 3 million barrels per day by the 4th Quarter of 2000, the U.S. will still have $30 barrels next winter. This is because inventory levels of petroleum and petroleum products are at their lowest levels in more than 20 years. Gasoline inventories are down 15 percent from last year, and crude inventories are down 13 percent. Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development inventories are 99 million barrels below normal. 
   Low inventories means that OPEC will continue to control global supply and demand. Even if OPEC increases production by a small amount, it will not be sufficient to prevent them from increasing prices at any moment. This, therefore, has become a matter of national security. 
   The United States must use the SPR to prod OPEC to release significantly more oil. If the United States releases the reserve through swaps, other OPEC producers will realize that their stranglehold on the market is ending and will disregard their quotas, thereby releasing oil into market and forcing the price back down. That is the scenario OPEC fears the most and that is the card that we need to play to ensure a sufficient and timely increase in production. We have been warning since  September that this day would come if the United States did not play the SPR card. It is here; it is late; but it is not yet too late to avert a crisis. We need to use the leverage of the reserve. 
   Increased oil prices could severely affect the health of our economy. It has the potential to increase inflation. It will drain the budgets of working families. The price of shipping will increase. Oil prices at these levels will filter through every sector of our economy like a virus. 
   The President and Secretary Richardson must act quickly to release oil from the SPR in order to counter OPEC's assault on the United States and the global economy.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to thank my distinguished Senate colleagues for their support, help, consideration, and, hopefully, passage of S. 2076, legislation which will bestow upon John Cardinal O'Connor the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   I, along with Senators MOYNIHAN, SPECTER, and SANTORUM, introduced this bill last week. We believe now is the perfect time for Congress to publicly thank His Eminence for his 50 years of service to America, the Catholic Church, and for his numerous contributions as an ambassador of peace, freedom, and humanitarianism around the world. 
   Since being ordained 54 years ago, John Cardinal O'Connor has humbly captured the hearts of millions with a message of caring and compassion for all people. He has dutifully served the Church in Philadelphia, the Diocese of Scranton, and now from the steps of the treasured St. Patrick's Cathedral serves as the spiritual guiding force for the 10-county New York Archdiocese and its more than 2.3 million Catholic members. 
   He is loved in New York and by Catholics across the country. He has touched the hearts of millions whose spiritual life is richer from the words and deeds of our cardinal. 
   Since being named by the Pope as successor to the late Cardinal Terence Cook in 1984, Cardinal O'Connor has sought to reinforce the traditional teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church while putting a human face on the problems faced not only by Catholics but all New Yorkers. 
   He has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage. He has advocated for farm workers. He has advocated for working people throughout New York and throughout the world. 
   He has worked hard to improve relationships between Catholics and Jews, knowing that is so important to the future of the area he represents and to all Americans. 
   He has advocated relentlessly for fairness and justice. And even while reaffirming the Church's teachings on homosexuality, he set up AIDS clinics and volunteered anonymously in them. 
   I have not always agreed with Cardinal O'Connor. For example, he is a strong, vocal, and impassioned voice in opposition to abortion. I have respectfully disagreed with his position. But in some instances you earn an even greater respect for someone by the way they disagree with you, how they fight for their beliefs: With vigor, passion, and conviction, but also with humility and grace. 
   He is a man of immense conviction. He has been unyielding in his commitment to reaffirm the priorities of the Church and his faith. 
   I am left with nothing but respect and admiration for the way in which Cardinal O'Connor has advocated on behalf of his beliefs. 
   John Cardinal O'Connor's life of spiritual service began decades ago. He had 20-plus years of distinguished service in the Armed Forces. He heeded our Nation's call in 1952, joining the ranks of the military chaplaincy during the Korean war, and provided spiritual leadership for members of the Navy and Marine Corps during Vietnam. His career continued on as chaplain to the United States Naval Academy. 
   Eventually he rose with distinction to become Navy chief chaplain. He served in that capacity until 1979, upon which he retired from military service with the distinguished rank of rear admiral. An international ambassador for humanity, Cardinal O'Connor has traveled the world over--Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia, and Russia--and he also accompanied Pope John Paul II on his visit to Cuba. 
   He has called on governments to work for social development, provide international peace, and implored governments to provide their citizens with the freedom and ability to exercise their religious beliefs. 
   His work in volatile 1980s Central America helped clear the way for clergy members to be allowed to visit political prisoners and also helped end  the expulsion of foreign missionaries. He has, with great resolve, worked to strengthen the human spirit whenever war, oppression, and poverty have threatened to weaken it, as a servant of the Roman Catholic Church and a compassionate American citizen. 
   Now the cardinal is ailing. We all pray and wish for his recovery. But there is no time more appropriate than now for the Congressional Gold Medal to be bestowed upon Cardinal O'Connor. It is not often that this gold medal is issued. But given the cardinal's service, given the cardinal's ability to reach out to so many different kinds of people, no one is more deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. The medal is an expression of public gratitude reserved exclusively for those who have distinguished themselves through their achievements and contributions to our great Nation. From his spiritual guidance to the members of the Armed Forces 50 years ago to his commitment to justice and holiness as head of the archdiocese in New York today, John Cardinal O'Connor has earned this rare and distinguished congressional honor. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will continue the remarks I made earlier about Cardinal O'Connor. 
   First, I thank Senator SANTORUM of Pennsylvania, as well as my colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, and his colleague, Senator SPECTER. The four of us have worked hard on this bill. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Cardinal O'Connor, of course, has had a distinguished career. He has had a distinguished career as a Catholic, rising to one of the great positions of the Catholic Church in America. 
   He also has had a distinguished career as an American, having served for many years in the Armed Forces. He served 20 years in the Armed Forces. In 1952, he joined the ranks of the military chaplaincy. During the Korean war, he provided spiritual leadership for the Navy and Marine Corps. He was Chaplain of the Naval Academy, became Navy Chief Chaplain, and left the Armed Forces with the rank of rear admiral. 
   I want to say, as someone of the Jewish faith, that the cardinal has been particularly effective in moving out to the people of the Jewish community and doing a great deal to bridge the gaps--which fortunately now are relatively small and minor--between the Catholic community and the Jewish community. He went out of his way to do this, which I greatly respect. 
   He has always been seen doing things for the poor. He has worked hard on making working conditions better for people. He cares about the plight of the farm workers. He is dedicated to protecting the rights of immigrants and, in fact, announced at his Labor Day mass as recently as September, his first public appearance after his surgery, a new archdiocesan program of aid to immigrants. He reached out to the poor. 
   His views on homosexuality are known, but he has spent time anonymously working with people with AIDS. I do not agree with his views, but I sure respect the fact that, without any fanfare, he has been able to do those things. 
   Of course, now he is ill, and that is one of the reasons I thank every one of my colleagues for moving this bill with alacrity because my State of New York and this entire Nation owe a debt of gratitude to Cardinal O'Connor. There is no more fitting way than presenting him with the gold medal. 
   For his compassion, for his strength of argument--which I agreed with many times; disagreed with sometimes--for his intelligence, and for his commitment to New York and to faith, very few would be more deserving of this medal than Cardinal O'Connor. 
   I again thank my colleagues. I thank this body for taking the time, in the middle of this bill, to honor the cardinal in a very fitting way. Our hopes and prayers are for his health, and our thanks are for the great job he has done for New York's Catholics, for all New Yorkers, and for all Americans. 
   With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, during the Civil Rights movement, Dr. Carter G. Woodson's idea of a Negro History Week honoring the achievements of African Americans was extended to the entire month of February. 
   I rise today as a Senator from the state with the largest population of African Americans in the United States to speak on behalf of this year's Black History Month theme ``Heritage and Horizons.'' Harlem, New York was the center of a 1930's Renaissance period. It attracted aspiring individuals from across the country and the world. It is also the birthplace of renowned African Americans who have excelled in the areas of politics and business, arts and entertainment, athletics and activism. 
   Since the expansion of the Negro History Week to Black History Month, countless African Americans continue to amass accomplishments and shatter barriers worthy of multiple months of tribute. Many of us know of the great strides made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Frederick Douglas, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, Ida B. Wells, and Rosa Parks. Many of the Members in this chamber have worked alongside Shirley Chisholm, Thurgood Marshall Sr., Charles Rangel, Clifford Alexander, Jr., and Colin Powell. 
   African Americans from New York have been pioneers in many different fields. In 1981, Pam McAllister Johnson was named publisher of Gannett's Ithaca (NY) Journal, making her the first African American woman to head a general circulation newspaper in the United States. In June 1995, Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a Harlem native, became the first African American appointed as president of the American Medical Association. American Express announced in February 1997 that Kenneth Chenault was named president and heir apparent to the position of CEO, making the Long Island native the highest-ranking African American executive in corporate America. 
   Art Hardwick, husband of Shirley Chisholm, won the 1962 State Assembly race becoming the first African American to represent Western New York. In 1971, Carmel C. Marr became the first woman of any race to serve as Commissioner of the New York State Public Service Commission. Harry Belafonte, a Harlem native, was recently honored at the Grammy's for his lifetime contributions as an actor and entertainer. Denzel Washington, born and raised in Mount Vernon, recently won a Golden Globe for his role in the movie Hurricane. The critically acclaimed author of The Women of Brewster Place, Gloria Naylor, hails from Queens, New York. 
   In 1957, New York City native Althea Gibson was the first African American woman to compete and win at the Wimbledon and Forest Hills. The following year, she repeated as the Wimbledon and U.S. National Tennis Champion. Former NBA coach and Brooklyn native, Lenny Wilkins, was voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for holding the NBA record for the most regular season victories by a coach. 
   Almost 70 years after the Renaissance began, New York continues to be the place where African American innovators and pioneers distinguish themselves, thereby continuing the Renaissance and enhancing our country.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise today to speak about George Daniels, who has just been confirmed as a Federal Judge in the Southern District of New York. 
   George Daniels is uniquely qualified to serve in this position. His work experience is as diverse and impressive as it gets: He has been a Legal Aid Defense Attorney and a prosecutor; he has worked at a top New York Law firm and served as a Law Professor; he worked in politics as Counsel to the Mayor of New York, and, of course, he has been a Judge--first on the Criminal Court of the City of New York and then as a Justice on the Supreme Court of the State of New York. I know he has the respect and the admiration from individuals on both sides of the aisle. 
   I am extremely pleased to see him confirmed as a Federal Judge. I know he will be an extraordinary addition to the Southern District of New York bench.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 4 years ago, Congress passed a landmark measure, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This bill was passed in an attempt to break down some of the regulatory barriers among various communications sectors. It is one of the sparks that ignited our booming new economy in this information technology age. 
   In New York especially, the 1996 law has created competition in local telephone networks, areas previously dominated by monopolies. After an 18 month marathon of hard work by the New York State Public Service Commission and a thorough review by the Federal Communications Commission, Bell Atlantic became the first Bell operating company in the country to offer long distance service. Already, nearly one million New Yorkers have exercised their right to choose a new local telephone company. Creative new packages of local/long distance and ``all distance'' telecom services are being offered by many different carriers. To date, there are more than 350 competitive local exchange carriers, CLECs, in the country that are able to provide local telephone service, furthering consumer choice options. 
   Competition and innovation is working as we intended with the Telecom Act, and our experience in New York is proof positive. 
   I commend Bell Atlantic, the newer carriers on the scene, and our own New York State Public Service Commission Chairman Maureen Helmer and her team for their hard work in bringing the benefits of competition to all New Yorkers. It has been well worth the effort, and provides a valuable road map to competition for other States.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my friend from Arizona, Senator KYL, a high tech crime bill aimed at combating computer crime. For the past nine months I have been discussing with law enforcement and computer crime experts how best to address the growing threat that computer crimes pose to our increasingly networked society. 
   Many of the best solutions are far-reaching and complex and will only be achieved through sustained and thoughtful hard work on an international level by both government and the private sector in the years ahead. There are, however, modes changes to existing laws that can be made now, which will serve as a significant first step in a much-needed effort to give law enforcement to tools they need to effectively fight cybercrime. The legislation that Senator KYL and I are introducing today will, among other things, make the following changes to existing law. 
   We must update our laws governing the use of what are called pen registers (which record the numbers dialed on a phone line) and trap and trace devices (which capture incoming electronic impulses that identify the originating number). These laws have become outdated and their procedures are too slow for the speed of criminals online. 
   Under current law, investigators must obtain a trap and trace order in each jurisdiction through which an electronic communication is made. Thus, for example, to trace on online communication between two terrorists that starts at a computer in New York, goes through a server in New Jersey, bounces off a computer in Wisconsin, and then ends in San Francisco, investigators may be forced to go successively to a court in each jurisdiction for an order permitting the trace (not to mention having to approach each provider along the way). In the recent Denial of Service attacks, hackers utilized dozens or even hundreds of ``zombie'' computers from which the attacks on specific sites were then launched. No doubt, these computers were located all over the country. and tracing them quickly under current law is therefore virtually impossible. 
   This legislation will amend current law to authorize the issuance of a single order to completely trace an online communication to its source, regardless of how many intermediate sites it passes through. Law enforcement must still meet the exact same burden to obtain such an order; the only difference is that they will not have to repeat this process over and over each time a communication passes to a new carrier in a different Jurisdiction. 
   One deficiency of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.C.C. &#167;1030, is its requirement of proof of damages in excess of $5,000. In several cases, prosecutors have found that while computer intruders had attempted to harm computers vital to our critical infrastructures, such as telecommunications and financial services, damages of $5,000 could not be proven. Nevertheless, these intrusions pose a great risk of harm to our country and must be prosecuted, punished, and deterred. 
   The Schumer-Kyl bill will unambiguously permit federal jurisdiction at the outset of an unauthorized intrusion into critical infrastructure systems rather than having investigators wait for any damage assessment. Crimes that exceed the $5,000 limit will be prosecuted as felonies, 
   while crimes below that amount will be defined as misdemeanors. The bill will also clarify that a $5,000 loss resulting from a computer attack may include the costs of responding to the offense, conducting a damage assessment, restoring a system to its original condition, and any lost revenue or costs incurred as a result of an interruption in service. The $5,000 requirement should not serve as a barrier to the prosecution of serious computer criminals who threaten our country's networks. 
   This legislation will also modify a directive to the sentencing commission contained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1999, which required a mandatory minimum sentence of six months' imprisonment for certain violations of section 1030. Computer intrusions that violate the statute vary in their severity and maliciousness. All violations should be punished, but under the current regime the mandatory imprisonment applies to some misdemeanor charges, even where the attack caused no damage. As a result, some prosecutors have declined to bring cases, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment. We should insure that federal prosecutors are bringing cases under section 1030, but we also should insure that the sentences being meted out fit the crime.  
   Often the most technologically savvy individuals are juveniles who have grown up with computers always at their fingertips. Unfortunately, certain juveniles are committing the most serious computer crimes and wreaking havoc on our critical infrastructures. For example, one juvenile hacker caused an airport in Worcester, Massachusetts to shut down for over six hours when its telecommunications connections were brought down. Similarly, two California teenagers broke into sensitive military computers, including those at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the U.S. Air Force. 
   As a longer term strategy, we need to do a better job of teaching our children from a very young age that, like anywhere else, certain conduct on the Internet is wrong and illegal. But we also need to send a clear message that crimes on the Internet will have real consequences. This legislation will amend 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030 to give federal law enforcement authorities the power to investigate and prosecute juvenile offenders of computer crimes in appropriate cases. The bill will make juveniles fifteen years of age or older who commit the most serious violations of section 1030 eligible for federal prosecution in cases where the Attorney General certifies that such prosecution is appropriate. In conjunction with the elimination of the six-month mandatory minimum, this legislation will provide a balanced, measured approach to juvenile hacking crimes. 
   Again, these are just the first steps that should be taken in a very long battle against cybercrime that many of us will wage for years to come. And while we fight computer crime by modifying our criminal laws, we also should seek concomitant ways to fully protect the fundamental rights of innocent individuals on the Internet. 
   I want to thank Senator KYL for joining me in introducing this bill. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, I know that he cares deeply about these issues and I look forward to working with him on this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank both the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Minnesota who was gracious to yield time. 
   Mr. President, I do not profess to be an expert on the bill that my good friend, the Senator from Georgia, has introduced. I came on the floor because it seems to me that education is not only the No. 1 issue that most Americans feel is important, but it is the No. 1 issue that is facing the future of our country. 
   We have a huge number of different problems in education. We have overcrowded classrooms. My children attend the public schools in New York City, I am proud to say. I am proud to say they are getting a good education. When my daughter was in kindergarten, she had to share that kindergarten room with another class. We have a desperate shortage of classrooms. We have a desperate shortage of teachers coming forward. The average age of a teacher in America is 50 years or older. Every year we are going to need more and more teachers in our schools. 
   We have a desperate shortage of standards. All too often people graduate from course work and can't carry the load. In an economy where education and knowledge seem to be so important, we don't have any good Federal ideas on what to do. There are some who might say we don't need Federal ideas. I don't question the right to debate this proposal, nor do I doubt what the Senator from Georgia has said in that it will help lots of families. I am aware of the problem. 
   I introduced legislation, along with the Senator from Maine, to make college tuition up to $12,000 tax deductible because of the strain. It is another way to go. It might benefit some families more than the legislation of the Senator from Georgia. It might benefit some families less. But it is along the same line. 
   But I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts. Why are we doing this piece of legislation, worthy though it may be, when we have all these issues out there? Why aren't we taking a month? It is certainly worth our Nation's future to take a month and debate all the educational issues, see where our priorities are, and see if this proposal from the Senator from Georgia, into which he has put a lot of effort and a lot of work, comes at the top, the middle, or the bottom of our priorities. Is it going to do more than spending the same amount of money on new classrooms or new teachers or mentor training? Is it going to do more than, say, raising teachers' salaries because it is awfully hard in large part in this country to get a qualified person to teach our young people math and science when the private sector pays them double. Is it worth more than having our National Standards Board come up with real national standards, and should we be debating that issue? 
   These are questions that I think are vital to the future of our country and to the future of this Chamber. 
   These are questions that get to the very heart of a fundamental principle with which I think most Americans agree. We want to stay the No. 1 economic power in the year 2025. 
   In my judgment, to bring up one particular issue that stands in isolation and not be allowed to debate the whole panoply of educational issues and vote on them together as a package is not how a good business would operate. 
   It is not how a good volunteer organization would set its priorities. A family sitting around the dinner table would not say let's just discuss vacation in our budget and then not discuss what we have to pay for food, for shelter, and for transportation. 
   Again, I respect my friend from Georgia. We have worked together on many  pieces of legislation. He is sincere in this effort. I simply say to my colleagues, this is no way to come up with a real and desperately needed education policy in 21st century America. 
   I thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to rise alongside my distinguished colleagues Senators MOYNIHAN, SPECTER, SANTORUM, BAYH, BROWNBACK, DURBIN, LANDRIEU, and STEVENS, to honor the enormous contributions made by John Cardinal O'Connor to religion, humanity, international relations, and service to America, by bestowing upon him the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   I believe this simple gesture would be our opportunity, as members of Congress, as representatives of this nation, to thank his Eminence for the care, compassion, and spiritual guidance that he has provided to millions of people throughout his lifetime. The work he has done from the treasured St. Patrick's Cathedral has reinforced the traditional teaching and practices of the Roman Catholic church, and helped bring to life the spirit and mission of the Vatican. 
   Since being ordained 54 years ago, John Cardinal O'Connor has dedicated his life to the noblest of deeds, that of service. He has been an advocate of the poor, the sick, the elderly, and America's young children. He has heeded his country's call to service, serving first as a military chaplain, and rising, with distinction, to become Navy Chief Chaplain. He has served as an international ambassador, traveling the world over, Israel, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Russia, as a messenger of peace, humanity, and freedom. Wherever war, oppression, and poverty have threatened to weaken the human spirit, he has been there--a tireless servant of the Roman Catholic church and as an American citizen. 
   With the recent celebration of his 80th birthday, and the prospects of his retirement growing, it is truly the proper time for America to pay tribute to John Cardinal O'Connor. Last week, the members of the House overwhelmingly supported similar legislation, introduced by Congressman FOSSELLA, by a 413 to 1 vote. It is my hope that this legislation will receive similar support here in the Senate, and that all of our colleagues will join us in this effort.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to the use of block grants in education spending. 
   First, education is clearly the No. 1 issue this body, our Government, and our country will face in the next decade. We have huge educational problems. We are now an ideas economy. Alan Greenspan put it best. He said: High value is no longer added by moving things but by thinking things, that it is an idea that produces value. 
   In that kind of time and place, what could be more important than education? In an ideas economy, for America to have a mediocre educational system, which is what we have now, is a very real crisis. If we continue to be rated 15th, 16th, 17th among the educational systems of the OECD Western countries, the 22 countries in North America, Asia, and Europe, we are not going to stay the greatest country in the world by the time 2025 or 2050 rolls around. Fortunately, because of our democratic system and our free enterprise system, because of the great entrepreneurial nature of America, because we accept ambitious and intelligent people from all over the world to come here and grow and prosper, we have a little lead time but not much. 
   Our educational system is at a critical point. Over the next decade, for instance, high school enrollment will increase by 11 percent. Schools will need  to hire 2.2 million public schoolteachers. Over 50 percent of the teachers are over 50 years old. Every day more than 14 million children will attend schools in need of extensive repair and replacement, and 12 percent of all newly hired teachers who enter the workforce will enter without any training at all. That will be even higher in 
   math and science, computer science, engineering, and languages, the kinds of things for which we need people. 
   So with the crisis upon us, all of a sudden we have a new proposal: a block grant. A block grant is exactly what we don't need to improve the educational system. A block grant is something that gives the school districts more money and doesn't direct them on how to spend it. 
   I find there is a contradiction among so many of my friends who are strong advocates of block grants. They say the educational system is poor. I agree in many instances. They say we spend too much money and waste too much money on education. Then they say: Give those same localities, without any direction, more money. 
   They can't have it both ways. Either the localities are doing a good job and need more money, which they are not professing because they really don't think they need more money, or the localities are doing a bad job and to give them more money makes very little sense at all. 
   The notion that we should take Federal dollars, which have been used to raise academic standards, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, hold schools accountable, and send them in an unmarked paper bag to the Governors breaks our commitment to help communities and parents across the country. Block grants are a blank check from the Federal Government. They fundamentally make no sense. They are bad government policy. 
   I am sure many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would agree with me that to separate the taxing authority and the spending authority makes no sense. The spending authority for that spending, if they don't have to raise the taxes, painful as that is, is not going to spend it as wisely as somebody who knows how important those dollars are. 
   Sometimes I think we would be a lot better off eliminating the block grant program and giving the money back to the taxpayers rather than the Federal Government taxing and then giving this blank check to the locality and letting them spend it. 
   A block grant is poor government policy to begin with because it separates the spending power from the taxing power. In education, it is even worse. We hear clamor in the land that the local school districts are not doing a good job. I have sympathy for those local school districts. First, they are so busy minute to minute and day to day trying to run a school system. They are up to their necks. Second, their only spending power is from the property tax--justifiably the most hated tax in America--so they can't raise new dollars. 
   I have sympathy for those local school districts, but we all agree they are not doing as good a job as they might. The irony is that my colleagues from the other side of the aisle would probably say it is not more money. It is wasted money. Yet here we are, giving them more money. 
   In today's global ideas-based economy, we cannot afford to have an atomized educational system. Instead, the trend must be for local, State, and Federal governments to work together with families and communities. What is very interesting about any public good is that there is no capitalism. Good ideas don't spread on their own. If someone invented a new heart valve in San Diego, it would spread to Boston in an hour. Why? Someone would sell it. That is what America is all about. But when a new educational innovation develops in one school district, it doesn't spread, frankly, because there is no capitalism. 
   The appropriate role of the Federal Government in education is to find what works and, on a matching grant basis, say to the locality, this is a program that works. We will pay half or three-quarters of the cost because we know you are strapped based on these high property taxes. You pay some and use it. We are not requiring you to use it. I don't like mandates. We are giving you the opportunity to use it because we have seen it works in some areas. 
   When I was working on the crime bill, this is what we did. We found there were, again, programs that worked. 
   Community policing: Wichita, KS, had developed community policing and done it well. 
   But it hadn't spread to Topeka. So I put in a bill when I was chairman of the Crime Subcommittee in the other body and I said let's give the localities money to do community policing on a matching grant basis. The President came in, and in his usual intelligent and astute way on these matters, said let's call it ``100,000 cops on the beat.'' So we did and it has worked. It changed policing in America. 
   Without that program, we would not have had community policing. But the Federal Government played the appropriate role--finding a good idea, giving money as an incentive to help spread the idea--not 100 percent; that is a bad idea, not even 90 percent. Then it is like a block grant with no strings attached and money gets wasted. And then they let it happen. It is not bureaucracy that is the problem in Federal aid to education, as some who support the block grant would say. Only one-half of 1 percent of Federal aid to schools is spent on administration. The States use an additional 4 percent. All the rest, 95 1/2 percent, goes to local school districts. It is not bureaucracy at all. In fact, the claims of those who spin stories of a grand Federal education bureaucracy ring hollow. In a letter written to the President by the House Committee on Education in the Workforce in 1997, the committee majority listed 760 so-called educational programs. They said we have too many. Combine them. 
   Look at the programs they call ``educational'' programs: Boating safety financial assistance, Air Force defense research sciences, biological response to environmental health hazards, financial assistance for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
   Those are not educational programs. In truth, the Federal Government provides, on average, only 7 percent of all K-through-12 educational funding. It is the State and local communities that should and do maintain control over educational priorities. But what Washington can do is help communities meet certain reform priorities when their budgets are stretched too thin. Again, if the system isn't working, why give more money with no strings attached to the very localities that we think can do better? Why not do it in a way that directs them? Sure, the local school board wants free money. Fine. Let them raise taxes and do it for themselves. Don't let us put more burden on the Federal taxpayers to do it. 
   Proponents of the block grants argue strenuously that control should be returned to the localities. But the irony here is the block grants would not return power to the communities; rather, it shifts control of the Federal funding away from parents and communities and gives it to politicians--Governors and the State legislature. This is the antithesis of local control. 
   What I would like to do before I conclude is look at a couple of examples of block grant proposals. The Straight A's Act gives the States and the Governors the authority to combine into a block grant Federal funds from 10 educational programs. More than 80 percent of all Federal support to elementary and secondary education will be included in the block grant. This sounds to me like LEA. I remember Law Enforcement Assistance--a block grant to law enforcement. That is the area in which I have the most expertise. Do you know what they did when no strings were attached? One police department bought a tank; another police department bought an airplane to take the police officers back and forth to Washington--I think it was a jet-- all with block grant money. If we do this Straight A's Program, 
   we will be back on the floor of the Senate a year or two later pointing out horror stories of how the taxpayers' money was wasted. 
   Under Straight A's, parents, teachers, principals, and school boards would no longer have a say in how the Federal dollars are spent. Schools would no longer be accountable for results and national priorities, such as funding for the neediest students and better teachers. New school buildings could be put aside for more salaries for administrators. If this program gets straight  A's, I would like to see what the curve is in that classroom. 
   The Senate Health Committee intends to mark up a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the next few weeks. I am concerned to learn that the bill currently includes a block grant for teacher quality and professional development, programs to reduce class size and Goals 2000. Yes, we need qualified teachers and smaller classes. They produce the best results for children. But with the committee bill, there is no guarantee that class size reduction or teacher development will be done well, or even done at all. 
   I ask my colleagues to look at the proposal that Senator KENNEDY is putting together. His leadership on this issue has been extraordinary. His proposal does not intend to dictate to localities what they must do or impose new mandates on localities. Rather, it says, here are our Federal priorities; do you want to be part of them? They include smaller class size and new school construction. Fine. You are going to match our dollars. If you don't want to be part of them, keep doing the same old thing, but not with Federal dollars, Federal taxpayer money, which gives you a free ride. 
   I hope my colleagues will look at Senator KENNEDY's proposal and will examine the folly of block grants. I look forward to the debate that may come on education in the near future. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Before the Senator moves on to the investment part, I think the points the Senator from Illinois is making are astounding. To me, particularly our friends in the business community, and all of the American people, ought to look at what the Senator from Illinois has said--deficits, biggest paydown ever--the usual criteria that conservatives use for how big and encroaching Government is, smaller than it has been in three decades, smaller under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan. 
   To reiterate, because the facts are astounding, Government spending as a share of the economy went from 21.6 percent in 1980 to 22.2 percent in 1992. Under President Clinton, it has gone from 22.2 percent to 18.7 percent, which is lower than it has been under any year in 30 years and under Ronald Reagan. 
   Taxes and the number of jobs in the Federal Government are lower than anytime since 1966. 
   If you went to the business leaders and asked them what the Senator from Illinois is talking about, they would say no. The message sent to the business community in the budget of this last year of the Clinton Presidency is that the fiscally responsible party is the Democrats; we believe in investment. I know what the Senator is talking about. But we also believe in tightening the belt of Government. No one has done a better job of that than the President between 1993 and the present. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding. I just wanted to underscore that point.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for asking me. Yes. 
   What we are trying to do overall, as the Senator from Illinois has stated in his proposal the President is trying to do and we are supporting, is not a huge across-the-board tax cut, which generally benefits the wealthiest people, the people who need it the least, but, rather, targeted tax cuts for the middle class. 
   The Senator has correctly pointed out, for instance, long-term care. My parents are 76 and 71 years of age. Thank God--knock on wood--they are in decent health. But they were debating the other week whether to pay a massive amount of money down now, which is hard for them to afford, so they will get long-term care if, God forbid, they become ill in later life. 
   The proposal I have been championing--I am delighted and grateful that the President has put it in his proposal--another burden that middle-class families have is waking up at 2 a.m. in the morning worrying about young families who have kids who are about to go to a clinic. 
   We all know that college is a necessity these days if you want your children and grandchildren to have a better life. Yet it is so expensive. Tuition has gone up more than any other portion of the family budget--over 250 percent since 1980. Even for a family that is making $50,000 or $60,000 a year, people are often neglected by the Government, and neglected by the kind of grandiose tax plans we have seen from the other side. College tuition bills bring shivers down their spine. 
   What we are saying, at the very least, is that Uncle Sam ought not take his cut. If you are going to pay for tuition, which is good for your children but also good for America--you ought to be allowed to deduct that, or take a tax cut, whichever you prefer. This for the first time brings relief to middle-class families who really do not need the Government day to day but who are worried about the big financial nugget such as long-term care and such as paying for college tuition. Our proposal would benefit them in ways they have never seen. 
   This is again a theme of the budget--not a broad, across-the-board tax cut that will benefit the top 5 percent, at most, and give a few crumbs to the struggling middle class but, rather, target that part of the middle class. There is no better target than college tuition. 
   I thank the Senator for asking me to extrapolate on that point.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota a question. In his questions to the Senator from Illinois, he has pointed out the core of this budget is balance. It is a balanced budget in the traditional sense that we are not spending more than we bring in. In fact, we are doing the opposite, by paying down the debt. However, it is also balanced in terms of the needs of the American people. 
   The No. 1 priority we have is to save Social Security by buying down the debt; second, target tax cuts for middle-class people who need help. They don't need help day to day. People are doing fine making $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 a year, but they do need help with the big financial notes such as college tuition costs and long-term care. 
   Finally, spend in a careful way in areas where we have to, such as education, where everyone knows we have to do better. I know the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, has been a leader on this issue. I am sure we will hear from her. 
   I ask the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, in his years of experience, has he seen a budget as balanced as this, that cares for the American people in a thoughtful, rational way, that is built on a platform of prudent Government responsibility?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment along with Senators SNOWE and REID, JEFFORDS, FEINSTEIN, LEAHY, MURRAY, KENNEDY, LAUTENBERG, and DURBIN to ensure justice is served for those who willfully and gleefully thumb their noses at clinic protection laws by feigning bankruptcy. This amendment makes debts incurred as a result of acts of clinic violence nondischargeable under the bankruptcy code, and it does this clearly and unequivocally. In other words, this amendment will hold the perpetrators of clinic violence responsible for the damage they incur when they imperil, through either violence or intimidation, a woman's legal right to choose. 
   The history of this amendment goes back several years. Before 1994, a woman's right to choose, guarded carefully by the Supreme Court, was imperiled. That is because a small and radical minority sought to intimidate, to harass, and ultimately commit violence against clinics that offered women their right, their constitutional right for an abortion. 
   The chart tells the story. Acts of violence were way up, to 437. It reached its peak in 1993. Acts of disruption went to 3,379 and blockades, including arrests, went to 3,885. In many parts of this country a constitutional right--whether one agrees with it or not--was being prohibited by a very small minority who believed their view was more important than our democratically chosen, American people chosen view. 
   As a result, this body, in a fine moment, gathered together and said the rule of law must prevail whatever our views, pro-choice or pro-life. I was sponsor of the FACE Act in the House. Senator KENNEDY was the sponsor of the FACE Act in the Senate. Very simply, it said this kind of violence and intimidation had to stop. The major tool it used was to give these beleaguered clinics the right to sue those who committed violence. 
   It was a proud moment on the floor of this body when, with strong bipartisan support and strong support across pro-choice and pro-life lines, this amendment was agreed to, 69-30, in 1994. It was a proud moment for me in the House when I joined with my friend, Congressman HENRY HYDE--perhaps the leading voice of true conviction on the pro-life side--to support this amendment. Congressman HYDE knew that America depended on the rule of law. 
   The act had dramatic effects. If you look at the statistics, acts of violence went down, from 437 in 1993 to 113 in 1998. Similarly, acts of disruption went down, from 3,379 down to 2,600. The law was working. But, unfortunately, that extreme few has found a new way to avoid the law and threaten the kind of stasis, the kind of peace, the kind of coming together we had found in this body. What they have done is, when they get a judgment against the type of violence depicted here, they declare bankruptcy and the law cannot be enforced against them. 
   Randal Terry has $1.6 million in judgments against him. So far not a nickel has been collected. Flip Benham brags he will never pay a cent. 
   Perhaps the most extreme is the case of the Nuremberg Files, which has, today, its 1-year anniversary of a jury verdict of $109 million against those who put it together. The Nuremberg Files was a group of extremists. They published the names of doctors and accused them of murder. They published the addresses where their children went to school. Their graphic on the computer had blood dripping from the pictures of the 
   doctors. They published the name of Dr. Slepian, who was murdered, and after a doctor was injured they put the name in gray. After a doctor was killed, as in Dr. Slepian's case, from my State of New York, up in Buffalo, they put an X through the name. 
   Because of their activities, because of the ``wanted'' posters, where three doctors were killed once they put out ``wanted'' posters, a Federal court in Oregon urged the judgment against them. That judgment, the jury verdict, was 1 year ago today. 
   What did the defendants in that case do? The judge knew they would try to clean themselves of their assets and divest them. So the judge ordered them not to divest themselves of their assets. In each case, 2 or 3 days before they were to come to the court for a disposition of how they were going to pay their fine, they went back to their home States and declared bankruptcy. This horrible, horrible situation was compounded by the use of a bankruptcy law that no one in this body or anywhere else intended to be for that purpose. 
   This is what the attorney for the defendants in the Nuremberg Files case said:  
   The jury charge in this case created a negligence standard for threats. The charge on punitive damages embraces reckless or malicious conduct and my understanding is that reckless conduct does not preclude a discharge in bankruptcy.  
   Anyone who says our present laws cover this horrible situation and the many others like it ought to listen to the very lawyer in the Nuremberg Files case. 
   So no money has been collected, not only from the Nuremberg Files defendants but from all the others who are laughing at our law. They have gone back to their States and now the whole issue will be litigated again. Because we do not have a law, they will debate again whether the conduct was reckless--which is what the lawyers claim the jury verdict called for--or whether it was violent, in which case it would be covered by present law. 
   So the reason we are here today, the reason this vote has been so contested, is because a major tenet of our democracy is at stake--the rule of law. We talked about the rule of law last year at this time in this Chamber. If there was ever a case that cried out for  Democrats and Republicans coming together, for pro-choice and pro-life people coming together, it is this very case. 
   Let me answer a few questions that have been brought up about this amendment. First, is this a move by the pro-choice movement to move the goalposts? Absolutely not. My lead cosponsor on the Democratic side, Senator REID, is probably the foremost advocate on the pro-life side on our side. I respect his view. HENRY HYDE supported the FACE law. Others who disagree with my view on choice have also come to support FACE and the amendment. It is not pro-life or pro-choice, it is pro rule of law. It is pro-American. 
   Second, some say it is already covered by the willful and malicious exception in the bankruptcy law. It is true that if there is a willful, intentional, malicious tort, it might be covered by the bankruptcy law. But it would have to go to each bankruptcy court, as in the Nuremberg Files case, after the judgment. Without our statute, it would have to go back to each bankruptcy court in the State and be litigated. Then there would be one determination or another. 
   But what about these types of cases? What about situations where there is reckless conduct but not malicious conduct? The lawyer in the Nuremberg Files matter--clearly conduct we wish to prohibit--said it was reckless, not malicious, and would not be covered by the exception in the bankruptcy law. 
   What about the case where there is no intent? Thousands come and blockade a clinic but they say: My intent was not to create any violence. Then you would have to prove, for each one of those defendants, their own intent, a next to impossible job. 
   What about contempt orders? Everyone agrees that contempt orders are not covered by the exception. 
   So for anyone to argue the present law covers this, I say two things to you: No, it does not. And if you believe it does, there is no reason not to make sure that it does by passing our amendment. 
   How about some from the other side who argue bankruptcy should not be used to promote public policy? We are not promoting public policy. In fact, it is those who have declared bankruptcy after committing terrible acts who are seeking to use the bankruptcy code for public policy goals. The bankruptcy code was never intended that way. What we are doing by this amendment is protecting the bankruptcy code from those who seek to twist it and turn it and use it for their goals in public policy. In fact, we have done it before in this Chamber. We did it, with almost unanimous support, for drunken drivers. There is an exception in the code for that. It is a horrible thing--so is this. 
   I argue one more thing to my colleagues. This is the first time we have had an organized movement in America that seeks to use the bankruptcy code for these purposes. They tell people how to declare bankruptcy. One of the major organizations says you have to be judgment proof before you can join it. I have never seen that before in this country--I don't think anyone has--where an organized group seeks to subvert the law and then tells its members you can avoid its consequences by declaring bankruptcy. 
   One final question. I do not know if my colleagues from the other side will have an amendment similar to this. The Senator from Iowa is shaking his head no. But we have not seen one so far, and the amendment can only argue one of two things.

   Mr. SCHUMER. He doesn't know. I appreciate my friend's candor, although we have been debating this. This amendment came up in the Judiciary Committee in October or November and we do not know. But I argue to my colleagues, whatever you think of the other amendment, if it covers this it cannot hurt to have this one. If it does not cover it, we need it. 
   I do not have any predisposition, having not seen the amendment, whether you vote for or against an alternative. But voting for or against that alternative will not solve the problem. Voting yes or no on this amendment will. 
   In conclusion, this amendment and this debate--on its surface about somewhat arcane provisions in the bankruptcy law--is what America is all about. We have always had people with deeply felt views. The bishop in my community every month says the Rosary in front of an abortion clinic. 
   I disagree with his views. Bishop Daily is a fine man. I would defend his right to do that. I would vote for legislation that would allow him to do that. 
   We have always had people in America of strongly held views, but every so often we have people whose views not only are strongly held but who believe because they believe it, they should subvert the will of the American people, they should take the law into their own hands. 
   This happened shortly after the founding of the Republic. It happened throughout the 19th century. It happened throughout the 20th century. Every time that has happened, the Members of this distinguished body have risen and said we must defend the rule of law because nothing is more sacred to America. 
   People have uttered courageous speeches on the floor of this Chamber about that, even if they did not agree with the specific view. This is one such moment. 
   The vote is close. It is neck and neck. The Vice President has graciously agreed to interrupt his schedule to be here because the vote is so close and because this bill and this amendment is so important. 
   I urge my colleagues to look into your hearts and souls. You walk with America. We do it every day in this Chamber. Do not turn your back on what you know is right. Do not turn your back on the rule of law. Do not turn your back on what our Founding Fathers shed blood for, which is the right of a democracy to make its own decisions and not have a small band of people, for whatever reason, take decisions into their own hands. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Let me explain to the Senator from Iowa what happened, and I realize he has not intended to cast stones. 
   I have been lobbying Members on this vote for the last several weeks. As the Senator knows, this amendment held up the bankruptcy bill from being voted on last year because many of us felt so strongly about it.  
   As of yesterday, it looked as if the vote was dead even. That is the count we have. Last night, I called the Vice President and said: It looks dead even. You make a decision, but it is an important issue to us. And he determined to come back. It has nothing to do with theater. It has nothing to do with, frankly, the politics of this campaign. It has to do with the fact that so many of us consider the FACE law--both pro-life and pro-choice--so important that we could not bear to see it undermined, particularly if it lost by a very narrow margin. 
   I do not know what the vote will be. I do not know what kind of arm twisting will go on between now and then. I do know there has been dramatic resistance to this amendment which held up a bill that large numbers of people on both sides of the aisle wanted very much to have come to the floor last year, and I think the remarks of the Senator from Iowa do not fit the facts in this situation regarding the Vice President. 
   I thank him for the graciousness of yielding.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I greatly respect my friend from Utah, who is a fine legislator and a fine human being. He is just dead wrong on this. Let me just answer this. He said we don't need this law, first, because the present code covers it. CRS, which is hardly known as either a pro-life or a pro-choice organization, is respected for their analysis and they say in a memorandum of June 8:  
   We conclude, for the reasons discussed below, that the Schumer proposal, which would add a new subsection 19 to 523(a), is far broader in scope and would encompass a far wider range of potential debtor liability than is currently covered by 523(a)(6).  
   Don't rely on Senator HATCH, don't rely on Senator SCHUMER, but on 523. One other point. The Senator from Utah says everything is covered. Let's hear what the attorney said in that Nuremberg Files case, that horrible and devastating case--so bad that a jury in Oregon awarded $109 million in damages, realizing what has happened in America in terms of the death of doctors. Here is what the lawyer said:  
   Your clients are nothing more than nonpriority, unsecured judgment creditors, with other judgment creditors ahead of them ..... even a car loan has priority over your judgment.  
   Let me repeat that so maybe my friend from Utah can hear me in the  Cloakroom: ``..... even a car loan has priority over your judgment.'' 
   Is that what we wanted in the present law? No, absolutely not. The record is clear. There are certain instances where the present law would cover it--narrow instances, and even in those cases, you would have to go all the way back to bankruptcy court and relitigate. But in many of these cases, the law is not clear, and in every one of these cases, you make them litigate two, three, four times. We know what the policy of these violent extremists is. It is to delay and delay and delay. They should not be allowed to use the bankruptcy code to do that. 
   One other point. I think my good friend from Iowa said, well, it doesn't stop violence. That might be done by pro-choice groups. 
   Not so. If a pro-choice group were to decide to blockade a clinic, or threaten a doctor, or use violence because they did not like what that clinic was doing, they would be equally subject to the law. 
   The reason that statement is so absurd is because we don't have a grand movement on the pro-choice side seeking to use violence. Read the works of Randal Terry and Flip Benham and everybody else. They believe because they are morally superior to the rest of us that they have the right to take the law into their own hands and use violence.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say in conclusion to my colleagues that this is an extremely important amendment to keep a bipartisan law, the FACE law, alive and well. If we don't pass this amendment, there will be hundreds and hundreds of instances where people perpetrate violence, and violate the FACE law, and they will not be held accountable. 
   Let me repeat again what the Nuremberg Files people, who list Members of this body as people who ought to be looked at, say:  
   The judgment in this case, in my view, is not only ..... non-priority unsecured debt but fully dischargeable debt. 
   Even a car loan has priority over your judgment.  
   That makes a mockery of the rule of law in this country. This is not a pro-choice or a pro-life law. This is the law that says those who seek violence, threat, and intimidation against legal clinics in America because they somehow feel they have a moral superiority to every one of us will be punished for their actions. 
   It is a desperately needed proposal. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I reiterate to my colleagues how important this amendment is. Six years ago, the rule of law was challenged in this country because some who believed that they had more moral authority than the rest of us could take the law into their own hands and commit acts of violence against clinics, against doctors, against health care workers. They could harass; they could threaten; they could blockade, because they thought they had more moral authority than the rest of us. 
   The FACE law, a bipartisan law even supported by Henry Hyde, caused that violence to decline significantly. Now they have found a new way against these clinics; that is, once a judgment is made against them because they have violated the law, to hide behind the false shield of bankruptcy. 
   We will see violence increase. We will see a woman's right to choose impinged upon if we don't pass the Schumer-Reid-Snowe-Jeffords amendment. This is not an issue of simply pro-choice or pro-life. This is an issue about violence against women. This is an issue about the rule of law in America. I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer amendment and preserve a woman's right to make her own decision on the issue of choice.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, not only for the generous yielding of time but for his thoughtful remarks--as always. I think the name ``SARBANES'' and the word ``thoughtful'' are almost attached in this body, and with good reason. 
   I rise today in full support of the nomination of Alan Greenspan. I do it for a whole variety of reasons. Before I get into those reasons, I am holding something in my hand. Senator GRAMM's staff gave us the application of a man of such gravity and success and magnitude, it is kind of funny to hold an application where he lists his schooling. Even on the last page, there is a section that says ``qualifications,'' why he would be a good Chairman of the Federal Reserve. But he begins by saying, ``I have been an economist for almost half a century.'' One does not have to read this application, fortunately, to know of Chairman Greenspan's merit to be renominated as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
   First, I am proud personally, and I know the other representatives of my State are proud, because Alan Greenspan is one of New York's contributions to the national economy. He is a true New Yorker, born in the Bronx, attended George Washington High School, got his B.S., M.A., and Ph.D. from NYU. When you think about it, the two men who have had their hand on the economic tiller for a large part of the past decade, Bob Rubin and Alan Greenspan, are both New Yorkers. We are proud of our contribution. We have always been proud, in New York, that we send men and women around the country in so many different fields who make real contributions to America. Sometimes America does not recognize it as much as we would want, but it is true. I think there can be no one we can be more proud of, at least in the last decade, than Alan Greenspan. 
   Alan Greenspan is the perfect man for the job. He is thoughtful. I regularly eat breakfast with him at the Fed. I will never forget the first time we had breakfast together. I really didn't know him that well. He had been Chairman of the Fed for maybe 3 or 4 months. 
   I said, ``Mr. Chairman, how do you like the job?'' 
   He said, ``I love it.'' 
   ``What do you like best about it?'' 
   His eyes lit up. He rubbed his hands together, and he said, ``The data.'' 
   That, I think, is at the root of Alan Greenspan's great success as Chairman of the Fed--his knowledge. He knows the economy. He is a careful man. Those of us who have sat in the Banking Committee, both in the Senate and the House, as I did before I was lucky enough to become a Senator, know he is a careful thinker--almost too careful sometimes, when we ask questions. But that is his job, not to reveal too much. At the root of his merit for the position is the fact that he believes knowledge should guide his decisions, the data should guide his decisions. 
   He has also been a very careful Chairman of the Fed, and that is a job where care is important. I was always opposed to some of the people in my party who wanted to tie the hands of the Fed or subject the Fed to more popular whim because, frankly, monetary policy is one of those areas of policy that should have some distance from the popular whim. That is because monetary policy takes a while; it takes a while to formulate, and then it takes a while to have its effect once it 
   is implemented. To have it subject to the political vicissitudes and whims to too great an extent would be a tragedy and would make no sense for this country. 
   In fact, I always marvel at the genius of our Founding Fathers in setting up the structure of merit. But one of the great additions that was made was made in 1912 or 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was finally established. Over the years, we have seen the merit to that system. Yes, there is some popular control, but there is also some distance. I think Chairman Greenspan understands that very well. 
   There is a third reason I think he makes such a fine Chairman. 
   I ask unanimous consent I be given 3 additional minutes.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Not only his thought and care but his solid and sound judgment. The Chairman told me, and he said it repeatedly, he always had a slight lean towards combating inflation. It was not an ideological lean, as opposed to stimulating the economy or combating inflation. But he always said, once you let the genie out of the bottle, it is very hard to get it back. So he erred on the side of caution in terms of letting the economy overheat. My goodness, has that served us well during his 12 years as Chairman. 
   His steadiness, his intelligence, his judgment, his thoughtful care, his  knowledge, all add up to the fact that this is a wonderful day, not only for him--and I hope he will be approved unanimously by this body. This should not be a nomination where ideology--I think he is a Republican, actually. I think he served in the Council of Economic Advisers under, I guess it was President Ford. It is not one where ideology or party should play but, rather, the good of America. 
   So it is my honor to cast my vote for a great New Yorker, a great American, a great Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and someone who is truly a national treasure. I will be proud to vote for Alan Greenspan. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my remarks, every time some of us on this floor bring up gun issues--not to eliminate them, but to make sure those who should not have them do not get them--we hear from those who are opposed to us that we are being political. 
   I do not understand that remark other than it being a defensive remark. First, I believe my views as strongly, say, as the Senator from Idaho believes his. I do not think I am being any more or any less political than he is by defending that viewpoint. That is what the Senate is all about. 
   Second, if one wants to argue about politics, a vast majority of Americans support the position I support. That is what democracy is all about, and politics is a good thing if you are representing people's views and trying to do good for your country, your State, and your communities. So I do not quite get the political nature of the comment. 
   Third, we are not saying that all gun manufacturers are subject to suit or subject to successful suit. I heard the Senator from Idaho mention Wal-Mart. This is not a suit aimed at Wal-Mart. This is a suit aimed at dealers, often a handful of dealers, who are reckless, or worse, in the way they distribute guns. 
   About 6 months ago, my office issued a report which showed that 1 percent of the dealers issued close to 50 percent of the guns traceable in crimes. These were not the 1 percent who had the greatest volume. 
   These were obviously the 1 percent who, for some reason, were not living up to their responsibilities under the Brady law, which is the law of the land. That kind of fact is what brought these suits about. 
   The suit, for instance, brought forward by the City of Chicago claims that some manufacturers and some dealers are completely reckless in how they distribute guns. If each dealer were careful, if each dealer and manufacturer did what the law says, the number of people killed with guns by criminals and the number of children who get guns would decline. These lawsuits are a very legitimate part of American life. 
   I wish we didn't need lawsuits, but since this Senate has stymied every single measure to bring rationality to our laws about guns, not to take people's guns away, as some of the opponents argue in terms of setting up a straw man, but to say that the same responsibilities that someone who drives a car or practices free speech has, because none of those rights is absolute, should be visited upon gun manufacturers, gun dealers and, yes, gun owners. If this Chamber had moved forward in accordance with the will of the American people, we wouldn't have these lawsuits. But that is not the case. One can speculate as to why. 
   We have a Senate totally deadlocked, a Congress unable to even pass something as minute as closing the gun show loophole. So we have these suits. They are legitimate lawsuits. They are tried by a jury in accordance with American law. 
   Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Michigan to yield me 3 additional minutes.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair for his courtesy. 
   It is not the major gun dealers who are seeking the shield of bankruptcy; it is the companies, sometimes small, often nasty, that have sought this. Look at the so-called ring of fire, gun manufacturers around the city of Los Angeles that manufacture cheap handguns, who know darn well that those handguns are often ending up in the hands of young people who shouldn't have them. They are the people against whom the Senator from Michigan so wisely is seeking to allow the court process to continue. It would be the height of special interest folly if we allowed dealers to escape the punishment meted out by a civil court through a bankruptcy loophole that was never intended to allow people to evade justice. 
   This amendment is about justice, pure and simple. It doesn't preordain what the courts will decide, but it clearly states that if the court should decide a gun manufacturer or a gun dealer was reckless, was negligent, then they can be held accountable. If we don't pass it, it is another in a long line of sops to the gun lobby in which this Chamber has unfortunately participated over the last several years. I hope this body has the courage to stand tall and pass an amendment that we all know is right. 
   I thank the Chair for his courtesy.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. 
   First, I thank him not only for his leadership on this issue but for his very thoughtful remarks, which I will certainly chew over and look at. I saw them on the screen and wanted to do that. I certainly agree with the Senator from Alaska, that what he is talking about deals with the long-term problem which we have to deal with and what myself and the Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, and some of us have been talking about as a short-term problem, which is the oil. For instance, home heating oil is higher in my State than it has ever, ever been,  even though the price of oil itself is not higher than it has ever, ever been. 
   I would like to ask the Senator a question. On the short-term issue, which I understand the Senator's point, which is you are not going to solve the long-term issue. You will be back with short-term issues time and time again. But given the crisis that we have, the proposal that Senator COLLINS and I have made is to not deplete the oil reserve, the SPR, but rather to at this point sell a small amount of it, let's say 500,000 barrels a day, from now until March 31, that the experts we have talked to have told us that that is likely to crack OPEC's unity, and also not just OPEC, but Mexico and Norway, which in the past had not always marched in lockstep with OPEC. 
   I would be against depleting the reserve. The first question I ask the Senator is: If he was assured that the oil would be bought back at either a higher or lower price--and most experts think it would be considerably lower--would that assuage some of his concerns? I don't want to burden the Senator, but he is an expert, and I would like to get the benefit of his wisdom. 
   If a program were developed of swaps and were put in automatically so that oil was bought for the SPR when the price was rather low, oil was sold when the price was rather high, but there was a guaranteed commitment that if the oil was sold during a high price, that it would be bought back at a low price, and you could put a time limit on--one of the things mentioned was that you would have to do it in a year regardless--would that not deal with the long-term problem that the Senator is addressing in most of his remarks? But would that assuage some of his concerns about the short-term issue that many of us in the Northeast have such problems with? 
   I yield to the Senator to answer that question.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I know the Senator is sensitive to that, and I very much appreciate that. The experts with whom I have checked at least have said it would take about 30 days from the time the President were to order selling of the SPR to the time it could be removed and refined appropriately. I think more to the point --or maybe not more to the point but also to the point, many people, certainly the majority I have talked to, believe that even if we were to announce we were going to sell some of the SPR on the open market, the odds are quite high that from that point, the OPEC nations, countries such as Mexico and Norway--that would crack their unity. 
   My main goal, at least, in offering this solution is not simply to temporarily reduce the price of oil but rather to sort of break OPEC. In the past, what our Government would do would be go to the governments of Mexico and 
   Norway and say, hey, help us out. In the past, they would. When they pumped a little more oil, the unity of the 11 OPEC nations would crack. Well, Mexico and Norway are not fulfilling that role for a variety of reasons, some of which I am aware and some of which I am not. So we would be fulfilling the same role. 
   I guess my only question to the Senator from Alaska, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is--and maybe my information is wrong--if it would take 30 days, would that change his view? Secondly, does he think that it might have a good chance, if we did even announce this and began to do it, to crack OPEC's unity and that would solve our problem--short-term admittedly and not long-term--right away rather than pumping small amounts of oil ourselves?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I am happy to say there is good news in the omnibus budget bill for rural New Yorkers in two ways. The Satellite Home Viewer Act will finally allow rural residents in rural areas to receive local television programming, and the dairy language in the omnibus final package allows both option 1-A and the New England Dairy Compact to continue. Let me touch on both of these. It is clearly two dollops of good news for rural New Yorkers. 
   On the satellite bill, I have had constituent after constituent in areas such as Allegany County and Chenango County and Steuben County and Ulster County, throughout New York State in rural areas, tell me all of a sudden they were unable to receive over the air signals to receive local satellite programming. Imagine being cut off. Imagine for years depending on the weather reports before you took your kids to school or because you are a farmer and then not being able to get them. Imagine having your local news shows cut off. Imagine not being able to see things your family was accustomed to seeing, all because of a court action. 
   Today, that bill, that court action, is being overruled in the omnibus act. I am delighted to say half a million New York residents will now be able to get their local signal from their satellite which they were not able to do before--half a million people, all back the way they should be. 
   I hope we will continue the progress of the Satellite Home Viewer Act. The Federal provision was taken out. I understand the Senate Banking Committee plans to hold hearings next year to ensure that multiservice providers are encouraged to extend competition. I want to work with my colleagues to make sure my constituents in upstate rural New York, central New York, the west and southern tier, and in the north country have the same viewing options as those in downstate. 
   The other bit of good news, of course, is the dairy language in the final bill. First, I know some of my colleagues from Wisconsin and Minnesota have labored long and hard on behalf of their constituents in this regard. I salute their hard work, their tenacity, and their diligence. I heard the Senator from Minnesota say the average dairy farm in his State has 60 cows. It is no different in New York. We don't have large farms, by and large. We shouldn't be pitting one against the other. Without 1-A and without the dairy compact we would have had desperate times in rural New York for our dairy farmers. We are the third largest dairy State. Dairy is a vital industry in much of New York. 
   If option 1-B were allowed to be implemented, New York would experience the single largest loss of any State, $30.5 million a year. Compacts, of course, are necessary. The 1-A option passed both Houses. This is not something being done in the dark of night and not being debated. Both Houses, after full debate, passed both compacts. 
   I say with all due respect to my colleagues from Minnesota and Wisconsin, it is they who seek to thwart the will of the majority of the House and the Senate when they try at the last minute to stop an omnibus bill from going through. We need this compact. 
   In New York and New England, the price of milk has not risen by more than 4 cents over the national average in every 
   given year. I say to my downstate constituents, to keep an industry vital to all New Yorkers going, is it worth it to pay that 4 cents? Almost everyone says yes. With senior citizen centers, WIC, and other types of good programs being exempt, this is a worthy piece of legislation. I think it is a good day for the dairy farmers of New York. 
   It is not all we wanted; I admit that. We want New York to be added to the Northeast Dairy Compact, and we will fight like the devil to make that happen in future years. Without 1-A and the existing dairy compact, which still benefits New York dairy farms in the north country and places such as Washington and Warren Counties and in central New York, those areas without the New England Dairy Compact, we would have suffered dramatically. Adding insult to injury, not having option 1-A would have been devastating. 
   In the last decade, New York State has lost one-third of its dairy farms, 13,000 to 8,600. The dairy compact and option 1-A will help my State and region retain this vital and cherished industry. I believe that can be done not at the expense of our counterparts in the Midwest. 
   In conclusion, it is a good day for rural New Yorkers in this omnibus bill. No. 1, the Satellite Home Viewer Act will allow half a million New York families to receive local signal once again; and, an extension of the dairy compact, as well as extension of option 1-A, will allow our dairy farmers who have been struggling over the last decade to have a better chance to survive, to grow, and to prosper in one of the industries most vital to all of New York State.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Satellite Home Viewer Act, which is part of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. There are approximately half a million direct broadcast satellite households in New York State that have been disadvantaged by the restrictions currently facing satellite service providers. There are countless others who would like the privilege of having satellite service as a multi-channel video program provider. 
   Earlier this year, direct broadcast satellite customers in many areas of New York State had their local network service shut-off as a result of a court order. This meant that satellite service customers were unable to receive their local news, weather, and major broadcast stations from their local broadcast companies. We now have a bill that will allow direct broadcast satellite companies the ability to provide their local customers with local programming. For small, rural communities, it is imperative that residents be allowed to receive notice of local events, like school closings, weather reports, cultural happenings, and local business developments. In addition, New York is one of the two states that will benefit from retroactive local programming via satellites. 
   For residents of New York rural counties like Allegheny, Chenango, Clinton, Niagara, Ulster, and many others, that rely on distant broadcast network programming because they are typically unable to receive over-the-air broadcast signals, this bill allows them to continue to receive faraway television networks. 
   While I am pleased that we were able to pass the Satellite Home Viewer Act before it expired on December 31, 1999, I hope we will continue to further its progress. The federal loan provision that was included during conference, and regrettably taken out of the Senate conference report, must be revisited. It is my understanding that the Senate Banking committee plans on holding hearings next year to ensure that multi-channel service providers are encouraged to extend satellite service to rural and underserved communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on that committee to make sure my constituents in Western and Northern New York have the same viewing options as those in downstate New York.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time. 
   I rise, along with my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Illinois, very much against my colleague from Alabama on this important issue. 
   When somebody donates a liver or lungs or a kidney or a heart, they do not donate it in a particular area. They don't donate it and say: I want the person who lives in the State of Alabama or the State of New Jersey to have it. They donate it to do the most good. 
   Finally, we have come up with a solution with provisions that are fair--that say it doesn't matter where you live but rather what your need is in terms of getting an organ. 
   All of a sudden, to my disappointment, in the dark of night a ruling of that position was put into the legislation. 
   I think this is wrong. When somebody needs a liver in New York, and they need it, and their life depends on the liver, that liver should not go to someone in another State who has at least 3 years to live on their existing organs. 
   It is so wrong to create geographic divisions. We have learned that. The Secretary of HHS has promulgated regulations which, if I had my way, would be promulgated immediately. 
   My friend and colleague, who I know is very sincere in this, the Senator from Alabama, and others, put in a provision to delay this for 90 days. 
   I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator LOTT, and the Secretary of HHS for trying to compromise this issue so it can be fair to all. 
   We must and we will continue to fight, those of us who believe that organ donations should go to those who need it the most, and not those who live in a certain geographical area be given those organs. 
   The system has been supported by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine. It was developed by medical people and scientists. That is the way it ought to be. 
   We ought not hold organs hostage to political, geographic, and other divisive considerations. 
   Again, when somebody donates an organ, a beautiful and selfless act, it ought not be marred by politics. It ought to go to the person of greatest need, no matter where that person lives. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the revised ``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999'' (H.R. 1554). As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes as Title IV, the ``American Inventors Protection Act of 1999.'' This important patent reform measure includes a series of initiatives intended to protect rights of inventors, enhance patent protections and reduce patent litigation. 
   Perhaps most importantly, subtitle C of title IV contains the so-called ``First Inventor Defense.'' This defense provides a first inventor (or ``prior user'') with a defense in patent infringement lawsuits, whenever an inventor of a business method (i.e., a practice process or system) uses the invention but does not patent it. Currently, patent law does not provide original inventors with any protections when a subsequent user, who patents the method at a later date, files a lawsuit for infringement against the real creator of the invention. 
   The first inventor defense will provide the financial services industry with important, needed protections in the face of the uncertainty presented by the Federal Circuit's decision in the State Street case. State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group, Inc. 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In State Street, the Court did away with the so-called ``business methods'' exception to statutory patentable subject matter. Consequently, this decision has raised questions about what types of business methods may now be eligible for patent protection. In the financial services sector, this has prompted serious legal and practical concerns. It has created doubt regarding whether or not particular business methods used by this industry--including processes, practices, and systems--might now suddenly become subject to new claims under the patent law. In terms of every day business practice, these types of activities were considered to be protected as trade secrets and were not viewed as patentable material. 
   Mr. President, the first inventor defense strikes a fair balance between patent law and trade secret law. Specifically, this provision creates a defense for inventors who (1) acting in  good faith have reduced the subject matter to practice in the United States at least one year prior to the patent filing date (``effective filing date'') of another (typically later) inventor; and (2) commercially used the subject matter in the United States before the filing date of the patent. Commercial use does not require that the particular invention be made known to the public or be used in the public marketplace--it includes wholly internal commercial uses as well. 
   As used in this legislation, the term ``method'' is intended to be construed broadly. The term ``method'' is defined as meaning ``a method of doing or conducting business.'' thus, ``method'' includes any internal method of doing business, a method used in the course of doing or conducting business, or a method for conducting business in the public marketplace. It includes a practice, process, activity, or system that is used in the design, formulation, testing, or manufacture of any product or service. The defense will be applicable against method claims, as well as the claims involving machines or articles the manufacturer used to practice such methods (i.e., apparatus claims). New technologies are being developed every day, which include technology that employs both methods of doing business and physical apparatus designed to carry out a method of doing business. The first inventor defense is intended to protect both method claims and apparatus claims. 
   When viewed specifically from the standpoint of the financial services industry, the term ``method'' includes financial instruments, financial products, financial transactions, the ordering of financial information, and any system or process that transmits or transforms information with respect to investments or other types of financial transactions. In this context, it is important to point out the beneficial effects that such methods have brought to our society. These include the encouragement of home ownership, the broadened availability of capital for small businesses, and the development of a variety of pension and investment opportunities for millions of Americans. 
   As the joint explanatory statement of the Conference Committee on H.R. 1554 notes, the provision ``focuses on methods for doing and conducting business, including methods used in connection with internal commercial operations as well as those used in connection with the sale or transfer of useful end results--whether in the form of physical products, or in the form of services, or in the form of some other useful results; for example, results produced through the manipulation of data or other inputs to produce a useful result.'' H. Rept. 106-464 p. 122. 
   The language of the provision states that the defense is not available if the person has actually abandoned commercial use of the subject matter. As used in the legislation, abandonment refers to the cessation of use with no intent to resume. Intervals of non-use between such periodic or cyclical activities such as seasonable factors or reasonable intervals between contracts, however, should not be considered to be abandonment. 
   As noted earlier, Mr. President, in the wake of State Street, thousands of methods and processes that have been and are used internally are now subject to the possibility of being claimed as patented inventions. Previously, the businesses that developed and used such methods and processes thought that secrecy was the only protection available. As the conference report on H.R. 1554 states: ``(U)nder established law, any of these inventions which have been in commercial use--public or secret--for more than one year cannot now be the subject of a valid U.S. patent.'' H. Rept. 106-464, p. 122. 
   Mr. President, patent law should encourage innovation, not create barriers to the development of innovative financial products, credit vehicles, and e-commerce generally. The patent law was never intended to prevent people from doing what they are already doing. While I am very pleased that the first inventors defense is included in H.R. 1554, it should be viewed as just the first step in defining the appropriate limits and boundaries of the State Street decision. This legal defense will provide important protections for companies against unfair and unjustified patent infringement actions. But, at the same time, I believe that it is time for Congress to take a closer look at the potentially broad and, perhaps, adverse consequences of the State Street decision. I would hope that beginning early next year that the Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the State Street issue, so that Senators can carefully evaluate its economic and competitive consequences.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. 
   The Senator from Iowa knows I reserve that right but will not ultimately object. But I do want to point out to my colleagues that the amendments to be accepted by unanimous consent, which deal with the ``teaser'' issue, which deal with disclosure on credit cards, in my judgment, do not go very far and need to go much further. I suggest to my colleagues that the amendment Mr. SANTORUM of Pennsylvania and I have offered would go much further on what would do the job. 
   Let me be very clear. I have been working on credit card disclosure for over 10 years. A while ago, about 7 or 8 years ago, we passed something we thought required the credit card companies to disclose, in large numerical print, how much the annual interest rate was. That is really the key issue when you decide what credit card to take. Many of the credit card companies use ``teaser'' rates. They say 2 percent or 3 percent for a couple of months and then raise it to 10 or 11 or 15 percent. 
   So we drafted an amendment. But at the request of the industry, we were not very specific. They said: You don't have to specify how large the print should be or what should be in the box; just do it. It became law. The box was known as the Schumer box. 
   Let me show you what it is in current law. This credit card shown on this chart is governed by that law. The only large print and the only number you see is ``3.9 percent.'' That is what is called the ``teaser'' rate. It is only offered for a few months. 
   When it is time to pay your regular annual fee--in this case, 9.9 percent--in the box is just a lot of legal gobbledygook, and you can hardly see what the number is. To understand it is the 9.9 percent or the 19.99 percent which governs, you probably have to have a degree from Harvard Law School. 
   What the Grassley-Torricelli amendment does is allow this kind of deception to continue. It makes some improvements, but it does not make the real improvement of disclosure. I have talked to leaders of the credit card industry. They say: Don't cap us. Don't limit us. We are not against disclosure. Then when we come up with a proposal, Mr. SANTORUM and I, that simply says they have to show the amount in 24-point type--and here is what it says: ``Long-term annual percentage rate of purchases,'' and the amount--we get opposition. 
   Many of those who are close to the credit card industry have told me the industry has told them they are against it. 
   They say they are for disclosure, but they really are not. 
   I do not have to oppose this amendment because we have a better alternative. The alternative is this. If you really believe in disclosure, the Santorum-Schumer amendment is the way to go. 
   What is shown on this chart is deceptive. In all due respect to my good friend from Iowa, who I know cares strongly about this issue, his amendment will not change that one drop. They will have in big letters the ``teaser'' rate and in hardly intelligible language what the real interest rate is. 
   I would normally object to this unanimous consent request. But because there is an alternative to make real disclosure, and because we have already debated, and because I know it is our right to get a vote on that amendment, I will not object. 
   But I want my colleagues to understand one thing: We are not doing much, if anything, for the cause of real disclosure, for the cause of letting consumers see the interest rate they are paying before they buy the credit card, unless we pass the Schumer-Santorum amendment. 
   So I withdraw my objection to this amendment. I know it is offered in good faith. But please let my colleagues understand that if you want real disclosure--no more, just disclosure, Adam Smith economics--the only way to get it is not by an amendment that allows the industry to continue deceptive practices but, rather, by the Schumer-Santorum amendment which says, in no uncertain terms, ``9.99 percent''--whatever the interest rate is--24-point type, in large letters. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy. I withdraw any objection to the unanimous consent request.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, and I are offering an amendment to do some commonsense housecleaning with respect to the means test safe harbor now in the bill and, more significantly, to restore something that was unfortunately taken out of the bill by the managers' amendment: true protection for low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers from coercive predator litigation tactics involving section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code. 
   First the housecleaning: The managers' amendment included a provision stating that the bill's means test could not be used to remove low- and moderate-income debtors from chapter 7. That was undoubtedly a big step forward for this bill, and I congratulate the managers for having taken that step. 
   Now that the means test no longer applies to low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers, it makes no sense for these individuals to have to file means test calculations based on their income and expenses along with the other papers they must file upon declaring bankruptcy. Likewise, it makes no sense for U.S. trustees to have to do means test calculations with respect to low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers who, I repeat, cannot be means tested out of chapter 7. This imposes unnecessary burdens on debtors and wastes taxpayer dollars by leaving these requirements in place. 
   Our amendment would fix the problem by deleting these requirements only in cases involving low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers. These filers would still have to document their income and expenses. They just wouldn't have to do means test calculations anymore, which are no longer required. 
   Now for the more important issue, the issue of protecting low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers from any coercive creditor litigation tactics under 707(b). Sad to say, this only became an issue 2 days or so ago. The bill formerly had a provision preventing creditors from bringing any motion under 707(b) against low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers. That included motions under the means test, motions alleging that the debtor filed for chapter 7 in bad faith, and motions alleging that the totality of the circumstances of the debtor's financial situation demonstrated abuse. Bankruptcy trustees could bring these motions against low- and moderate-income debtors, and appropriately so, just not creditors. 
   According to the report language for this bill, the ban on predator motions existed to protect low-income filers; in other words, no motion, no prospect for creditor coercion. Last year's Senate  bill had the same protection for low- and moderate-income filers. And even this year's House bill, which many consider more stringent than the Senate bill, had this protection. Yet at this late stage in the game, the managers' amendment deleted much of this bill's so-called safe harbor against creditor 707(b) motions. It continues to protect low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers from motions under the means test but now, for the first time, leaves these debtors vulnerable to creditor motions alleging debtor bad faith or that the totality of the circumstances demonstrated debtor abuse. 
   This chart illustrates the problem. Under the House's bill, safe harbor creditors can bring means test or totality of circumstances motions only against above-median-income debtors. Under the Senate bill, as modified by the managers' amendment, motions against all debtors, even those with income below median income for a household of similar size, can be brought by creditors. 
   What is the big deal about leaving low- and moderate-income debtors vulnerable to creditor motions based on these grounds? The big deal is what some aggressive creditors will do with these motions. These creditors will use these motions and threats to bully poorer debtors into giving up their bankruptcy rights altogether, whether that means staying away from bankruptcy altogether, giving up their bankruptcy claims, or agreeing that certain of their debts simply won't be reduced or eliminated by virtue of bankruptcy. 
   This should trouble all of us. Debtors who can't afford to litigate with their creditors will just bow to creditors' demands. 
   Now, if I sound alarmist, I do so because the record is filled with examples of aggressive creditors using the motions and leverage they currently have under the bankruptcy code to coerce low- and moderate-income debtors into giving up their bankruptcy rights in some form.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I wish to answer. 
   The bill's provisions purporting to prevent and ameliorate coercive creditor litigation tactics will not be able to undo the damage done by giving creditors the right to bring 707(b) ``totality of the circumstances'' and ``bad faith'' motions against low- and moderate-income debtors. 
   Section 102 of the bill says a court may award a debtor costs and attorney's fees if a court rules against the creditor's 707(b) motion and that motion was not ``substantially justified.'' This provision will not deter coercive creditor litigation tactics. It doesn't cover coercive threats to bring 707(b) motions, which are often sufficient to force a debtor to give up his or her bankruptcy rights. 
   Finally, this sanctions provision contains an exception which precludes any award against a creditor that holds a claim of under $1,000, no matter how wealthy the creditor is.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his careful deliberation and his yielding. 
   It is my understanding that section 203 of the bill deemed it a violation of the automatic stay for a creditor to engage in any communication other than a recitation of the creditor's rights, and this would deal with threat. This provision would be stricken from the bill by the Reed-Sessions amendment. So the Reed-Sessions amendment didn't deal with the problem, but it actually took out the basic protection that a low-income debtor would have against threat. 
   Is that not correct?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the first session of the 106th Congress comes to an end, I cannot help but think of what an interesting and exciting first year it has been for me in the United States Senate. The experience has been a wonderful one, to say the least. As my colleagues all well know from their first days in the Senate, setting up a Senate office is a daunting task, and setting one up right does not happen by accident. Many have helped make my transition from the House to the Senate a smooth one, and I would like to take a moment to stop and thank, in particular, the dedicated and loyal employees of the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Senate Sergeant at Arms who played an integral role in making sure that my staff and I could serve the citizens of New York as effectively as possible. 
   From the Architect of the Capitol's office, a special thanks goes to the following: Sherry Britton, Michael Cain, Edolphus Carpenter, Tim Chambers, Jerry Coates, David Cox, Darvin Davis, Andre DeVore, Reggie Donahue, Ed Fogle, Bob Garnett, Steve Howell, Donna Hupp, Lamont Jamison, JoAnn Martin, Dwight McBride, Alpha McGee, Richard Muriel, Randy Naylor, James Outlaw, Albert Price, Lindwood Simmons, Sally Tassler, Doug Whittington, Jr., Clarence Williams, Caroll Woods, and Greg Young. 
   Kim Brinkman, Timothy O'Keefe, John Trimble, and Timothy Wineman from the Office of Secretary of the Senate deserve special recognition. 
   And, from the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, I would like to point out: Roosevelt Allen, Sterret Carter, Robert Croson, Val Fisher, Denise Gresham, Kenneth Lloyd, Michael Lussier, Stacy Norris, Theresa Peel, Dan Templeton, Jeanne Tessieri, and James Wentz. 
   The professionalism that each of these individuals displayed should be a source of great pride to their bosses, and if I wore a hat, I would tip it to them. But, for now, I hope they will accept my thanks and praise for a job well done.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank Senator COLLINS from Maine for her leadership on this issue. She has well represented her constituents on an issue of great concern. Like Maine, northern New York--much of New York--is very concerned with the prices of oil; not only gasoline but some heating oil, which--just as it is in Maine--is going through the roof in New York as we come into this winter season, which, thus far anyway, has been colder than people have predicted. I thank the Senator for garnering time to talk about our legislation, and I look forward to working with her on this issue. 
   Two months ago, I wrote President Clinton and Energy Secretary Richardson requesting that they look into the possibility of releasing a modest amount of oil from our Nation's well-stocked Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I made this request not because the price of crude oil was rising, but rather because global oil prices had recently more than doubled, primarily due to the new-found unity between OPEC members and allies to uphold rigid supply quotas--not free market but rigid supply quotas. 
   OPEC's decision in September to maintain the supply quotas meant the daily global oil supply would remain millions of barrels below last year's levels--and millions of barrels per day below global demand. The effects this decision would have on oil prices were clear. Yesterday, my colleagues--listen to this--oil closed at nearly $26 a barrel, and many industry experts now believe it will go to $30 or even $35 a barrel this winter. 
   Most industry and financial experts believe oil prices above $25 per barrel for an extended period will adversely affect economic growth, even if you come from Arizona; not only will it raise your gasoline prices--you don't have to worry about home heating oil, but $35 per barrel is clearly recessionary. 
   The effects will be felt most among the poor and elderly, both at the gas pump and in a sharp increase in the cost of home heating oil. It will effect our manufacturing, transportation, as well as other businesses that rely on oil. 
   I don't believe in interfering with free markets. But these OPEC decisions are not examples of fair economic play. In fact, OPEC recently announced that it would not even revisit the supply until March of 2000. With American and global oil demand increasing, and a cold winter forecast for North America, OPEC's continued supply quota could have a severely detrimental effect on the U.S. economy over the coming months, and may very well throw sand in the gears of the global economy. 
   Unfortunately, OPEC, with more than 40 percent market share in the global oil market, can have inordinate power over the global economy. 
   So the question is, Should we rely on the judgment of OPEC ministers to make the right decision when it comes to the American and the world economy? The answer is clearly no. 
   The next question is, What can we do about it? 
   My colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, and I have worked together to formulate what we believe is a reasonable response policy by the U.S. Government to instances when foreign oil producers collude to manipulate oil prices to a level that will likely cause a significant adverse impact on our economy, not to mention gasoline, which could go to a $1.60, $1.70, or even higher a gallon, and home heating oil that could go, in my part 
   of the country, from $1 to $1.25 a gallon. 
   Here is how our legislation works. It works within the parameters of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which set up the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which described oil supply reductions leading to severe price increases as a potential national emergency. 
   We simply add a provision that allows the Energy Secretary to order a drawdown of the SPR when oil and gas prices in the U.S. rise sharply because of anticompetitive conduct of foreign oil producers. 
   Oil supply can fall short for many natural, market-based reasons. But when the shortfall is due to opportunistic manipulations by foreign producers, especially to the degree that it will harm our economic well-being, we have the right to act in our own defense. 
   That is why our bill also requires the administration to report to Congress within 30 days after the price of oil sustains a price higher than $25 for more than 2 weeks. This reporting requirement--which will get Congress more involved in SPR policies--simply calls for a comprehensive review of the causes and likely consequences of the price increase. It also requires the President to explain why the administration does or does not --we don't force his hand--support the drawdown and distribution of oil from the SPR. 
   Before concluding, I want to make a few things clear about this legislation. First, it doesn't attempt in any way to bring oil prices down to what some would call unreasonable levels. Most of us believe oil prices were unrealistically low last winter, and that OPEC's initial supply cuts were an understandable strategy to achieve a better balance between global supply and demand. 
   But to maintain the cuts despite the price recovery and the projected growth in demand amounts to nothing less than price gouging. 
   OPEC is currently enjoying unity as a cartel not seen since the early 1980s. 
   The bill also protects our national security by requiring that proceeds from the sale of oil from the SPR be used only to resupply the SPR, with profits from sales remaining in the SPR account. Therefore, in the long run, we are not going to deplete the oil reserve. We are just going to use it to try to bring oil prices to a reasonable level. 
   And with the SPR currently stocked at 570 million barrels, we have more than enough oil to release several hundred thousand barrels a day in the event of a supply crisis without undercutting our stockpile. This should be more than sufficient to pressure oil producers to increase their supply to more realistically meet demand. 
   The bottom line is this legislation would show foreign producers the U.S. can and may well intervene when unfair markets threaten our domestic economy. We will say loud and clear our national economic health is a national security issue. That knowledge may be sufficient to prevent OPEC from extensive oil market manipulations in the first place. 
   A signal to OPEC that we are willing to use some of our strategic reserves to stabilize oil prices is consistent with the prudent long-term approach toward maintaining a stable economy. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is a measured, bipartisan response to a vital economic issue. I look forward to debating and passing this legislation next year. 
   With that, I yield back my time to the good Senator from Maine and thank her for her leadership.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Illinois for their courtesy and the Senator from Nevada for his diligent work in seeing we all get some time. 
   I am offering an amendment, along with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, to do something very basic to the bankruptcy bill, and that is to make credit card disclosure easier to find, easier to read, and easier to understand. I offer this amendment to achieve a goal I share with the sponsors of this bill--seeing fewer American consumers declare bankruptcy. 
   I believe, however, that real bankruptcy reform must address one of the root causes of consumer indebtedness, and that is, abusive consumer credit industry practices. Having saturated the middle market, credit card companies, of course, search ever harder for new users. Their search for new customers leads inevitably to those who have the least ability to repay and are most likely to wind up mired in debt. 
   The Federal Reserve reports that credit card solicitations skyrocketed to a shocking $3.5 billion in 1998, a 15-percent increase from the previous year. That represents an average of 13 solicitations per year--more than one a month for every man, woman, and child in the United States. That is 12 a year for every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
   To reach these new customers, the credit card companies are in a race to the bottom oftentimes to come up with misleading marketing gimmicks and hidden fees. 
   The whole purpose of this bill is to say that those who get deeply into debt should have to repay their debts, even if they are poor. I understand that. I do not agree with certain provisions of it, but I understand it. We can all agree that we ought to have full and broad disclosure before someone signs up for a credit card so they do not get mired in that debt. That is not a Democratic or Republican principle, it is an Adam Smith free market principle: full information. 
   I am hopeful this bipartisan Schumer-Santorum amendment will meet the approval of this body and improve the bill. 
   Let me show my colleagues what is happening. Credit card accounts have become more complicated than ever. Look at this credit card solicitation. It is blown up significantly from its actual size. Count the number of rates applicable to the account. There is a teaser rate, 3.9 percent on introductory purchases and balance transfers. That is the only thing that jumps out at you. An unknowing consumer, someone not really trained in legalese, would think that is the annual rate, but it is not. Here are the other rates mired in this very complicated language: a 9.9 percent long-term rate on purchases and balance transfers; 19.99 percent on cash advances; 9.99 penalty rate, 19 and 22 percent penalty rates on balances in the long run. 
   My colleagues, that is not disclosure; that is an advance math problem on a college entrance exam. I have had a deep and abiding interest in credit card disclosure. 
   In 1988, as a House Member, I authored the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act. The act required that certain information about a credit card account be disclosed: the annual percentage rate, the annual fee, the minimum finance charge, the method of computing the balance for purchases. 
   The act required that this amendment be disclosed in a table, the so-called Schumer box. By putting the information in 
   the table and mandating the table be prominently disclosed, the hope was consumers would be able to understand what the costs of credit truly were. But instead of clarity, they got obfuscation. Because of how the Federal Reserve has interpreted the table, disclosure provisions to the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act, the result has not been disclosure, but a hide-the-rate shell game. 
   Again look at this chart. The only number that stands out is 3.9 percent, and on the solicitation in big white letters on the front is 3.9 percent. If you were looking at this, you would think you are getting a 3.9-percent credit card; 3.9 is the only number in big letters. If you read all the little fine print on the inside, you will see the rate is 10 percent, 19 percent, even 22 percent. 
   We must correct this. We have seen the disclosure box can be stashed away in places far from prominent--the back page or accompanying scrap of paper. We see the disclosure box can appear in font sizes so small it is virtually unreadable. The disclosure box that appears on these is blown up significantly. In the actual solicitation, the letters are so small that even with my 48-year-old eyes, and getting older every minute, I cannot read them. 
   Finally, we have seen the box disclosure rate of information has turned out to be a mess. The so-called Schumer box, of which I was proud when it first passed, has not helped the consumer as much as intended. The amendment that Senator SANTORUM and I are offering will restructure the existing disclosure box in the following way: 
   First, it will create a large, readable, 24-point font table solely for the long-term annual percentage rate for purchases. This is the old card, where all you see is the introductory rate in big letters. This is the new rate, and it is easily seen, 9.99 percent, which would be the annual rate. If there is a teaser rate, a so-called introductory offer rate that is very low, that could be on the credit card, but you do not need a college education or calculus to see the annual rate. It is very important. 
   Second, beneath the table disclosing the long-term annual percentage rate for purchases, it would mandate another table in standard 12-point font that discloses such items as the grace period for repayment, annual fees, minimum finance charges, transaction fees, and other items that are not required to appear in any disclosure box under current law--cash advance fees, late fees, and over-the-credit limit fees. 
   Finally, beneath this second table there would be full disclosure on all rates applicable to the credit card account. The poster shows the difference. This one looks as if you have a 3.9-percent rate; this one, the annual rate. Again, we are not limiting the consumer. We are simply providing information. This is good old Adam Smith American competition, and companies will compete for people based on who has the best rates. 
   It is fair to say consumers will be better off under my amendment, in terms of understanding the true costs of credit. 
   Senator SANTORUM and I believe that disclosure is the way to go, not putting a cap on, not putting limits on, but simply disclosure--but real disclosure--so that people could understand this. 
   It will fit on an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet. We do not want the credit card companies to be able to say that it is difficult to put this together. All this information, including the large ``9.9 percent,'' is on an easily understandable sheet. 
   It is a shame we have to resort to putting font sizes into legislation, but if you look at the old ``Schumer box,'' with all the legalese, you will know that we need it. 
   Armed with better information, consumers will avoid some of the financial missteps that can send them into bankruptcy. That is a goal we all share. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, and myself. I urge that we could come together, in a bipartisan way, on an amendment that makes good sense, that improves the legislation. And then if someone falls into bankruptcy--which we hope does not happen--at the very least it would mean they knew what they were getting into. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have left on the 15 minutes that have been yielded to me?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to allocate some of its Wye Supplemental Assistance Funding to the first regional cooperative health program ever designed to serve both the Palestinians and Israelis. Improving the health of Palestinians and Israelis through a successful cooperative endeavor would provide a vibrant prescription for peace in the Middle East. 
   This important health program, which pairs the Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem with the Palestinian Al-Quds University, has requested support from USAID as a $20 million, five-year program. The purpose of this program is to find innovative ways to fight infectious diseases in the region, and calls upon these Universities to build a permanent, collaborative infrastructure for improving the health of the Palestinian and Israeli people. 
   United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said the most important projects for promoting peace and cooperation between nations are what she calls ``people projects''--those projects that people of all races, religions, and beliefs can support. This program, which seeks to protect local people from the infectious and parasitic diseases that are among the leading causes of death in the West Bank and Gaza, is a great example of fostering cooperation through people projects of mutual interest. 
   USAID has successfully funded similar health programs in Egypt and Turkey, but this is the first such program proposed for the Israeli and Palestinian people. Members of Congress, the President, and the State Department all support this program. If USAID funds the program, it would give the United States scientific and fiscal oversight through both USAID and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
   I support the funding for this regional collaborative effort as a powerful example of what a working relationship should be in the Middle East and I believe that it should be given the highest funding priority out of the Wye package.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank Chairman GRAMM, Senator SARBANES, Chairman LEACH, Representative BLILEY, and all of my colleagues who have worked so long and hard on this legislation, with particular thanks to Senators DODD and EDWARDS who worked with us in the late night hours to come up with a compromise that eventually helped get this bill passed. 
   Mr. President, this is a historic moment. We have been working towards it for 18 years. It has taken 18 years for Congress to pass this bill. 
   When I first came to Congress, the issue was a narrow one: revenue bonds. Could banks underwrite revenue bonds? With technological change and globalization, the issue has expanded far beyond revenue bonds to an issue where the future of America's dominance as the financial center of the world is at stake. 
   This bill is vital for the future of our country. If we don't pass this bill, we could find London or Frankfurt or, years down the road, Shanghai becoming the financial capital of the world. That has grave implications for all of America where financial services is one of the areas where jobs are growing the most quickly, where our technology is way ahead of everyone else, where our capital dominates the world. It would be a shame if, because Congress had been unable to act, all those advantages were frittered away, as they well could be, in a global world by our failure to realize the problems our existing antiquated laws cause. 
   There are many reasons for this bill. First and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive. As their international competitors, U.S. firms will be able to offer financial services to complement their business models. Had we not done this, 3 years from now, with new technology, we could find major U.S. companies leaving the United States and locating in other countries that had laws allowing these things. 
   I don't know what the marketplace will yield. Will people want to buy all their financial services from one company? Will it be online or with individuals? We don't know. We do know that to close off one avenue of competition is the death knell for the future of a country in that area--in this case, financial services. It is essential we pass this bill. 
   The first issue is jobs, plain and simple, hundreds of thousands--yes, millions--of high-paying jobs. I need not tell the Senate how important this bill has been to the financial capital of the world, New York. 
   Second, it is important to consumers. The years have shown the more competition, the better. This bill allows more competition by allowing many more firms to compete over similar product lines. When a bank decides to go into the securities industry or a securities firm decides to sell insurance, they 
   are looking for a competitive edge. They may well find it, they may not. However, the ability to have more competition--which this bill creates--is vital to consumers. This is a proconsumer bill. It is proconsumer for the same reason our system has predominated over all the others--competition. 
   Jobs are an important reason for this bill; consumer interests and competition are an important reason for this bill. 
   Third, we have to keep up with changing markets. When Glass-Steagall was passed, commercial banks dominated the financial landscape with 57 percent of all financial assets. Today they have less than 25 percent. To look at the world through that antiquated spyglass and say we must keep commercial banks from other areas because they may dominate is to look at a world that is 50 years old. Many argue commercial banks are among the weakest competitors when they are put against not only securities firms and electronic firms but mutual funds and pension funds. The third issue: We have to move this bill to keep up with changing markets. 
   Finally, we had to do it because otherwise the regulators were going topsy-turvy. We all know it does not make good policy to have individual regulatory decisions make policy. That has been what has happened. Because of the necessities of technology and globalization, because of the changes in financial markets, individual companies were going to the regulators and asking for special permission to do A, B, and C, and regulators were granting it. Now we have an overall fabric. We have a law that will treat all companies equally, that will allow businesses, either new or existing, to plan for the future, and will create a level playing field. 
   There are many reasons to pass this bill. My goal, which I stated at the outset, was to modernize financial services but not take one step backward on CRA. We have done that. The CRA provisions in the bill do not move things forward, but they do not take a single step backward. In fact, as I have argued to the groups in my State, they will benefit from this legislation because their leverage in the CRA process has always been when there are new mergers or new products that a bank  decides to add. This is going to increase 10, 20 times. Every time the groups are interested in CRA--one of the most successful banking laws we have passed--they will have that leverage. Instead of two or three opportunities a year, they will probably have two or three a month. I argue CRA groups are going to be so busy with all the new mergers and all the new services that they may not have time to keep up. 
   We accomplished a great deal. I thank the Senator from Maryland as well as the administration for making sure we did not take a single step backward on CRA. 
   Sunshine provisions are in the bill. It is very hard to argue against them. If I am for sunshine for business and for political people, including myself, how can we not be for sunshine even for groups we support and believe in? I have no problem with the sunshine provision. 
   We succeeded in CRA. We also succeeded in helping the consumer in terms of protections. 
   Regarding ATM fees, I am proud banks will be required to disclose any and all charges for using an ATM before a customer makes a decision to withdraw funds. I fought for years for this provision, first in the House with Representative ROUKEMA, and now in the Senate. It is in the bill. In addition, there are 
   privacy protections in the bill. 
   Does the bill go as far as I wish on privacy? No. But privacy is a large and complicated issue. We don't know what the balance ought to be between the ability of businesses to share information and the right of the consumer to protect his or her information. In the Senate, we did not have a single hearing on privacy. To restructure all of privacy with huge numbers of unknown consequences on this bill made no sense. My goal, again, was, can we move forward? We have. Not as far as I prefer or many prefer but certainly not enough to sink a bill that has so many necessities. 
   Finally, safety and soundness. The one thing that has dominated my thinking in this area is that we not repeat an S&L crisis, and we not allow insured deposits to be used for risky activities. I am proud to say the compromise between Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the structure of the bill makes sure that when insured dollars are used for anything that might be slightly risky, the capital requirements and firewalls will make virtually certain we will not repeat the kind of S&L crisis we have had in the past. 
   In conclusion, this is a historic day. It is a historic day for my State of New York, which I am proud to say is the financial capital of the world and, with this bill, has a much greater likelihood of remaining so. It is a historic day for modernizing one of the most important industries in America where we are technologically and entrepreneurially ahead of the rest of the world. This will help maintain our lead. And it is a historic day for those who have argued that we need to keep CRA strong and keep consumer protections in the bill. 
   From Glass-Steagall to Gramm-Leach, from the Great Depression to the Golden Age, from isolationist to internationalist, from underdogs to champions, this bill is an American success story for our economy, for our financial institutions, for our communities and consumers, and for my State of New York. I was proud to have played a role with so many others in ensuring its passage.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of utmost importance to American suit manufacturers in New York and around the country, an issue that my colleague PAT MOYNIHAN has been fighting on for many years. 
   I am referring to an anomaly in America's tariff policy that harms American companies like Hickey-Freeman, Pietrafesa, and other producers of fine wool suits. 
   Our response will determine whether this country will be able to support companies that manufacture suits with a ``Made in America'' label. 
   My general belief is that free trade is a boon to the overall economy. But our wool tariff policy is a patchwork quilt of part free trade, part high tariff, part no tariff: policies stitched together with no rhyme or reason as to how it will impact U.S. companies and consumers. 
   Under the current tariff schedule, U.S. suit companies that must import the very high quality wool fabric used to make high-end men's suits pay a tariff of 30 percent on that fabric. These American companies, in turn, compete with companies that import finished wool suits from other countries, which pay a 19 percent tariff on the finished suit. And since the NAFTA agreement, U.S. importers of suits made in Canada and Mexico pay no tariff whatever. 
   And those Canadian and Mexican suit manufacturers pay no, or very low, duties on their imported wool fabric from Italy and elsewhere. They, in effect, get a perfectly free ride into the U.S. market, while American clothing companies, employing American textile workers, have to pay to play. 
   Where is the consistency here? All we have today are randomly placed zero, 19 percent, or 30 percent tariffs with no concern over the big picture: American companies and American jobs. 
   In fact, U.S. companies have been fighting a war of attrition for nearly ten years, a war which they are slowly losing, due solely to American laws. 
   So we are now at a crossroads. 
   Some domestic fabric manufacturers support the tariff policies because they argue that Hickey-Freeman and other high-end suit manufacturers ought to buy their fabric here in the U.S. That would be great--if there was ample domestic supply of the fabric these suit companies require: But there is not. 
   According to leading American fabric manufacturers, U.S.-produced high-end wool fabric supply falls short of demand by more than 2.5 million square meters. That leaves Hickey-Freeman, a Rochester, New York, institution since 1899, Pietrafesa of Syracuse New York, and dozens of other fine suit manufacturers with two options: import more than half of their wool fabric at a 30 percent tariff, or shift their operations to countries where they will not be hindered by the restrictive added costs they face here. 
   In other words, these American companies are virtually compelled to move their operations out of the U.S. by these irrational U.S. laws. 
   That is why the textile workers unions are fighting hard to repeal these unfair tariff policies. Indeed, since 1991, fine suit manufacturers in New York and around the country have been forced to close dozens of manufacturing  facilities, and lay off more than 10,000 employees. 
   Don't get me wrong: I support the idea of free trade. I believe that our nation is the strongest and most prosperous on earth, and in such a strong global leadership position, due to our open trading system, and our principles of free trade which we help instill on other nations around the world. 
   But what I'm talking about today is not free trade. It is a hodge-podge of non-sensical trade laws. These wool tariffs give the advantage to foreign companies in other countries in their ability to compete in our market. 
   All I ask for is a level playing field--I believe that under fair trade and competition the U.S. worker and U.S. industries will prevail. But they will not be given a chance if the deck is stacked against them. Under current law, the game is fixed. 
   Now, I recognize that good faith negotiations are ongoing between American fine wool suit manufacturers, domestic wool producers, Senators MOYNIHAN and ROTH, Members of this body from interested states, and the White House. Senator MOYNIHAN has, for many years, made this unfair wool tariff a cornerstone of his efforts to ensure fair trade. And I am doing what I can to help move these negotiations along. 
   But I want to make clear that we need to resolve this issue as soon as possible. The American fine suit industry and their employees can wait no longer. Too many jobs have already been lost due to these tariffs, and too many more remain on the line. 
   The trade package currently under consideration in the Senate provides the best opportunity to finally provide economic justice to American companies struggling to compete in a global trading system which is still struggling to work out its kinks. 
   I believe that reasonable minds will resolve this issue when the facts are clear to all involved. And the main fact is that loyal, productive, U.S. companies are currently at a serious disadvantage in its own home economy. That should not stand.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on behalf of the thousands of workers in New York, I join my colleagues in thanking both Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their work on this issue. Earlier this year I was visited by one of these workers, Mr. Fred Cotraccia, a Shop Steward for Hickey-Freeman of Rochester, NY. At that time he explained to me the importance of providing relief to the suit manufacturing industry, and he presented me with a teddy bear dressed in an American-made, hand-made, fine wool fabric suit. In a letter from him accompanying the bear he says, ``Please stand up for American jobs.......My livelihood and the livelihood of thousands of other hard working American employees, depends on you supporting our jobs--please choose `made in America.' '' 
   A number of my Senate colleagues received a similar type letter, and a similar request to help save their jobs. I believe we have made significant strides in finding a way to provide relief to this industry at the expense of no one, but to the benefit of many.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today with my distinguished colleagues, Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator LIEBERMAN, to introduce a resolution honoring one of the greatest franchises in American sports history, the New York Yankees, or as so many of us endearingly refer to them as--the Bronx Bombers. 
   Having grown up in New York during the 1950's, I am full of fond memories of a team that as a child I idolized. After school, time after time, I rode the dynamite D train with my friends from Sheepshead Bay to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, sitting in the bleachers eating hot dogs and munching on peanuts, watching my idol Mickey Mantle play like no one else could, then returning home happy as a kid could be, all for less than three dollars At that time, the only thing in life I wanted to be was Mickey Mantle. Since I never reached that achievement, it is only proper for me to honor the team in which he became a baseball icon. 
   The Yankee were then, and are now, the toast of the town. They have become a franchise synonymous with greatness, a team full of heroes, playing in the greatest city in the world. Players such as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and Lou Gehrig are some of the many Yankee legends of the past. Players like Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, and David Cone are our Yankee legends of the future. The Yankees are typified by character, commitment and achievement, values that represent all that is great about baseball, the State of New York, and America. I can still remember listening to one of the greatest games of all time, Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. But the memories do not stop there, five years later in 1961 Roger Maris hit a then-astonishing 61 homeruns, breaking the previous record of 60 set by the legendary Babe Ruth. 
   Sixteen Hall of Famers, countless no-hitters, and 25 World Championships later, I stand before you to honor an American icon, a team of this century, and also the next, the New York Yankees.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator HARKIN's Sense of the Senate amendment to the partial birth abortion ban. The reason why this amendment is so important is that it really gets to the heart of this debate on the so-called partial birth abortion. The battle is really about chipping away Roe v. Wade. Let's not pretend any longer. It's about ultimately denying a woman the right to an abortion, maybe even the right to contraception. 
   This Sense of the Senate is a ``put your money where your mouth is'' vote. It calls the Senate on their true motives. This is the beginning of a step by step process to find an abortion procedure that seems awful, to make an inaccurate portrayal about how and why it is used, to draw a ridiculous cartoon and put it on the Senate floor, and to then outlaw the procedure and make doctors into criminals and women into murderers. In fact, the term partial birth abortion is a political slogan, not a medical procedure. 
   So who knows what the next term will be used to outlaw another type of abortion procedure. Let's be thankful that we have the courts. This legislation has been consistently found unconstitutional by the courts. In 19 different cases, including federal courts, the definition of partial birth abortion used in this bill has been found to be too vague, and to apply to pre and post viability abortions. As a result, this legislation violates the terms of Roe v. Wade, the cornerstone of a woman's right to choose in this country. This bill is also unconstitutional because it lacks an exception to protect a woman's health. 
   The Supreme Court has concluded that woman's health is the physician's paramount concern, and that a physician's discretion to determine the course of treatment must be preserved. But Congress is hardly concerned with physician authority these days. In fact, this bill tries to turn lawmakers into doctors. It would take medical decisions out of the hands of women and their doctors and give it to politicians. 
   My colleague's amendment underscores our commitment to the terms of Roe v. Wade, and emphasizes the right of women to choose will continue to be upheld. If you really believe that the problem is the so-called partial birth abortion, and you are truly sincere that this is not the camel's nose under the tent of undoing Roe v. Wade, vote yes on the Harkin amendment. If this is instead the first step toward making all abortion illegal--as I believe it is--then vote no.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who are so eloquently paying tribute to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY. 10,000 of anything is a lot. But 10,000 votes is a mind-boggling milestone. I figured out that at our current pace, if God willing I am reelected, by the time I reach 10,000 votes we'll be debating Y3K legislation. But seriously, 10,000 votes is an indication, not of longevity, but of thoughtfulness, patience, hard work, effectiveness, and of representing ably and nobly your Vermont constituents. 
   Many of my colleagues have worked side-by-side with PAT LEAHY for a number of years, as he worked tirelessly and successfully to protect and advance Vermont's interests, as he led the crusade to ban the production and use of land mines, and as he wrote and rewrote laws in order to foster the growth of the Internet. When you hear them speak about PAT LEAHY, they speak about a man of exceptional character, astute vision, and abundant compassion. I've been here for only 9 months but working with PAT LEAHY has been a truly rewarding experience for me. He has been a leader, a teacher, and a friend. He is very patient and very open to ideas. And we have PAT to thank for producing a balanced juvenile justice bill--a bill that, thanks to his efforts and those of Senator HATCH, secured the support of three-quarters of this Senate. Who could have foreseen the Senate's reporting juvenile justice legislation on such a bipartisan basis? Who could have foreseen the Senate's ultimately closing the gun show loophole after kicking off the debate by voting down our modest proposal? Only those who correctly estimated PAT LEAHY's skill and perseverance. 
   But outside the committee, we've worked together on local economic development issues. We share a large border and many of my northern New York constituents share a great deal with PAT's rural Vermont constituents. What a relief for me that I can turn to PAT at any time on dairy and agriculture issues. I hope it is an indication that I've been a good student now that PAT has started calling me ``Farmer CHUCK.'' Well, if I'm ``Farmer Chuck,'' then all I can say is that, in large part, I learned my new craft from the best of them--PAT LEAHY. 
   So, congratulations on reaching this ironman milestone. There aren't too many Senators who can make the kind of mark that Senator LEAHY has made and still be considered a friend to every person in the Senate. I know you have been a friend to me, and for that I am proud to share this great moment with you.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her inspiring words, as well as the Senator from Michigan for his leadership on this issue. I will not speak for a long time, but I felt compelled to rise because we really are at a crucial time in a debate on campaign finance reform. 
   We have debated this bill for a few days. Most of it has been on Friday and Monday, when most of the Members have not been here. The debate is just beginning to reach its fulsome place. We need to continue this debate. 
   Campaign finance reform has been an issue that has been debated for over a decade. Scant progress was made. We made more progress on the floor today, when 55 Senators voted for the McCain-Feingold bill, than we have made in a long time. And those who wish to nip that progress in the bud are not for campaign finance reform. 
   If anyone ever needed a distinction--there is a lot of rhetoric going on and a lot of little cloudmaking machines to hide what is going on--look at the vote. If you were for campaign finance reform, you voted for that proposal; and if you were against, you voted against it--even modest campaign finance reform. 
   Many of us bit our tongue when we voted for it because it is a small step, a very small step--the simple abolition of soft money. It is not even what the House did. I would expect, on a lofty issue such as this, the Senate to lead but instead the Senate trails far behind even the House of Representatives and certainly the American people. 
   And now, when we want to continue the debate, there is a move to shut off that debate. I would certainly ask my 10 colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted for this modest proposal not to shut off debate, if you are serious about campaign finance reform. We have not even begun the amendatory process. 
   I have an amendment, along with the Senator from Illinois, that is very simple: When issue committees put ads on television, they should have to disclose where the money comes from--no prohibition, no limitation, simply disclosure. Isn't it unbelievable we would support a campaign finance bill and not have disclosure of where people are spending that money? The 
   public certainly has a right to know about that. 
   My good friend from Kentucky has been arguing the first amendment for a very long time. I don't know why we don't see the same passion on other first amendment issues as we see on this one, but so be it. 
   But the amendment the Senator from Illinois and I will be proposing is a first amendment type of amendment: disclosure, sunlight, sunshine. If a big corporation, any other big interest--it could be an environmental group or a labor group or some group that I generally support--puts money out there, large amounts of money, to make their viewpoint known, the public ought to know, particularly in these days when advertising can be so deceptive. We have groups called citizens for fair this and fair that, when they are really interest group shields. Come clean. 
   Allow that amendment to be debated. I think if the amendment were debated, it would pass. It has had some bipartisan support. Even the Senator from Nebraska has indicated a likelihood of support. But if we cut off debate, simply after the two cloture motions, we will have no chance to debate that amendment and other amendments. I think this amendment would strike a balance that would satisfy most people. 
   So we sit in this Chamber. Today we began at 1:15. It is not that we are out of time; it is simply that those on the other side of the aisle do not want to debate this issue. They want to put a dagger in the heart of campaign finance reform and by not debating don't even want to leave fingerprints. With the cloture votes today, I say to my colleagues on that side of the aisle, your fingerprints are all over that dagger that killed campaign finance reform. 
   There is not even a pretense, so at the very least let us debate it. Let us  spend some hours reminiscent of the great days of the Republic and the Senate debating this issue, which is a very serious issue about how we govern our country. Let the debate be full. Let there be dialog. Let there be amendments. 
   I worry about the future of this Republic. We have a great structure. The Founding Fathers were truly geniuses. The more I am around, the more I respect their genius. We have a great economic system, which the world emulates, that promotes entrepreneurialism, that allows anybody, no matter how poor they start out, to rise to the top. But we have a poison eating at us, and that is the mistrust that the public has of the Government. That mistrust is more caused by the way we finance campaigns than any other single issue. It creates the partisanship people decry. 
   When I went home to New York, I got lots of that this weekend because of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It promotes the feeling that an individual citizen cannot have any influence on the Government. It promotes a view that it is not one-person/one-vote, but one-dollar/one-vote. Those views we do not even have to comment on their veracity. I think there is a lot of truth to them. But it certainly creates a mistrust, a distance between Government and the people. 
   In an era where things move quickly, in an era of global competition, in an era where we all have to work together as one, this is poison. We have a chance to take a modest step. It is not everything I would want--not even close--but it is a modest step. We made real progress today. We got more votes than we thought we would. Two Senators on the other side of the 
   aisle who had not voted for campaign finance reform before have voted for it now. Maybe if we debate this for another few days, we will not win any more votes, but maybe we will. Maybe someone will offer an amendment that strikes some kind of unity, some kind of feeling of bringing us together. 
   The issue is too important to brush aside. The issue cries out for full debate. To move off now, just as things begin to get going, is wrong and tragic, if that does not overstate it, because I think the issue is so important for the Republic. 
   So I make a plea to the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Mississippi: Don't cut off debate. Don't use your legislative prerogative and might to shut this debate down. Let it continue. Let the debate continue. Let amendments, such as mine, be offered. Let amendments, such as others have proposed, be offered. Let the chips fall where they may. But to shut off debate in this untimely manner is a travesty of this body and for the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield back my time. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding and I understand his anger and anguish about this specific allegation. I do not wish to comment on the details other than to say I have complete respect for the integrity of the Senator from Utah and have witnessed it in my time here. 
   My question is this: Given all of the examples he has mentioned, some of which he thinks are conclusive cases--first I think it was three, and then he said the fourth was maybe a little less conclusive

   Mr. SCHUMER. Excuse me. The two he said were conclusive and the third possibly conclusive. The allegations that he feels, at least in my judgment, correctly, wounded about, don't all of these questions and particularly the cases that the Senator has laid out--and I am not commenting on whether I agree with his cause and effect--make as strong a case as we have seen for passing some campaign finance reform? Doesn't it importune the gentleman from Utah, and so many others in this Chamber, that we pass something because all of these allegations fly  around? And in fairness to the Senator from 
   Arizona, when I heard his response, he was talking about appearances as opposed to realities, but appearances that are damaging to the body politic, whether there is reality or not. 
   My question to the good Senator from Utah is, once again, don't the instances that he has outlined, the ones not referring to himself but the ones he believes fervently about the Democratic National Committee, motivate him to fight very hard that we pass something, not allow a filibuster to prevent us from passing it, and do something good for campaign finance reform? It seems to me the logic is sort of inexorable, as inexorable as the logic of the Senator's piercing questions about his specific case. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding and ask him to respond.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair and all of my colleagues. 
   Before I get into the substance of the bill, I think many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in this last debate, are missing the forest for the trees. In fact, in my judgment, the Senators from Kentucky and Utah and Washington have helped make the case for the bill, not only in the specifics that I talked about with the Senator from Utah before, but everyone in this Chamber, all three, in my judgment, all three have felt compelled, in a certain sense, to explain themselves. All three are very honorable people. I tend to be sympathetic. If I were listed, I would feel the same way. 
   But there is a cloud hanging over the Senate. There is a cloud hanging over this Capitol Dome and all of Washington. In good part, it has been caused by the way we finance campaigns. 
   So even when Senators have the purest of motives, they are called into question. The good Senator from Utah felt his integrity was questioned. The Senator from Washington felt his integrity was questioned. The Senator from Kentucky was defending the honor of his colleagues. 
   Why was that necessary? It is necessary because with the system we use today, there is such mistrust that no action--no action--no matter how purely done, is perceived that way. 
   Obviously, there are many gradations. Pick Senator A and Senator B; Senator A is a lifelong believer in the pro-life movement and receives money from a pro-life PAC. Nobody questions that--or pro-choice. 
   But how about if Senator C believes strongly that a certain facility or company needs dollars to bring jobs to his area and receives contributions closely related to that? Everyone doubts it. 
   I would argue to you that those two cases, at least on a factual basis, are not distinguishable. But every--every--move we make in Washington is now under a cloud. It is under a cloud because of the system by which we finance campaigns. We must change it. 
   This is the most important vote we are facing in this whole year of Congress, period. I know we have had important ones. But the very roots, the foundations of this democracy, are being eaten away by public cynicism. In good part, that public cynicism is caused by our system of financing campaigns. 
   The great debates we have had this year--whether it be on impeachment or guns or Patients' Bill of Rights--over every one of them, the cloud of how we finance campaigns hung over it. The debate is vitiating by that cloud, and because of this system people feel further and further away from the Government that is theirs. 
   So those who argue for the status quo, saying nothing is wrong, or other issues that predominate, sort of befuddle me. I am surprised at the advocacy of the first amendment by some on the issue of financing campaigns, when that advocacy on other issues--freedom of artistic expression--does not seem to be there. I find that befuddling. 
   But, to me, there is no higher value that we can create than trust between the people and their Government. If that trust continues to decline, I don't know if this system of Government survives. So to argue whether the Senator from Utah or the Senator from Washington was maligned in a specific and wrong way, misses the point. 
   To argue that every Senator is maligned fairly or unfairly by a system that the public perceives--and their perception is not out of cloud 9; their perception has many bases in reality--is making that Government further and further removed from their reach, that is what we are talking about. 
   This proposal is a minor proposal in the broad scheme of what we must do. It is, to me, a disappointment. I would have liked to have gone a lot further. I do not hold my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin responsible for that. They are trying to go as far as this body will let them go. 
   One thing I believe we cannot do--one thing we try to do too often--is let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The McCain-Feingold proposal will make some good, positive changes. Will it advantage one party or the other? I don't know. I don't think any of us can predict. Will it advantage one race, one person in a political race over another? Maybe yes; maybe no. We know one thing. We know it will begin that first step of rebuilding trust between the people and their Government. It will begin the first step so the kind of debate that occurred on the floor a few minutes ago won't be necessary, because the public will have the kind of faith they had in their elected officials in decades and centuries past. 
   We must move forward. Can we improve on the proposal before us? Yes. I am going to offer a proposal, most likely with the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, to say that when there are independent expenditures and when there are independent committees, the financing there must be disclosed. That will help a little bit more without vitiating the chances of passing this bill. I hope my colleagues will support that. We will be talking about it. 
   The bottom line is, we have a tremendously serious problem. We have a poison that is in the roots of this great tree of democracy. It is spreading day by day, week by week, and month by month. That poison is cynicism. That poison is a view of the average citizen, rightly or wrongly--and in many cases, it is right--that the average person doesn't have the influence of a person or a company or a group of great wealth. We have to begin to change it. In a complicated world, where decisions are not so clear and not so black and white, we cannot afford to have every decision, difficult as they are on the merits, be held in askance or even contempt by average citizenry because they don't think they have a fair shot at influencing their legislator. 
   I ran for office at the age of 23, right out of law school. It is because I believed in our system of government. There were tens of thousands of young men and women, Republicans and Democrats, who threw themselves into government because they believed. We had seen good things happen in terms of World War II, getting out of the Depression, the prosperity of the 1950s, the civil rights movement, and the protests, angry at times, that changed our course in Vietnam. People believed. 
   My guess is that there are far fewer 23-year-olds today who are making the sacrifices it takes to go into government because of the cynicism, because of the mistrust, because of the problems of financing their own campaigns. If we can no longer get our best young people going into government, whether it be elected or appointed, and if we can no longer have the citizens believe, when this body debates an issue, that the debates are being divided by firmly held beliefs rather than by who is manipulating, 
   controlling, or contributing to whom, then we can't survive as a democracy. That fatal distance between people and their government will get larger and larger and larger. We will wake up one morning and say: We don't have the kind of democracy that the Jeffersons and the Madisons and the Washingtons and the Jays believed in and put together for us. 
   This is not a trivial debate. The bill is smaller than many of us would like. But it is a debate that goes to the core  of whether this Government will ultimately survive. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to look at the specific details of ``this provision is in'' and ``that provision is out,'' but to look at the broad, in general, anger, hostility, cynicism, skepticism, and impotence that the public believes they have in relation to their government; then ask what can be done about it. 
   My guess is, one of the few things we actually can do as Senators is pass the bill the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have put together. It is an important debate. I am glad we are getting to debate it on the floor. I hope and pray that at the end of the day we will not walk out of this Chamber emptyhanded and end up being worse off than we were before the debate started, as the public will believe this Government has finally pulled totally out of their reach and influence. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I must respectfully disagree with my colleague from North Dakota. This bill is a disaster for the farmers in the Northeast. We have been hit, in this bill, by a triple whammy. No. 1, the dairy compact hangs by a thread. No. 2, the pricing support system for dairy 1-A is replaced by 1-B. And then, to add insult to double injury, what has happened is that there is so little disaster relief--given the hurricane in North Carolina, flooding in North Dakota, and the worst drought in a generation in the Northeast--it is hard to see how the money allocated here covers the needs of hard-pressed farmers. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. It just does not do the job for us. I have spoken to many on my side, including our minority leader, who shares our heartfelt concerns; and we are going to make an effort to do whatever we can to get extra disaster relief in other supplemental bills. But it is faint concern, little concern, to the people and farmers in the Northeast. 
   We have 220,000 farmers in the Northeast, according to the Secretary of Agriculture. We have a program, a dairy program, and fruits and vegetables as well, that are different from the majority of farming here in this country. It is not a row crop, and they are not large farms; they are family farms. 
   I will leave my colleagues with a plea: We need help. We need real help, particularly this year when low prices and the drought have severely affected us. We are not getting the help we need in this bill, and we hope we can come back another day and get it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   As I go around my State of New York, I meet all kinds of people who are unable to use their hands anymore because of the kinds of jobs they have had. We have had, for instance, in New York City, workers from a variety of jobs come together to talk about the need for some kind of standard. Many have been disabled by workplace injuries and have had to limit the amount of hours they work. One woman, for instance, an editor for a local TV station, says she can't use her hands for cooking, for opening doors, or for carrying anything. 
   I ask my colleague from Illinois, how would this amendment 
   affect people in that position?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if the Senator might yield for another question, I guess there is some talk about whether we need to study further; that they are not yet ready to have standards. Yet it is my understanding that scientific and medical journals have had over 2,000 articles about the need for some kinds of standard, about what the problems are, and that it is pretty clear cut that in many new kinds of industries the problems that have developed at the workplace are so real that we have far more than enough information to develop standards. 
   Would the Senator care to comment on whether or not the argument that we are not ready to have standards in ergonomics washes?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I respect his expertise on this issue. I know he has been involved in it for a long time. 
   It is my understanding that in 1990 the Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole--not a member of our party, now a candidate for President--said that OSHA must take all the needed steps to develop an ergonomics standard. That was virtually 10 years ago. There has been lots of planning since. Am I correct in assuming that even at the beginning of the decade it was pretty clear we needed some kind of standard, and that we have delayed and delayed to the harm of thousands, tens of hundreds, and hundreds of thousands of workers?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to this amendment. 
   When people say government is not responsive to people's problems or that it gets nothing done--they are talking about this amendment which bars OSHA from issuing a standard on ergonomics. 
   We know the facts. Ergonomics is no longer the mystery it once was. Over 2,000 articles related to this appear in scientific and medical journals. 
   We do not need new studies. How many studies do we need before everyone recognizes the obvious--ergonomic injury is real? 
   The 600,000 workers who experience severe back pain or hand and wrist pain have been studied ad nauseam. 
   So let's move forward and develop a standard. It will ultimately save businesses money and it will protect workers, because a standard will keep people in the workplace. 
   The Department of Labor has worked on formulating a standard since former-Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in 1990 that OSHA must take all the needed steps to develop an ergonomics standard. That's 10 years of planning. We don't need another year of delay. 
   This shouldn't be a partisan issue. We need not pit business versus labor. All sides will benefit. 
   If not now, I predict eventually we will develop an ergonomics standard. Because as this economy becomes more dependent on the computer, and more top level managers spend much of their day in front of a screen--they will develop the same injuries that are reserved now only for secretaries. 
   And that will be impetus to develop a standard for them and for those in construction and factories that develop repetitive motion stress. 
   Last April in New York City, workers from a variety of jobs came together to talk about the need for an ergonomics standard. Some have been permanently disabled by workplace injuries. Some have had to limit the hours they work. 
   One woman, an editor at a local television station, said can't use her hands ``not for cooking, opening doors, carrying anything.'' 
   Passing this amendment means we believe these people are faking it. No wonder people are so frustrated by government. 
   Let's defeat this amendment. 
   Mr. President, will the Senator also answer another question?

   Mr. SCHUMER. This is one other problem that I have heard from my constituents in New York. Workers who have labored long and hard who show up at the job day in, day out develop certain types of problems, and because there are no standards, all too often when they go to their supervisor, when they go to their boss, when they go to somebody of some authority in the company in which they work--it could be a large company, it could be a small company--and complain of these problems, they are told they are faking because these injuries are different. Many of them are the kinds of injuries we are used to where, God forbid, you see blood or bone or some bruise. These are injuries that hurt and affect their ability to work just as much, but they can't be seen in the same way. 
   Has the Senator from Illinois come across the same type of problem, and wouldn't the promulgation and maintenance of standards help these people prove they have a real problem?

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues Senators MOYNIHAN and ROTH in introducing legislation today that I feel is long overdue. 
   More than 20 years ago, in an attempt to end the looting and pillaging of important archaeological and cultural sites, and to protect the integrity  of a country's cultural patrimony, Senator MOYNIHAN and others labored to develop an international protocol that struck a balance between a country's desire to protect its heritage and the art world's desire to have a healthy trade in and exhibition of cultural artifacts. After years of deliberation, these efforts resulted in the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property--a delicately balanced set of rules and guidelines to protect countries from looting, but to allow a legitimate trade in historical objects and the showing of those objects in museums around the world. 
   Congress later established the Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC) to assist the President in making determinations under this convention about whether to restrict or allow the trade of archaeologically significant materials when another country claims harm. Once again, Senator MOYNIHAN was the impetus and intellectual might behind this legislation. 
   For years, this was a balanced process that weighed the claims of countries against the competing interests of museums, art dealers, and auction houses. The CPAC itself was comprised of individuals representing the interests of the museums, auction houses, dealers, archaeologists, and anthropologists. This committee, with the help of staff, made determinations based on fact (was there sufficient evidence of looting or pillaging?) and effectiveness (if the U.S. unilaterally banned the import of certain items, would it have a reasonable chance of reducing or ending the looting?). The original international protocol as well as the enacting legislation passed by the Congress, specifically discouraged unilateral or bilateral actions. The protocols and the legislation were designed to lead to a cohesive international response, not a country-by-country response to looting. 
   Somewhere along the line, that delicate balance shifted. CPAC hearings that were once open became closed. Actions that were once multilateral became unilateral. A process that was once inclusive became exclusive. Decisions that in the past were based on a fair hearing on the merits became instead a foregone conclusion against the museums and the dealers. I would go as far as to say that for those representing museums and art dealers, the process became overtly hostile and secretive. 
   More than a year ago, I convened a meeting with then-USIA director Joe Duffy, members of the art community, and the staff of Senator MOYNIHAN. The meeting was called because of a sweeping action taken by the CPAC regarding Canadian Native American artifacts. Without dwelling on the details of the complaint by the Canadian government or the decision to bar any imports by the U.S. of thousands of artifacts--the meeting was extraordinary. Director Duffy, who as USIA head oversaw the CPAC, admitted that they were way out of line. He admitted that the process had become closed and hostile to dealers and the museums. And he suggested to me and by proxy to Senator MOYNIHAN that we supply him with a name of a person to fill a vacancy on the CPAC to help restore the balance that once was the norm. We gave him the name of Andre Emmerich, a semi-retired dealer in artifacts and probably the most respected voice in the field of cultural property. Director Duffy said to me that Andre Emmerich was the perfect choice. 
   More than one year later and unfortunately after Director Duffy retired, Andre Emmerich's nomination was rejected because, the CPAC claimed, as a dealer he had a conflict of interest. Let's face facts. The entire CPAC is designed to be a conflict of interest. The balance of the committee membership is supposed to reflect that conflict of interest. That conflict of interest is essential to the inner workings of the committee as the expertise supplied by those in various fields is also intended to edify the rest of the committee to help them make the right decision. 
   That brings us to today. We are introducing legislation that is intended to clean up the CPAC--to make the process open, fair, transparent, and accountable. Among other provisions, the legislation forces CPAC to open meetings that have been absurdly secretive. The need for cloak and dagger, spy vs. spy, CIA level secrecy over the importation of Peruvian pottery escapes me. 
   I am proud to be joining both Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator ROTH--two of the most respected leaders in the Senate--in introducing this legislation. I hope we can move this bill quickly, because this is a situation that needs a remedy.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senators from Arizona, Oklahoma, and Connecticut for their courtesy, and the President as well. 
   I would like to make some remarks in contraposition to the Senator from Oklahoma. I say that without casting any impugning of any motivations as to why people voted. 
   It seems to me that this being, as I understand it, the first time we have this year rejected a Senate candidate on the floor--and I understand that there were recommendations from the home State--I still find myself very troubled by that rejection. I find myself troubled because we do need diversity on our bench. We need to, in my judgment, try to have more African Americans on the bench. 
   There is not an African American Member of this body. I find that regretful. The first impression I had the first day I walked on the floor was that. And I guess what I would like to do is just call into question why this nomination was rejected. I would ask that we examine. I know one of the reasons was the opposition of this nominee to the death penalty. I happen to be for the death penalty. I wrote the death penalty law when I was in the House. But I would like to ask how many other nominees we have rejected because of opposition to the death penalty. 
   I am told that one of the Senators who objected from Missouri actually nominated judges on that State court who agreed with Ronnie White on the very case that has been brought into question. 
   So if we are not to be accused of maybe having two standards, I think we ought to be very careful. 
   I respect each Senator's right to oppose nominations for judge. I respect the idea that we often defer to our colleagues in their home States. But I think there is a higher calling here. That is, because this was one of the few African American nominees to reach this floor, we ought to be extra careful to make sure the standard was not being used that we haven't used for some other nominees who have come before this body this year. 
   I disagree with that nominee on the issue at hand. But I still think that we should have extra sensitivity, given the long history of division in this country and the need to try to bring some equality onto our bench in the sense that we have a diverse and representative judiciary. 
   I hope my colleagues will examine those questions. I do not know the answers to them. But my guess is, we have unanimously approved or approved overwhelmingly judges who have the same view as Judge Ronnie White on this very controversial issue.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Victor Marrero to serve as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
   I express my appreciation to Chairman HATCH for moving this nomination expeditiously to the floor. 
   This is one of those moments where you cannot help but feel proud about this country and about how the American Dream is not a myth but a reality. 
   Where else in the world could a young child, with no knowledge of the native language, go to school, learn English, become valedictorian of his high school, and embark upon a distinguished and towering career in public service? 
   Only in America. 
   That is the abridged story of Victor Marrero. He came to this country with practically nothing. He studied and learned in school. He was inspired to public service by President John F. Kennedy. 
   And from that day on, he has never strayed from helping people, teaching them, from trying to make the world a better and more just place. 
   President Clinton nominated Ambassador Marrero to this judgeship upon my recommendation and on the basis of the Ambassador's extensive experiences and accomplishments as both a practitioner of law and a public servant. 
   Ambassador Marrero's legal career is extensive and distinguished. Between his two stints in public service, he spent twelve years as a partner at two prominent New York City law firms. 
   Ambassador Marrero's public service career is almost without equal in its breadth and degree of achievement. He has served as Executive Director of New York City's Department of City Planning, Chairman of the city's Planning Commission, Commissioner of New York State's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   In 1993, President Clinton appointed him United States Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. In 1998, be became United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States. 
   Ambasssador Marrero, through charitable work, has helped to enhance New York City's public schools, libraries, museums and parks, and to help bring opportunity to other Puerto Ricans and Hispanics. 
   Perhaps the most telling testament to the esteem in which Ambassador Marrero is held is the fact that he has been confirmed by the United States Senate on three separate occasions over the past twenty years. 
   I am pleased today that Ambassador Marrero will be adding a fourth Senate confirmation to an already impressive resume.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington, Senator MURRAY, who has done such a great job on this issue, for yielding time. I rise in strong support of her amendment. 
   My State and our Nation are on the verge of an education crisis. At the end of the last school year, test scores showed that half of New York's fourth grade students could barely handle basic written and oral work.  
   If you look at the studies, what is one of the best ways to remedy that? It is the method of the Murray amendment--to reduce class size. If her amendment is not passed, in New York State, 3,497 teachers in the next fiscal year will get pink slips. Why are we doing that? 
   We have a program that works. It is reducing class size. The same things were said about the Cops on the Beat Program, the 100,000 police, that it wouldn't work or needed targets or would create bureaucracy. It has helped bring crime rates way down. 
   Now we have a chance to do the same thing for education. It makes such eminent sense to support a proposal that is aimed at the heart of the problem: too many students; not enough teachers. 
   Instead, what the alternative amendment proposes, the Republican amendment, is a block grant. Instead of saying make sure the money goes into the classroom, it says, if the local school board wants to fritter it away on something that is much less necessary than good, new teachers, let them do it. 
   I have never understood the zealotry on behalf of block grant proposals. 
   It is classic good sense to say when you take the people who tax you and the people who spend the money and separate them, money is going to be wasted. When the taxing authority is separated from the spending authority, the people spending it didn't have to go through the sweat of bringing those dollars in, and they waste it. Every block grant program we have seen, when audited, shows huge amounts of waste. Certain school districts will use that money for all sorts of programs that are not necessary. Some, I argue, would be laughed at. 
   Then we will hear people from both sides of the aisle come back and say: Oh, we should cut this program because it is wasteful. To start out with, let's make it work. If you ask educators what is the No. 1 place to put dollars, it is teachers. 
   I would like anyone on the other side to tell me what is more important than teachers. Why give the local authority the ability to take money away from teachers and give it somewhere else--to bureaucracy, or to waste, or to things that might be necessary but not as necessary as teachers? 
   There will be 3,497 teachers in New York State who will get pink slips if the Murray amendment does not pass. The number is proportionate in your own States. 
   How are you going to look teachers and, more importantly, young students in the eye and say, ``Well, I had this ideological concept, and the teacher is going to be fired?'' 
   Yes, we must spend more on education. I am completely sure of that view. But we must spend it intelligently. We must spend it rigorously. We must spend it with standards. To just throw money at the problem, as we have learned in school district after school district, will not solve the problem. 
   The wisdom we have accumulated about education goes into the Murray amendment because we know that smaller class size increases reading scores and increases math scores. 
   We hear a lot of criticism. I heard my good friend from Tennessee criticize the education system. Then he is giving money to the same people who are being criticized for not doing a good enough job. 
   Are we going to have leadership? Are we going to show America that we know what needs to be done, or are we going to hide behind the defensive measure that nobody really has any heart for, which will not maximize our bang for the buck? 
   There is, indeed, an educational crisis in America. There is, indeed, an anxiety among the people of our great land that our educational system doesn't measure up to the 21st century. Last year, in a bipartisan way this Congress had the courage to begin to address that issue at its core: Too few teachers for a growing number of students. Let us not take a step backward and reverse that. Let us support the Murray amendment. 
   I thank the President. 
   I yield the time I have remaining.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on what I consider is perhaps the most important issue facing us, and that is the future of our educational system. 
   Everywhere I go in my State people are worried about the future of our education system. They are worried in the inner city; they are worried in the wealthy suburbs; they are worried in the rural areas; they are worried in the upstate cities. Everywhere we go, people are worried and concerned. 
   Their gut feeling, as usual with the American people, is right. They know we are entering a profound new time where ideas generate wealth. Alan Greenspan I thought put it best. He said: High value is added no longer by moving things but by thinking things. 
   America, God bless us, does very well in this type of ideas economy. In fact, if one looks at probably a core sentence at the very key of our existence as Americans, it is competition of ideas. That is what the Founding Fathers fought for, that there could be a free and open competition of ideas, free speech, or in the spiritual sense, which is freedom of religion, or in a business sense which is capitalism, free enterprise, or in a political sense, which is democracy, all of which are at the core of this country. 
   In general, we are doing extremely well as an economy because we believe in the competition of ideas. It does not matter who you are, from where you come; if you have a good idea, you can either go out and make money or become an author or professor or whatever. It works. But when our world is becoming so focused on the competition of ideas and ideas in general, we cannot afford to have a second-rate educational system. When I read that we are 15th, say, in math of the 25 or 22 developed countries, or we are 18th in biology or 12th in geography, I worry, and I think every American worries, whether they voice it in these terms or in other terms. 
   We face a real problem, and that is the future of our educational system. It is not the best. 
   I can imagine a country, let's say an imaginary country, of, say, 20 million citizens, many fewer than we have. It can be a complete desert: No fertile fields, no wealth in the mines, but if they had the best educational system and churned out top-level people, they could become the leading economy in the world. 
   We have an imperative to create not the second best, not the third best, not the fourth best, but the best educational system in the world. 
   We have pockets of excellence. I have seen them in my State. But we also have pockets--broader than pockets, we also have broad plains of schools that are not the best. I say this as somebody who is a father of two daughters who are both in public schools in New York City. One is 15 and one is 10. 
   They are getting a good education. My wife and I do everything we can to see that the education is the best. But every parent and every grandparent and every young person worries about the future of our educational system. 
   With the Education, Labor and HHS conference report, one of the first things I look at, perhaps the first, is how is it for education? 
   At first glance, it does not look too bad. Funding levels are marginally better than last year on some of the major school programs. When you consider how contentious this bill can be, at first glance it seems this is a pretty fair, good-faith effort. But then there is the fine print. When you get to the fine print, it is frustrating and maddening. It is not a good bill for education. If we care about our country's future, our children and our grandchildren, we will not support a proposal that is as weak as it is on education. 
   The most egregious item in the bill is the so-called teacher assistance initiative. This is our program to hire 100,000 new teachers. There is funding in the bill of $1.2 billion. That is all great, except when you read the fine print. It says this money is subject to authorization. To the average citizen, it means this money is not there at this point in time. 
   We all know we are not going to authorize this program this year. So money for new teachers will disappear at a time when we need better quality teachers. I have introduced a ``Marshall Plan'' for education focusing on the quality of teachers. At a time when we need to reduce class size, what we are doing is taking away money that would now exist, and then we are afraid to say so. 
   So we put in this chimerical program which says the money is here, and then it isn't. The language for this program is designed, in short, not to hire teachers but to fool parents; it is a bait and switch, because what is really going to happen to the $1.2 billion for new teachers is that it is going to be spent on something else. Who knows what it will be. It could be on anything. But it will not be on teachers. 
   What disturbs me is that the shortage of good, qualified teachers is reaching crisis proportions. Half of our teachers are at retirement age; too few new teachers are taking their place; and in today's world, where the success of an individual depends more on the content of their mind than on the strength of their back, we cannot continue this holding pattern on education. 
   But this proposal is not just a holding pattern. It is worse. It is a step backward because last year we made the initial downpayment on the hiring of 100,000 new teachers, and this year we are leaving cities and towns across the country in the lurch. 
   It is a shame. It is a shame this bill makes a false promise that we are going to continue to fund this emergency teacher program, when we all know that unless the language in the bill is deleted, not a single dollar will be spent on new teachers. 
   I would ask our Senate leadership--plain and simple--to allow us to vote on this language. 
   There are two other problems with the education portion of this bill. The first is school construction--another national crisis. We have inner city schools that are overcrowded. We 
   have kids in the suburbs going to school in trailers. 
   I learned this firsthand from my own daughter when she was in kindergarten and went to an overcrowded school in my hometown of Brooklyn, NY. There were two classes in one kindergarten room on the day my wife and I went to Open School Day. We understood the difficulty because you had one class in one part of the room and one class in the other part of the room, and when our daughter's teacher was speaking, you could not understand her because you heard, in the background, the  other teacher speaking in the other part of the classroom. 
   We have students in New York who are in temporary classrooms because either their suburban school districts or their city school districts are growing or because the decrepit buildings that were built 40, 60, and 80 years ago are in desperate need of repair. 
   Some might say, let the localities do all this. Have you ever seen the property taxes in localities throughout our States and large parts of our country? The local governments do not have the wherewithal for these kinds of major expenditures. So we can come up with some kind of rule that the Federal Government is not going to help, whereby this problem continues, or we can step into the lurch. I would like to step into the lurch. 
   Our school districts need Federal help. This bill offers nothing for school construction and is a grievous blow to our schools and our kids. 
   Last, there is no money for afterschool programs. These are programs that help students with tutoring and help gifted students with advanced learning. It is also an important part of our strategy of keeping kids out of trouble by keeping them in schools so they are not marching around the streets or the shopping malls. There is nothing in this bill for them. 
   When I was a young man growing up in Brooklyn, I attended the Madison High School Afterschool Center and Night Center. I spent a lot of time playing basketball. I had fun. We were not very good. Our team's motto was: We may be small, but we're slow. But it kept me in constructive activity. It did not cost much. There is nothing in the bill for something like that. 
   Again, could the local school district do this? Yes; and some are able to. But with property taxes through the roof in so many districts--in the suburbs, in the cities, in rural areas --most school districts say they cannot afford it and they simply let the localities fend for themselves. 
   So there is nothing in this bill for students who need and want a place to go after the final bell rings. 
   In sum, this bill, which on first blush does not look too bad, is a real disappointment. Much of the promised money is ``phantom'' money, and it saddens me because our education crisis is anything but ``phantom.'' 
   The economic strength of this Nation, as I mentioned at the beginning of my little chat, is directly tied to the ability of our schools to produce young men and young women who are the best, who are innovative and creative and analytical, skilled in math and science and technology and communications. 
   Just today I introduced legislation with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KERRY, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, which talks about how we are using foreign workers for the most highly skilled professions because we do not have enough Americans to fill those positions. Let's make sure we have enough Americans 5 and 10 and 15 years from now to fill those positions. This bill does not do it. 
   In my view, we should be doing much more for our kids and for schools than what we would do in this bill, even if all the funding was real. This is the one place we should be spending more money. We should be spending it intelligently. We should be spending it with standards. I believe we should not have social promotion. I believe teachers should have standards and be tested and meet certain levels. But we should be spending it. This bill, even if the gimmicks were eliminated, basically treads water. With the gimmicks in it, it means we are drowning. 
   I am disappointed we can't produce a bill that does more for our kids and, particularly, that there is funding here that we know is a phantom. The least we should do is make sure the 100,000 teachers provision is real and whole because our problems are not about to fade away. 
   We need to embark on a massive effort to improve education. If the Federal Government can help do that, I think we should.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, he is right on the money, literally and figuratively--literally because, as I understand it, this proposal says they are going to use $1.2 billion, the amount we need to continue the program of hiring 100,000 new teachers, but then it says only if it is authorized. The Senator may correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the program is not authorized and there is virtually no chance we will authorize it this year. Am I right about that?

Instead of moving forward, this bill is a step backward on teachers and smaller class size, on school construction, afterschool programs. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, in the Senate to reject this bill until it does good for education. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for bringing forward these points so eloquently and so forcefully.

   Mr. SCHUMER. What a great body. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns about the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I first thank the chairman and the ranking member for their efforts on the bill. This is a bill with many important programs that are very popular which has a limit to funding. I know how hard it is to please everybody on this bill. Under the budget caps, it is next to impossible to find the money to do what is necessary. So I appreciate that. 
   But I do rise to voice my concerns. I will support the amendment to be offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY, if he should offer it, to add an additional 50,000 section 8 affordable housing vouchers, because this amendment is a step in the right direction. I hope the Senate will adopt the amendment and work with the House to ensure that it is part of any package sent to the President. 
   New York City and New York State have a severe housing shortage. It is not just in New York City. In New York City, there are over 400,000 people who need homes. In Rochester, there are nearly 20,000 families with severe housing needs. In New York City, there are over 150,000 families on public housing waiting lists alone; and 220,000 families waiting for section 8 help. The waiting list is as long as 8 years in each case. 
   In Syracuse, families must wait 2 and a half years before they get section 8 help. In Rochester, there are 1,700 families waiting for public housing, and 4,500 are waiting for section 8. The bill will make these families wait even longer. 
   The bill adds no new section 8 vouchers, and the public housing is dramatically underfunded. 
   New York State Comptroller Carl McCall--our excellent comptroller--issued a report in July highlighting that New York City's public housing needs over $7 billion in major repairs. 
   Under this bill, I fear these properties will further deteriorate, threatening the health and safety of children and seniors, the disabled and veterans who live in these communities who depend on this Congress to meet our obligations. 
   Our Nation has invested over $90 billion to house the poorest Americans. This bill, I believe, uses these investments as spare parts for other parts of the budget. Let's put a face on the budget. 
   Many of those who are helped by the housing programs that are underfunded by this budget are the most vulnerable in our society. About half of section 8 beneficiaries are children. Over 40 percent of those in public housing are children. 
   Last year, Congress did take a step forward. We authorized 100,000 additional section 8 vouchers in the public housing reform bill. We made progress by adding 50,000. This year, however, the Senate and the House decided the Nation does not need any more. 
   The hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and many more other Americans, waiting for safe and affordable housing need more than the bill offers. 
   About 5 and a half million families spend more than half their income on housing. Many of those are in New York State. Recent studies have indicated that for many of these families the situation is getting worse. The Kerry amendment will help them. 
   The section 8 vouchers that this amendment funds will help Congress fulfill its promise to working families, particularly families leaving welfare. If we are committed to strong communities and want to shrink the welfare rolls, new section 8 
   authority can only help. 
   If the bill was absolutely perfect for veterans, but shortchanged housing, I would be a little happier. Although I feel strongly about section 8 public housing, the bill also achieves only a bear minimum for veterans.  
   As other Senators have pointed out, 99 of us are on record that a full $3 billion over the President's request is needed. I agree with this and I am disappointed that the Wellstone amendment failed. 
   Veterans hospitals across my State have laid off hundreds of staff this year alone. Despite promises from the Department of Veterans Affairs, I believe that even more staff will have to go if this bill goes through. 
   So, in conclusion, I appreciate the job, the difficult job that the chairman and the ranking member face. It is not easy when there are so many important needs and so few funds. I just wish either we could find the extra money or at the very least the priorities were a little different because of housing and veterans needs that are so pressing in my State. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for their courtesy. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today my esteemed colleague from Vermont stood in praise of the beauty of his fine State during the fall season. Nothing, he argued, could compare with the sight of the Green Mountain State's autumnal foliage. To that end, he reported a challenge issued by his fine constituents in Stowe; that on October 1 of this year, the changing leaves of Vermont would reign supreme. 
   I represent a contender to this challenge whose autumn beauty is destined to win any comparison with its bright flying colors of yellow, red, and orange. I am proud to represent the State of New York in this Senate, the Empire State, whose foliage will outshine the changing leaves found in Vermont during this and every October. 
   New York's fall splendor has been captured by a wide variety of artists, from the landscape painters of the Hudson River School to the soulful jazz of Vernon Duke's ``Autumn in New York.'' I point to such representations as proof of our superiority in this venue, and invite any skeptics to visit the Empire State themselves. They will enjoy the breathtaking grandeur of the Catskills, or happily succumb to the peaceful serenity of an autumn day's drive along Interstate 87 in the Adirondack Mountains. From our wineries to our apple orchards, nothing can compare to the glory of Upstate New York in the fall. 
   In fact, speaking of apples, I recall that my esteemed Vermont colleague brought a prize to the table from which he issued his challenge. To the State possessing the finest foliage on the first of October, he said, would go 10 gallons of Vermont Fancy Maple Syrup. Mr. President, it is only appropriate that the Empire State bring its own prize to this competition. To that end, I hereby offer as proof of our greatness 10 gallons of New York's finest apple cider, gleaned from the 25 million bushels produced by the Empire State every year. After all, while maple syrup is truly a product of Vermont's spring rejuvenation, apple cider is evidence of the glory of New York's fine fall.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding. 
   I rise today to express my strong support for the dairy compact and urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the dairy amendment offered by Senators LEAHY and JEFFORDS. I believe the dairy compact will not only help stem the tide of farm closures but will help New York consumers by halting the trend of consolidation within the dairy industry into a few large farms that control most of the market. This proposal gives two hopes for New Yorkers: 1-A, which is far better for us than 1-B; and second, if the dairy compact is kept alive, we hope to be added. We realize that because of technical rules, we couldn't do it here, but we are hopeful that will go forward. 
   In conclusion, I am well aware of the strong objections of my colleagues from Wisconsin and Minnesota. But for upstate New York, one of the few areas of the country losing population and not sharing in the Nation's current prosperity, the dairy compact is a matter of economic survival. I sincerely hope that we can find some common ground----

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania. I am proud to work with him on this amendment. As was stated, this would reauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact and extend it to New York and Pennsylvania, as well as New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Ohio. It also implements the 1-A pricing structure. 
   I have visited dairy farms throughout New York State, and I have become an enthusiastic supporter of the compact, which will preserve the economy and a rural way of life in my State and throughout the country. Over the last 10 years, New York State has lost a third of its dairy farms, dropping from 13,000 to 8,600. These are not just 8,600 farms; they are the backbone of a rural economy. We in New York State have the third largest rural population of any State, and the dairy compact is vital. 
   I have talked to constituents in New York City, and they would, in some cases, pay a little bit more for milk. But we need to bring both parts of the State together. As I have asked my upstate constituents to sometimes consider the problems we have downstate and be mindful of those, I ask the same of my downstate constituents about upstate. 
   The cost is not great. The New England compact price of milk has not risen by more than 4 cents a year; that is, $3.50 a family. WIC is exempt. There is a move I support to exempt senior citizen programs. 
   So it is not going to cost anyone very much to help preserve a portion of our State and a way of life. I am disappointed, of course, that we were unable to garner the 60 votes for the New England compact. I understand why the Senator from Pennsylvania--and I agree with him--will not pursue this to a vote at this point, but we do this in hopes that in conference we can be added to the compact. 
   Both of my good friends from Wisconsin led a strong, valiant fight on the other side. The only thing I would ask them to understand is how desperately our State needs this compact. I am hopeful that we can find some common ground that will benefit both areas. 
   But in the meantime, New York needs entry into the compact. We need 1-A, and I hope that my colleagues will look at this amendment and might be able to support it in conference. 
   I yield whatever remaining time I have. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding time to me.

   Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota and Senators HARKIN and DASCHLE for the farm aid amendment, and for their hard work. This measure will help farmers across the country, including the farmers of New York State, who were hard hit by drought and last year's storms. 
   We are in the midst of the worst drought since the Dust Bowl in my State. There is not a penny of relief for farmers with drought assistance. This drought is affecting farmers throughout the Eastern United States. When I meet with farmers in New York who tell me they are facing unprecedented losses, they are now pointing to letting fields die off to conserve water, or other fields. We can't do anything about the rain, but the Democratic amendment would increase section 32 funding to give farmers some relief from the devastation on the farm and would increase funding for the disaster relief fund--something that would help New York's apple and onion farmers who faced tens of millions in losses last year. 
   In urging my colleagues to support the Democratic amendment, I simply ask the Senator from North Dakota, am I correct in assuming that the Democratic amendment does have this kind of drought relief, which is not in the other bill?

   I ask the Senator to yield for a question. 
   I want to underscore the point about disaster relief in the Northeast. We have farmers who are hurting in my State of New York. Further south, in the middle Atlantic States, the drought is probably the worst it has been in this century. It is awful. In my State, it goes from county to county. Some have had some rain. Many have not. In other States, it is the whole State. 
   The fact that this proposal has money for disaster relief and the other doesn't is going to mean a great deal for the Northeast, I would presume.

   This amendment is simple. It is bipartisan, sponsored by the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, Mr. SMITH of Oregon, Mr. BAYH of Indiana, and myself. It seeks no political advantage for either side. It helps the middle class in a vitally needed way, by making college tuition, up to $12,000, fully deductible for all those in the 28 percent bracket or lower. That is over 90 percent of all Americans. The average middle class person making $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year sweats at night worrying about paying for the cost of college, which is getting higher and higher. I urge support of the amendment.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I rise in support of his amendment. First, I thank him for his leadership on educational issues before introducing this amendment. I would like to speak for a couple of minutes and talk about another educational amendment that will be before us tonight or tomorrow. 
   First, on the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, I have generally considered myself a balanced budget type of person and Democrat. I backed up the President a few years ago when we had a split in our party in the House as to whether to enact a balanced budget, and I am glad I did. I am glad I did. That means that one has to be careful about spending. 
   But if there is one place as we move into the 21st century that we should be spending more--not just throwing money at the problem, being careful, setting standards, but spending more money--it is the area of education. 
   As we move into an ideas economy, an ideas-based economy, the most important resource our country has is the minds of our young people. It is more important than the wealth of the mine, or the fertility of the fields, or even the output of the factory, because more and more and more wealth is created, jobs are created, and happiness is created by how well educated we are by the ideas that our people have. 
   To enact the budget plan posed by the other side, as the chart of the Senator from New Mexico shows, and cut education funding or to even simply freeze education funding, in my judgment, would be a mistake. This resolution, which urges this Senate and this Congress and this country to spend somewhat more on education, again wisely--I would not spend much more on education without imposing standards on teachers and standards on promotion, which makes a great deal of sense--I support wholeheartedly. 
   There is another amendment in the area of education which I am introducing along with Senator SNOWE of Maine, Senator BAYH of Indiana, Senator SMITH of Oregon, Senator WYDEN of Oregon, and Senator KOHL of Wisconsin. It is a bipartisan amendment. We hope this amendment doesn't became a football in the various views of reconciliation that we have. But it is an amendment that is very simple. It is an amendment to make up to $12,000 of college tuition tax deductible and to provide tax 
   credit to help those saddled with student loans. 
   We have introduced this amendment for two real purposes. The first purpose relates to individual families. 
   We are talking about tax cuts. But when I talk to my constituents in New York, and when I hear about constituents from around the country, what is the average person worried about? It is not the exact amount of taxes that they pay as much as it is the big financial nugget they have to deal with--buying a home in early family life, paying for the kids' college in middle life, and paying for health care in later life. 
   Tonight, as we all go to sleep, there will be millions of Americans worrying about how they are going to pay for their kids' college education. Tuition has gone up far more than the rate of inflation. In fact, if you look at the prices of everything since 1980, tuition has gone up more than anything else--even more than health care. I believe the number is 250 percent between 1980 and 1995 for middle-income families--families that do not really need much  other help, families that might make $50,000, or $60,000, or $70,000 a year. It seems almost unfair, after they struggle to pay that tuition bill, for Uncle Sam to take his cut. This bill says that won't happen. This bill says that for anyone at the 28-percent bracket or lower. So the numbers will go up fairly high--$90,000--for a single head of household, and $105,000 for a two-family head of household. You can deduct your tuition. 
   We rarely give relief to those in the middle class. Too often many people in the middle class--the majority of Americans--think most of what we do helps the very poor or the very rich. But this proposal is aimed right at what bothers them, and with good reason. It is going to be tremendously helpful to millions and millions of Americans who right now think they are not getting much out of the tax proposal on either side of the aisle. 
   There is a second reason to do this; that is, for the good of the country. As we move into an ideas economy--as I mentioned in my remarks about the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico--education is the key. The better educated we are, the better we do as a country. In fact, I worry when you look at some of the rankings in terms of education when compared to other Western countries. 
   But every time a well-prepared, intelligent student isn't able to go to the college of his or her choice because of that tuition bill, not only does that individual lose, not only does their family lose but America loses. Every time we don't use and fulfill the potential of a young mind, not only does that person lose, not only does his or her family lose but America loses. 
   It seems to me, as we move into the 21st century in an ideas-based economy, it is almost imperative that we have as many students in as good a college as they can academically achieve. Right now that is not happening. But in this tax bill, if we were to make tuition deductible up to $12,000, it would have a tremendous impetus. 
   A couple of other points on the proposal, a bipartisan proposal, made by myself and Senators BAYH, KOHL, and WYDEN on this side of the aisle, and Senators SNOWE and SMITH on the other side of the aisle: 
   No. 1, it is completely offset. So we are not increasing the tax bill. We mainly do this by delaying certain things in 
   the existing bill for a year. 
   No. 2, it does not cut off until, as I said, you move from the 28-percent bracket and above that. So 90, 95 percent, a huge percentage of America's families, would benefit--all but the extremely well-to-do. 
   No. 3, tuition is deductible up to $12,000 a year. That is full tuition for over 80 percent of all Americans. Even for those who are going to a more expensive school, it is a real help in terms of getting them there. 
   I urge my colleagues to please look at this amendment. It is bipartisan. It is not intended to be an amendment that scores political points. It is an amendment intended to better this country and help middle-class families struggling to send their children to college. 
   I urge its adoption by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   One of our great historians said those who don't learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat it. We are about to repeat the same kind of mistake that was made 20 years ago. We have an economy that is moving along smartly and well. We have inflation in check. We have job growth. Americans are prosperous and happy. 
   All of a sudden, almost with happy recklessness, the other side wants to blow all this up. 
   In 1981, we passed a huge dramatic tax cut. What happened? Interest rates went through the roof. Unemployment rates went from 4 or 5 percent to 7, 8, or 9 percent. Americans were out looking for work. It took an entire decade to rectify that. 
   Adding insult to injury, not only is this idea reckless in terms of the soundness of our economy as my colleague from Illinois has brought up and as Alan Greenspan stated, now we have CBO, which has always been known as a bipartisan, careful agency, saying this huge tax cut is very wrong, as every major economist that I have read about has also stated. It should be done when we move into recession if, God forbid, we do but not now. 
   CBO says this balances the budget better than saving the money and putting it aside for debt reduction and for Medicare. The world is almost being turned upside down. I plead with the CBO Director to get his bearings. I have never seen CBO act in such a wild and almost irresponsible way. 
   We know the budget caps are going to be lifted. What did the Republican leadership do in the House yesterday? They passed another emergency bill. Last week, the census was an emergency, not contained in the budget caps. This week, it was something new. Just yesterday there was an emergency, another $5 billion. They are going over the budget caps. CBO says they won't; it will go to debt reduction. It is absolutely awful. 
   CBO is one of the few compasses we have as we sail through these new economic waters. For them to get so partisan and so off base by making an assumption that is virtually laughable, I plead with the head of CBO to reexamine his statements. To say a $1 billion tax cut will reduce the deficit more, or a $700 billion tax cut will reduce the deficit more than a $300 billion tax cut, with most of the remainder going to be put aside for debt reduction to help the Medicare system is absurd. 
   I ask the Senator from Illinois his view of what CBO is doing. When we lose our moorings, when we lose our lodestars, when the whole debate becomes entirely political, we are in trouble.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I wish to continue the line of discussion we were in before about these two alternative tax cut plans. Again, my greatest worry is not in how the pie is divided, although I certainly very much disagree with the Republican way that is done but, rather, in the overall strength of our economy. 
   To put a huge tax cut in place now, at a time when inflation is low, unemployment is low, and jobs are being created, has the potential of throwing a monkey wrench into our economy. Targeted tax cuts, things aimed at helping middle-class people with their big financial nuts, whether they be health care or college tuition or retirement--those make some sense. But a huge across-the-board tax cut, in my judgment, could throw the economy dramatically off kilter. Will it? No one can predict. But there is an old expression: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
   Our economy has been moving along well, and now, I think mainly because of some ideologues, we are being pushed to do something that risks the great recovery we are now having. That is issue No. 1. 
   Issue No. 2 is saving Social Security and Medicare. Again, you cannot have the money go for everything. Despite CBO's awful statements in the last few days--and I will talk about those in a minute--when you have a dollar, you can use it for something. You can return it to the taxpayers, you can spend it on a program, or you can put it away for some kind of obligation that might occur later. 
   The two great obligations we have to the American people, fiscally speaking, are Social Security and Medicare. If you look at this chart, the Republican plan takes that Social Security surplus and makes it a deficit from 2005 on. 
   How many Americans, for a quick tax cut--most of which they will not  see because it will go, just by definition, to the highest income sector--would risk their Social Security for that tax cut? My argument is: Very few. 
   How many Americans would risk their Medicare--and, God forbid, they or a loved one became ill--for what have proven to be in the past chimerical tax cuts, things that people do not see? Very few. 
   So what we are talking about here is very simple--targeted tax cuts that will help the middle class and preserve Social Security, which is the plan the Democrats have put forward, or a huge tax cut, mainly going to people who are doing remarkably well at the highest end of the spectrum and risking Social Security and Medicare.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I say to the Senator from Illinois that, first of all, my constituents say: Preserve Social Security and Medicare, No. 1; and, second, if you are going to do certain tax breaks, make them targeted to help the middle class, not these big across-the-board tax cuts. 
   I also say to the Senator, in certain parts of my State they would want a ``loxbox,'' but in many others they would refuse that.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from California brings up an extremely valid point. The American people are most worried, not about their present tax situation, although everyone would like lower taxes, no question--particularly in my State, property taxes, which we have nothing to do with, are through the roof. What they care about are the big financial nuts that might bother them. 
   As the Senator from California said, God forbid a parent becomes ill, God forbid a spouse becomes ill, and Medicare is not there or it is so reduced that they have to shell out tremendous amounts of dollars from their own pocket before Medicare bites in. That is what worries people. That is why, I say to the Senator, I am pushing a tuition deductibility proposal because the average middle-class family is doing fine, but when they get hit with these huge tuition bills, it is tough for them to pay. 
   One other point, which relates to what the Senator said, going back to what CBO has done in raiding these two plans. I want to come back to this because it is so worrisome. What they have done is, they have said a plan that cuts taxes by $700 billion reduces the deficit more than a plan that cuts taxes by $300 billion--

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator. 
   CBO has said putting $300 billion aside for deficit reduction reduces the deficit less than putting nothing aside for deficit reduction. 
   I have, in my 18 years in the House and now my 1 year in the Senate, always relied on CBO as a lodestone, as a morning star--fixed, correct, dealing with the excesses politicians have on both sides of the aisle. That has seemed to be true whether they were appointed by Democrats or Republicans. For the first time, I think we are going to start doubting the veracity of CBO in a significant way because they have so twisted their economic logic that economists across America are scratching their heads. 
   We need a CBO to be fair and nonpartisan. CBO is vitally important to us being honest in reducing the deficit; when either party does fiscal hi-jinks, they are called to the carpet. 
   Again, I make a plea to the CBO Director: Reconsider what you have said or, at the very least, give it a better explanation because right now people who follow economics across America are scratching their heads and saying: What has happened? How the heck can CBO score things the way they have? The only answer that seems to be available is politics. That would be a shame. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I think the Senator makes a very good point. Our No. 1 argument is the one the Senator made. It is not middle class versus wealthy. It is not redistribution. That is an argument. 
   The No. 1 argument is a very simple one: The economy is doing remarkably well. The people at the highest end of the economic spectrum have benefited the most. That is how it usually is in America. And here we are, everything is going along nicely, interest rates are low, fueling economic growth, allowing people to buy homes, allowing people to take second mortgages so they can buy other things. We are going to change conditions so that Alan Greenspan would be more likely to have to raise interest rates. And he, a Republican conservative, fiscal watchdog, says: Don't do it. And we are proceeding headlong into a wall to do it. 
   The Senator from Delaware has asked an excellent question: What is motivating this? I think it is leftover politics from the early 1980s.

   Mr. SCHUMER. There is a view, first, that Democrats haven't learned our lesson, which we have since 1994, which is we can't spend on everything we want to, even though we would want to. What we have proposed doing with this money is not spending most of it on new programs but putting the vast proportion away into Social Security and Medicare and reducing the deficit. 
   Second, it is based on the theory that the tax system is out of whack. When you look at it, the percentage of tax paid is going down; the economy is moving. It is almost ``Alice in Wonderland.'' So I think the Senator from Delaware makes an excellent point. Whether you believe in the politics of redistribution or not--and there is a division in this country, in this body, and in our party, as a matter of fact--even if you don't, this tax cut, so massive, so much risking the monkey wrench being thrown in the economic engine that is purring smoothly, is a real risk.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, our State of New York has lost three of its finest citizens. I want to add my voice to the condolences to John Kennedy's sister Caroline, to his entire family, and to his wife's family, as well, for their double loss. Anyone who knew these three people knew they were the finest of New Yorkers and the finest of Americans. They were decent people; they were concerned people; they were people who cared about average folks. 
   As was noted, John, in particular, would never go by somebody and make them feel they were less significant than he was, despite his enormous wealth, attractiveness, good looks, his grace, and everything else about him. He and his wife were a man and woman of grace. I am told that her sister was as well, although I did not know her. 
   So we in New York particularly mourn our loss. John had become a real New Yorker, and the Bessette girls always were. There is nothing we can do but pray that they have met their final reward, and that the wounds that are so deep in their families, with God's help, heal quickly.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, the Senator from Delaware and the Senator  from Virginia, in offering this amendment to preserve the COPS Program for fiscal year 2000. 
   Three days ago, we received the latest news on crime in America, and the news is good. According to the latest National Crime Victimization Survey, nonfatal, violent crime fell 7 percent from 1997. Other figures recently released by the FBI indicate that murders dropped about 8 percent between 1997 and 1998. Overall, the Nation's crime rate has fallen more than 21 percent since 1993 and now is at its lowest level since 1973. 
   My home State of New York has been a shining example of crime reduction. Crime is down from one end of New York State to the other. In Buffalo, it has fallen by more than 30 percent; in Albany, it is down 24 percent; in Nassau County, it is down 24 percent; in New York City, overall crime declined 44 percent and murder dropped more than 60 percent. 
   Why the continued good news on crime? Well, I would be happy to concede to those on the left that a strong economy has something to do with it. I would be happy to concede to those on the right that tougher punishment for violent offenders and aggressive crime fighting by both Republican and Democratic mayors have played a significant role. But just as clearly, enhanced community policing and the COPS Program deserve their share of the credit. 
   I say to anyone in America, ask your local police about the drop in crime in the neighborhoods they patrol. Ask the local neighborhood and civic associations. They will tell you, inevitably, about new partnerships between police and neighborhood residents. They will tell you about successful efforts to deter vandalism, loitering, and disorderly conduct--the seeds of more serious neighborhood deterioration. 
   As pleased as we all should be about the crime fighting successes of the past years, now is no time to stand pat. Old and new law enforcement challenges require us to maintain our vigilance and our efforts. Indeed, the war on crime is sadly a war that never ends. The surest way to prevent a return to the bad old days of untamed streets and unsafe schools is to do what works: Yes, lock up violent offenders; yes, invest in prevention programs; and yes, hire and retain community policing officers. 
   When I authored the COPS Program in the House of Representatives and worked with the Senator from Delaware--we worked in tandem then because I was a House Member and he a Senator--I knew that not only the increased number of police, but the change in the type of policing, to community policing, was going to work. And work it did. 
   There is almost unanimous agreement from law enforcement, from people on both sides of the criminal justice argument, on the left and on the right, that the COPS Program has been a shining success. So when I read the words in the committee report, ``The Committee directs that from within available funds the COPS office close by the end of the fiscal year 2000,'' I was distressed, perturbed, and I was shocked because this is a Government program that works. This is not an ideological program, and it has such broad support. 
   The police agencies, the mayors, and town councils that have put COPS funds to such good use over the past 6 years felt the same way. I have received many letters from New York police chiefs and mayors over the past few weeks about this appropriations bill, and every one contains a similar refrain: Please keep the COPS Program in business. 
   As the Senator from Delaware knows, we made special efforts when we wrote the law to make sure small towns, villages, and counties were included. There was a special set-aside so that not all the money would go to the big cities. I was then a city representative--and, of course, I represent the whole State--representing the people who were most fervently for the program, the small town mayors and local county people, who could not have afforded these police but for the COPS Program. 
   It also has let us accomplish so much. In addition to hiring officers, it purchased new technology and implemented innovative programs to stop domestic violence, all because we created in this program the flexibility that if you could take cops off the desks and put them on the streets, patrolling the streets, it would work. 
   Well, 10,505 newly funded officers later, even the most skeptical New Yorkers--and we have many skeptics in our State--are converts to the cause of the COPS Program. 
   I am proud of this amendment which would keep the COPS Program in business for this fiscal year, negating the report language to the contrary. That is certainly an improvement over the committee's bill, which didn't provide any funding of the program. At the same time, I believe the COPS Program deserves even greater funding for fiscal year 2000 than provided in this amendment because fighting crime is a key to building strong communities. In my State, many of the communities have rebounded, including New York City, because it is much safer. 
   So I believe it should be a top priority for this Congress to reauthorize the COPS Program. Senator BIDEN and I already tried to do it as an amendment to the juvenile justice bill. We will soon introduce, along with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, a freestanding bill to reauthorize the program, and we will not rest until we get the job done. 
   But this is an important step forward. I congratulate my friends from Delaware and Virginia for their hard work on the issue. I also thank my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. HOLLINGS, for his invaluable assistance with this amendment. Again, we will not rest until we get the job done.

   Mr. SCHUMER. When we passed the first Hate Crimes Law there were those who said that it was unnecessary and that hate crimes were overblown. 
   Then came the news of James Byrd in Texas, Matthew Shepard in Wyoming, William Gaither in Alabama, Gary Matson and Scott Mowder in California--young men who were victims of crimes that desecrate America. 
   Today's debate goes back to our original fight. Does this Congress believe that there are those in America who are motivated by hate? Does this Congress believe that there is more that can be done to condemn, prosecute and prevent violent hate? Or do we believe--even after James Byrd, even after Matthew Shepard, even after William Gaither, even after Gary Matson and Scott Mowder--that Hate Crimes are overblown? 
   Since we started keeping statistics in 1991 the FBI has documented over 50,000 hate crimes. But they could prosecute only 37 because the current law is too narrow. 
   The Kennedy bill completes the law. It gives it teeth. The Kennedy bill adds sexual orientation to hate crimes, an omission that has sent a message to those who feed off hate, that bigotry against gays and lesbians is somehow less wrong than bigotry against blacks, latinos and Jews. 
   It removes the civil rights test which gives prosecutors the chance to put violent bigots behind bars. 
   As a nation, we have divergent political views but we are bound by our commitment to punish acts of bigotry against African Americans, Latinos, Jews, and yes--lesbians and gays. 
   This is a bill that will bring this nation together. This is a bill that will make people proud. 
   The only people who need fear the Kennedy bill are those whose private hatreds manifests itself in violent rage against the innocent.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the comments expressed by my friends, the Senator from California and the Senator from Arizona, and commend them for their efforts on the extremely important issue. 
   The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program provides much needed financial assistance to New York State and many of our great state's cities and counties, as they try to grapple with the significant costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. In fiscal year 1998, New York and its localities received a total of $96.4 million in SCAAP funding--  with New York City securing the largest single grant for a locality in the nation. 
   I am very disappointed and disturbed that the bill reported by the committee would reduce SCAAP funding to $100 million for fiscal year 2000, This could translate to a $80 million cut in assistance for New York: a $46 million cut for the state itself, $27.7 million for New York City, 4 million for Nassau County, $1 million for Suffolk County, $800,000 for Westchester County, $32,000 for Montgomery County, $25,500 for Albany County, $19,500 for Putnam County, and smaller amounts for Cortland County. 
   Cuts of this magnitude would leave New York to assume a difficult and heavy burden for what is very much a federal responsibility. I join my friends from California and Arizona in asking our friend from New Hampshire whether something could be done to restore SCAAP funding to a more acceptable level.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the School Quality Counts Act and the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 1999. Mr. President, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates that our nation will require two million teachers over the next decade. In New York State this problem is particularly acute: 40,000 new teachers will be needed over the next four years. In New York City, where there are 10,000 emergency-certified teachers overwhelmingly concentrated in the highest poverty schools, there is virtually no incentive for qualified professionals to teach at the highest poverty schools and as a result there exists an uneven distribution of well trained teachers. 
   Across the nation, many school districts are experiencing both geographic and subject area teacher shortages. In many instances, school districts with lower tax bases are forced to compete with districts that can afford to pay their teachers higher salaries thus creating a drain on the pool of experienced and qualified teachers in lower income school districts. Attracting and retaining well-qualified teachers, and compensating them appropriately, is critical to raising student achievement. 
   Mr. President, the School Quality Counts Act deals directly with the teacher quality issue in three ways: First, the bill strengthens state and local accountability for student results by requiring that school districts take specific steps to improve teacher quality within two years of the bill's enactment; second, the legislation would empower parents and taxpayers by providing information on student and school performance through the issuance of school report cards; third, the bill would provide ``achievement awards'' to those schools that demonstrate continuous student improvement.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. It looks as if even this amendment will be defeated, if the past is any pattern. It is so minimal: the right to ombudsman, points of service, a gag rule so your physician can tell you the truth, financial incentives. It is hard to believe this amendment is going down, but it is, and so is every other reasonable provision. 
   So as we come to the close of this week's debate, it is worth looking at what has happened in the Senate. What has happened this week can be summed up in one sentence: The insurance industry won; American families lost. 
   The insurance industry won and American families lost because the right to emergency room treatment at the nearest hospital is not granted. The insurance industry has won and American families have lost because access to specialists is not guaranteed. The insurance industry has won and American families have lost because the right to appeal an unfair decision by the HMO is not guaranteed. The insurance industry won and American families lost because the right to sue, even the most egregious, outrageous behavior by an HMO, is not granted. 
   The insurance industry won and American families lost because the right of so many women, the desire of so many women to have an OB/GYN as their primary care physician is not there. And most of all, the insurance industry won and the American people lost, because instead of covering 161 million people, we are only covering 48 million people. Even the minor changes that were made by those on the other side of the aisle are underscored by these two numbers: 161/48, 161 million  people 
   covered by our proposal; 48 million by theirs. 
   What about the other 113 million? They get no rights at all. 
   I am going to make a prediction. This will not be the last time we take up the Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   We are coming to the close of this debate. The amendment the Senator from North Carolina and I offered on appeal has been replaced by a much weaker version. We allow an independent review process. We allow that, if your HMO should say to you, you can't have this medicine, you can't have this procedure, you can't see this specialist, you would get an independent review as to whether that was right or wrong. 
   Under the proposal that was passed by the other side, very simply, that review will not exist except by somebody appointed by the HMO itself--not independent and not real. But, in general, in this debate, and what has happened again is what has happened this week, which is simple, the insurance companies won and American families lost. As a result of what we have done today, the vast majority of American families will not get access to emergency rooms, access to specialists, the right to appeal an unfair decision, the right to sue, and the right to have an OB/GYN physician be their primary care physician. 
   If we could sum up this debate, it is in two charts. It is in three little numbers. First, under the Democratic plan, 161 million people are affected. Under the Republican plan, 48 million people are affected--161 million or 48 million. 
   What do the American people want? My guess is they want as many people covered as possible. 
   As for cost, it is $2 a month more. As the Senator from Massachusetts has said repeatedly, that is not more than the cost of a Big Mac a month. We could cover all of these people, and we  could have emergency room access, we could have access to a specialist, and a right to appeal an unfair decision. 
   I ask the American people to remember this day as a day when the Senate turned its back on them and their wishes; as a day when the special interests, particularly the insurance companies, prevailed over common sense and wisdom; as a day when this Senate chose to have only 48 million people covered, not 161 million; and a day when this Senate said you can't get emergency room coverage, you can't get access to a specialist, and you can't get the right to appeal an unfair decision by the HMO because it cost $2 more a month per worker. 
   It is a sad day for the American people. It is a day when this body chooses to follow the whims of the insurance industry rather than the desires of the American people. 
   Oh, yes. There are some placeboes. In fact, the bill we are passing today is a placebo. But by definition a placebo is only affected when there is nothing wrong with the patient. If you are well and you are never going to get sick, you love the Republican plan. But if you have had to go through the agony and ordeal of having an HMO reject medicines, doctors, and procedures that are desperately needed by you or a loved one, you will rue this day. 
   I say to my colleagues: Wake up. Our health care system is ill. A placebo won't work. This bill is a placebo. Managed care needs real medicine to become well again, and this placebo will not do the job. 
   It seems very clear to me that this will not be the last time we take up the Patients' Bill of Rights. The reason this won't be the last time we will take up this bill is because the families of America will find out in the next year that the HMO beast has not been tamed, that the good that HMOs have brought in terms of reducing costs is being outweighed by the bad in terms of cookie-cutter decisions made by accountants and not by doctors. 
   We will be back. We will argue this issue again and we will prevail because the American people want real medicine--not a placebo prescribed by the insurance industry. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding. 
   It has been a long week. I know there will be many who will say that this week was not as productive as it might be. I agree with that completely. 
   But this is one good point that has emerged. We have debated, as we asked, the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is now an issue that is before the American people. They know there will be a time when they don't have to put up with HMOs that are dictating policy. 
   The American people know that in the doctor-patient relationship there does not have to be a third person in the room all the time--an actuary, an accountant with no medical experience. They know it is possible for this Senate and this Congress to pass a law that might say that if your doctor says you need a medication, and says you need a procedure, and says you need an operation, and your HMO denies it, you have the right --you could, if this Senate had the courage--to an independent appeal. 
   Unfortunately, amendment after amendment that would have protected the average American was rolled back. Unfortunately, we are in a situation where the insurance industry has all too often dictated what has happened on this floor. Instead of stepping up to the plate and voting for the protections for which our constituents are literally clamoring, this Senate buckled to the insurance industry and passed a bunch of amendments that are aimed at looking good and doing nothing. The look-good, do-nothing amendments will not prevail because next week, and the week after, as Americans visit their doctors and their HMOs deny them service, deny them things they need, they will know. 
   This entire debate can be summed up in three numbers. Who is covered under the Democratic plan? One hundred and sixty-one million people. We lost on that amendment. The Republican plan, which covers 48 million people, prevailed. 
   What are we saying to the 113 million who will not get coverage? The main argument against the legislation is that it would cost too much. The cost is $2 a month. How many Americans wouldn't pay $2 a month to have their doctor determine what medicine, what operation, what specialist they need? 
   I think the only Americans who would not vote to have that $2 a month in exchange for what they need medically are in this Senate, and in a few of the HMOs. 
   My colleagues, my friends, this is not the Senate at its greatest hour. This is a time when we, once again, succumb to the special interests and deny what the American people want. 
   But we will be back. The American people will demand we come back. They will demand the pendulum swing back to the middle so actuaries don't make policy, but doctors do. 
   We shall return. We shall, not tonight but in the future, prevail.

And, further asking a question, that means that four out of five would not get emergency room coverage; four out of five would not get the right to specialists; four out of five would not get the extended appeals, the independent appeals; four out of five would not have any right to sue. 
   So this amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts is offering is probably, I would guess, the most important amendment because every other amendment is dependent on it. No matter how good an amendment you agree to, if the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts is not agreed to, it does not matter to most Americans because they simply will not be covered. We would be voting for a bill that would do one-fifth as much, at best, as a proposal that would cover everybody. Am I correct?

   Mr. SCHUMER. One final question. This chart would indicate it all. It is 48 million/161 million. Under our proposal, the Democratic proposal, 161 million Americans are covered for emergency room, for specialists, for independent review, for the right to sue. And, at best, even if all the other amendments are agreed to, under the Republican proposal under 48 million would be covered?

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   There are two crucial numbers to look at as we debate this entire bill: 48 and 161--48 million Americans covered by the Republican plan, 161 million Americans covered by the Democratic plan. We are saying 70 percent of all Americans will get no protection. 
   Do we say 70 percent of all Americans are not covered by minimum wage? Do we say 70 percent of all Americans are not covered by Social Security? Do we say 70 percent of all Americans do not get child labor laws applied to them, do not get the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts applied to them? I have never heard anything such as this in my life--take a proposal needed by all people and arbitrarily say 30 percent of Americans will be covered and 70 percent of Americans will not. 
   This vote on the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts will be the most crucial vote in the entire debate, because it will determine, do we really wish to cover all Americans. 
   Should only 30 percent of Americans get the right to emergency room care? Should only 30 percent of Americans get the right to see a specialist? Should only 30 percent of women get to treat an OB/GYN as their primary care specialist? Who would agree with that? 
   Anyone who votes against the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts, anyone who votes for the Republican plan is arbitrarily, unfairly,  and inhumanely cutting off 70 percent of all Americans. 
   The cost: $2 a month. The cost argument is bogus. 
   The real issue is, who will be covered and who will not be. Under this plan, we cover 161 million; they cover 48 million.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   As the Senator from Iowa noted, no one seems to be debating this amendment. Everyone seems to be debating  other parts of the bill. There is a very simple reason why. Our bill says, when your primary care physician says you need a certain specialist, you will get one. Their bill says, when you need a certain specialist, maybe you will get one if the HMO says you can. 
   Let me tell you a story about a young woman in my State, a nurse, in her prime of life, 24 years old, a good athlete. She had a health care plan from her father because he was a lineman for the phone company. She developed a tumor on her femur. She went to her primary care physician. He said: This is dangerous. You need an oncological orthopedic surgeon. Her HMO said: No, no, no. You can use an ordinary orthopedic surgeon. The primary care physician said: No. You need an oncological orthopedic surgeon. This is a very difficult tumor. 
   But they were not a rich family. When the HMO said no, she went and had the operation from the orthopedic surgeon. Guess what. The tumor grew right back. She went back to the HMO. She said: I did what you said. I went through a painful operation. Now let me go to the specialist my primary care physician says I need. They said no again. She went on her own, paid $36,000 out of her pocket. It cured the tumor, but now she can hardly walk. 
   When she went to the HMO and said, please, pay for this, they said, no, no, no. Under the Democratic bill, Debra Bothe would not have had to go through this. She would have had the specialist she needed. She would be walking today. Her family would not be totally out of money today. Under the Republican bill, nothing would have changed. 
   That can be repeated in story after story, in anecdote after anecdote, on factual basis after factual basis. If you need a specialist, if you are deathly ill--I ask the Senator if I could have 30 seconds?

   Mr. SCHUMER. If you are deathly ill, and your physician says you need a certain specialist, do you want the Democratic bill that says you get one or the Republican bill that says maybe you will get one, if your HMO allows you to? 
   I say to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, that is what working families want and need--this 
   kind of bill, this kind of proposal, not a proposal that is toothless and sides with the insurance companies time after time after time. 
   I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   There are two pernicious parts to this amendment. One is removing the accurate definition of medical necessity, as the Senators from Massachusetts and California have pointed out, and the second is putting in an appeals process that is nothing short of bogus in a whole variety of ways. When you look at the appeals process that is being substituted by the Senator from Vermont, you understand how grudging it is, how imperfect it is, how it will not do the job. Let me give a few examples. 
   First, there is no timeliness. The HMO can initiate the appeals process whenever it wants. It could wait 3 months or 6 months or 9 months before review. Our amendment, which the Senator from North Carolina and I will offer, requires the review process to start when the patient asks. 
   Second, there is no requirement that the appeals process, after it is finished, be implemented. The HMO can appeal and appeal and appeal. 
   The two I want to focus on this afternoon are these: First, it is much more limited in scope. I say to my friends and my fellow Americans who are watching this debate, this is not two competing bills; this is one bill that does the job and one bill that seeks to please the insurance industry and still make it look as if the job is being done. 
   One of the main issues is scope: 160 million covered versus 48 million covered for emergency room, for medical necessity, and for other things. Thirty-eight million people would be included in the Schumer-Edwards amendment who are excluded by this amendment. 
   Perhaps the greatest area where this amendment is a false promise, is a hoax, is the independent review. The Senator from Vermont said the review is independent. Not so. In the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, the reviewer is appointed by the HMO. The reviewer is not even required to have no financial relationship with the HMO. Theoretically, under this proposal, the HMO could pay an ``independent'' reviewer. If we want an independent external review, why shouldn't that reviewer have no ties to the HMO? 
   How can we tell people that an independent review is independent when the insurer selects the reviewer? If you have ever heard of the fox guarding the chicken coop, here it is. An independent review, as in the amendment we will be voting on in the next few days, requires that the HMO not pick the reviewer. I know the Senator from Vermont has stressed that a pediatrician would review a child's case. I say to my colleagues, if I were a member of an HMO, I would not want a pediatrician who has a financial relationship with the HMO to review the case.

   Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator did not yield to me. I will wait until his time to answer a question. 
   What I am saying is this: If you want a real review, and hundreds of thousands of Americans want such a review, then vote against this amendment, wait for the Schumer-Edwards amendment, and you will get a true independent review. 
   In conclusion, this is not so different from the gun debate we had a month and a half ago, where we had a powerful special interest on one side and the American people on the other side, and there were a series of proposals put forward that the powerful special interests liked but were intended to make the American people believe we were making progress. 
   I cannot tell you how or where or when, but just as in the gun debate, the American people will not be fooled. They want, they demand, a real Patients' Bill of Rights, one that covers 160 million Americans, not 48 million, one that has a real review process, not a sham review process where the reviewer can be paid by the HMO. Please vote down this amendment.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate the Senator searching to come up with the right solution here. I would ask him--he is an 
   excellent lawyer, far better than I am--on page 179 of the bill, (iv), says:  
   receive only reasonable and customary compensation from the group health plan or health insurance issuer in connection with the independent external review .....  
   It seems to me--and I ask the Senator the question--that the plan proposed in the substitute envisions the insurer paying the reviewer. That seems to me not to be an independent review.

Again, I rely on the Senator's much greater knowledge of the law. If the reviewer were not selected by the HMO, they would obviously be more independent. That is on page 175.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the Senator, wouldn't we be better in guaranteeing independence by having the selection of the review panel be made independently of the HMO, given that the HMO--I understand there are some criteria here, but if we are trying to get a truly independent process, it strikes me that it would be a lot better to have the selection be made truly independently, not by the HMO, which obviously has an interest, albeit, as the Senator certainly recognizes and pointed out, with a bunch of criteria.

   I rise in agreement with the Senator from California against the amendment of the Senator from Ohio. I make this argument--and I am sorry the Senator from Pennsylvania is not here--if I were to offer an amendment that said you couldn't use your Federal dollars to buy a handgun from your salary, there would be outrage on that side. They would say: We haven't made handguns illegal. 
   You may think they should be. I don't, it so happens, but for the sake of argument you think handguns should be illegal. But fight it on the issue of handguns, don't fight it by taking away Federal employees' rights. 
   There would be outrage from the very same people who are now saying this.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California for yielding to me to allow me to answer the question of the Senator from Pennsylvania, which is what I was attempting to do. He asked me a question, and he didn't let me answer. 
   The answer is simple: What you are doing on this amendment is imposing your will on how a Federal employee can spend their money, despite the fact they have a right to choose. It is no different, I argue, from me imposing my will on the right of a Federal employee to spend their money--Federal dollars--on the right to, say, buy a handgun. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. 
   I wouldn't support that amendment for both the reasons I mention. I think you argue right head on--not try to deal with Federal dollars. Second, I am not for abolishing all handguns. However, I say to my colleagues, the analogy is exact. I think it shows the fallacy of the argument behind the amendment of the Senator from Ohio.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I very much appreciate the encomia that the Senator from Connecticut has given to our State of New York. 
   I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey for not forcing this dubious amendment tonight. First of all, there are two reasons to reject this amendment. One is that it is moot. Six days ago, as the Senator from New Jersey indicated, a court knocked out the entire commuter tax. To spend time debating this amendment right now, at this late hour, when people are eager to leave, and when the good work of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Illinois has to be completed, does not make much sense. 
   Second, I caution that for the Senate to do this amendment without any hearings, without it going to the Finance Committee, might jeopardize all sorts of other complex decisions. Many States have pacts and agreements and covenants with neighboring States. How much this amendment affects those pacts and agreements, I don't know--but neither does anybody else in this Chamber. 
   To move this legislation which might have an effect on so many things, I am told, without nary a hearing or a discussion, would be a serious mistake. In fact, the Federation of Tax Administrators, on June 21, wrote about the companion bill in the House. They said:  
   Just what this bill is trying to do that has not already been done is the question. Unfortunately, when Congress attempts to restate existing constitutional law, the courts are left to cast about for a meaning for the new law. The resulting interpretations lead to countless examples of ``unintended consequences.'' Because of the bill's widespread impact, its confusing language, and the fact that the protections Congress hopes to bestow upon the taxpayers of New Jersey are already firmly established in the U.S. Constitution, the Federation [that is the Federation of Tax Administrators] would urge you at a minimum to withhold consideration of the House companion bill.  
   So I appreciate the fact we have done that in the House. We will debate this another day, this already moot point, and to not take any further time from my colleagues who are eager to debate other issues. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time and wish my colleagues a happy Fourth of July.

We do not deserve--the American people do not deserve--for it to be shoved under a carpet to pop out sometime unknown perhaps when it cannot be debated. 
   I ask the Senator this question: Does it seem unreasonable, given his years of experience in the Senate--and I know we worked on criminal justice matters when I was in the House--does it seem unreasonable for us to have a goal, for the American people to sort of set the goal, or agree with us in the goal, that the juvenile justice bill, including provisions such as closing the gun show loophole, which this body passed, be on the President's desk by the day school resumes, by Labor Day of next September? Does that seem to be a reasonable timetable and a reasonable request for people who are interested in debating the issues and seeing that we do something to close the gun show loophole?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   I, too, want to join my friends, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator LOTT, Senator ASHCROFT, and others in honoring the memory--the blessed memory--of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, who is truly one of the great heroes of the Jewish community and of all of America in the second half of the 20th century. 
   I am proud to have called him a friend as well as a mentor. He would guide me regularly on political and moral events. He is missed by myself, and my wife and my family, as he is by millions of others. 
   Rabbi Sherer did so many good things. Senator LIEBERMAN spoke about how he gave great strength to the orthodox community which had been through one of the worst periods of history ever inflicted on any people, and they came to America. What Rabbi Sherer did more than anything else was show them that they could live by Torah values, and the values of teaching, as well as by American values--in fact, that the two strengthened each other; that the values we have learned in the Torah, the Bible, and our teachings, the Talmud, which was mentioned by Senator LIEBERMAN, would make people better Americans; and the values that America allowed us to grow in, no matter who you were, or where you came from, if you worked hard, you could achieve something for you and your family, were consonant with Torah values. 
   What Rabbi Sherer did through the guide of Israel, aside from the way he touched all of our lives, is that he helped my State of New York and our great country grow, because today there are hundreds of thousands--maybe millions--in America who follow Rabbi Sherer and who follow what he taught. They are living the ways that have been lived by our ancestors for thousands of years--the way of Torah, the way of life. 
   But at the same time, they are building this country by the American values consonant with Torah values of hard work and dedication. And as they build and work hard to help themselves and their families, they help America grow; they start companies; they work in other companies; they teach. 
   So Rabbi Sherer's loss has been a loss for us who know him and knew him and miss him. It has been a loss for the Jewish community in America--one of our greatest leaders who taught us about education and who taught us that living a life of Torah values and being proud Americans is totally consistent. So it is also a great loss for America because America has always depended on and relished in the glory of lives such as that of Rabbi Moshe Sherer. 
   So I join with my colleagues, my friends in the gallery, in remembering him, remembering his life and his good deeds, and knowing that, as a Jew and as a New Yorker and as an American, I am proud to stand before my colleagues and before all of our country and say words of praise in memory, in blessed memory, of Rabbi Moshe Sherer.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask the Senator a question because I have heard of so many similar instances. A young woman, a nurse on Long Island, needed an orthopedic oncologist to remove a tumor from her leg. No, she can't have it. She couldn't afford it. So she went to a regular orthopedist, not the oncological orthopedist, who took out the tumor. It grew back. She can hardly walk. Then she had to go to an oncological orthopedist and pay the $40,000 herself because there was no other choice. 
   So the Senator is right. She has fought for this for so long. 
   I just heard--parenthetically, it is sort of related, because one of the things that inspired some of us to join in this fight was what happened on guns--for instance, that the majority leader in the House has said they would not appoint conferees at least until after July 4, which I consider truly outrageous. I will talk more about that later when we get time. I think it is so wrong to not allow the will of the people to happen. We are doing the same thing on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We just want to debate and let people vote on what is important. 
   I ask the Senator, is this the only case she has heard of in this situation, or do you hear, when you go around your State, as I go around mine, hundreds of cases where people are denied treatment that the doctors feel they need? They sit there in anguish.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I was going to ask the Senator another question related to one of the other problems we face; that is, even before they get the right to sue, there is an appeal. 
   Let us say, as in the case that the Senator from Illinois brought up and the unfortunate death that occurred, the doctor said that she needed catheterization, and it is denied by the insurance company. The only type of appeal that is required by law is an internal review. I want to know if that is required--that the only appeal that would be required would be an internal review. 
   I ask the Senator a question, and that is this: Wouldn't it be much fairer if it at least were mandated that there be some external, impartial review so that in instances over and over again where inadequate health care maybe would be provided before the stroke occurs--as in the case related by the Senator from California, and the unfortunate death that occurred--some outside, independent reviewer gets to say, hey, that actuary didn't quite make the correct medical decision; I agree with the doctor?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 2 months ago, right after the tragedy of Columbine High School, I warned that whenever a tragedy occurs in our schools, if we don't act quickly and resolutely, the tragedy would recede in memory and we would fail to pass laws necessary to make our schools safe, thereby creating new ways for future tragedies to occur. 
   To the relief of the entire Nation, the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill that, thankfully, although belatedly, closed the gun show loophole. 
   The House, however, failed in its duty to the American people. The House was unable to shake loose from the NRA. They were unable to pass a juvenile justice bill with any gun control legislation and unable to even close the gun show loophole. 
   I rise today to remind the Senate of the urgency that led us to act firmly and resolutely after Columbine, and to use the various parliamentary procedures that allow Members to bring the juvenile justice bill and the gun show loophole bill to conference where we can do what is right. 
   I spent part of this weekend, Sunday and Monday, in New York's capital region, talking with constituents from Albany and the surrounding towns. Some of the areas were fairly rural. Without prompting, people walked up to me and said: Senator, what the heck are they doing in Washington? How come you can't even close something as simple as the gun show loophole? 
   They were incredulous. These people aren't passionate advocates of gun controls. They were outraged. They could not believe that a lobbying group, even such a powerful lobbying group as the NRA, could stop the Congress from passing a basic gun show measure. 
   I am proud of what the Senate accomplished last month. We debated juvenile justice for over a week. Passions frequently ran high. We cast five separate votes on various proposals purporting to close the gun show loophole. In the end, we approved the real thing. The juvenile justice bill itself passed by a margin of 73-25, with majorities of both parties voting in favor. 
   Is it a perfect bill? No. Is it a good bill that will make a real difference? Absolutely. 
   Now the question is whether we are going to throw up our hands and say the House couldn't stand up to the gun lobby, so let's give up. 
   We are in a strange lull, a lull in which newspaper stories inform us, and I quote the Washington Times of June 23:  
   Some [GOP leaders] said even a Senate-House conference to iron out differences with Democrats over gun-control provisions in a juvenile justice bill is now in doubt.  
   I am told today that Mr. ARMEY said at the very earliest, conferees would not be appointed until after the July 4 recess. 
   First and foremost, conferees ought to be appointed. We should not simply stop the process because some people, certainly a minority of the Members of Congress, and certainly a minority in terms of the views of the American people, do not want it to happen. The Senate debated the issue. We should have the ability to go to conference. I call on the House leadership to appoint conferees quickly and with alacrity so we might debate the provisions here, not only the gun show loophole but many of the provisions that people on both sides of the aisle support that would make it easier to punish violent juveniles as adults and that would provide some of the prevention services that young people need. Because juvenile justice and closing the gun show loophole is a priority to many Americans; to a large majority of Americans, in my opinion. 
   Two weeks ago, for instance, a month after we passed the juvenile justice bill, we passed the Y2K liability bill. Lo and behold, Senate conferees were immediately appointed, and I understand we are now close to an agreement. In fact, I believe an agreement is due this afternoon. I think that is great. But Y2K is a far more complicated bill than juvenile justice. It is treading on fresh new ground. 
   The millennium, by definition, occurs every thousand years but we finished this one right up. The juvenile justice bill, however, is in stasis. There are things that can be done to get it moving. The most obvious is for the House leadership once again to appoint conferees so we can debate the gun show loophole. The real problem I fear is that those in the Republican House leadership do not want to continue to debate this issue. They know their allies in the NRA and the American people, including most gun owners, are divided because most Americans, including most gun owners, sincerely believe providing a background check at a gun show does not infringe their rights just as we now provide that a background check must be done when you buy a gun at a gun shop. But they do not want to do that. 
   So there are other things we should consider to get things moving. Perhaps we can add these provisions to a bill that has to be conferenced. Perhaps we can add this to other types of proposals which the other body sees a need to have go forward. But I am issuing this challenge, particularly to the House leadership but to all of my colleagues: We should pledge to send a juvenile justice bill, one way or another, to the President's desk, a bill which includes the Senate gun show provision, by the first day of school, the Tuesday after Labor Day. That is 2 months to pass a bill that we already passed. If we do not, and there is, God forbid, another school shooting, we will sorely regret our inaction. 
   I yield the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Philip E. Lagana, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York who recently passed away. Judge Lagana leaves behind a legacy of fairness and compassion as a Justice. He was not afraid to make difficult decisions, explore new concepts, or develop new theories, and he serves as an example to all in terms of not only how to be an exemplary justice but also how to be an exemplary human being. 
   Judge Lagana was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent his lifetime serving his community. He attended Georgetown University, and then Brooklyn Law School, after which he began a private practice in the field of criminal law. Soon after, he began a long and distinguished career of public service, beginning in the Kings County District Attorney's Office, where he was appointed an Assistant District Attorney. He was rapidly promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the Supreme Court Trial Assistants, where he set up a Bureau of Major Offenses. Upon completion of this task, Judge Lagana was appointed Chief of this bureau. In 1974, then-mayor Abe Beame made Judge Lagana the President of the New York City Tax Commission. In 1975, he was elected to the Supreme Court of the State of New York. His election served as recognition by the public of his many years of public service. 
   As a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Judge Lagana acted with firmness, fairness, and compassion. His actions found support from the appellate bench which reviewed them, from the lawyers who argued before him, from his fellow justices, and from the public. He was reelected for an additional 14-year term. 
   In 1992, Judge Lagana retired from the bench, leaving behind a proud legacy as a distinguished public servant, and taking with him many accolades and honors, among them from the Catholic Lawyers Guild, the Columbian Lawyers Association, the Kings County Criminal Bar Association, the Brooklyn Bar Association, the New York State Real Estate Board, the United Jewish Appeal, Marlboro Memorial Post No. 1437, the American Legion and its Women's Club, and the 46 A.D. Democratic Club. 
   Judge Lagana will be remembered as a dedicated public servant and as a decent person who had a loving commitment and dedication to his family, country, and society. Judge Lagana will be missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator and appreciate everything he said and the graciousness with which he said it. 
   I will make two points in terms of my question. I am a freshman Senator. I am well familiar with the process of the House. That is something I wished to escape. It is one of the reasons I ran for the Senate. The reason was that we could not debate at any time appropriations bills or authorization bills without really the consent of the Rules Committee, which was controlled by the Speaker 11 to 5. We could not get anything done. 
   From what I understand in listening to my colleagues and being here myself, this has been like a pressure cooker. On bill after bill, bills that we have done, instead of being given the chance to offer amendments--we did some authorizing bills, but then on a good number of them--Y2K, for instance--the tree was filled. In other words, the majority leader offered an amendment and then put on a second-degree amendment, and then another amendment and put on a second-degree amendment. We were not permitted to, say, add a Feinstein amendment or an amendment that I hoped to offer about scope or other amendments as well. 
   The frustration on our side--I began to hear my colleagues, who have been here many years longer than I have been, start saying that this is just like the House, 
   that in the past the right of the majority was to sort of set the agenda--chair the committees, call the hearings--but in the Senate, in its grand traditions, the minority always had the right to offer some amendments. 
   As we moved through the process this year, through a bunch of legislative maneuvers--all within the rules but maybe not within the previous traditions of the Senate--we were not allowed to do that. 
   So we came to the conclusion that, on something as important to so many of us as the Patients' Bill of Rights, we would not have the opportunity, under any circumstance, to offer those amendments. 
   My guess is that the kind of offer that was made, which our minority leader has outlined why we think it is inadequate, we never would have gotten to that point if there had been an open process and we had been allowed to offer amendments as we went through that process. 
   I just ask the majority whip, who is a Senator I have a great deal of respect for--and I understand we have different views on the Patients' Bill of Rights, but he is coming at this and trying to be very fair--what can be done to avoid the kinds of frustration that my colleagues on this side of the aisle are genuinely feeling on the Patients' Bill of Rights or on so many other issues, that we will not have any opportunity, any time, to offer amendments on issues important to us, unless we sort of force the issue, as we have done this week? 
   I yield. That is my question to the majority whip.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would just like to first thank my colleagues from South Dakota, Massachusetts, and California for bringing up this issue. 
   Let me just say that, again, as I travel across my State, the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights is one that is foremost on the minds of my constituents. I have heard their pleas and complaints. I have heard about horrible situations that people are forced into. I have heard about the fears of tens of thousands of people in each community who do not have a problem now with their HMO, but having heard about a relative, a friend, a professional colleague who has, they worry about having one themselves. 
   So the bottom line is a simple one. We wish to have a free and open debate. That is our position. It is more important than many of the issues we were debating. 
   I heard the majority leader say we had to do the foreign operations bill. That is a bill that is important to me and to many of my constituents but hardly one as important as the Patients' Bill of Rights.  
   So what we are saying on this side is the following: That there has been such a breakdown in the patient-doctor relationship, and with the intrusion of that patient-doctor relationship by an army of accountants and actuaries and bureaucrats who are making decisions that should be made by doctors and nurses and hospitals, that something has to be done. 
   We disagree on cost issues. The Senator from Oklahoma thought it would raise costs 13, 14, 15 percent. The Senator from Massachusetts has a CBO estimate--CBO is impartial--that says it would be the cost of a Big Mac a month to a family. But the very least is that we should be debating that issue, debating it fully and openly. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma has said that it was not his intention, when he offered his proposal, that someone filibuster and take the whole 30 hours or the whole week just filibustering. 
   That may well be the case, but there may be one of the 100 Senators who feels so strongly against this issue that he would take to the floor to filibuster. Unless we can get in the confines of the agreement that we will be able to vote on the very important issues that are part of the Patients' Bill of Rights, then how can we agree? Because if we were to agree now--and there are so many thousands of our constituents on whose hopes and even prayers this legislation rests--and we were not to get those votes, and instead someone would filibuster, they would all think we had let them down. 
   So the bottom line is a very simple one. 
   The bottom line is, yes, we can come to an agreement, but the agreement, from our point of view, needs to allow open debate and votes on a whole series of issues. My guess is we won't win every one, but my guess is we will win a good number. 
   To have an agreement that might allow one person to filibuster the whole time, even though it may not be the majority whip's intention, to have an agreement that would not allow the major issues to be not only debated but voted upon would be a serious miscarriage of the hopes of millions of Americans who wish to see the patient-doctor relationship restored. It would have been much better if we had done that debate this week. 
   As I mentioned to the majority whip, the feeling on this side of the aisle of frustration, that the open process on which the Senate has prided itself for 200 years would no longer be allowed, led to our view that we would make sure and do everything in our power within the rules of the Senate to see that open debate and votes on the Patients' Bill of Rights occurred. 
   I think we are doing a service to our constituents. I think this is what they sent us to the Senate to do. I will be doing everything I can, helping our minority leader, helping the senior Senator from Massachusetts and all of my other colleagues who care so much about this issue, to see that we get that open, full debate and the votes on the very important issues of the Patients' Bill of Rights to which our constituents are entitled. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here, of course, to discuss what many of my colleagues have discussed in the past--the need for us to debate totally and openly the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is an issue of great concern to the people of my State. Everywhere I go--urban, rural, suburban--people are asking: What is happening to the Patients' Bill of Rights? 
   This is an issue many of us have discussed. I know this 
   body debated it for a little while last year, but, unfortunately, things were left unresolved. It has not been left unresolved for the millions of Americans who are now having their medical policies dictated, not by their doctor, not by their nurse, not by their family, but rather by some unknown bureaucrat who has no medical education but is simply part of an HMO. 
   When you go to hospital after hospital throughout the State of New York and sit with doctors, you see the frustration in their eyes as they tell you story after story. They have been negotiating with these actuaries. They say to the actuary: Are you a medical doctor? How can you tell me the patient does not need this type of operation or this type of medication? They get no good medical answers. To them, it is similar to going to medical school and spending years of internship and residency and it makes very little difference. 
   For that reason, our health care system--by the way, I give good marks to our health care system. It has been overwhelmingly successful. The average age of Americans is higher than ever before. Not only do we live longer but we live healthier longer. 
   I look at my parents. Thank God. Praise God. Just last week each of them had a birthday. One is 76 and one is 71. My dad has had a few health mishaps, but he is in good health. It is in part because of our medical system. But we have been losing so many of these benefits in the last several years, because the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of the HMOs. We find more people who have had no training in medicine overruling doctors in medical procedures, because the book of standard operating procedures dictates the limited number of options. We don't want that. Most Americans don't want it. 
   That is why we need to debate this Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to debate its scope: Should it cover only 50 million Americans, or should it cover  closer to 150 million Americans? We need to debate its provisions: How long a review process should there be? Should it be internal or external? Should an HMO be allowed to have the last word on a life-or-death procedure that the physician believes is very much needed? Should there be a gag rule? Should physicians be ordered not to tell their patients about certain procedures or certain medications that are available? Should women have the right to choose their obstetrician and gynecologist who is often their primary care physician? 
   These are all important issues. I know there are Members on the other side who talk about freedom of choice. People talk about costs. I don't agree with those arguments, but I would certainly like to debate them in this distinguished Chamber. 
   I ran, as I know you did, Mr. President, and many others, for the Senate from the House because I thought that we would have the opportunity to debate the great issues. There was certainly no guarantee that we would win. There was certainly no guarantee that my beliefs would prevail. But I thought there was something of a guarantee--that the wide open debate the Senate has been known for for over 200 years would be guaranteed even to somebody who sits way over in this corner of the Chamber, which means you are a freshman at the bottom of the seniority pecking order. It hasn't happened. 
   The reason this floor is silent right now, and the reason we are not debating other bills, is that many of us believe strongly we should debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. But we 
   also believe the ability to debate issues of importance to us--that has been a hallmark of this body--should not be extinguished, should not be snuffed out. 
   I would like to know answers to certain things. I would like to know answers to the kinds of examples I have heard about in my State and throughout the country. 
   I would like to know, for instance, what happened to a woman who had terrible back pain and required two surgeries to repair her spine. The HMO denied coverage for the $7,000 for the second surgery. The doctor then stated to the woman that he would be committing malpractice if he didn't perform the second operation, because the whole procedure entailed two of them; the HMO said one. The patient offered to pay out of pocket. Both surgeries were done. But in this case the surgeon--a very generous person--declined to take the money from the woman. Why did that happen? Why did this physician believe so strongly that the woman needed the second surgery that was denied by the HMO? 
   How about an incident where a New York man slipped and cracked his skull as he was getting out of the taxi? The taxi driver called 911. The victim was rushed to an emergency room for treatment. But this episode did not have prior authorization as an emergency, so the HMO refused to pay the bill. 
   Again, what has happened here? Have we become so bureaucratic and so narrow in the way we practice health care in America that common sense has been thrown out the window? 
   Another example: An HMO denied another New Yorker who suffered from multiple sclerosis physical therapy despite the opinion of the doctor and the neurologist that this was the only way this patient could recover. 
   Another example: A mother called her HMO at 3:30 a.m. to report that her 6-month-old boy had a fever of 104 degrees and was panting and was limp. The hotline nurse told the woman to take her child to the HMO's network hospital 42 miles away, passing several closer hospitals. By the time the baby reached the hospital, he was in cardiac arrest and had already suffered severe damage to his limbs. As a result, both his hands and legs had to be amputated. The court found the HMO at fault. The family received a large financial settlement. As sure as we are here, that family would give back every nickel and pay more for that not to have happened. 
   These are not isolated examples. There are so many that it is hard to go through our jobs as Senators of the 50 States without hearing when you go to a town hall meeting, or when you go to a veterans hall, or when you go to a chamber of commerce meeting that 
   somebody makes their complaint about this issue. 
   These examples need answers. I believe the answers in this bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, are the right answers. I may be dissuaded from all or parts of that answer by my colleagues. If we don't debate the issues, we are never going to be able to determine that. If we don't debate the issues, we are not going to be able to move forward on a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   If we continue in a pro forma fashion--we vote our bill; the other side votes their bill; then the issue is forgotten because we know the bill on the other side will not become law--we are not helping our constituency. 
   The bottom line is simple: I believe strongly we need the Patients' Bill of Rights or something close to it. My colleagues and I want to debate. We want the opportunity to debate these issues. If the other side changes our mind, so be it; if we change their mind, great. 
   Without debate, we will have no progress, and we will continue to hear the stories we are hearing, much to the detriment of the health care of the American people.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clinical Trials Disclosure Act of 1999. As the Senate debates important health care issues such as Medicare, prescription drug access, and managed care reform, I want to call our attention to another important health care matter: doctors and other health care providers accepting payments from drug companies and their contractors to refer patients to clinical trials. Each of us understands that by providing a forum for medical research, clinical trials play a vital role in our health care system. Unfortunately, some providers are violating the patient-doctor relationship by not informing patients of the fees they receive for referrals to the clinical trials. 
   Recent media reports have highlighted this growing trend that threatens the important relationship between doctor and patient. In one case in California, a doctor received over $1,600 to refer a patient to a prostate cancer drug trial despite the fact that the patient's prostate was healthy. Other drug companies offer bonuses to physicians who refer numbers over and above a certain quota. Providers benefit in other ways, too. A cooperative doctor may get his or her name attached to an academic study authored by a ghost writer based on the drug company's data. No matter how the doctor benefits, however, he or she is not compelled to inform the patient of his or her relationship with the drug company. This is why today I introduce the Clinical Trials Disclosure Act of 1999. 
   This bill simply requires that if a health care provider receives payments or other compensation for referring a patient to a clinical trial, the provider must inform the patient both orally and in writing. The measure is not intended to discourage patient participation in important medical research. Instead, it will strengthen the relationship between doctor and patient and help ensure that clinical trials attract patients who will benefit from their important work.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer this resolution on behalf of Mr. BROWNBACK of Kansas, Mr. LIEBERMAN of Connecticut, and many other cosponsors. 
   Last March, 13 Iranian Jews from the southern cities of Shiraz and Esfahan were arrested on preposterous charges of spying for Israel and the United States. These men have not been allowed visits by family or legal counsel, nor has any evidence been produced to warrant their arrest and imprisonment. For more than 2 months, leaders of the American Jewish community and the U.S. Government officials have worked behind the scenes for the release of these men. 
   Iran has done this sort of thing many times before, and they are usually just seeking some ransom money. Unfortunately, this situation is different. Iran went public with this issue first, meaning something far more nefarious is at work. 
   It is clear that these 13 people are being used as unfortunate pawns between two warring political factions in Iran: moderate followers of President Mohammad Khatami and hardline ayatollahs who remain entrenched in high positions of power and seek to undermine Khatami's domestic reforms and overtures to the West. These men may very well be hanged without a trial under preposterous and trumped-up charges. We must not let that happen. Indeed, we must do all we can to secure their release. 
   We have a resolution before the Senate condemning in the strongest possible terms the arrest of these men and calling for their immediate release. I thank all my colleagues for supporting this resolution which denounces the worst form of religious intolerance. 
   The notion that Iranian Jews, particularly those living hundreds of miles from Teheran, even have the capacity to spy for Israel or the United States is laughable. What access would these individuals have to any valuable information whatsoever? 
   The truth is that since 1979, Iran has habitually utilized the term ``spy'' for anyone it arrests for political reason. Schoolgirls and blind old men have been hanged as ``spies'' simply because they were religious minorities. 
   Some say we should not come down too hard on Iran on this issue, lest we play into the hands of the hardline ayatollahs and set back Khatami's reform movement. I say that is out of the question. We are not going to sacrifice innocent lives to help one side in a political battle of wills. 
   Khatami has the power to stand up to the hardliners on 
   behalf of these 13 pawns and for all of Iran's 30,000-member Jewish community, as well as other religious minorities. He won the Presidency with a 70-percent landslide vote, and moderate candidates continue to score big victories in local elections. He can choose the political battles he wishes to fight, and this resolution before us today makes it perfectly clear that this needs to be one of those battles. 
   In fact, any talk of a kinder, gentler Iran under the supposedly moderate President Khatami is simply empty rhetoric as long as Jews and other religious minorities are victims of the most vicious forms of religious intolerance. 
   The Koran in Islam treats justice like all the great religions, as something at the highest pinnacle of human values. If Khatami cannot deliver on this issue, then what is his reform movement about in the first place? And if Iran seeks to do this in the name of Islamic fundamentalism, what about the teachings of the Koran in terms of justice and fairness? 
   The administration has spoken out strongly on this issue, but they have to make this a top priority. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright should immediately press influential regional states--Syria, Saudi Arabia, Russia--to help secure the release of the 13. 
   Iran must know from the United States, and the world, that should these men be executed, as 17 other Jews have been since 1979, Iran will slip back into pariah status for decades. That means no loans, no trade, no international respect. 
   With this resolution, the Congress, the Senate, has spoken today, and the world is watching.

<DOCNO>106-schumer-ny-2-19990622</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. 
   I have been very impressed with what he has said. As the Senator knows, I have been advocating the Patients' Bill of Rights for quite a while. Just this week I had traveled to different parts of my State--to Long Island, to New York City, to Syracuse, to Rochester. Everywhere I went, I found an amazing thing: The providers, the doctors, including the medical society, the AMA, the nurses, the hospitals are allied with the patients. Usually they are at loggerheads. But they were allied together in asking for a real Patients' Bill of Rights, not a Patients' Bill of Rights in name only. 
   We do not want to go through putting something on the floor that says: Patients' Bill of Rights, and does not protect patients. We are worried about that. 
   The reason I think we want an open debate and not just: Well, here is your version; we will vote for it. Here is our version; we will vote it down. We are finished with the Patients' Bill of Rights--we do not want that because we do not want to be able to just go home and say we passed something and then 3 months from now the very same doctors, and others, will say: It doesn't do any good. You didn't do anything. 
   We went through this on guns. We were going to pass something in this body that did absolutely nothing. Then the very same people who say the gun laws do not work, or who tried to cripple and emasculate the provisions we passed, said the laws do not work. 
   So the question I ask is--here are some examples of inequities that I have come across. I just would like to ask the Senator from North Carolina if he thinks the Patients' Bill of Rights would help in these instances; and they are just amazing. 
   One, an HMO denies high-dose chemotherapy for a man with lung and brain cancer, stating it is experimental. What was the HMO's solution? The claim agent told his family to get in touch with organizations that have fundraisers for patients denied HMO coverage. Can you imagine the gall of that? 
   A man is dying of cancer. They find a solution that might work. There is finally some hope in the family. Not only does the HMO say, no, we won't pay for it, but at the same time they say go have some fundraisers while the person has cancer. How about this one----

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts not only for yielding but for his leadership over many years on this issue. Let me make a couple of points. 
   First of all, the Senator from Tennessee has outlined his bill, and it is a different approach. I ask Americans to ask: Why do all of the leading doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association, why do the leading consumer groups up and down the line, support our approach? If the bill on the other side is so good for consumers and so good for physicians and providers, then why are they all supporting this bill? And if, as the Senator from Tennessee believes, all of these are worthy goals--specialists, appeals processes, et cetera--then why not go all the way? Why not do it right? Why not do it in a way that the AMA and all the consumer groups and all of those that both sides are talking about protecting choose? The bill they choose is our bill. 
   Second, on cost, because I know the Senator from Maine mentioned cost, the most recent estimates by CBO said that the Daschle-Kennedy bill, at the end of 5 years, would cost $2 extra a month a person. Ask Americans: Would they pay that to have access to specialists, to have emergency room treatment, to have the kinds of things we have been talking about? You bet. They would pay it in a New York minute. So if cost is the concern, it is not much, and you get a lot. If helping providers and consumers is the concern, our bill prevails. 
   What we are going to do tonight is table any proposal. That is not adequate, nor is it even adequate, at least from my point of view as a freshman Senator, to try to deal with this issue and just push it away. We believe passionately that patients need help, that consumers need help, that physicians and nurses and hospitals need help. 
   We believe the HMOs have swung too far in their ability to police the basic patient-doctor relationship. We do not think that a quick ``let's get rid of this, let's have a quick vote and say it is over'' serves the American people. 
   What we will be doing on this side is continuing to fight until we can get a full and open debate. I want to debate the Senator from Tennessee on whether the Daschle bill or his bill really gives access to specialists. I want to debate the Senator from Tennessee on whether the appeals process in our bill or in his bill is the most open. 
   I want to debate the Senator from Tennessee on every one of the issues that has been mentioned. The process that we are going through now does not allow that debate. I do not know where it will come out. My guess is it may come out similar to the last debate we had where a number of people, in a bipartisan way, come together for a stronger bill. But that may not happen. 
   But at the very least, in conclusion, we should have a full and open debate. And a motion to table and a vote on one bill and then the other to get rid of this is not fair to the American people. 
   Thank you.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, for what he had to say today. He is exactly right about one of the problems we face these days with HMOs; that is, that many types of children's health are neglected. 
   Just today I was in both Rochester and Syracuse, back in my State, New York, meeting with doctors and patients and health care providers about the problems they face in the health care area. 
   What I found over and over was this problem that we are talking about that would be rectified by the Patients' Bill of Rights, as the Senator from Rhode Island correctly pointed out. 
   I had a doctor in Syracuse, just this afternoon, maybe 3 hours ago, mention to me that one of her patients needed a pediatric oncologist, but the family's HMO would only allow an oncologist, not a pediatric oncologist. 
   They had the procedure done--it was not done correctly--four times, and only on the fifth time did the HMO relent and allow the pediatric oncologist do the job. Then it was done and, thank God, successfully. 
   The amazing thing about this is this would have saved money had they relied on the judgment of this doctor and used a pediatric oncologist right at the beginning. Then very simply the HMO would have saved money, the child would be healthier, and everyone would be happier. 
   When many people ask, what is the problem with HMOs--and there are many and they have been documented by my friend from Illinois and my friend from Rhode Island--one of the things I am beginning to learn is that when HMOs come in, they try a cookie-cutter approach. They say one size fits all. 
   In Rochester this morning, a young man told me this story: His wife needed a very special type of medicine because she was receiving treatment, I think it was for cancer. In any case, her immune system was down. She needed these drugs to help build up her immune system. These drugs are lifesaving. They are very precise. In other words, one has to measure the level in the blood before determining how much of another dose is needed. They are expensive--hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week--and they have to be taken at exactly the right time. If a dosage is missed, say, at 8 o'clock in the morning, you could acquire an illness that could kill you because your immune system is deficient. 
   Everything was going fine. This young man said that he and his wife had no problems with their HMO through their travail of her illness, until the HMO decided that all prescriptions should come through a mail-order house in Texas. He has gone through an enormous amount of trouble. 
   First of all, his wife has to have her blood taken and measured in Rochester and then communicate all the time with the facility in Texas. Second, sometimes the medicines do not arrive, and when they arrive late, if her blood level is different, they cannot be used. 
   Every week this young man and his wife are shelling out hundreds of dollars because the HMO is insisting for this particular drug, a rare drug, a special drug and one that requires a great deal of care before it is administered, that they have to get it through this mail-order pharmacy. 
   He said to me: If we had diabetes, and if the mail-order house was sending us the insulin, it would be just fine, because in those instances, it is a set dose of insulin and they could send a whole bunch. 
   When they ran out, they could send a whole new bunch. They could send copayments. He said making them go through this mail-order house for the immune drug made no sense. 
   Today, as I went through the day and listened to people, I found that happens all the time. Yes, in most cases, a pediatrician or a pediatric surgeon might do the job, but in certain cases an oncologist is needed. Who knows that? Certainly not the actuary sitting in the insurance company's home office who is now making the decision. The person who knows that, of course, is the physician or the nurse who has spent long, long years studying it and has had many years of experience in figuring this out. 
   The problem we face and the problem we are trying to rectify with the Patients' Bill of Rights is to deal with many of these situations, to deal with the fact that medicine is not a cookie-cutter enterprise, that one size does not fit all, as much as a corporate mentality might like to see that happen in the name of saving dollars. In reality, in most cases, you lose dollars. Certainly the amount of dollars paid into the health care system is increased, not decreased by these mistakes, which are often very costly. 
   The more I listen to my constituency throughout my State, from one end of the State to the other, the more I have come to the conclusion that we really do need this Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, we were debating State Department authorization which is obviously important. We have to deal with diplomacy. We have many other bills before us. But I cannot think of one that seems to have the urgency and importance to my constituents that this Patients' Bill of Rights does. I hope we can move quickly and bring the bill to the floor. 
   There are two sides to this argument, as there are to most serious issues. I am hopeful the Patients' Bill of Rights that I have cosponsored and that Senator KENNEDY has introduced will be the one that is passed. I join my colleagues, Senator DURBIN from Illinois and Senator REED from Rhode Island, in hoping that will happen. At the very least, we are entitled to debate the issue. 
   This is such an important issue that we should debate it, 
   and it is in the tradition of the Senate that when an important issue is facing us, we do not just say: Let's lickety dispose of it; you vote your bill, we will vote our bill, and that is that. 
   We are trying to come to the best possible product and coming to the best possible product entails a significant amount of debate. Is it worth the time? Ask the pediatrician in Syracuse if it would have been worth the time. The amount of time and energy that she and the family she looked after far exceeded 4 or 5 days of debate. Ask the young man in Rochester who is having such trouble with his HMO using this pharmaceutical house. The amount of  time and energy that that one family is going through will exceed the amount of time we spend on this debate. Of course, that is happening every day to tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of American families. The argument that we do not have time to debate this issue, that we ought to just dispose of it and get rid of it, does not make much sense. 
   In conclusion, I am joining my colleagues this evening and, I believe, many of my constituents in asking that once and for all we stop delay. It is already the end of June. We only have 6 or 7 weeks left on the legislative calendar, and we should debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We must let people decide what should be the HMOs' responsibility in terms of specialists, in terms of appeal, in terms of emergency rooms, in terms of the ability to be sued, and then I believe we will come up with a pretty good product. This issue is of grave importance to many families. It will become of even greater importance to many others. 
   I make a further plea to the majority leader in this body, someone for whom I have a great deal of respect--and I know he has the best interests of the people at heart--and that is that we, as soon as we can, hopefully before the July 4 break, have a full-fledged, open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is my judgment, and I think the judgment of many, that there will be enough support in this body to pass a bill and end the pain and agony and suffering of so many American families.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will address the same subject that my senior colleague from Massachusetts and the Senators from California and Illinois have talked about: The Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Our health care system has been a remarkably successful system. We can't forget the fact that over the years the idea of people living longer and healthier has become a reality. 
   When I was a little boy, all the kids in my neighborhood would come around and press their foreheads to the kitchen window because in our home sat a curiosity, in a certain sense. It was my great grandmother; she was over 80. In the neighborhood, everybody said she was the oldest lady in the world. They hadn't seen anybody over 80. It was a rarity. 
   These days, of course, somebody who lives over 80 is, thank God, rather commonplace. In fact, on the ``Today Show'' they used to announce people who celebrated their 80th birthday; then they announced the 90th birthdays; and now they announce the 100th and 105th birthdays. That is, in good part, because of our health care system. 
   It is a good health care system, there is no question. However, over the last several years it has developed some problems that can be fixed. These are not the intractable problems of how we pay for the costs of new operations that cost tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
   What happened is very simple. Costs were going up. We were basically involved in a cost-plus system. As a result, HMOs developed. HMOs had a good purpose. They were going to ``rationalize'' the health care system. They were going to keep costs down so that the providers could not raise costs willy-nilly and have a third party pay. 
   For a while it worked. Costs did decline. It is one of the reasons that our budget is in better shape today than it has been. 
   However, the pendulum swung too far. In a good effort to reduce costs, HMOs began to go too far. They started assigning important, often life-and-death decisions. They started taking those decisions out of the hands of physicians, out of the hands of hospitals, out of the hands of trained personnel, and putting them in the hands of actuaries. 
   As a result, day after day after day, injustices are done. We hear stories such as the one I told on the floor a couple of days ago about the young nurse who can barely walk because her HMO would not provide her with an orthopedic oncologist. Instead, she went to a regular orthopedic surgeon. The surgery was performed not well. The tumor grew back. She had to go to an orthopedic oncologist. 
   How about a simple case where somebody has cancer. The HMO says yes, that is covered. Because of the cancer, they cannot swallow; they cannot eat. The HMO's decision of no dietary supplements being allowed is a ridiculous decision. 
   How about the times when people go to an emergency room and are told: You are not covered; go somewhere else. 
   Or when woman after woman after woman is again turned away from going to an obstetrician or gynecologist. A woman is told that osteoporosis, a common woman's disease, is not covered by the HMO, even though diseases that would be just as frequent in men are covered. 
   On issue after issue after issue, every day across America, scores of people--perhaps hundreds of people--are sitting there in awful situations and are told that not only do they have to deal with their illness but they have to deal with an unfair HMO. 
   What we seek to do, led by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, is simply to redress that imbalance. This is not radical surgery. We are not trying to totally change the system. We are not even trying to eliminate HMOs. We are simply trying to put in place some basic rules of fairness that seem to most Americans to be called for. We are simply trying to say that the pendulum, which has swung so far over on the side of the actuaries, should move a little bit back to the middle. We are attempting to keep the best parts of HMOs, which deal with cost savings, and at the same time get rid of their most egregious violations. We are on the floor of the Senate simply asking for a chance to debate those issues. 
   I have now been in the Senate close to 6 months. We had some historic moments in the first few months. Since then, it seems to me no issue is being asked to be debated more, to be discussed, to be legislated upon than this subject. Yet we are told we can't do it. It just does not make sense. 
   So we must come to the floor of the Senate in the early hours of the morning or the later hours of the evening and make our case. We shouldn't have to. This is a deliberative body that has been known for its great debates, that has been known for the fact that, if a group of Senators feels strongly about an issue, they will get to debate it and vote on it. That has been the tradition for the 200-some-odd glorious years of this body. It is being thwarted on an issue of great importance. 
   I am sure most of my colleagues in this body do not agree with every position I hold, and I don't agree with every position they hold on HMOs. How in the name of fairness can we refuse to debate the issue? 
   How can we refuse that young nurse who really needs the orthopedic oncologist or that cancer victim who needs dietary supplements or that woman who needs help with  osteoporosis? How can we refuse, at least through their elective Representatives, to let their voices be heard? 
   So we debate tonight simply asking for some vital things. We ask for the ability of patients to be treated in the emergency room wherever that emergency occurs. We ask for the ability of people to get the specialists that are medically called for and that they need, not for excessive use, not for things they do not need, but for things they need. We ask, if that HMO makes an egregious and reckless mistake, for the ability to sue it, not out of malice but out of fairness, out of recompense, and out of a desire to correct an abuse that may have occurred. 
   As I mentioned, these are not large demands in the grand scheme of things, but they are very important to millions of Americans who either have an ill loved one, or have an illness themselves, or who worry that they might. 
   So I ask, and I am joined by so many of my colleagues, particularly those of us on this side of the aisle, I ask the majority leader to allow this issue to come to the floor, to allow a full and open debate. I do not know what the results will be, but I can tell you this: If we do that, we will be, indeed, fulfilling our obligation as the people's Senators, as the people's Representatives, and we will be living up to the fine and high traditions of this Senate. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, with the threat of a permanent shutdown of the High Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the employees who operate the reactor have asked to be reinstated under The Department of Energy Worker and Community Transition Program. This office provides funding for separation benefits, outplacement assistance, and training. Brookhaven and Argonne National Labs in Idaho were removed from the program in 1997, making their employees ineligible for those benefits. 
   I thank Senator REID for committing to pursue adding this provision during the conference committee negotiations on Energy and Water Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2000. This program is crucial to ensure future employment of the workforce at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I am in complete sympathy with the remarks he has made. 
   Everywhere I have gone in my State, people have brought up one horror story after the next, whereby, say, accountants are making medical decisions instead of doctors. I would like to relate to the Senator an instance that I heard about, which was really frightening to me, and see if the kind of proposal we are talking about might deal with that issue. 
   There was a young woman on Long Island, 24 years old and beautiful, who had just got out of nursing school. She was an athletic individual. She went to a physician because her upper leg was hurting. She went to the physician, who determined that she had a tumor on the bone. The physician recommended and told her privately that she ought to go to an orthopedic oncologist because they had to take the tumor off. She went to her HMO. The HMO said: No, no, no. All you need is a regular orthopedic surgeon. 
   Well, this was not a well-to-do family. She had her health plan because her father had retired as a lineman for the phone company. She figured she would go along. She went to where the HMO recommended--to a regular orthopedic surgeon. The operation was had, and he said it was a success. 
   Two months later, the tumor grew back. She called the HMO and said, ``I really need an orthopedic oncologist.'' They said no. She then paid something like $45,000 or $50,000; she went into hock with loans to get the operation done, which was a success. A day after the operation occurred, the HMO wrote her a letter saying, ``All right, you are right; we will give you an orthopedic oncologist.'' But it was too late. She said, ``Why don't you reimburse me?'' They said no way. After a lot of intervention from my office and others, they have finally reimbursed her. 
   One of the things that has been mentioned as part of the Patients' Bill of Rights is guaranteed access to appropriate specialists. I was just wondering if the Senator from Illinois could enlighten us as to--in that type of situation, which I am sure is repeated time and time again--how the Patients' Bill of Rights might rectify that situation.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I couldn't agree more with the Senator. These are the kinds of things, it seems to me, that our constituents sent us to Washington to do--not to spend all day debating all sorts of things that have very little relevance to their lives but to try to solve the problems that families face. 
   I find families from one end of my State to the other are just totally frightened about the ability to pay for health care and are frightened that the HMO that they have is really not giving them good medical care, that it is putting dollars above health care. 
   There is nothing wrong with HMOs. In fact, a lot of them have done a good job in terms of reducing costs. But the pendulum has swung, it seems to me, too far. 
   When physicians who spend years and years of training, and whom this country subsidizes to train, are no longer making the decision, it seems to me the Senator has made a great point: It not only hurts health care but it actually costs more money. The example I gave is an example where the operation has to be gone through twice because it was done so poorly the first time. 
   My issue is, from what I understand, oftentimes, in access to specialists as well as access to procedures, the gatekeeper is not even a physician; some HMO is the gatekeeper. Someone who is an actuary is looking at tables and statistics, and things like that, and overrules the actual decisions of the medical doctor or the specialist. 
   Is that true in the Senator's State as well?

   Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I have one final question. This is not a new issue. In other words, I think we have heard about the Patients' Bill of Rights for at least a year or two. I am new to this body. 
   Have there be any attempts to deal with this issue in the past? What has happened? What is stopping us from just voting on this right now? I am sure it is a measure that the American people in every one of our States want us to discuss. What has been the history of this legislation?

   Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield once more, it seems to me that, again, if there is anything we should be doing, it is things such as this. There are lots of important issues. This is a big country. We debate all sorts of things. 
   But, again, I go around my State. I can't think of anything that people care more about, that we can do something concrete about, that is not a radical solution. This is not something that says scrap the whole system and start from the beginning; this is simply something that redresses the balances so people can have faith in their physician. 
   This is an amazing thing to me. I don't know if the Senator has found this. But as I go around the State, perhaps the most frustrated group is the doctors themselves. They are hardly a group of wide-eyed crazy radicals. The doctors come to me in place after place with anguish in their eyes, and they say: You know, I have spent so many years, I went to college and took all of the courses, I went to medical school, I performed a residency, and I practiced medicine in the way I chose, in the best I way I know how, for 30 years, and now, all of a sudden, because of these changes in health care, I can't deliver the quality health care that I want for my patients, whom I care about, many of whom have been my patients for decades. 
   I would join my colleague in urging that we in this body debate and debate rather quickly a Patients' Bill of Rights. We don't have the only approach. Let every approach be aired. Let us have a real debate on the issue. But let's not walk away from here before the July 4th break without having a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I am wondering if the Senator thinks that is within the timeframe of possibility that we could get such a Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Just one final question to the Senator. I first thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the eloquence and passion and intelligence that he brings to these issues, and our leader, Senator DASCHLE, for sponsoring this legislation and leading us in this regard. 
   When you walk into an emergency room, the first question you should be asked is not: What is your coverage? It should be: Where does it hurt? Yet, these days, the way our system is working, the first question that often has to be asked is: What is your coverage? That is so totally wrong. 
   One of the reasons I ran for the Senate was so I would have the opportunity to debate these bills, because the procedures in the Senate allow the American people, through their elected Representatives, to debate in a much wider way than the process in the House. Yet we are not being allowed to debate this, even though we have wished to do it. 
   I ask my senior colleague, what holds us back? I mean, why can we not debate this issue? Not everyone is going to have the same view, but I think everyone would agree this is an issue on the very top of the list of things that most Americans care about. What can hold us back? What is holding us back from debating an issue as important as the Patients' Bill of Rights?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Briefly, because I know we want to move on. 
   Just as an example, I ask the Senator this question: Our bill, it is correct, has the right to sue, and I respect the view of many on the other side. Our bill, for instance, has a far more ample  provision about having access to specialists. There might be a good number of Members in this body who want to see greater access to specialists but not support the right to sue, and conversely. Giving us the right to do some amendments might perfect a bill that can pass. I ask the Senator, my being new here, if that would be sort of an ideal way that could work?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will prepare our nation's public libraries for the twenty-first century: the Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Lifelong Learning Act. Mr. President our nation's libraries are in crisis. Eighty-five percent of America's nearly 16,000 libraries require expansion or renovation. In New York State alone, 1.3 million citizens do not have access to free basic library services and nearly one-half of the state's libraries cannot accommodate users with disabilities. 
   The Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Life-Long Learning Act is designed to prepare America's libraries for the twenty-first century by providing grants of one billion dollars over five years for construction, renovation, and rehabilitation of public library facilities. The bill will also permit libraries to use grants to purchase high-tech hardware and information technology so that all citizens can take advantage of the tools of the information age. Since the funds provided through this legislation must be matched dollar for dollar by states, cities, or private sources, billions of additional dollars will be leveraged. Moreover, since the grants will be awarded competitively, areas most in need will receive much needed assistance.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, around this time every year I deliver this speech to the House of Representatives and now I am privileged and honored to deliver it to the Senate. I rise today to pay tribute to the capture of several Israeli soldiers who were taken prisoner by the Syrians in the 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon. 
   On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The Syrians succeeded in capturing Sgt. Zachary Baumel, 1st Sgt. Zvi Feldman and Cpt. Yehudah Katz. Upon arrival in Damascus, the identified tank and crew were paraded through the streets draped in Syrian and Palestinian Flags.  
   Since that terrible day in 1982, the Israeli and the United States Governments have been working to obtain any possible information about the fate of these missing soldiers, joining forces with the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations and other international bodies. According to the Geneva convention, the area in Lebanon where the soldiers first disappeared was continually controlled by Syria, therefore deeming her responsible for the treatment of the captured soldiers. To this day, despite the promises made by the Syrian Government and by the PLO, very little information has been forthcoming about the condition of Zachary Baumei, Zvi Feldman, and Yehudah Katz. 
   June 11 marks the anniversary of the day that these soldiers were reported missing in action. Sixteen pain-filled years have already passed since the families of the MIA's have last seen their sons, and yet President Assad has still not revealed their whereabouts. 
   One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen from my district in Brooklyn, N.Y. A dedicated basketball fan, Zachary began his studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved to Israel with other family members, and continued his education at Yeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army service. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his military service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew study psychology. But fate had unfortunately decreed otherwise and on June 11, 1982 he vanished. 
   Zachary's parents, Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in their pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have worked closely with the Jewish Congregation of America, the American Coalition for missing Israeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the conference of Presidents of major American Jewish organizations. The Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls forged a project that has increased awareness and support for the MIA's plight for freedom. These groups have been at the forefront of this pursuit of justice. I want to recognize their devoted efforts and ask my colleagues to join me in commending their efforts. These families have been without their children for sixteen years. Answers must be found.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to remedy what I believe is a significant shortcoming in federal law relating to missing person reports. My bill is entitled ``Suzanne's Law,'' to serve as a continuing reminder of the plight of Suzanne Lyall. Suzanne, a resident of Ballston Spa, New York, disappeared last year at age 19 during the course of her senior year at the State University of New York at Albany. All indications are that her disappearance was due to foul play. She has never been found, despite investigations by campus security, the local police, and the FBI. Suzanne's family, friends and relatives dearly miss her and have undertaken admirable efforts to secure improvements in campus security and in missing person reporting. 
   The Lyall family has brought it to my attention that federal law currently prohibits state and local law enforcement officials from imposing a 24-hour waiting period before accepting a report regarding the disappearance of a person under the age of 18, yet it does not extend similar protection for reports of missing persons between the ages of 18 and 21. This is an oversight that must be remedied. Prompt action on the part of law enforcement authorities is of the essence in missing person cases. Thus, my bill would prohibit state and local law enforcement officials from imposing a 24-hour waiting period before accepting ``missing youth'' reports--defined as reports indicating that a person of at least 18 years of age and less than 21 years of age was missing under suspicious circumstances. Enactment of this legislation would enhance the prospects for family reunification in missing person cases and may spare other families the pain and sacrifice experienced by the Lyalls.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this morning's headline says it all: ``House GOP Backs NRA's Gun Show Bill.'' 
   Many of us in the Senate worry that the good work done in this Chamber will be undone in the House. It is hard to believe that the House leadership is deaf to the pleas of the families who want Washington to quit playing patty-cake with the gun lobby and pass a real bill that closes the gun show loophole. 
   The measure we passed in the Senate was modest--far too modest for many people's taste. But we said, let us limit it so it does not hurt the legitimate gun owner but at the same time will close loopholes that allow kids and criminals to get guns. 
   Now in the House, because the NRA is actually in the back room, pen in hand, drafting legislation, we fear that that legislation will be a sham. Anything less than an airtight Brady background check at gun shows is a sham. Redefining what a gun show is and making many gun shows exempt from the law, in effect, to not allow the FBI to make background checks in the time they need so that criminals cannot get guns, is all happening right now in the House. 
   The only thing I can say to my former colleagues in the House, still my friends, is this: You will not get away with it. When some in this Chamber tried to change the rules, to make it seem as if they were doing something, but winking at the NRA, they were thwarted. The same thing will happen in the House. 
   There has been a sea change in the views of the American people. Do the American people want to repeal the second amendment or confiscate hunting rifles? No way. But do they believe modest measures that will move us along and prevent kids and criminals from getting guns are in order, no matter what the NRA says? You bet. 
   I urge the House leadership to come clean, to step forward, to pass the same legislation we passed in the Senate on gun shows without any loopholes, and allow the families in Littleton and the American people to breathe one large sigh of relief that we finally have begun to make progress in preventing kids and criminals from getting guns. 
   I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.

   Mr. SCHUMER. 
   Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senators FEINSTEIN, CHAFEE, GREGG, and SANTORUM to introduce legislation that phases out the federal sugar program. Remember that old story, if you believe this, I've got some swampland to sell you in Florida? Boy, I wish I bought some of that swampland and became a sugar grower. 
   It is a can't miss, can't lose proposition where all of the risk is absorbed by the federal government and all of the reward goes to the sugar barons. It is one of the last vestiges of a centralized, subsidized U.S. farm sector which has mostly gone by the wayside.  
   Ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Odessa on the Okeechobee with its generous price supports somehow still survives. This is a special interest program that benefits a handful of sugar barons at the expense of every man, woman and child in America. 
   Several years ago, the GAO estimated that consumers paid $1.4 billion more at the cash register because of the sugar price support. Today, because the world price for sugar is lower and the price paid in the U.S. is higher, the cost to consumers could be twice as high. 
   And let's not forget. It has already cost America thousands of refinery jobs. And it has already cost the Everglades hundreds of acres of pristine wilderness. In Brooklyn and in Yonkers, we have lost one-third of our refinery jobs in the last decade. Why? Because the sugar program is such a bitter deal, refiners cannot get enough raw cane sugar to remain open. 
   Four years ago, when we came within five votes in the House of terminating the sugar program, the world market price for sugar was about ten cents and the U.S. price about 20 cents. Today the world price is less than a nickel and the U.S. price is almost a quarter. In other words, the gulf between the free market and the sugar program is getting wider. 
   Under any reasonable and rational measure the sugar program should be repealed. If the issue is jobs, the environment or the consumer--then we have no choice but to repeal. At all ends of the political spectrum the answer is the same--it's time to repeal the sugar program.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this morning while we are compromising with the gun lobby, ambulances are rushing to Heritage High School to save children from another shooting. It is profoundly disheartening. How much longer are we going to embrace the gun lobby instead of the mothers and fathers of America? Why are we compromising on such simple issues? 
   It should not have taken us a week to come to the view that we should close the gun show loophole. It never should have been opened, and it now should be closed, and it should be closed cleanly and simply by passing the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. 
   We are making progress. At the beginning of the week, we started way apart, and because of the American public, we have come closer and closer together. I commend my colleague from Oregon. He has adopted language which I believe closes the pawnshop loophole. That is a major step in the right direction. 
   But, I say to my colleagues, there are other loopholes to close, and this very morning when there has been another shooting, why are we afraid to close those as well? 
   There is the new 24-hour loophole when the instant check system does not work, when the records are not immediately available, the FBI says they need 72 hours to check to see if the person asking for the gun is a felon. We now make it 24 hours. If a gun show is held on Saturday, there is no way--no way--to check. So what we will have is felons getting guns at gun shows. We will have children even being able to buy guns in many different ways. 
   The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey is simple. If we want to do it, let's do it. Let's not do an elaborate minuet 
   where we take one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, three steps back. That is what we have been doing this week. Yes, we are making progress, but on such a modest amendment like closing the gun show loophole, why does it take us 7 days of debate? Why does it take three different fixes that still do not close all the loopholes? 
   It is time for this body to come clean. It is time for this body to simply say, yes, we believe in the right to bear arms, but we also believe there are practical limitations that do not interfere with the rights of legitimate gun owners that we can make, and we can make them forthrightly and cleanly without all of these tiny baby steps. 
   I guarantee you, the American people are fed up with compromises with the gun lobby. Since the beginning of time, some teenagers have been crazy and angry and mixed up and sometimes disturbed, but they have never been armed. Until now, a teenager who was truly disturbed had his fists, and there might be a broken thumb and there might be black-and-blue eyes. There would not be dead children being taken out of our schools in every corner of America. 
   There are still loopholes, significant loopholes, that will be left in the law if we do not vote for the Lautenberg amendment. We can close them. We can stand up to the gun lobby. If anything, the actions this morning should have taught us that winking at the NRA and then smiling at the American people just produces more carnage. 
   It is not hard, it is not technically difficult, and it is not bureaucratic. The law for licensed dealers has worked since 1968. The Brady law has worked since 1993. It has prevented 250,000 felons from buying guns. What are we saying now? At a gun show, maybe; the FBI doesn't need 72 hours to check when it fails. 
   What the heck is going on in this country? Why do we let the gun lobby continue to pry open more loopholes for the Klebolds and the Harrises to crawl through? Because those who want to get guns for illicit purposes have ways to do it. Even if Lautenberg should be adopted--and I pray to God that it is--they will have means. But let's at least do our best to close those loopholes. 
   This week has been a week of both encouragement and discouragement for the American people. There has been encouragement. Because of the efforts of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona, we are closing the pawnshop loophole, but it is discouraging overall, Mr. President. It is discouraging that it takes us such time to close a simple loophole like the gun show loophole and not do it cleanly and not do it completely. It is discouraging that when we close certain loopholes, somehow we feel obligated to open two or three more. It is discouraging that the gun lobby still seems to rule the roost, not in America, not in urban, suburban, or rural America, but here in this Congress.  
   I am going to support the Smith amendment because it does close the pawnshop loophole, but I am going to vote for, and urgently and prayerfully urge my colleagues to support, the Lautenberg amendment because it does not open or leave open other loopholes. 
   This is a test of the soul of America. I watched television this morning, and I said to myself: What is going on in America? The American people are asking themselves not only what is going on in America, they are asking, What is going on in the Senate of the United States? Let us show courage. Let us step up to the plate. Let us be strong, let us close the gun show loophole, let us not open new loopholes, and then let us move to do the other things that will prevent children and criminals from getting guns. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Delaware not only for his generous use of the time--which I will not need all of--but, more importantly, for his leadership on this issue in 1994, and again today. And I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, as well, for both of those things. 
   I have been in this Congress a long time; this is my 19th year. I have rarely seen a program be as effective as the COPS Program. It has worked. It has brought police officers and, just as important, new policing techniques from the largest city to the smallest rural hamlet. Before this bill passed, America, from one end of the country to the other, was crying out: Do something about ending crime. 
   Some said it is a local issue, not a Federal issue. But the average person didn't care about that. The average person just said to his or her government: Please, in God's name, do something. Stop the robberies, stop the burglaries, stop the auto thefts, and stop the murders. 
   A number of us who were concerned about this issue, including the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and myself when I was then in the House, just scoured the country. We tried to find out what worked--not ideological, but something where we could have prevention or punishment. We found out that community policing worked just about better than anything else. Yes, we should have incarcerated more criminals--now we are--and had tougher penalties. Yes, we needed afterschool programs and things to help. 
   The bill Senator BIDEN and I authored--he in the Senate and myself in the House--was called ``tough on punishment, smart on prevention.'' That was our credo. Probably the most important and best program in that bill was the COPS Program. As I say, I have seen it work in every part of my State. 
   Violence is down, property theft is down, police officers are more fulfilled in the job that they do. In my own home State, in Buffalo, crime has been slashed more than 30 percent; in Albany, 24 percent; in Nassau County, 24 percent; in New York City, 44 percent. Talk to police chiefs, talk to ordinary cops, talk to criminologists; they will all point to the COPS Program. 
   My colleagues, this program expires in the year 2000. If it is so successful, and if we want to continue our fight against crime, we should be doing this. Keep up tough punishment, keep up smart prevention, but continue to fund this successful program. 
   My colleague from Delaware is not being hyperbolic when he says this is one of the most important programs that we passed. We need to continue it. And putting 30 to 50 new officers on the beat, particularly the middled-sized and small cities, which have not applied because they haven't had the chance that the larger cities have had, is vital. It will help economically distressed communities, which all of us represent--no matter what part of the country we are in--to absorb some of the long-term costs of new police hires. And when crime goes down, which it does, because of the COPS Program, there are more jobs in a community, there is better health in a community, and the educational system works better in a community. It is good in every way. 
   COPS isn't the only reason crime has gone down. But, just the same, no one can reasonably claim it is not a good part of the reason. 
   I urge my colleagues in the strongest of terms to support this amendment to continue this magnificently successful program. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. There is one difference we have. Yes, prosecute those who violate the law, no question. But very simply, that doesn't say you shouldn't prevent young people from getting guns before they violate the law. The two people at Littleton, Klebold and Harris, had not violated the law before--or were not detected. 
   It is of little consolation, it seems to me, to their parents and their families and the whole community that had they not killed themselves they would have been prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. I am for laws as tough as my friend from Alabama is, but why shouldn't we both do things to prevent young people and criminals from getting guns before they commit crimes, as well as prosecute them after they commit crimes? The two are not contradictory. 
   I always hear ``let's do more prosecution'' as a substitute for also preventing criminals and young people from getting guns in the first place so we won't have to prosecute them. 
   I ask my friend from Alabama, why is one in place of the other, as opposed to doing both alongside one another?

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Presiding Officer for yielding and the Senator from Alabama for his courtesy, as well as all the other Senators. 
   I think, my colleagues, this afternoon will be a moment of reckoning on the floor of this Senate. The vote that will occur on closing the gun show loophole--really closing the gun show loophole--will be historic, because it will really mark the difference as to whether we are serious about moderate, carefully-thought-out measures on gun control or whether we are going to continue the same game we have played for the last 4 years. 
   What game is that? The game is a simple one. When the public gets aroused, all too often because of a tragedy, then some of us try to deal with the causes of that tragedy in a variety of different ways, including reasonable restrictions preventing children, preventing felons, from getting guns. 
   What in the past has occurred is, those who oppose us have said: Oh, we agree with you. And they put in a substitute amendment which does not close the loophole. 
   They put in a substitute which makes it appear as if the problem is being solved but does not solve it. Then, inexorably, another tragedy occurs. 
   Today is the day we can stop that. We can stop it on a modest, simple measure to close the gun show loophole, to really close it. 
   Now, let me go over, for my colleagues--and then I want to talk a little bit about what the Senator from Alabama has said--the status of the present legislation that has passed on the floor of the Senate and what we are attempting to do with the Lautenberg amendment this afternoon. Right now, after passage of the Hatch-Craig amendment, we give with one hand and take away with another. There are, right now, three types of people under the status of this legislation who can go to gun shows and sell guns: One is federally licensed dealers. These people, since 1968, whether they sell at gun shows or anywhere else, have to keep records and, since 1993, with the passage of the Brady law, have to do background checks. They always have and they will continue to, unless we repeal that for some unforeseen circumstance. 
   The second group of people is those who are not licensed dealers. Under present law, they could show up at gun shows and sell guns without background checks, without recording processes. The Craig-Hatch amendment correctly, as does the Lautenberg amendment, prevents that from happening. A background check would have to be done, as it should. There shouldn't be any loopholes. 
   The country came together, in 1993, passed the Brady law, and it has worked. It has worked dramatically so. It has worked so that over 250,000 felons who walked into licensed dealers were refused guns. 
   Let me show you how it has worked in the last week. Since last Wednesday, May 12, 1999, when the Senate missed the opportunity to close the gun show loophole once and for all, the FBI, using the Brady law's national instant check system, stopped 1,550 felons, fugitives, stalkers and others who should not have guns from buying licensed guns. In one week, 1,500 people were stopped. But in that same week, sure as we are here, some of those very same people went to gun shows and bought guns without a check. What kind of mindless system is there when the dealer has to do the check but you can easily go to a gun show and get around it. 
   Over this past weekend, there were a minimum of 31 gun shows. In every one of those gun shows, children, felons, the mentally incompetent, and stalkers could go buy guns without ever being detected. Why? 
   Because of the public outcry about what occurred in Littleton, the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Idaho said: Fine, if you are not a licensed dealer, you also have to engage in a background check. That was their second attempt. The first attempt, of course, made it voluntary, which made no sense. But then, after the outcry and after the Senator from Vermont and myself got up on the floor late that evening and said, hey, this does not do what it is supposed to do, the next day Senators from the other side, the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona, got together and said: Wait a minute, we thought we were really closing the gun show loophole. It wasn't. And so this Craig-Hatch amendment evolved. 
   But the same darn thing occurred. So while closing the loophole for nonlicensed dealers, they opened it up for a whole 
   new category of people called special licensees. What was the reason to have a special licensee? Nobody has figured that out. But a special licensee can go to a gun show, under the status of the Hatch-Craig amendment, and not do a background check. 
   It is a shell game. On the one hand, we say we are not going to let unlicensed dealers do this, and then we say, but if you become a special licensee, you can. 
   The American people are just appalled at what this Senate is doing. A simple measure like closing the gun show loophole, which can be done easily and quickly and noncontroversially, can't pass. We have to do an elaborate kabuki dance to make it seem as if we are doing something but not do anything at all. 
   So this is a moment of reckoning for the Senate. Are we going to step up to the plate and just close the gun show loophole once and for all by passing the amendment this afternoon, or are we going to continue to play games? I say to my colleagues, playing games won't do anymore. There has been a sea change in the American people in the last few weeks, because they are fed up. 
   After Brady, something happened. Before the Brady law passed, the gun lobby would tell citizens throughout America, if Brady passes, the hunting rifle your Uncle Willy gave you when you were 14 will be confiscated and some people in big black boots will knock on your door and take your guns. It was a message of fear. 
   Well, wherever I go in my great and diverse State, I ask people who are gun owners, has the Brady law interfered with your right to bear arms? And every one says no. So the fear tactics that the NRA has used, the scare tactics, the big lie is losing velocity. That is why they have lost members, half a million, in the last few years. That is why they are unable to garner support. 
   Now, because of the tragedy at Littleton, there seems to be a whole change in public opinion. They say, enough already. It is not just among Democrats like myself who have been arguing for these changes for over a decade. You have two candidates for the Republican nomination for Senate who have had the courage to say the NRA is not always right. In 1996, no candidate, much as they wanted to,  could dare say that. That is as good an indication of the change in public opinion as any. 
   I respect Elizabeth Dole; I respect JOHN MCCAIN. They do not agree with me about everything on guns. I do not expect them to. But on logical, rational methods of closing loopholes of a law that has received overwhelming public support and, more importantly, has been successful, 1,500 felons last week stopped from getting guns by Brady, how many of them went to gun shows to get around the law to buy those same guns we don't know. 
   Not only did the Hatch-Craig amendment fail to deal with the gun show loophole; it added three more loopholes. 
   Pawnshops: There has been a law that has worked. It said, you are a person; you go bring your gun to a pawnshop; before you retrieve it, let there be a background check--no harm to anybody. That has been in place since, I believe, 1997; it may have been 1996. It has worked. Hundreds of felons, I think it is 254, have been caught going to pawnshops, and all of a sudden we are going to open it up. Again, give with one hand take away with the other. 
   What are we saying? Do we want to have a loud speaker go up and down the streets of our country saying: Hey, felons, hey, kids, here are ways to get around the Brady law; you don't need a background check. That is what we are doing here in the Senate. 
   Then we have opened another loophole. This one is totally befuddling. The instant check system has worked. 
   It was proposed by people who didn't agree with me when we wrote the Brady law. But we said let's see if this works. 
   Well, it has, in about three-quarters of the cases. So people can get their check instantly and then go out of the gun shop with their gun. No problem, as far as I am concerned. Some people think a cooling off period is important, and it may be, but the main purpose we had in passing Brady was the background check. If you can do it quicker, fine. Still in about 25 percent of the cases the records are not in good shape, where there is a glitch in the computer, where the instant check doesn't work. 
   Right now, the FBI has 72 hours to check. Why in God's name did we reduce that to 24 in the Hatch-Craig amendment? Why? 
   Let me tell you the particular relevance to gun shows, where it applies. If you have a gun show on Saturday, you have 72 hours to check. The FBI can go through their records on a Monday. If you have a gun show on Saturday and you only have 24 hours to check, there is no check at all. Under the Hatch-Craig proposal, you would have to give that gun to someone even if they had committed 10 or 12 felonies. Why? It did not hurt anybody; it only applied to 25 percent. Yet, we persist in creating new loopholes. 
   One final thing. Our system has always been one that has recognized States rights. We said gun dealers can only sell within their State. Under Hatch-Craig, that principle goes. You can go across the country to sell a gun at a gun show. Why? 
   So not only did we fail to completely close the gun show loophole in Hatch-Craig, but we opened three new ones--in my judgment, three big ones. Why? Well, I know why. We all know why. It is because of the power of the gun lobby, because of the power of the NRA. There is no other reason. I have been asking for a rational reason why, and you hear ``too much bureaucracy,'' or something like that. 
   Well, in this juvenile justice bill, we are creating a lot more bureaucracy to put more kids in prison who commit serious crimes. I agree with that. I am a pretty tough-on-crime guy. But we don't get up on this side and say: too much bureaucracy. We don't hear colleagues on the other side say: too much bureaucracy. That is a false argument if there ever was one. 
   People want bureaucracy when they want Government to do something. If you want to put kids or felons away, it is more bureaucracy, more prosecutors. I am for it, but it is more bureaucracy. More laws? I am for it, but it is more bureaucracy. But when it comes to a law that would stop the kids from getting guns, that would stop the felons from getting guns, oh, no, no, then it is too much bureaucracy and we can't have it. I have never understood the distinction. 
   So the bottom line is a simple one. In the legislation we passed by one mere vote last week, we did not close the gun show loophole. We closed one little loophole and opened up another one to take its place. It is as wide open as it was before the legislation, and anyone, as my colleague from Nebraska has pointed out, could become a special licensee; and then we created three more loopholes. 
   Mr. President, we would have been better off without Hatch-Craig than we would have been with it. It was easier to stop children and felons from getting guns before Hatch-Craig than it is now, if it were to become law. So who are we kidding? 
   Then one final argument to my colleagues, to my friends on the other side--the Senator from Alabama is not here, but he will be even more ably represented by the Senator from Utah. That chart has been up here for a long time. I think we have heard more talk about that chart than about a lot of the legislation we are talking about. But that is fine. That is a legitimate argument, in my judgment. But I ask my friends--they say there is not enough prosecution of firearms violations. I agree with them. I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, in the budget last month, we put in a proposal to add $50 million to do what has been done in Richmond, Philadelphia, and in Rochester, NY, to do better prosecutions of those who violate Federal firearms laws. 
   As you know, most of the firearms laws are State. It has never been a Federal responsibility. Folks on the other side want to make it one, and that is fine with me. I am not one who says the Federal Government should not be involved in crime fighting. In fact, over my 10 years, I have pushed the Federal Government to be involved in crime fighting. But, again, why does prosecuting those who violate our firearms laws contradict closing the gun show loophole? It doesn't. Both should be done. They should go hand in hand. 
   As I mentioned before, in the debate we had with the Senator from Idaho a while back, there are grieving families in Littleton. There may be prosecutions of some who gave guns to Mr. Klebold and Mr. Harris, who created the tragedy. I am sure those prosecutions don't make the parents of the 13 dead children feel any better. I saw one of them begging us on television at the rally in Denver last week. They would beg us to do both--to prosecute those who violate firearms laws, but at the same time prevent children like young Harris and Klebold from getting guns to begin with. 
   A prosecution occurs after the crime. It sometimes deters crime because people don't want to be prosecuted. I have been tough on crime--for mandatory minimum sentences, and for incarceration--my whole career. But, in God's name, don't use that which is a worthy cause as an excuse, as a substitute for simple, moderate things such as closing the gun show loophole, closing the pawnshop loophole and allowing the FBI system to check when the instant check system doesn't work. 
   In conclusion, I know my friends from Nebraska and Utah wish to speak. This afternoon will be a moment of reckoning on this floor. It will determine, very simply, whether we are going to persist, as we have in the last few years, about coming up with solutions that don't do the job--that are almost designed not to do the job--or whether we can actually do some real good in a simple measure, sponsored by the Senators from New Jersey and Nebraska, and close the gun show loophole. The yeas and nays this afternoon will determine which side each Senator is on. The eyes of America will be upon this floor this afternoon. Let us pray we do the right thing. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to name the new train station at the James A. Farley Post Office Building, which sits across the street from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, after my esteemed colleague and tireless champion of this project, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   It is an especially fitting tribute to offer this bill today as President Bill Clinton, Governor George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, Postmaster General William Henderson and Senator MOYNIHAN all gathered this morning at the Farley Building to officially unveil the magnificent new station plan, designed by the celebrated architect David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. I am deeply sorry that I could not attend that event, which I understand was a success in every way, but other matters called me here to the floor. 
   First, let me praise the vision and determination of my dear friend, the senior Senator from New York. In 1963, long before he was a Senator and, in fact, when I was 12 years old PAT MOYNIHAN was one of a group of prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our City's spectacular Pennsylvania Station--a glorious public building designed by the nation's premier architectural firm of the time, McKim, Mead & White. 
   It was PAT MOYNIHAN who recognized years ago that across the street from what is now a sad basement terminal that functions--barely--as New York City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office Building, built by the same architects in much the same grand design as the old Penn Station. PAT MOYNIHAN recognized that since the very same railroad tracks that run under the current Penn Station also run beneath the Farley Building, we could use the Farley Building to once again create a train station worthy of our great city. He then tirelessly did the impossible--persuaded New York City, New York State, the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Amtrak, Congressional Appropriators, and the President himself, to commit to making this project succeed. No mean feat, I assure you. In a day, particularly in our city, when grand public works often get bugged down in fighting and court suits, it is a tribute to Senator MOYNIHAN that not only did he have the vision to see the station, but he also had the muscle and legislative skill to see it through. 
   This past Sunday, Herbert Muschamp, the noted New York Times architecture critic praised Childs' design, which brilliantly fuses the classical elements of the Farley Building with a dramatic, light-filled concourse and a spectacular new ticketing area. Muschamp adds: ``In an era better known for the decrepitude of its infrastructure than for inspiring new visions of the city's future, the plan comes as proof that New York can still undertake major public works. This is the most important transportation project undertaken in New York City in several generations.'' We have PAT MOYNIHAN to thank. 
   That Senator MOYNIHAN would be responsible for the success of this project is no surprise. His passion for and dedication to public architecture is well known and dates back to his days as a young aide to President Kennedy, who, right before his death, tasked MOYNIHAN with restoring Pennsylvania Avenue here in Washington. 
   MOYNIHAN succeeded brilliantly in his task, with the final piece of Pennsylvania Avenue--the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center--unveiled one year ago and instantly hailed as one of the best new buildings to grace the Capital. MOYNIHAN has another renowned Federal building to his credit--the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building, which provides such a beautiful companion to Union Station and the Old Post Office. 
   In New York City, MOYNIHAN has been an equally tireless architectural champion, responsible for the restoration of the spectacular Beaux-Arts Custom House at Bowling Green and for the construction of a grand new Federal Courthouse at Foley Square. MOYNIHAN is beloved in Buffalo for reawakening that city's appreciation for its architectural heritage, which includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and the Prudential Building, one of the best-known early American skyscrapers by the architect Louis Sullivan--a building which MOYNIHAN helped restore and then chose as his Buffalo office. 
   When he first came to Buffalo he told me that nowhere else in America had the three greatest American architects of the 20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright, Henry Richardson and Louis Sullivan, had buildings standing near one another. 
   He has also spurred a popular movement in Buffalo to build a new signature Peace Bridge. 
   So my colleagues, it is altogether fitting and appropriate that this new Penn Station be named in honor of our distinguished senior Senator from New York, someone who is my friend and who I wish was staying in the Senate for a longer period of time--someone I will dearly miss. It is an honor to stand here and offer this tribute to such an uncommon man, because Senator MOYNIHAN himself is indeed a national treasure. 
   Truly, the epitaph given to Sir Christopher Wren, designer of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, is fitting for Senator MOYNIHAN. If my colleagues will pardon my pronunciation, for my Latin isn't that good: ``Si Monumentum Requiris Circumspice,'' ``If you would see the man's monument, look around. 
   I join my fellow New Yorkers in anxiously awaiting the day when we arrive at the glorious DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN Station.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
   This proposal is as riddled with loopholes as the previous Craig proposal. No. 1, you can buy guns at gun shows without any background check through the new provision of special licensees. No. 2, criminals can buy guns at pawnshops without any background check--a step backward. No. 3, there is still immunity in lawsuits. But most importantly, anyone who thinks that we close the gun show loophole with this amendment is mistaken, because special licensees neither have to make a background check nor file any reports. 
   Please do not think that we are closing the gun show loophole with this amendment. I urge my colleagues in strong terms to oppose it. We should pass the Lautenberg amendment. That does close the gun show loophole. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say you are closing it and leave a huge, wide open loophole. This is a Swiss cheese amendment.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair and thank the Senators from Vermont and New Jersey for their consideration and leadership on this issue. 
   Let me say, again, even with the new Hatch-Craig amendment, which I understand the Senator from Utah has offered in the best of faith, there are three and possibly four major problems. 
   No. 1, it does not close the pawnshop loophole. Felons will flock to pawnshops and get guns. Why are we taking a step backward less than a month after Littleton? Why are we telling criminals around the country, you can go to a pawnshop, get a gun, no questions asked? How can this body vote for that given what just happened in Littleton? What is the justification? What is the reason to allow pawn dealers to give guns to criminals, no questions asked? There is absolutely none. 
   All of America is scratching its head and saying, what is going on in this Chamber? Some say it is not the gun lobby. Well, I would like to know what it is that is making us do the most irrational, ridiculous things that make it easier for criminals to get guns after what we have seen happen. 
   No. 2, this modification puts a stranglehold on the Brady law. It sets a 24-hour time limit for gun show sale background checks, only 24 hours. Do you know what the FBI says they need? They say they need 3 days. That is what Federal licensed dealers get. When the FBI says give us 3 days, they get it. But not at a gun show. So if they can't find the records within 24 hours, the gun will go right to a criminal. What kind of loophole is that? Why do we need it? Again, if it is not the gun lobby that is pushing us to do this, then who is it? 
   Finally--this is not even about the modification that was mentioned--the bill undermines the law by weakening 
   prohibitions on interstate sales. Dealers would now be able to go to gun shows outside their States and sell firearms directly to residents of other States, even though they may not know the firearms law of that State. Why is that? Why are we allowing gun dealers who have been previously limited to their own State on the grounds that they know the laws of the State, that they know the people of the State, to go across the Nation to sell their guns? If it is not the gun lobby, my colleagues, then what is it? 
   So even with the modification that the Senator from Utah has so graciously offered--and I will get to that in a minute--you have pawnshops being able to sell guns to criminals with impunity. You have no kinds of checks when the FBI says it might be a criminal, give us the time, the 72 hours. And you allow gun dealers to go from one end of the country to the other and sell out of the State for the first time. 
   Then, finally, on the gun show loophole, if you really wanted to fix this, you would pass the bill we had before us 2 days ago, the bill that was sponsored by the Senator from New Jersey, cosponsored by me. 
   Let me say this: 2 days ago I brought up on the floor to the Senator from Idaho that there were mistakes in the bill. The next morning they said, yes, there were. They were corrected; some of them, not all. Last night, I went quietly over to the Senator from Utah in the hallway and said that you have a major loophole in this called ``special licensees.'' If I or the Senator from New Jersey or the Senator from Vermont were trying to obfuscate, we would have just laid in wait, not brought that up to you and not looked at the correction. 
   I say this: It is only fair to give us some time to look at the language here, because twice what we were told was in the bill was not in the bill. I think something is going on here. We are trying to act as if we are being tough on gun control but then put so many loopholes in the bill that we can say to our friends on the other side, hey, see, we really didn't mean it. It is sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 
   I am also told, in all fairness, by the Senator from Utah--and I don't know, because the language hasn't been analyzed--

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple one. It requires Internet web sites which offer at least 10 guns for sale to be federally licensed firearm dealers--no more, no less. It closes the loophole which has allowed unlicensed, and only unlicensed, gun brokers to set up web sites offering thousands of guns for sale. 
   Right now, if you punch into the web you will see legitimate gun dealers who will continue just as they have been, and you will see lots of unlicensed gun dealers.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Again, this bill has no effect on chat rooms, on newspaper want ads, or on licensed dealers in any way. It does not restrict advertising or the sale of guns on the Internet. It is a very simple and modest measure which says that unlicensed dealers cannot--cannot--sell guns on the Internet. If they wish to become a dealer, which is relatively easy, then they will be able to. 
   The entire nature of the black market in guns will make a quantum leap if we do not deal with this problem. The Internet has already become for some, and will become for many, the method of choice by which children, criminals, and the mentally incompetent get guns. Presently the unlicensed dealers sell their guns completely on the honor system. Let me quote one, GunSource.com:  
   Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, we cannot confirm that each user is who they claim to be.  
   That is how a 17-year-old Alabama boy got a semiautomatic last month. 
   The Weapons Rack:  
   It is the sole responsibility of the seller and buyer to conform to regulations.  
   My colleague from Idaho said last night there are laws on the books. You can't enforce them on the Internet unless you have a dealer, because if somebody says on the Internet that he is 22 and gets a gun mailed to him and he is really 14, the post office is not going to open every piece of mail that might have a gun. We wouldn't want them to.

   simply requiring everyone who sells to be a licensed dealer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from California, not only for the time but, far more important, for her leadership on this issue. 
   We were the coauthors of the assault weapons ban of 1994. She carried it bravely in the Senate, and then I followed in the House. 
   We still have unfinished work to do. That is what this amendment is all about. The Senator from California has well documented the need for this legislation. But let me say that this is such a simple, carefully drawn, and modest measure that to take half a loaf or a quarter of a loaf is not good enough, particularly in light of the tragedy in Littleton and the tragedies which have occurred throughout America. 
   The Senator from Missouri has tried to deal with a part of the Feinstein amendment, but it still leaves a giant exception for young people to get these clips for hunting, for employment, for a group of other exceptions. 
   I say, if we believe these clips are unnecessary--unnecessary for hunting, unnecessary for self-defense--because they kill far too many people, then why are we making such an exception? So I ask my colleagues, if you really believe in rational laws on guns, if you really believe that young people should not have the kinds of clips--30-round--from all across the world sent to this country for no other purpose than to harm and maim--no legitimate purpose--then how can you believe it is OK half of the time or a quarter of the time or three-quarters of the time? 
   So I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment, not to shy away from it with a modification that does not really do the job, but to take this well-thought-out and modest step. 
   Let me say something else about the climate around here as it relates to this amendment and all of the amendments that are here. 
   What a bitter disappointment it is that the response to Littleton is that a loophole which allows criminals to get guns just gets wider. The American people are scratching their collective heads and saying, What is going on in this Senate of the United States? There is the blood of young children on our schoolhouse floors, and not only do we fail to take the modest step of closing the gun show loophole, we actually make it wider. I don't get it. I am new in the Senate, but I just don't get it. 
   As the entire Nation turns its eyes towards the Senate to do something to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, we give criminals a new special pawnshop exemption, one that did not exist even in the months before Littleton. Shame on us. 
   On the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, there was some discussion between him and me about it yesterday, but now it seems that all of the provisions I mentioned that were in that amendment seem to be true. And, frankly, the Senator from Idaho was gracious enough to admit that to me in the well of this Chamber this morning. 
   Let me tell you what we passed into law yesterday. 
   A violent felon gets out of jail and has little cash, so he pawns some of his guns. At this point, he is not even allowed to own a gun by law. Later, he raises money--maybe through a job, maybe through a crime; who knows--and he goes to redeem his gun. And now there will be no background check because of the amendment of the Senator from Idaho. 
   In 1994, of the 5,405 people who redeemed their own gun at a pawnshop, 294 were caught in the Brady net. When America begged the Senate to do something about guns, they were not asking us to bring back the pawnshop loophole. Why are we back-peddling? And other places, too.

   There were two other exceptions in the Craig amendment, two other loopholes that, again, made it easier for people--children, criminals--to get guns. One is an exemption from liability for certain gun dealers; another would allow gun dealers to actually set up shop out of State, something unheard of since 1968. I would caution my colleagues in the Senate, evidently the Craig amendment had other loopholes as well, which we will talk more about later. 
   So please, let us, everyone, if we are afraid to take a step forward--and I pray that we are not--not take three steps backwards, which up to now the Senate has done. 
   I yield back.

We are in the process of analyzing it and hope to very shortly be able to either agree or disagree. But given what happened yesterday, we want to make sure we know what is in the bill and that it is the same thing the Senator from Idaho thinks is in the bill. I appreciate his indulgence. 
   But I do appreciate his words. They are meaningful to me, 
   and I am glad we can conduct this debate, where we disagree so strongly, in a civil and fine tone.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I want to go over the language. I agree with much of what the Senator said on the factual situation, but I would make one correction. The pawnshop exception was not part of Brady; it was added in. I remember this because I fought with then Chairman Brooks of the Judiciary Committee about it. It was added in the 1994 crime bill. Brady would have required the background check as is required today. The Brooks amendment exempted pawnshops from that check. And now, with the Craig amendment, we would go back to where the Brooks amendment was. Am I correct in that? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-schumer-ny-10-19990513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. Just one point on the pawnshop exception. The reason it was put in Brady, no exception, the closing of the exception--the reason the administration went ahead and said that instant check required it was that, without the recheck, 
   many people who were felons would get guns. 
   Of the 5,000-some-odd people who went to pawnshops in this period between the Brooks amendment and the ATF's regulation, over 300 were found to be felons. In other words, they were missed in the first check and the second check found them. 
   So I say to the Senator--and on this one we do not have to wait for the language because the Senator from Idaho has said the pawnshop exception in the language of yesterday will stay in the bill. I think that is a serious mistake. It will take us, in my judgment at least, a step back because many, many, many--in this case, close to 300; 294 people who were missed in the first check--were stopped in the second check. These are felons. These are not people whom the Senator from Idaho or I generally bend over backwards to help get guns. 
   So what is wrong with the second check when it is working? I urge the Senator from Idaho to reconsider and take the pawnshop exception out of this amendment. 
   I yield my time. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.

<DOCNO>106-schumer-ny-19-19990513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. We did not have any opportunity to address this special registrants issue. As I understand it, Hatch-Craig elaborates on the reporting requirements of special registrants and other important things. Let me say to my good friend from Utah, it is a major new way of dealing with firearm licenses. 
   I understand the urgency that my friend from Utah places on the $50 million for more juvenile prosecutors. It is something I share, because lives might be saved. 
   How can we rush through a whole new way of dealing with firearm dealers, something that we first saw at 3:30, something we are vetting? That is my concern. We could rush it through and find that this type of provision has totally changed things. 
   For instance, as I understand it----and I want to know about it before giving any permission for time limits----these special registrants don't have to keep any records. Someone could go to a gun show, be a special registrant, sell a gun, and there would be no way to see to whom they sold the gun, why, and where. 
   That, to me, is extremely serious. I don't think it is fair, given that this is a major change, admittedly, to a gun show provision. I want to move this bill, but I would like to know more about that.

   It was then voted on with the feeling by many Members, if not most, that those provisions weren't in the bill. 
   Then this morning we hear--in all consideration, the Senator from Idaho was very gentlemanly, saying he was wrong--those new provisions were in the bill. 
   So we have never had a serious debate on one of the most fundamental changes in the way we sell guns in this country.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the time and for his leadership. I understand there is movement on the other side to try to deal with the gun show loophole. I appreciate that. But I say to all my colleagues, if we pass the amendment sponsored by the Senators from Utah and Idaho, we will not close that loophole and we will be back here hearing about more tragedies from guns emanating from gun shows. There are six reasons for that which we should talk about. 
   First and most egregious, the amendment creates and deals with someone called a ``special licensee,'' a person who would be licensed to sell in volume at gun shows who would not require background checks. This is overturning 31 years of having federally licensed firearms dealers with a new system that is as weak as a wet noodle. The licensees will not have to----

   Mr. SCHUMER. The point I make is this. We have always had the only people who can legitimately sell guns in quantity are federally licensed dealers. We are now creating an exception. 
   I ask my colleague, the Senator from Utah, why we exempt these people from any reporting requirements? When you talk to our law enforcement people in either the Justice Department or in the Treasury Department, they say if one of these new licensees--because they have no reporting requirements whatsoever--were to simply pass guns out, we would have no way to check. 
   My friend from Utah and many from the other side have talked about the need to enforce existing laws. This creates such a huge loophole we would never be able to enforce any existing laws.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Right now, for interstate, these people could go interstate. That is the basic problem. If these people, these federally licensed special licensees had to stay within their State, I would concede to the Senator from Utah that maybe it is nonexistent--but not a step backwards. But they can. So now for the first time we have people who can sell out of State who are not federally licensed dealers and who do not have any reporting requirements. 
   There is sort of a split, almost a schizophrenia in the logic of the other side, which is we must enforce. We do not need new laws to enforce. But we take away every single tool of enforcement.

   Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from California is exactly correct. What we are doing now is making it easier because we take one of the barriers away for criminals to get their guns back at pawnshops. Why, for the love of God, are we making it easier for felons to get guns? It is an amazing thing. If the American people were all listening to this debate, they would be utterly amazed. Let me yield to the Senator from California.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. 
   I say to my good friend from Utah, who I know is very sincere in this, if the sponsors of this legislation were to accept a provision that says let's have the same reporting requirements for the special licensees as we have for the Federal dealers, he might be making a step in the direction--it would not be as strong as the Lautenberg bill, but it would move in that direction. 
   I remind him of one other thing. Right now, the only people who can sell guns in large quantities at gun shows are federally licensed dealers. Under this legislation, for the first time--and that is what I was saying--we would have a new group of people allowed to sell guns in large quantities at gun shows. These are people who have not gone under the rigors of the check before becoming a Federal dealer. They are not people who have the licensing requirements. It is a loophole so wide you can drive a Mack truck through it. 
   Our law enforcement people tell us, again, if we are talking about enforcement, I am sure we want to trace guns that criminals have. Everyone on the other side is saying tougher penalties for the criminals. I agree with that. One of the reasons I believe I befuddled some of the folks on the other side is I am a tough guy on law and order. I believe in tough punishment and have worked for it. But tough punishment and gun laws are not contradictory. 
   The NRA and others always set up that straw man: Well, we need tough enforcement. 
   Yes, we do. If the two people who brought the guns into Littleton High had lived, I would have wanted the book thrown at them. But may I say to my friends and my fellow Americans, I would have also wanted them never to have been able to get a gun, because punishing after the crime, while important and necessary, does not save a life. 
   To say that we need tough laws and tough enforcement is correct. To say that that means we do not need gun laws is incorrect. And that is the basic illogic of the arguments I have heard made on the other side tonight. Tough punishment, yes; tough gun laws, yes. 
   The Senator from Idaho talked about where the American people are. I will tell you--I agree with you--they are for tough punishment, no question about it. They are also for tougher gun laws. In a recent CNN survey, 4 percent said they did not think the gun laws ought to be toughened. In another survey--I forget who did it--87 percent said close the gun show loophole. They did not say come up with a mechanism by which other people can sell quantities of guns and never report to whom they sold those guns at a gun show. That is what this amendment does. 
   Let's make no mistake about it. Is this a diluted version of the Lautenberg amendment? It is worse, because it gives the impression we are tightening the loophole.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
   We are trying to give the impression that we are toughening things up, but, in a sense, not only are we not because of these special licensees--and I still have not heard a single good reason why they should not have reporting requirements--but at the same time, we are creating a new mechanism. And sure as we are sitting here--and I say this to the American people because the Senate seems unable to understand the pleas of the American people--they are going to start using special licensees as opposed to federally licensed dealers all across America. 
   Violence will increase, and we will be hearing calls for more tough punishment, which we will need because there will be more criminals and more gun deaths. 
   I urge rejection of the Hatch-Craig amendment. If you want to do something real, pass the Lautenberg amendment. We will have a chance, hopefully, to revote on it next week, and then we will see who wants to close the gun show loophole. 
   I thank my colleagues for their time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the point I was about to make regarding the Orrin Hatch amendment, before we get into the substance of this debate--I doubt that we will take the whole hour on this one--is this: Under the Hatch-Craig amendment, there is a new category of people called ``special licensees'' who can sell at a gun show. They can sell guns en masse--lots of guns. Not only are they not required to do the paperwork, they are not required to do a background check. So when the Senator from Utah said before that they are toughening up the law, it is just not so. 
   It is true that federally licensed dealers would have to do a background check; it is true that the law is a little toughened up so that individuals who sell to one another might have to do a background check. But we create a whole new huge category of special licensees who can come to gun shows, sell en masse, do no background check and no paper recording. What a loophole. 
   That is why the Hatch-Craig amendment, more than any other reason, is a giant step not forward but backward. That is why the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, is what is needed. I ask my colleagues to look at that as part of the other debate. 
   Mr. President, we are here today to debate an amendment dealing with Internet sales of guns. I want to thank Chairman HATCH and Senator LEAHY for the opportunity to offer this amendment. We have known for a long time that gun shows are a loophole that have allowed people to buy guns without a background check. We know that. Well, there is another loophole that I believe is about to make a quantum change in the gun black market  and is a disaster waiting to happen: At this moment, on your personal computer in your home, in your child's bedroom, there are thousands and thousands of guns available for sale by unlicensed dealers on the Internet. 
   These guns, including assault weapons, automatic weapons and cheap handguns, are listed for sale on a no-questions-asked, honor system basis, which leaves it up to anonymous buyers and sellers to comply with Brady and State and local firearms laws. Any computer novice can so readily and so easily find gun web sites that owning a personal computer means having a gun show in your home 24 hours a day. 
   Last month, for instance, a 17-year-old Alabama boy acquired a Taurus 9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol and 50 rounds of ammunition over the Internet. He was caught only because his mother was home and UPS dropped off the package. Who knows what crime may have been committed with that Internet gun. 
   Since 1968, it has been illegal for a felon to buy a gun. The reason we passed the Brady law is because enforcement had no mechanism to enforce that law. The Internet returns us to the pre-Brady period where disreputable people can get together and evade gun laws with little prospect of detection. Mark my words, if we don't pass an amendment such as this one, within a year or two, the Internet will be the method of choice by which kids, criminals, and mentally incompetents obtain guns. We will rue the day we don't pass this amendment. Passing this amendment now will save lives. 
   What does it do? My amendment simply requires that any web site that is set up to offer guns for sale on the Internet be a federally licensed firearm dealer who will make certain that criminal background checks occur with each sale. It just makes the Internet Brady compliant--no more, no less. 
   Let me show you what is available on the web by simply typing in key words like guns for sale, militia and AK-47. This is the Guns America Web site right here on this paper. Anybody can punch into it. Guns America boasts that it sells guns on the honor system, that there is ``not an FFL dealer among the bunch of us,'' and that it will ``grow to hundreds of thousands of new listings every month.'' 
   Guns America, at this very moment, has 21 AK-47s and AK-47 copies for sale, with no questions asked--not a soul watching, not a stitch of oversight. It is solely up to anonymous buyers and sellers to comply with all gun laws. Let me tell you, the chance of getting caught breaking the law is as likely as mom finding the gun in junior's bedroom. 
   Now, this one here is the Weapons Rack, another honor system weapons site. Since last week when I made this poster, the Weapons Rack has had 3,300 visitors to its site. We don't know anything about these visitors. Did they buy? Did they sell? Were they kids? Were they felons? What we do know is that the number of visitors is indicative that sales on the Internet are growing exponentially. Remember, 5 years ago, practically nobody bought stocks on the Internet. Today, 30 percent of all stocks are sold online. 
   The internet is about to change the entire way guns are bought and sold in America. And if we don't get on top of it now and create and ironclad enforcement mechanism to ensure Brady compliance, I promise you just as sure as I am standing here, it will cost lives and we will sorely regret it. 
   This is the Weapons Rack disclaimer: ``It is the sole responsibility of the seller and buyer to conform to [firearms] regulations.'' 
   Not exactly a confidence booster, is it? 
   If either the seller or buyer don't want to comply, they go right through. 
   GunSource.com has 3,600 guns for sale. Their disclaimer says, ``Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, we cannot confirm that each user is who they claim to be.'' 
   Isn't that amazing? 
   Let me read that again. This is right on the Internet. ``Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, we cannot confirm that each user is who they claim to be.'' 
   This is a chilling admission. It is also an invitation to those who cannot buy a gun from a licensed dealer to use the cloak of the Internet to find illicit sellers and arms sellers. 
   Earlier this year eBay, the Nation's largest Internet auction site, put out this statement in conjunction with a directive banning the listing of guns on this web site. This is what eBay said. They said:  
   The current laws governing the sale of firearms were created for the non-internet sale of firearms. These laws may work well in the real world, but they work less well for the online trading of firearms, where the seller and the buyer rarely meet face-to-face. The online seller cannot readily guarantee that the buyer meets all the qualifications and complies with the laws governing the sale of firearms.  
   Listen to the experts. eBay said selling guns on the web is too dangerous because they had no idea who was buying and who was selling; no way to find out; no way to ask; no way to verify--the guns are sold purely on faith. 
   My amendment is balanced, reasonable, and modest. 
   It replaces blind internet faith with fully Brady compliance, no more, no less. 
   It bans the unlicensed sale of guns on the internet by requiring websites clearly designed to sell guns to be federally licensed firearms dealers. It won't affect chat rooms. It won't affect newspaper want ads. It won't affect licensed firearms dealers. 
   It requires internet gun sites to become ``middlemen'' and act as conduits for all sales by forwarding all gun sales to the appropriate firearms dealer in the buyer's state who will perform the Brady background check. In this way, it is just like a mail-order sale. You have an intermediary. When the gun is sold, it is sent to a gun dealer who then does the background check and gives the gun to the buyer. 
   To prevent buyers and sellers from circumventing the website operator and from carrying out transactions which violate federal law--the amendment prohibits sites from listing information like an e-mail address or phone number that allows buyers and sellers to independently contact each other. 
   Sellguns.com does this already. They are an FFL. This is an auction site where buyers e-mail bids for a particular gun through the website operator. 
    The seller sends the firearm, the shipper pays, and the buyer sends the bid, plus fees and shipping, and SellGuns.com makes the match and identifies the seller's item with the buyer's request. It works well. It is happening now. We would require this to happen in every sale. It doesn't interfere with the transaction of guns; it just makes sure that kids and criminals can't get them. 
   When a final bid is accepted, the buyer sends a check to SellGuns.com. The seller sends the gun to SellGuns.com. They trade, the check and the gun cross, and everybody is happy. 
   That is the model for how all internet gun sales will proceed if this amendment passes. 
   This amendment is also easy to enforce. 
   Since these websites operate on a volume basis they have to make their sites easily accessible. Most sites are linked to common words like ``guns,'' ``AK-47,'' and ``militia.'' So gun sites are actually easy to find and easy to put into compliance or put out of business if they refuse to comply. 
   Some members have asked me about the difference between a gun ad in say, Guns and Ammo magazines or a newspaper want ad and gun sites on the internet. 
   Number one: volume, The number of guns for sale right now on the internet--20,000, 50,000, 100,000 guns--dwarfs anything available in any publication. 
   Number two: secrecy. Magazines are static publications. If the same individual keeps showing up selling guns, law enforcement can look at back issues and investigate. The internet is ephemeral. Sellers come and go. Ads appear and disappear. 
   Number three: access. Gun sellers are in my home and your home. They're in the bedrooms of my ten year old and my fourteen year old daughters. Owning a personal computer means having a gun show in your home. 
   All it takes is a curious and troubled teenager to cruise the web until they find someone willing to sell. At least with Guns and Ammo a kid has got to know the magazine exists and go to a magazine shop and buy it. This gun store is in your home whether you like it or not. 
   Number four: anonymity. The web allows kids and criminals to use e-mail  to rapidly probe on-line sellers to see who is willing to bypass gun laws. And since it is impossible to monitor any transaction there is only the slimmest of chances that anyone would get caught. 
   In a magazine ad it would be enormously time consuming and frankly involve luck to figure out who is willing to sell under the table. 
   Number five: distance. The local want ads, are just that--local. The internet moves the transaction from a neighborhood market to a national market. 
   Commerce on the internet is in its infancy. I agree with those who say that we ought to be very careful before we prohibit certain activities on the net. 
   I believe that the internet is one of the reasons that American productivity is at an all-time high and growing at a remarkable pace. 
   But this is an area that cries out for common sense regulation. it is rare that Congress is ahead of the curve. We usually have to be prodded by crisis to act. 
   If we fail to close the internet loophole today--I promise you--it will not be the last time that we hear about this issue. A child, a criminal, a disturbed individual will exploit this loophole, evade a background check and commit a crime that will leave America in mourning. 
   In Alabama, where a juvenile succeeded in buying a gun on the internet an ATF agent said:  
   The sale of guns on the internet is part of the growing cottage gun industry, replacing face-to-face firearms sales between dealers and individuals at local shops with e-mail messages and shipping orders. 
   On the internet, the dealers don't know who they're dealing with on the other end. You could be dealing with a career criminal, a drug dealer or a high school student.  
   Do we really want to leave the sale of guns over the internet completely unregulated? 
   This bill I am presenting is a balanced, constitutionally sound bill which requires web sites that are clearly designed to offer guns for sale to be federally licensed firearm dealers--no more, no less. 
   We learned from the Brady bill that the honor system doesn't work for guns. It might for most people. It doesn't for criminals. And it doesn't for kids who want to buy them and to do something terrible. 
   Pass this amendment and we solve the major problem. Let it fail and we open a firearms cyberhighway that has no exit. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will answer a few points of the Senator from Idaho and maybe we can engage in a dialog. 
   The Senator is wrong in one sense. The Internet does not just do advertising. Some sites just do advertising, and if there were no efforts to transfer guns, we would agree. 
   How about when a web site offers guns and earns a fee when there is a sale? That is not an advertisement, it is a business. The more guns they sell, the more the web site makes. 
   The second point I make, and this is the most important point, the Senator from Idaho got up and he said they give each other the name and address, and it is their responsibility to contact a firearms dealer. 
   Say I am a 15-year-old and I want a gun, but I don't tell the seller that I want it, and I don't contact the firearms dealer. What is to stop me from doing that? That is the point here. 
   Sure, in a perfect world, the Senator from Idaho would be right. But then we wouldn't be debating a juvenile crime bill. The fact that there are criminals, young and old, means there are people who won't obey the law. All we are trying to do is make it easy for law enforcement or even possible for law enforcement to make sure people obey the law. 
   I guess I would ask my friend from Idaho if the 15-year-old has no intention of going through a licensed dealer, which is the law for an out-of-State sale, how do we stop him under present law? How do we stop him from getting the gun? That is the problem.

   Mr. SCHUMER. The point is, the two gentlemen from Columbine High School broke the law. If we want to allow every kid to get a gun and we can then, after they create havoc, say they broke the law, we are in pretty sad shape. 
   What we want to do here is prevent them from getting guns. To simply say a 15-year-old who purchases a gun on the Internet broke the law is not very satisfying to most Americans. They want to stop them from getting the gun, prevent him from getting the gun. 
   So I suggest there in a nutshell is the whole argument. The Senator from Idaho says, since the law prohibits interstate gun sales, we should allow a 15-year-old who wants to violate the law to use the exact mechanism we have talked about, the Internet, to get that gun and then after he gets the gun we go after him.

<DOCNO>106-schumer-ny-58-19990513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHUMER. Let me just finish my point and then I will be delighted to allow the Senator to respond. 
   The 15-year-old wants to break the law, sends for the gun, gets the gun, and because the Postal Service is not going to open every package ahead of time, there is nothing that prevents the 15-year-old from getting the gun. In fact, the Postal Service has no way of knowing that gun is being shipped to an underage person. So they cannot even--there is not even a suspicion. Then, after that person gets the gun, we say that person broke the law. 
   In fact, the only way we are going to know they broke the law is if they use that gun for a bad purpose. If there was ever a situation of closing the barn door after the cows got out of the barn, this is it. 
   I simply ask my colleague to rethink his opposition to this legislation based on his own statement. He broke the law. How do we know it? The only human way we can know it, that is humanly possible, is after the gun is used in a crime. If the 
   Senator would like me to yield, I will. I do not have to if he does not want to respond. Please. It is on my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I don't think the common carrier did. 
   But, again, my point is a simple one. They are all breaking the law, and there is no way to find out. This is not a question for the ATF. This is a question because the Senator would be one of the first if the ATF started opening every package to see if there were guns and knocking on the door of every person who ordered a gun to see what age they were, which is of course an absurd situation, we would all be in an outcry. So, to say that three people broke the law is not very satisfying. To say that Klebold and Harris broke the law in Littleton is not very satisfying to the parents who are grieving their children. 
   By this simple piece of legislation, we might have stopped it. Without impinging on anyone's rights, without  changing anything else, we might have stopped it. 
   With that, I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey  very much. I also thank my friend, the Senator from Idaho, for his graciousness in letting me take the floor right now. 
   Let me say, as somebody who has been involved in this issue for a long time, today is a very crucial day in our fight to bring rationality to the laws that relate to guns in America. It is the first time we have had a real opportunity to make progress since the Brady law was passed. 
   All we are trying to do here is make sure that Brady continues to work. The bottom line is a simple one; that is, as Brady has begun to work, the vast majority of Americans, gun owners and nongun owners, have abided by this law. Almost everybody believes it has worked, but those who wish to avoid the law have found loopholes--the Internet, which we will be dealing with later, an amendment I will propose, and most notably, gun shows, which the Senator from New Jersey has highlighted. I am proud to be his lead cosponsor of that legislation we have worked on. 
   The problem we face in the law when we try to make laws on gun controls is we are always ruled by the least common denominator. If 99 percent of the people obey the law, but 1 percent finds a loophole, then all the criminal element and everybody who wants to give guns to children, to criminals, to the mentally incompetent will use that loophole. So all the rest of the laws do no good. 
   They say there are 40,000 laws on the books about gun control. But as long as you have a weak link in the chain, it is exploited, and we suffer. In my city, 95 percent of the guns that are used in crimes come from out of State, many of them from gun shows. Gun shows have proliferated as the loophole has become more obvious and more known to people. 
   I plead with my colleagues--it is so important for us to continue the work of Brady. We are not seeking to go further in the area of gun control. We are simply trying to keep the status quo by plugging the loopholes that have allowed people to get around the Brady law which most people regard as very, very successful. 
   I know that my friend, the Senator from Idaho, has an amendment to make it voluntary. The problem with that is very simple, in my judgment. Again, it would not work because it is the least common denominator. If you go to a gun show and nine of the sellers of guns are using the instant check system and one isn't, anyone who evades the law will go to that one. All the other nine law-abiding people will both lose business and not be able to stop it. So making these laws voluntary, you may as well not make them at all, because those who wish to avoid the law will go to the one person who doesn't participate in the system and send a cascade of guns forward. 
   I am proud of this debate, Mr. President. First, I am proud that its tone is one of constructiveness in the light of Littleton, CO. Each of us is groping to see what can be done. We have differences of opinion, but there is respect in the debate. 
   I thank the Senator from Idaho. When he added his amendment, he did not come up with an amendment that was a subterfuge. He did not come up with an amendment that simply diverted the issue, as we have seen time and time again. He came up with an amendment that would allow us to debate this issue foursquare. 
   It is very simple. If you believe in closing the gun show loophole, you have to vote yes on the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. If you vote no on that, the loophole will continue, because no matter how many people voluntarily comply at gun shows, those who wish to violate the law or turn the other way, as the law is violated, will continue to do so. 
   This is an important crossroads in our debate. Just as in warfare there is defensive and offensive warfare and some move forward and then new mechanisms are found to get around those who move forward, we are at that point right now. If we allow people who wish to get around the Brady law and sell guns to criminals and sell guns to children and sell guns to the mentally incompetent, to use gun shows or use the Internet or any other way to get around it, we will have taken a dramatic step backwards. I believe the Brady law has in good part contributed to the decline in gun violence throughout America. Has it made it certain; has it made it so that there is no gun violence? Of course not. But why is it that gun violence has plummeted even more than other crimes since the Brady law has been passed? 
   The best explanation is that, yes, it works. The best explanation is that despite the doom and gloom, when we debated Brady, from the opponents, it has not interfered with the rights of the legitimate gun owner. I ask my colleagues, if you believe in keeping Brady sound--

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair. 
   If you believe in keeping Brady sound, if you believe that we can save lives without impinging on the rights of legitimate gun owners, then the only vote you can cast is yes on the Lautenberg amendment. Any other vote will not do the job. 
   This is a modest but important first step that will continue to reduce the number of deaths caused by firearms without impinging on the rights of those who believe they need them. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Senator from Idaho, again, for his graciousness.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   It is unfortunate we could not take this step forward on the Lautenberg amendment. Let me just inform my colleagues that the Craig amendment would not be a status quo amendment, but it would be a big step back, for three reasons. 
   One was mentioned by Senator LEAHY, that it would exempt certain people--it is unclear who--from liability. No. 2, it expands the pawn shop loophole. The law now is if you are a criminal, you have to get a background check when you redeem your gun at a pawn shop. Under the Craig amendment, that background check would be erased--no check. 
   And most significantly of all, the Craig amendment repeals a significant portion of the 1968 gun control act. Right now, if you are a licensed Federal firearms dealer, you can only sell guns at your licensed premises or at a gun show in your State. Under the Craig amendment, you could go anywhere in the country and sell your gun. It is a significant step backward. 
   I had hoped the Senate would take what would be, in my judgment, a step forward on Lautenberg. But please let us not take a step backward, which we would be doing if we voted for this amendment. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senators from Utah and Vermont for yielding me time on the floor as we begin to discuss juvenile violence. 
   First, let me say I appreciate the majority leader making this time available, and at this crucial time, because some say, well, maybe we should wait for the dust to settle in the aftermath of the tragedy in Littleton, CO. But I have found in years that sometimes when a terrible tragedy occurs people are focused on issues that might prevent future terrible tragedies; but if we wait several months, nothing much happens. So I am grateful for the opportunity. I think it is correct legislatively. 
   This is not a new issue. We have, unfortunately, seen other tragedies--in Springfield, OR, and Arkansas and throughout the country. Most of us have given lots of thought to the issue of how do we deal with violence among juveniles? How do we deal with violence in the schools? 
   I agree with all of those who have said there is no one road to Rome, that there are many, many different approaches. In fact, to me, an argument where one says, well, do A, which means don't do B, C, and D, is wrong. We have to examine all the causes of violence. We have to look at them. To advocate one particular course doesn't gainsay that another course might help as well. 
   It is obviously a very complicated issue. The question I guess all of America is asking itself is a simple one: Why now? Why all of a sudden have we seen such a rash of violence in our schools? 
   I have given this a great deal of thought, first in my 18 years in the House where, as a member of Judiciary, I focused on crime issues, and now in the last several months as a new Member of this body. In addition to thinking and reading about this, I also went out and talked to many young people. In fact, I have had conversations, been in classrooms, either directly or by video, with schools across my State--East High School in Rochester; Nottingham in Syracuse; Colony High School in Albany; Rockville Center in West Chester; New Rochelle High School; and two schools in New York City, Tottenville and Hunter High School. In each I sat down with a group of 30 to 50 young men and women and asked them their views, because I think it doesn't make much sense to talk about juvenile violence without talking to the juveniles. 
   Basically, what I found was quite interesting. I found that they, too, agreed that there were a number of causes, and many were perplexed as to why this happened. But I found some interesting thoughts. In every school, the students talked about two things more than any other that they thought led to this violence. In each school I went to--and these schools were quite varied; one was in an upper-income neighborhood, one in a poor neighborhood, and the rest were in rather middle-class neighborhoods--there were two common themes: 
   First, students did stress isolation, that young people do feel isolated and alone. They realized that the adolescent condition sometimes was such that when someone was isolated and alone, instead of reaching out, the inclination was to pick on them. A number of schools had suggestions as to how to deal with this problem. One school had an ombudsman, a young teacher whom the students loved. If someone was in trouble or feeling isolated or lonely, they could go to that ombudsman, and many did. Just as importantly, if it seemed to other students in the school that a young person or a group of young people was headed towards trouble, they could go to the ombudsman and the ombudsman would do what was necessary to try to bring that group of young people into the fold. 
   In another school up in Albany they had a human relations club. The heads of all the various student activities and the heads of different cliques or groups would get together once a month and discuss things and discuss their differences. It proved a good way of bridging gaps in that high school. Finally, another school, one on Long Island, had a club. It was sort of an elite club; it was hard to get into. I think it was called Smiles. One of the ideas of Smiles was to reach out to others and be inclusive. It was sort of taking the credo of inclusiveness and bringing people together and making it a thing that everyone aspired to do. I thought those ideas were pretty good and pretty interesting. Maybe we should look at some of them this week. 
   One idea that every classroom I went to seemed to laugh at 
   was the idea that seems to have gained some currency here in Washington, and that is the culture of violence. I, for instance, myself, having seen the video games and seen some of the movies that came out, when I started this process, thought this should be a reason young people would be more violent. 
   The kids seemed not to feel that way. They laughed at the idea that a video game, a movie, a television show would push somebody to do something awful like at Littleton. I said to them, well, it may not push you, but it might push people who were isolated and alone. They said, no, it would take a lot more than that. 
   One youngster raised his hand and said to me: When did you grow up? I said in the 1950s. He said: You saw a lot of westerns. I said that, yes, I did. He said: Did that move you to be more violent? I said not at all. 
   We may disagree with it, but I thought it was interesting that from one end of my State to the other, young people of all economic backgrounds and races and creeds and ethnicities rejected that idea. And again, of course, I come from New York  State, but these schools were spread throughout the State, many in quite conservative areas. 
   I found the one thing that was virtually universal is kids thought that guns were too available for them. I asked each high school class, if you really wanted to get a gun, would you know where to go or who to ask? And 60 to 100 percent said yes. 
   My point here today is this: Certainly we should consider other causes of violence among young people. We should look at isolation. Certainly we should look at parental responsibility. I am the father of a 4-year-old. It seems a lot of times she doesn't want to have her parents around her. But most of them wanted parental guidelines, wanted parental responsibility, wanted parental authority. There was no disagreement about that. 
   If you looked at the one consistent thing that almost everyone agreed with, it was that guns, the availability of guns, was too great; the availability of knowledge of how to make bombs and how to buy guns encouraged and created more violence. And it made me think of a useful parallel, which I just heard Senator LEVIN mention earlier today about his community in Detroit, MI, and I have mentioned in mine in Buffalo and western New York. Both those communities are right across the border from Canada. In both those communities, there is something startling. There is the same culture, same video games, same movies, and they get the same TV stations. People in Windsor, ON, watch the same TV as people in Detroit. People across the Niagara River in Canada, in Fort Erie, watch the same TV as the people in Buffalo and Niagara Falls. 
   Why are we so much more violent? It is not culture or violence. It is the same in each. It is not really the idea that we have two parents working and single moms and single dads, fewer parents around, less parental responsibility. That is the same in each. It is not the isolation that young adolescents often feel. That is the same in each. What is the difference between the situation in Canada and the situation in America? 
   The one difference is the gun laws, where Canada's are much tougher than ours. 
   It seems to me that if we go through this package--and we certainly should consider other issues--but we ignore or short circuit, truncate, a debate on gun violence, we will be making a serious mistake. 
   I heard one of my friends say this is political. Well, it is no more political to me than talking about Hollywood might be to some others in this. I believe this would make a huge difference. 
   I thank the Senator from Vermont. He has put together a package of gun amendments that just about everybody in our caucus could support. I am glad he did. I think they will make a difference. A group of us have been meeting, those of us who believe in tougher laws on guns, although we tried to be very mindful of the law-abiding rights of citizens, of gun-owning citizens. We have put together a package of 10 amendments. Each of them meets two criteria: One, that they would do some good; two, that they have a chance of passing, that they are not going to get 25 or 30 votes from people who agree with my position but, rather, that they would be able to garner much greater support. 
   I say to the majority leader and to my chairman, the Senator from Utah, we do not want to speak on these amendments forever. We do want the opportunity to debate them and to discuss them and to vote on them, because we think some of them have a real chance of passage. 
   I say to my colleagues that I am appreciative of this opportunity. I know the issue of guns is not the only answer, but it seems to me, because there is a culture of violence, because parents are working, and because adolescents are young and often feel isolated, that none of those gainsay the need for better laws on guns. 
   As I say, our package is moderate. It is careful. We have not put everything on the floor. Many times I would like to, because I would go further than this body would. 
   But I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues. I believe we will do it in a careful, respectful and bipartisan way. Our goal is not to have a Democratic v. Republican division. Our goal is to pass legislation, and if we can do that in a bipartisan and nonrancorous way, I think we will have served America well. 
   I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont for yielding their time. I look forward to their debate. 
   I simply ask the majority leader to make sure, provided we are willing to live within the time limits, that we have the time to discuss these 10 amendments--there may be others--and to discuss them, perhaps pass them, and finally do something real about the Littletons that have plagued our Nation over the last year. 
   I thank the President.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the chairman from Texas accepting the amendment, which he has told me he will do, and I believe he mentioned it on the floor. 
   This important amendment involves, very simply, disclosure on ATM machines of fees. As many may know, on April 1, 1996, Visa and MasterCard, which run the largest ATM networks in the United States, ended their prohibition against surcharging ATM users. Before that, there could not be a second surcharge. This fee was in addition to any fee already imposed on a transaction from other bank customer withdrawals. 
   Three years later, 93 percent of all banks are imposing ATM surcharges on customers. That is 31 percent more than last year. The bigger the bank, the more likely they are to surcharge and at a higher rate. What this means is, if you have a BankAmerica card and you go to a Bank One machine, you will pay two fees, one to the Bank One machine--which everyone expects to pay--and the other to the BankAmerica card. People are paying two fees. It is very difficult to figure out what they are. 
   When the banks first started charging these fees, many of them didn't bother to tell their customers they would be charged. They had to figure it out by looking at the monthly statement. For anyone who has looked at their monthly bank statements and all the fine print, it is clear that the fees were not transparent. So, unsurprisingly, there was an outcry. I took to the House floor, when I was in that body, to show that banks were not disclosing these fees. I remember surveying the banks in New York City and finding out they were not disclosing them.  
   So what we are proposing to do here is to rectify that wrong. This amendment is in the great traditions of ADAM SMITH, pure capitalism. Some have said we ought to eliminate the fees. Some have said we ought to cap the fees. My view is to let the free market prevail. Let people see what the fee is before they enter into the transaction and then they can make a decision. That is the way it ought to work in capitalism, in free market enterprise. So that is what this amendment does. 
   Last year, a record $124 billion was generated in all-fee income. That is up 18 percent in 1 year from banks. The fees are going up. This amendment will not take away a penny of that, except from knowing consumers who decide not to enter into this transaction. We must do this. Awhile ago we forewent this amendment because most banks promised they were not going to impose surcharges, and to their credit for a few years they did not. But now they all do. It is time we have disclosure so when they say that they will always disclose, because some do it voluntarily, I simply say, ``trust but verify.'' 
   This is a simple, straightforward, reasonable, balanced amendment. I hope it will pass without hesitation. 
   Mr. President, I yield my time. Is someone available to just accept it?

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the President, and I thank both my colleague from Michigan and my colleague from Texas, the chairman, for their work. 
   It is a very important amendment. In fact, if this amendment had not been adopted, we might have seen the virtual unraveling of the strong framework of securities law that we have built up in this country since the 1940s. 
   When I see my friends on Wall Street sometimes complaining about the SEC--and they can be very, very strict and sometimes hardheaded on specific issues--I remind them that in the general framework of regulation, a tough and strong disclosure has made our securities markets the strongest in the world. It is the reason that billions of dollars come from overseas to the United States, because they know basically that our markets are on the level. 
   This bill, while in the report language said that we wish to have what is called ``functional regulation,'' that is, having the correct regulator for the type of function, not by the type of institutions, and therefore if a bank gets securities regulation it would be regulated by the SEC, just as if a securities firm did securities regulation it would be regulated by the SEC. It is a fundamental principle, particularly if this bill becomes law, which, if we change CRA, I hope it will. 
   It means very simply that if you underwrite securities, if you sell a security, you must abide by the SEC strict disclosure. The banking regulators have never been very good at this type of regulation, and weren't intended to be. 
   The securities regulators--the SEC--have always been the tough guy who is an adversarial regulator. The banking regulators have always been a friendly regulator, sort of akin to a big brother making sure the banks didn't get too far into trouble--for two good reasons: One, the banking industry had Federal insurance, and we had to protect that investment; and, two, the banks were engaged traditionally in not very risky activity. 
   The securities markets have no Federal insurance. They are raw capitalism, and they have had risky activities. Therefore, you really need full disclosure. 
   The amendment which the Senator from Michigan has put forward, which I am proud to cosponsor, is a very simple one. It says keep that functional regulation. 
   Let me explain to my colleagues just in a brief minute, because I know we all want to hurry, what would have happened if this amendment had not been adopted. 
   First, the whole regulation--the whole SEC regimentation of regulation--would not have been applied to banks as they entered the securities industry, and they will enter it massively. 
   Then securities firms, being put at an unfair competitive disadvantage because their banks would not be regulated, would start having their securities activity occur under a bank holding company. 
   The entire structure of regulation which has worked so well--and every person on Wall Street I know admits it; it is tough, it is strong, but it keeps our markets on the level--would have unraveled. This bill in effect had a Trojan horse. 
   The amendment being proposed by the Senator from Michigan and myself closes that door. We will have to work out the language in conference, but I for one, if I am lucky enough to be a conferee, or even if I am not, I am going to work very hard to see whatever loopholes are placed in there are very narrow and very limited. 
   I know the hour is late but this amendment may be the most important amendment we are adding to the entire bill. It keeps the structure of functional regulation there. It has securities-type activities, wherever they be done, be regulated by the SEC. It is a system that has worked. We should not undo it right now as our capital markets are enjoying the tremendous success they have. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from Maryland, as well as the Senators from Alabama and Texas for their courtesy here this evening. 
   I also thank Senator SARBANES for his indefatigable efforts to defend the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   And I'd like to thank my Democratic colleagues as well as Secretary Rubin for their strong commitment to CRA. 
   In 1977 when CRA was enacted, the thinking was that banks--though privately owned--receive public benefits in the form of deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and payments system. 
   And in return, they would have an obligation to ``serve the convenience and needs'' of their communities. 
   Over 20 years later, banks still CRA as an obligation--but as an obligation that a minimum they can live with--and in many cases, that they endorse. 
   Does CRA work? 
   The answer has been a resounding yes. 
   Since its enactment, CRA has resulted in $1 trillion of investments in underserved communities. It's been a driving force for community economic development; one of the best ways to bring people together, to bring poor people and people of color upward, which we all want to do. 
   It's also driven a 30 percent increase in home ownership among low-income families since 1990, making the American Dream of home ownership a more commonplace reality for our minority communities. 
   And in 1997, large banks and thrifts made approximately 525,000 small business loans totaling $34 billion to entrepreneurs located in low and moderate communities. 
   CRA works. 
   And we know it works because banks who have never been shy in fighting what they view as burdensome or intrusive Federal regulation are not pushing to repeal CRA or even to roll it back. 
   In fact, they're supporting it. Every major bank in my State has contacted me in favor of CRA. 
   Some have been honest enough to admit that because of CRA they are reaching out to communities that they would not otherwise have served. 
   And they're serving them profitably. 
   Hugh McColl, Jr., Chairman and CEO of BankAmerica Corp., stated earlier this year; ``My company supports the Community Reinvestment Act in spirit and in fact. To be candid, we have gone way beyond its requirements *.*.*. We're quite happy living with the existing rules.''

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of the financial services legislation now before us. Like many of my colleagues, Mr. President, this marks my 19th year of trying to improve financial services. We haven't done much in 19 years, but I am hoping this 20th year is the charm. 
   Today, however, regrettably I have a few doubts. As much as anyone in the Senate, I want to see modernization pass, and I want to see it pass now. The bill is critical to the vitality of New York's economy. New York City is the financial capital of the world.  
   As I have said time and time again, financial modernization legislation is critical to ensuring that our financial institutions are competitive at home and abroad. Because of the entrepreneurialness of America, particularly in financial services, we dominate the world. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are employed in every one of the 50 great States because of our dominance in this area. And even as things that have happened in America spread to Europe and Asia, it is more and more American companies that are taking the lead and doing them. That is because we are technologically, entrepreneurially, and in innovation ahead of just about every other country in the world in financial services. So today we are the financial capital. We are the leaders. But we may not be tomorrow. Our superiority is not some historical inevitability. We need to compete in order to win. And we cannot compete in the present context of the laws. 
   Mr. President, when I came to the Congress in 1981, I was strongly supportive of the Glass-Steagall law. It seemed to me very simple--that while my inclination would be to allow financial institutions to do whatever they chose, they should not take part in risky activities with insured dollars. In those days, many of the banking institutions in the country wanted to use their insured dollars for the riskiest of activities. Some of us, even back in the early eighties, warned against it, and we were like voices against the wind. 
   I will never forget an amendment of the Banking Committee in the House, sponsored by the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Roemer, and myself, that said no S&L, for instance, could use insured dollars for equity investments in real estate. It lost by one vote. Had it passed, America would have saved $200 billion. 
   But as a result of the awful S&L crisis, we were able to come closer together on financial services. One of the great ironies is that in the early eighties, when many had said let everybody do everything, even with insured dollars, and they deadlocked with those of us who felt--some felt that each institution should be pigeon-holed, but others felt don't pigeon-hole institutions but pigeon-hole insured dollars and make sure they only go to low-risk types of activities. But the S&L crisis allowed us to come together because everyone realized that insured dollars should not be used for risky activities. 
   And so in the early and middle nineties, legislation was crafted that allowed institutions to underwrite, sell, and even be agents for all varieties of financial services, but that successfully walled off insured dollars from the rest. This is good legislation. And so in the last few years, I--who was 
   regarded, I guess, as one of the leading opponents of modernization--became an advocate. I was proud to support the modernization bill that reached the floor of the House last year. In fact, I persuaded a good number of my New York colleagues to support it and it passed by one vote. 
   We found a good model, Mr. President; we ought to stick with it. There was balance in that model. There was bipartisanship in that model. It worked. Yet, we come here to the floor of the Senate today, with financial services at risk. They are at risk because even though we had a plan that had almost everyone's support, that is not the bill coming to the floor today. 
   One of the main sticking points is CRA. CRA is supported by most of the financial institutions in my State, while those who seek to lift CRA say that it is a terrible burden for the financial institutions. I seem to hear that more from some of my colleagues in the Senate than from the institutions that it is supposed to help. In fact, if you surveyed the major banks and major insurance companies and major securities firms in my State of New York, almost every one would say they were happy to support last year's H.R. 10 and would be happy to support it again this year. 
   They realize that CRA has been an important tool for building communities across America. It has been at work in my State, whether it be in the inner city, which in the past was starved for capital, or whether it be in rural areas, also starved for capital. Individuals, homeowners, small builders, small business people, from the Adirondack Mountains and from the South Bronx, have come and said, ``Senator, make sure we keep CRA.'' 
   The amazing thing is that CRA has worked. While in the past financial institutions, banks, would write off whole areas because it was hard to find the good loans, the economical loans, CRA forced them to go in and now they find they are making money by lending money in rural areas and inner-city areas. So it works. All of a sudden, we see that these provisions, widely accepted by the industry, widely accepted in a bipartisan measure in the House this year, accepted last year by the Senate Banking Committee by a 16-2 vote margin, are ready to scuttle the whole bill. 
   Let me say this: I fear that the Community Reinvestment Act provisions in the bill before us would doom modernization's failure once again, 
   doom modernization to partisanship, doom modernization to a Presidential veto. It cannot and should not be the monkey wrench that grinds modernization to a halt. CRA or removing CRA should not be the monkey wrench that grinds modernization to a halt. 
   I greatly respect the views of our chairman. He is a towering intellect--somebody I joust with on many occasions and have always done it in a respectful way so that we each enjoyed it and went away shaking hands. 
   I say to my chairman that I understand his strongly held views. But if you believe that financial modernization is important, given the consensus that CRA has built through most parts of this country and among most Members of both parties--the House, for instance, passed a bill with a similar CRA provision as the Sarbanes substitute by a 51 to 8 margin--I ask the chairman to reexamine it, and again not have his strong feelings about CRA be the monkey wrench that undoes the whole financial services construct. 
   Strangely enough, it is not the passions of the many in the House but rather the passions of the few in the Senate that are causing us problems today. This is a reversal of what has usually happened. 
   The bill's provisions that undermine CRA will clearly cause a Presidential veto. It caused all of the Democrats on the committee to vote against the bill. 
   One thing we have learned in financial services in this long, tortuous, and sad history is that unless we have bipartisan support, a bill such as this with so many conflicting interests will fail. It is my hope we can today move this bill forward by setting aside partisanship and confrontation and replacing it with pragmatism and compromise. 
   There are certain provisions in the Democratic substitute that I don't particularly like. I am giving serious thought to the affiliate op-sub issue. In the past I have strongly been for the affiliates for the same Glass-Steagall reasons I mentioned before. I talked to the Secretary of the Treasury, who feels strongly on the other side, and he has modified the bill to meet some of the objections I have. But I don't want to let my views on that issue hold up the bill. 
   It is my hope similarly with CRA that we will act with dispatch. It is my hope that the Senate will adopt the CRA provisions of the Democratic substitute and we can move this bill forward to conference assured that we have created a bill that has sufficient support to pass the Senate on a bipartisan basis, assured that we have created a bill that will finally, after 20 years, be signed into law. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I recently ran for the Senate. One of the main reasons I ran was the ability of Members to amend bills. I have always admired the Senate for this. The House has become nasty and partisan. It has basically shut down. 
   I want to thank the minority leader for voicing the frustration that so many Members have. During the impeachment proceeding, we worked together. Since then, it seems to me that comity is gone. There is no ability for Members on either side of the aisle who have ideas to offer them. We may lose them. 
   The frustration that so many felt in the wake of Littleton--we had ideas which we thought wouldn't solve the problem but might ameliorate or reduce the chances of future Littletons--of not being able to offer those amendments was enormous. 
   Has the process thus far this year evolved so we are virtually no different from the House?

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to close what I believe is a major loophole in our federal gun laws--a loophole which permits 18-20 year-olds to possess handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. 
   Firearms trace data collected as part of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) paint a disturbing picture of crime gun activity by persons under 21. In the most recent YCGII Trace Analysis Report, the age of the possessor was known for 32,653, or 42.8 percent, of the 72,260 crime guns traced. Of these 32,563 guns, approximately 4,840, or 14.8 percent, were recovered from 18-20 year-olds. Indeed, the most frequent age of crime gun possession was 19 years of age, and the second most frequent was 18 years of age. 
   At the same time, according to the 1997 Uniform Crime Reports, the most frequent age arrested for murder was 18 years of age, and the second most frequent was 19 years of age. Those aged 18-20 accounted for 22 percent of all arrest for murder in 1997. 
   There are indications that the 18-year old girlfriend of one of the two gunmen involved in the tragic Littleton, Colorado school shooting purchased at least two of the firearms used in the attack. Handgun possession by persons 18 or over is not forbidden by Colorado law. 
   The 1968 Gun Control Act prevents federally licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to anyone under the age of 21. This ban does not apply to sales of handguns by unlicensed persons, however. Federal law only stops such persons from selling handguns to anyone under the age of 18--thus neglecting to ban sales to the 18-20 year-olds who account for such a significant portion of crime gun traces and murders. In another inexplicable oversight, federal law also fails to ban private sales of semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition feeding devices to persons even under the age of 18. 
   My bill would correct these flaws in our federal gun laws. It would ban sales by unlicensed individuals of handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, and large capacity ammunition feeding divides to persons under the age of 21. Indeed, it would ban possession of these deadly weapons by persons under 21, with exceptions made for young persons who are members of the Armed Forces or National Guard or use these firearms in self-defense against an intruder to their residences.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with 35 of my fellow Senators to introduce legislation to re-authorize the Northeast Dairy Compact and extend it to New York State. This legislation is vital to the Northeast Region and it will strengthen the economy of upstate New York. 
   The Compact may add a couple of cents to the consumer price of milk during months when the retail price of milk falls below a federally set minimum price, but it is a small price to pay to preserve the family dairy farm in rural New York. 
   The purpose of the Compact is to stabilize dairy prices and therefore enable small dairy farmers to budget their expenditures and plan for the future. The Northeastern Dairy Compact works by ensuring a minimum retail price for milk producers. The price paid to farmers for milk has fallen from $2.77 in 1960 to $1.36 in 1997. These low milk prices have forced many small farmers into insolvency over the years and have put the entire concept of family farms in peril. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact will preserve the American tradition of local family farms in every region. I believe that this is a tiny price to pay to keep local farmers in business, and keep New York State's rural identity intact.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me commend the Senator from Vermont for his remarks. As always, they are considered and thoughtful and right to the point. His career and legislation has been just the same way. I consider myself, as always, privileged to be here to listen to his remarks. I thank the Senator. I also thank the Senator from Maine for her courtesy, allowing me to make these brief remarks before she makes hers. 
   Mr. President, as we remain transfixed and horrified by the images of Littleton, as we listen to the stories of the survivors and hear the sobs of the families of the victims, we can feel that America is looking to Congress to do something to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of kids. This morning I watched television as did millions of Americans. My eyes filled with tears, listening to the families of the students talk about their ideal, and to hear them ask what can be done. Since time began, there have been troubled teenagers. We have always sought to help them through their families, through spiritual leadership, through schools. That is nothing new. But what is new today is that it is far too easy for a disturbed young person to get his hands on a gun or a bomb and channel his anger into carnage. 
   Mr. President, 25 years ago all an angry, troubled teenager had was his fists. Scores of students were not killed when that troubled boy vented his rage. Today we live in a different world. It is no coincidence that the tragedies that we have heard and read about throughout the last year did not occur 10, 15, and 20 years ago with this kind of horror, with this kind of frequency. 
   In Littleton, we do not know how these two teenagers managed to get their guns. We don't know if they took the guns from their parents or stole them from a neighbor. We don't know if they bought them at a gun show or if they bought their guns off the Internet, although certainly they were immersed in a computer fantasy world, and there are dozens of web sites that offer guns to anyone, anywhere, no questions asked. 
   We know that gun control alone is not the only solution. We need better counseling in the schools. We have to be more vigilant at identifying and condemning hate groups in schools. But, my colleagues, let us not kid ourselves. It is not possible to confront the epidemic of violence in our schools without dealing with guns. 
   Yesterday there was a shift in the gun debate that I have never seen before in my career in Congress, and it gives me a glimmer of hope that maybe we can do something to make schools safer. Yesterday, pro-gun lawmakers of Colorado, Florida, and Illinois each withdrew their legislation which would have made it easier for people in those States to buy and/or carry firearms. 
   They did it because of Littleton. They did it because they know that the  easy availability of guns is part of the problem. They put a stop to their own legislation. 
   Yesterday, the National Rifle Association scaled back its annual convention, which is to be held in 2 weeks. It will not admit it, but the NRA did it because of Littleton. It will not admit that it is simple common sense that rational gun control equals fewer Littletons, but in its collective heart, the NRA knows that that is true. 
   So in a small but significant way, the NRA has changed. Now we have to change. Congress has to wake up. America's mothers and fathers are looking to us. To my Democratic and Republican colleagues, many of whom have traditionally opposed gun restrictions, we can pass reasonable, targeted, measured laws that make guns safer and keep them away from kids but still respect people's right to bear arms. 
   I would like to mention several of these modest measures, measures that will make a great deal of difference and have little or no impact on the people in your State who hunt, who target shoot, who own guns for sport, collection, or protection. 
   We should pass the parts of either the Kennedy or the Durbin legislation which require adults to safely store their handguns and rifles in their homes. Nearly every day, some kid takes their parent's gun and does something horrible with it. Why? Because half the families who own guns do not lock them away or leave the gun unloaded. We can change that, and we should change that. No one will be harmed, and no one will be inconvenienced. 
   We have to ban the unlicensed sale of guns on the Internet. It is numbing what a kid can buy simply by going on line and searching gun web sites--handguns, semiautomatic weapons, ammunition feeders; everything is available with no questions asked. This morning, a parent came up to me and said he asked his son how kids get guns. His son answered, without a blink of the eye: ``On the Internet.'' 
   I have a bill which will stop that. It will have no effect on law-abiding gun owners or licensed gun dealers. Ask yourself: Who needs to buy a gun with no questions asked? The answer is only two groups--kids and criminals. Let's pass this bill. 
   We should also bring public and private dollars together to develop smart guns. These are guns which contain a device that permits only the owner to fire the weapon. Imagine a gun that is useless when it is stolen, taken without authorization, or sold on the black market. It can be done. The technology is available. I will talk more in the next week about ways we can bring gun makers and the military together to develop a gun that is safe. This could transform the gun industry and make us all rest easier. 
   Finally, and in the meantime, let's make a strong, secure trigger-lock requirement on all guns. Every car has a seat belt; every gun should have a lock. 
   Mr. President, each of these measures will make schools, homes, and neighborhoods safer without denying a single law-abiding citizen the right to buy the gun of their choice. How can anyone oppose that? 
   In conclusion, every time we tune in and see another group of innocent children fleeing from school, we pray that it will be the last time. We can help make our prayers come true. America is waiting for us to do what is right and necessary to keep guns out of the hands of kids. Let's not let them down. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Walter H. Weiner on his retirement from Republic National Bank of New York and Republic New York Corporation. Mr. Weiner has served Republic New York Corporation with acclaimed leadership as Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 1980 to April 21, 1999, as President from January 1, 1980 to July 26, 1983 and as Chairman of the Board from July 23, 1983 to April 21, 1999; also, Mr. Weiner has served Republic National Bank with excellence and distinction as Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 1980 to April 21, 1999, as President from April 22, 1981 to April 16, 1986 and as Chairman of the Board from April 16, 1986 to April 21, 1999. 
   Mr. Weiner has been a wise and trusted colleague, adviser and friend to the directors, officers, and employees of the Corporation and of the Bank. I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to him for his active and vital participation in the Bank's affairs and for his loyal support of its business philosophy and corporate purposes. 
   Mr. Weiner's skill and wisdom have been a great asset to his colleagues. His dynamic and expert service has contributed to both the Bank and Corporation immeasurably. The great success achieved by the Corporation and by the Bank have been in large measure due to the excellent leadership, generosity of spirit and untiring devotion that Mr. Weiner has brought to his more than nineteen years of dedicated service as Chief Executive Officer of these organizations. I have no doubt that he will continue to offer guidance and valuable contributions to the Corporation and the Bank as a member of the Boards of Directors.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. President, this afternoon we are talking about education legislation. 
   Today, all of our thoughts and prayers go to one school in Littleton, CO. Yesterday's massacre is all too familiar. It is America's recurring nightmare. It leaves us shocked and numb. It takes away our innocence. It makes children afraid to go to school. 
   This morning I had breakfast with my daughters. I do that every day before they go off to the schoolbus. Usually, it is routine, but today the conversation was a little different, both for me and for my girls. 
   Yesterday, as we sat transfixed to our television sets praying for those caught in the crossfire and hoping for an explanation of the carnage, we heard the same phrases that we heard in Pearl, in Springfield, in Jonesboro and Paducah. 
   ``This is a quiet town.'' 
   ``Nothing like this happens here.'' 
   ``We do not have crime problems in this town.'' 
   ``It didn't seem real.'' 
   ``This is a good school.'' 
   ``Could it have been prevented?'' 
   ``How could someone be so distraught to murder, and, yet, no one in authority knew?'' 
   ``How did they get a gun?'' 
   ``What can we do?'' 
   The same words each time. 
   Each time there is a new tragedy, we act as if this will be the last in a list of school shootings. But it is not the last. 
   As sad and as horrible as it seems, this will definitely not be the last time we tune in to our television sets to see children fleeing from their schools. 
   I have taken to the floor today to ask that we in Congress make a concerted and comprehensive attempt to address school shootings. I want, today, to list some ideas, many of which have already been discussed, some of which haven't, which I hope we can agree to work on and come up with some solutions that may make a difference. We have counselled teenagers since time began who have struggled with personal and psychological problems. The difference today is that through computers, fantasy worlds, lethal guns, and explosives, the damage that a disturbed boy can do today is 1,000 times worse than it was when we were kids. Some schools are very good at counseling. Most are not. We need to help schools get better at counseling. 
   We need the Federal Government to help share information among schools so that good schools can teach those schools that do not do very well how to do it. There are too many young boys and girls with troubles and too few well-trained people to handle them. 
   Second, the people who best knew that there were troubled kids in Columbine High were the students at the school. 
   Students need to be encouraged to confidentially identify for the school psychologists and counselors those in the school who are exhibiting dangerous behavior and who need help. It is usually not the nature of a teenager to approach an authority figure to say someone in class is doing something strange. But it is not impossible to change that. If they know they are helping someone, kids will answer the call. 
   Then there is the issue of hate groups. It is shocking that a large number of students in Littleton knew that yesterday was Hitler's birthday. That is because this group of so-called Goths idealize and proselytize about Hitler. But school authorities had no idea that there were those who worship Hitler in the school. 
   We have to identify and we have to exchange information about hate groups and be far more vigilant in condemning these activities. Principals, teachers, and students must be encouraged to speak out. We have to get hate, white supremacy, and guns out of the schools. We don't know yet how these youths got their weapons. Did they take them from their parents? Did they steal them from a neighbor? Did they buy them off the Internet? Did they get them at a gun show or store? 
   We must accept that any solution has to involve a change in gun laws. A teenager can only do so much damage with his fists. There have always been troubled teenagers. All of a sudden they seem to have the ability to do so much more damage. We can work on trying to change teenagers. We should also work on making sure that the instrumentalities of death and destruction cannot end up in their hands. 
   We have to close off loopholes that allow kids to get a gun. We should ban unlicensed Internet sales. We should pass Senator KENNEDY's child access prevention law. The House should pass Congresswoman MCCARTHY's comprehensive legislation. We need the  President to help us, to lead us in passing this type of legislation. We should also begin an effort in the public and private sectors to invest research money in ``smart'' guns that cannot be used by anyone other than the owner. This is an area where the military and the private sector can come together 
   and do a lot of good. I will be talking more about that later in the week. 
   Mr. President, it is not enough to wring our hands and pray it won't happen again. We need to act. Let's resolve to work together to do what is necessary to protect our children. Let us focus on better counseling, condemnation of hate groups within the school, encouraging students to come forward, and much better laws preventing kids from getting guns. 
   We are all in mourning today. When the tears are dry, let's not pretend that this won't happen again.

   Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his comments. There are a lot of initiatives. The Senator from Illinois himself has been a leader in this area. There are many things we can do. 
   In this specific instance, we don't know where the guns came from. They may have come from gun shows. Gun shows are open markets where virtually anyone can buy a gun. They may have even been bought off the Internet. There are almost no rules for controlling gun sales on the Internet. 
   We also can proceed with trigger locks and much stronger legislation in terms of making schools gun free. 
   These are things we can come together on. I think they are things that most experts agree would not eliminate the chance for this occurring but greatly reduce it. 
   I look forward to working with the Senator and all Members of this body to do something about this. It is just awful when you see the pictures. Everyone is moved to try to do something to prevent it.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Cassadaga Job Corps in Cassadaga, New York, which was recently rated the nation's top job center. The center's director, Andrew Carpenter, and his staff have earned top billing for overall training and job placement performance. In addition to winning national and county recognition, the Cassadaga Job Corps' achievements have also set state records. 
   Over the past four years, time and money has been invested in upgrading Cassadaga Job Corps facilities, including construction of an academic and training center which opened in 1997. Upcoming projects include dormitory renovations and construction, development of a waste water plant, and remodeling of the nursing education complex. 
   I would like to express my congratulations to the Cassadaga Job Corps' 120 staffers and 255 students who have earned the privilege of being named the best job training center in the nation, and my thanks to them for their hard work and dedication.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, like many New Yorkers, I have spent a great deal of time in the aftermath of the Amadou Diallo killing reflecting about our city, our police, our country, and our people. 
   During my career, I think I have been considered a friend of both law enforcement and the minority community. But I have always been troubled by the rift between minorities and the police. And I have always felt that this rift has caused pain and harm to both communities. 
   There are men, women and children, black and white, alive today because of the work of the New York City Police Department--their fine work. New Yorkers are proud of that fact. Most cops are decent, honorable, and hardworking--and it is wrong to judge all cops by the actions of the bad few. 
   But what we all must realize is that the momentous drop in crime and the model behavior of many officers does not undo the plain truth that black men and women in New York City who have never broken the law and who should have absolutely no reason to fear law enforcement, are all too often hassled and made to feel like lawbreakers, and that it is different for minorities than for the average white person in the city. 
   Many whites seem to feel that widespread frisking and patting down is a small price to pay for a steep reduction in crime. But most white people have never been frisked and have no conception of how pervasive the practice is. 
   But if you talk to black stockbrokers on Wall Street and black lawyers downtown--people who wear a suit and a tie every day--to a person they have a story of being stopped, frisked, and harassed by a police officer. 
   If you talk to minority co-workers or attend services at African American churches and ask the men and women from the congregation about their interaction with the police--they talk about how they or their law-abiding children were stopped, questioned and searched by the police. 
   And they will tell you, as they have said to me, that they know this doesn't happen as often to white people. They know that white people are treated differently. 
   All people, black and white, want very much for their neighborhoods to  be safe and to feel confident that when they send their children or grandchildren to the corner store for a carton of milk they will come home safely. But in addition to these feelings, minorities are humiliated and angered by the indignity of being treated all too often as presumptive criminals. 
   And if you take the time to listen, the views of minorities about the relationship they want to have with the police can be summed up in five words: ``Protect me, and respect me.'' 
   This poem was left on the shallow doorway where Amidou Diallo was killed: 
 When you look at me what do you see; Am I innocent until proven guilty; Am I your enemy; Or were you sent here to protect me.  
   Protect me and respect me. 
   Whatever facts emerge from the killing of Amidou Diallo, or for that matter, the killing of a Syracuse man, Johnny Gammage, by the Pittsburgh police--whether it is guilty, not guilty, suspension, or removal--our society must deal with the underlying problem of race and law enforcement. 
   There has been a great deal of rhetoric and anger in the aftermath of the Diallo shooting, I can understand why. But I wish to take a different approach. 
   I offer today, what I believe are constructive solutions that transcend any one set of circumstances and will allow both the ``protect me and respect me'' parts of the equation to coexist and even flourish. 
   First, for the sake of the city and for the sake of the police force, the NYPD must immediately put in place a system that more quickly gets bad cops off the street. 
   It was well known among police, for example, that Justin Volpe, one of the cops who turtured Abner Louima was a bad, bad seed with multiple complaints against him. It was well known that officer Francis Livoti was a ticking time bomb for years before he strangled Anthony Baez in 1994. 
   The force knew it and did nothing about it. That attitude of silence, protecting your own, sweeping problems under the rug has got to end, not only for the sake of future victims, but for the police department itself. 
   The tens of thousands of good, honest, hardworking officers pay a price when the Volpes are not removed. For that reason, it is in their interest to end any policy of silence. 
   The mayor, the police chief, police union leaders, community leaders and church leaders should all urge police officers to come forward when there is a bad element on the force. It should be an honorable action, not a shameful action, to come forward. 
   Second, minority recruitment at the NYPD must improve. The force is more than two-thirds white; the city is nearly three-fifths minority. 
   When mostly white cops patrol high-density, minority neighborhoods resentment is bound to follow. 
   The city should at last fully fund the Cadet Corps to recruit qualified, college educated minority applicants through the City University. The program is on the books, but until this crisis was basically ignored. 
   Also, the city should take advantage of a program created last year by Reverend Johnny Ray Youngblood and me to recruit and train young minority applicants through the churches and to help them become police officers who will patrol the neighborhood from where they came. 
   Next, beyond minority recruitment, New York City should look to what works in other places. 
   Two efforts stand out: Boston's Ten-Point Coalition and the military's Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute. 
   Boston had the same problems as New York: a rift between police and the African-American community; several high profile incidents of abuse by certain officers; and clergy that took on the role of police critics. 
   Their hatred exploded into the open with the stabbing death of Carol Stuart, a pregnant white woman. The husband, Charles Stuart, told police that a black man committed the crime. 
   The Boston Police hit the streets in full force. They stopped and searched every black male that fit the general description. The neighborhood residents complained about the tactics, but the crime was so horrible no one listened. 
   They arrested William Bennett, a black man. Carol Stuart's husband, it was learned months later, was the killer. Bennett was innocent. 
   And Boston was on the verge of a meltdown. 
   With no place else to go, the police and the clergy agreed to stop fighting and to sit down to develop a plan to stop crime on the one hand, and preserve dignity on the other. 
   They initiated a five-point contract. 
   The heart of it was this: The ministers and respected community leaders agreed to help identify those in the neighborhood who were the real troublemakers. They took the responsibility of telling the police who was dealing drugs and committing violent crime. 
   The flip side is that when ministers and community leaders took responsibility and identified the troublemakers, others were left alone. And because most crime in each neighborhood is caused by just a few people, the use of the standard stop in frisk procedure that the community found so oppressive greatly diminished. 
   If an officer is abusive or disrespectful, ministers and community leaders have an open line to the police. If the police did not act, or if they refused to address the problem, the ministers and community leaders were free to go to the media. 
   The plan worked. The crime rate in Boston has dropped even faster than in New York. Serious youth crime is almost non-existent. And the important but difficult relationship between police and the minority community is vastly improved. 
   Last month in the Bronx, 100 members of the clergy met in the office of the Bronx Borough President and said they have always wanted to work with the police. They said, ``We could be a resource. But they're not using us. The police don't even know us. They don't come and talk to us.'' 
   The Boston model will work in New York and we should move quickly to implement it here. 
   The military--and our prayers are with the American soldiers fighting over Kosovo--has also found a way to confront bigotry while increasing effectiveness. 
   The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, developed in the early 1970s to confront segregation and racial hostility among soldiers in Vietnam, is one of the reasons that the armed forces is the most integrated institution in America. 
   The military learned that unless bigotry was ended in the armed forces, America could not have an effective military. So by necessity they developed a program that lasts to this day. 
   Officers and supervisors take a course to confront their own stereotypes and to identify problems within their unit. They have a simple goal: change people's behavior. The rule is that if you've got a problem with race, it better not show up in your words or actions. 
   The thrust of the program is this: DEOMI, as it is called, continuously surveys enlisted soldiers and officers about race relations on their base. The results are made known only to the commanding officer and to people at DEOMI. When there is a problem on a base, a mobile team of trainers moves in to solve it. 
   The model has been so successful that DEOMI has signed contracts to work with police organizations. New York City should sign a contract as soon as possible. 
   In conclusion, this has been one of the most trying and emotional times in New York in years. We are a city, right now, divided. No good has ever come from divisiveness. No job was ever created. No street made safer. No school made better by pulling ourselves apart. 
   I worry about two things: 
   First, is that division in ours, the most diverse city on earth, has the potential to pull us down. 
   Second, failure to deal with this problem will ultimately weaken our efforts to fight crime and perhaps, forfeit the gains we made in crime reduction. That is unacceptable and unnecessary given that options abound if we choose them. 
   New York City is undoubtedly a safer place in every neighborhood from the far end of the Bronx to the tip of the Rockaways. But it is not necessarily a better place for every neighborhood. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King taught us that ``we are tied together in the single garment of destiny, caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. And  whatever affects one directly affects all directly.'' 
   The killing of Amdiou Diallo; the killing of Johnny Gammage affects us all directly. 
   We all love our city. Let's each side--as hard as it is to do--put aside our frustration and distrust so we can move past confrontation and collaborate constructively on solutions that protect and respect. 
   I again thank the Chairman and my colleagues for their consideration and I yield the floor.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator MOYNIHAN to offer an amendment to strike Section 314 of S. Con. Res. 20, the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Resolution. Section 314 expresses the Sense of the Senate that Governors Island will be sold during Fiscal Year 2000. 
   While the intention of the sale, to provide an offset for crop insurance reform, is a worthy one, it is an illusory offset and will seriously undermine New York's efforts to turn this historic gem into an economically viable site. It is also a matter of fundamental fairness--President Clinton made the offer to Senator MOYNIHAN to give the Island back to New York for one dollar--the very sum the Federal Government paid to the State for the Island back in 1958. Now that the Island's last tenant, the U.S. Coast Guard has gone, Governors Island should be returned to New York, not sold to provide offsets for other programs across the country, however well-intentioned those programs might be. 
   I thank Senator DOMENICI and Senator LAUTENBERG for their willingness to accept the amendment Senator MOYNIHAN and I have offered. We will continue to strongly resist all attempts to thwart New York's efforts to develop Governors island for use by our own citizens, who are understandably anxious to reclaim this unique treasure.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator GRASSLEY in introducing this legislation to permit federal trials and appellate proceedings to be televised, at the discretion of the presiding judge. 
   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger once said of the U.S. Supreme Court, ``A court which is final and unreviewable needs more careful scrutiny than any other. Unreviewable power is the most likely to indulge itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate self-analysis . . . In a country like ours, no public institution, or the people who operate it, can be above public debate.'' 
   I believe that these words are applicable to the entire federal judiciary. As such, I strongly support giving federal judges discretion to televise the proceedings over which they preside. When the people of this nation watch their government in action, they come to understand how our governing institutions work and equip themselves to hold those institutions accountable for their deeds. If there are flaws in our governing institutions--including our courts--we hide them only at our peril. 
   The federal courts are lagging behind the state courts on the issue of televising court proceedings. Indeed, 48 out of the 50 states allow cameras in their courtrooms in at least some cases. Moreover, a two-and-a-half year pilot program in which cameras were routinely permitted in six federal district courts and two courts of appeals revealed near universal support for cameras in the courtroom. 
   Our bill would simply afford federal trial and appellate judges discretion to permit cameras in their courtrooms. It would not require them to do so. Furthermore, to protect the privacy of non-party witnesses, the legislation would give such witnesses the right to have their voices and images obscured during their testimony. 
   A version of this legislation passed the House in the previous Congress. I eagerly anticipate Senate passage and the day when openness is the norm in our federal courtrooms, not the exception.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last year the New York Yankees set a new baseball record--125 wins in a single season, the most ever in major league history. Today, I want to speak about another--sadder and more tragic--legacy that has befallen current and former members of this great baseball team. That legacy is cancer. 
   We remember that the house that Ruth built lost its founder, the great Bambino, ``the sultan of swat,'' to cancer. During last year's season, Darryl Strawberry was stricken with colon cancer. Former General Manager Bob Watson is battling prostate cancer. Earlier this month, Joe DiMaggio lost his life to lung cancer. And recently we learned that Yankee manager, Joe Torre, is another victim of prostate cancer. 
   I join millions of New Yorkers--and millions of Americans--in wishing Joe Torre a continued recovery, who joins a team of almost 200,000 American men who will learn they have prostate cancer in 1999. It is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in this country. And, like other cancers, prostate cancer must be stopped. For, it will claim the lives of nearly 40,000 Americans this year. My own state, New York, has the third highest rate of diagnoses and deaths due to prostate cancer. 
   Unfortunately, this country invests only about one of every twenty cancer research dollars trying to stem the epidemic of prostate cancer, which accounts for about one in every six cancer cases. It is a disproportion that  must be corrected, Mr. President. On behalf of Joe Torre, Bob Watson, Senator Bob Dole, General Norman Schwarzkopf, Andy Grove, Harry Belafonte--and millions of other men and their families whose lives have been affected by prostate cancer--now is the time to renew those efforts. 
   I am pleased that Congress established a prostate cancer research program in the Department of Defense in 1996. I supported the establishment of that program, just as I supported last year's increase in funding of the National Institutes of Health, with strong language to assure that $175 million become dedicated to prostate cancer research in 1999. 
   We must continue to develop these critical research initiatives. I congratulate Senators STEVENS, INOUYE and many others in the Senate for their championship of the important program at the Department of Defense, and I hope to work with you to help fully fund this program over the next three years. We must work collaboratively with NIH to accelerate their sponsorship of clinical prostate cancer research, and I look forward to reports, due next month, by the NCI and NIH directors about their five-year investment strategy for prostate cancer research. Even though this year promises some daunting budget challenges, we must not let our commitment to end the war on cancer waver. 
   One in six American men will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime. As frightening as that statistic may be for the general population, it is even more pointed in the African-American community. African-Americans have the highest rates of prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the world, with occurrences 35% higher than among Caucasians and death rates twice higher than white males. 
   The battle that Joe Torre faced gives testimony to the fact that prostate cancer does not affect men only in their retirement years. About 25% of cases occur in men younger than 65 years old, and, with the aging of our baby boom generation, we can fully expect both incidence and mortality to increase if the disease is unchecked. 
   Mr. President, I call on our membership to join with national organizations, like the National Prostate Cancer Coalition, CaP CURE, the American Cancer Society and 100 Black Men, and take action to end the toll prostate cancer takes on American men and their families.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to salute our veterans of the First World War as the French government confers the Legion of Honor, its highest honor, on those living American veterans who served on French soil during World War I. I salute these brave men and women for their courage and for their sacrifice. For the past eighty years, they have taught several generations of Americans what it means to be a hero and what it means to be an American. 
   Our World War I veterans fought because they believed in something beyond themselves, a greater good. They fought to preserve the best of humanity--democracy, compassion, and liberty. Unfortunately, their fight exposed them to the worst of humanity, the first modern war, with its machine guns, its trenches, its very inhumanity. 
   ``The Great War,'' ``The War to End All Wars'' is what they called it. It was so terrible, so inhuman that we believed that a calamity of that magnitude could never happen again. But it did. The Great War became known as World War I as a second inhuman war consumed our world. 
   Today, we owe it to those who fought in World War I, who we promised that it would never happen again, that we will make sure that it doesn't. These medals and this promise are for our World War I veterans and for everyone who fought alongside them in the trenches. 
   I offer this promise to our veterans, but I also ask for their help in keeping it. I ask them to teach their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren about what it meant to fight for such a great and costly cause. Together, we can make sure that our children and our children's children never have to fight another Great War.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   First, I want to, on behalf of Senator MOYNIHAN and myself, thank Chairman STEVENS, as well as Senator BYRD, for their assistance in removing the $350 million offset from the TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, account, which would have deferred the funds until 2002. 
   Mr. President, I and many others in New York feared that this offset set us off on the wrong course, that it would run counter to the intention of the welfare reform bill which allowed States to set aside TANF funds for use at a later date when welfare rolls would rise, such as during a future recession. 
   My State, as the chairman knows, was particularly affected. The State was the source of nearly a quarter, about $80 million, of the $350 million that was offset. So I am pleased that the alternative offset would shift some HUD funds from one fiscal year to the next, funds that never would have been used. We have checked with both the administration as well as our side on Housing and on Banking and on Appropriations, and they agree with that. 
   I say to the chairman that I appreciate very much the spirit of compromise in which this was offered. I understand his view and I will bring that message back to our State. The people of New York will now be breathing a sigh of relief that this has been replaced. 
   I also thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, who worked with me on this. He found his State in a similar position as ours. At least for my first foray into the Senate legislative process, it has been a bipartisan and productive effort. For that, I very much thank the chairman for his understanding of our needs and yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Internet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999. The Act would plug a gaping loophole in the enforcement of federal firearms laws--the ability of felons and minors to find guns for sale on-line and illegally acquire those guns without detection. 
   The Internet affords computer users--including children and felons--easier-than-ever access to individuals offering firearms for sale. It also facilitates firearms transactions in which sellers and buyers need not meet face-to-face. For these reasons, individuals who are legally prohibited from purchasing or selling firearms can turn to the Internet to find others willing to engage in gun transactions with them--either knowing or not knowing of the illegality of such transactions. Unlike firearms sales at gun dealerships and even gun shows, illegal Internet firearms sales occur ``sight unseen,'' thus presenting significant enforcement challenges for federal, state and local authorities. 
   In particular, a number of Internet web-sites are designed specifically to allow individuals who are not licensed firearms dealers to offer their firearms for sale. These individuals post phone numbers or e-mail addresses by which potential buyers may contact them. Unfortunately, the operators of these web-sites do not monitor the interactions between firearms sellers and buyers. Thus, sellers and buyers may with ``no-questions-asked'' and little prospect of detection evade laws prohibiting sales of certain types of firearms, prohibiting firearms sales to felons and minors, and prohibiting the direct shipment of firearms to unlicensed persons. 
   Last month, eBay--a popular on-line auction site that had allowed users to list firearms for sale--changed its policy to prohibit auctions selling firearms, explaining: ``The current laws governing the sale of firearms were created for the non-Internet sale of firearms. These laws may work well in the real world, but they work less well for the on-line trading of firearms, where the seller and the buyer rarely meet face-to-face. The on-line seller cannot readily guarantee that the buyer meets all the qualifications and complies with the laws governing the sale of firearms.'' 
   The Internet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999 would end the unlicensed sale of firearms using the Internet. 
   First, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site which offers firearms for sale or otherwise facilitates the sale of firearms posted or listed on the web-site to become a federally licensed firearms manufacturer, importer, or dealer. Currently, persons who operate web-sites that post classified advertisements for the sale of hundreds of firearms need not be licensed under federal law, even though such sales may be intricately linked to their trade or business and provide them with substantial profits. Requiring these persons to secure a federal firearms license would, among other things, enable them to more actively monitor firearms transactions facilitated by their web-sites. 
   Second, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site which offers firearms for sale or otherwise facilitates the sale of firearms posted or listed on the web-site to notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the address of the web-site. This requirement aims to facilitate necessary law enforcement investigations of Internet firearms sales. 
   Third, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site which posts or lists firearms for sale on behalf of other persons to serve as a ``middleman'' for any resulting gun transactions. Under the bill, the web-site operators in question would do this by, first, prohibiting the posting of information on these sites that would enable prospective firearms sellers and buyers to contact one another directly (such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses), and thus bypass involvement by web-site operators, and, second, requiring that all firearms sold as a result of being listed on their web-sites be shipped to them, as federally licensed firearms dealers, rather than directly to the buyers. Once the operator of the web-site received a firearm from the seller, it would have to comply with federal firearms laws in transferring the firearm to the buyer, including laws requiring that firearms be shipped to a licensed dealer in an unlicensed buyer's state rather than directly to an unlicensed buyer. 
   And fourth, it would prohibit unlicensed individuals who offer firearms for sale on ``gun show'' web-sites from shipping firearms sold as a result of being listed on such web-sites to anyone other than the web-site operator.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 100th birthday of one of the greatest American Jazz musicians and composers this country has seen, Duke Ellington. Duke's contributions to today's music are immeasurable, and his hundreds of compositions, including ``Satin Doll'' and ``Take the A-Train,'' are all time classics. Jazz and all genres of music will forever be influenced by the sophisticated, yet emotional and spiritual sound of Duke Ellington's music. 
   Born in a segregated Washington, DC neighborhood, Edward Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington, achieved an enduring legacy and popularity that has not been equaled or exceeded. He developed his talent during the Harlem Renaissance period and became one of the top five band leaders from 1926-74. Duke's contribution to music can be summed up best by Miles Davis: ``All musicians should get down on their knees once a year and thank the Lord for Duke Ellington.'' 
   Duke was the first jazz composer to produce extended compositions, such as ``Creole Rhapsody'' and ``Reminiscing in Tempo'' as well as a series of long works like ``Jump for Joy,'' ``Black, Brown, and Beige,'' and ``A Drum is a Woman.'' He wrote for large orchestras, small combos, vocalists, choirs, movies, theater, church and nightclubs. He produced thousands of songs for more than fifty years, which are still as fresh and vibrant today as they were when he wrote them decades ago. 
   It is my honor to express an enthusiastic tribute to this jazz legend during this year-long celebration of his amazing contributions to American music.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators MOYNIHAN, LOTT, and BOXER in cosponsoring this resolution to honor Mr. Joe DiMaggio. On March 8, 1999, Joe DiMaggio, one of the greatest baseball players of all-time, died in Tampa, Florida. The Yankee Clipper led his life with class and dignity. A true hero and the quintessential American, Mr. DiMaggio gave people something to believe in. 
   Playing 13 seasons in the major leagues, all for the New York Yankees, Number 5 not only took left field in Yankee Stadium, but also took over New York and baseball showing us his talent day in and day out. When one looks at the numbers accumulated by Mr. DiMaggio, it is hard to think of anyone who did it better and in such a genuine fashion. As a baseball player, few have approached DiMaggio. With a .325 batting average, nine World Series rings, a 56 consecutive game hitting streak in 1941 (a major league record that has never been seriously challenged for more than 5 decades), 361 home runs with only 369 strike-outs, Joe DiMaggio transcended the game of baseball and will remain a symbol for the ages of talent, commitment, and grace. As Simon and Garfunkel sang in their hit song Mrs. Robinson, ``where have you gone Joe DiMaggio......'', the answer is, into our hearts, which will stay with us forever. 
   But Joe DiMaggio was more than a great baseball player, he transcended the game and will remain a symbol for the ages--a symbol of talent, commitment, and grace. With so few true heroes today, we are lucky that millions of New Yorkers and baseball fans everywhere could live their lives touched by a hero like Joe DiMaggio.

   Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I am introducing my first bills as a United States Senator. I said over the last year that the picture that I want to keep at the forefront of my mind is that of families sitting around their kitchen table paying their bills, planning for retirement, affording a home, paying for college for their children, and discussing the quality of their local schools. 
   Today I am introducing my first bills for those families at the kitchen table. And let me tell you a little bit about these families. They are the same in Brooklyn and Buffalo, Mt. Vernon and Massapequa, Syracuse and Setauket. 
   They are living in a time of both overwhelming promise and overwhelming challenge. 
   The promise--the upside--is that America remains indisputably the preeminent economy in the world. The challenge--the downside--is that for most families there is a great deal of uncertainty about the future. They are concerned that forces beyond their control--rising college costs, inferior schools, struggling communities--put them behind the eight-ball. 
   Their concern isn't so much that the U.S. economy will turn sour. It's that they, or their town, or their children may be washed aside in the economic tide. The families of Upstate New York have lived that reality for six years. 
   The nine bills that I am introducing today are designed to help families deal and thrive with the changing times of a global, competitive economy. 
   I am introducing two bills to make college affordable for working families. The Make College Affordable Act, which I am honored to introduce with Senator MOYNIHAN, makes all college tuition tax deductible for families with less than $140,000 in income. 
   The Save for College Act allows families to contribute up to $2,000 per year in an education IRA that is tax-free when the money goes in and tax-free when it comes out so long as it is spent on college costs. Families earning up to $200,000 are eligible for the IRAs. 
   Let me make two points about these bills. Since 1980, the cost of attending college has increased at more than twice the rate of inflation and has risen even faster than health care. At the same time, the necessity of a college education is greater now than at any time in our history. 
   If our country is to remain economically strong and if we want families to be able to get ahead, then college--whether it's SUNY or NYU--must not put families in the poorhouse. 
   The Teachers Loan Forgiveness Act will recruit new, high quality professionals to teaching by forgiving all student loans for public and private school teachers. 
   It is expensive to become a teacher. The pay is low. And we wonder why there is a shortage of young, eager, qualified teachers to educate our children. We must make the teaching profession more financially attractive to put excellence in the classrooms. 
   The Comprehensive Pension & Security Retirement Act makes all pensions portable. If you lose a job, if you take time off to raise a child, if you change jobs--your pension will stay with you and grow. Pension portability and reform is the most important retirement security issue next to Social Security. 
   Specifically for Upstate New York, with Senator MOYNIHAN I am introducing the Airline Competition Act of 1999 to end predatory pricing and to direct the Transportation Department to grant take-off and landing slots to underserved airports within a 500 mile radius of New York. Monopolistic airfares in Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo are slowly strangling the economy of Upstate and the Southern Tier. I believe the days of sky-high airfares to these cites are numbered. 
   To rebuild struggling neighborhoods through homeownership I am introducing legislation to offer a $2,000 tax credit to first time homebuyers in Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Communities. In New York, that includes the South Bronx, Harlem, and parts of Albany, Schenectady, Troy, Buffalo, Kingston, Newburgh, and Rochester. 
   Because women pay more for health care than men, the Equity in Women's Health Act bars any health plan from discriminating on the basis of gender or sexual orientation through their coverage options. It also requires each health plan to include a short prospectus to describe exactly what they will and will not cover. 
   To protect consumers, the Credit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1999 closes loopholes in existing law that allows credit card companies to offer low teaser rates that increase dramatically unbeknownst to the cardholder. 
   And last, the Environmental Crimes Act increases fines and penalties for criminally negligent polluters and it also trains new personnel to investigate environmental crimes. 
   These are not all--but some of my priorities for the year. As I have said many times, my passion is legislating in ways that make people's lives better. With the impeachment over, I am anxious to get started on the issues that matter to New Yorkers and all Americans.

    Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to recognize two young students from my state who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Joushua Hewitt of Perry, NY, and Dana Walsh of Oceanside, NY, have been named State Honorees in the 1999 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. Each year this program honors students who have demonstrated outstanding community service. 
   These two fine students have given back to their communities in many ways. Mr. Hewitt is being recognized for his efforts in staging a simulated traffic accident to graphically demonstrate the horrors of drunk driving to his classmates. Ms. Walsh is being recognized for coordinating a fund-raising drive at her school, which raised $3,000 for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. These two students are excellent examples of young adults who are working hard to make their communities better and they deserve to be honored. 
   Mr. Hewitt and Ms. Walsh should be extremely proud to have been singled out from a group of dedicated volunteers from across the country. As part of their recognition, they will come here to the Capitol in May for several days of special events, including a Congressional breakfast reception. While in Washington, 10 of the 1999 Spirit of Community honorees will be selected as America's top youth volunteers. I commend all of those who have been nominated. 
   It is my honor to congratulate these young people who have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world. They deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.
