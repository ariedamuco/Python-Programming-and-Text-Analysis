Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, H.R. 1023, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act, would authorize the establishment of a fund from which compassionate payments would be made to people with hemophilia who contracted HIV/AIDS through tainted blood products during the early 1980s. These people were victimized by the failure of the federal government to safeguard these blood products--failures included inadequate measures to screen out high-risk donors and long-delayed recalls of blood products known to pose an elevated risk of infection. During the time period specified in the legislation, approximately 7,200 victims were infected. Each victim--or the victim's family--would receive a single $100,000 payment. The total authorization is $750,000, which would have to be separately appropriated. The relief fund sunsets after 5 years. H.R. 1023 passed the House without objection on the suspension calendar in May. Similar legislation in the Senate (S. 358), which I sponsored, has 62 bipartisan cosponsors.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first let me thank the majority leader for the passage of the Ricky Ray bill, which just occurred a few moments ago. This is a bill that I introduced, along with Senator Bob Graham, here in the Senate. It was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Tauzin. It has certainly been worked on and helped immensely by Speaker Gingrich, by Congressman Hyde and by Senator Jeffords. It is a bill which I believe will do some justice in regard to a great tragedy. It is a great tragedy that has afflicted thousands and thousands of Americans through literally no fault of their own. These are hemophiliacs who received tainted blood. Many of them have died as a result of that. Many of them are suffering today, and their families are suffering. They have tremendous expenses. They have the normal expenses of being hemophiliac and on top of that they now have AIDS. The reason for this bill is to correct this injustice. The injustice was that the Federal Government was simply not vigilant, did not do what it should have done to protect the precious blood supply of this country. 
Those of us who have worked on this bill for the last several years, I think, have felt this was not just another bill in the Congress. We have seen and we have talked firsthand to the families who have suffered. I met in my office with a man from Ohio whose son died. His son died because of this tainted blood. As the father, one of the caregivers of this child who had hemophilia, he was the one who had to administer the blood. To talk to this father, with tears in his eyes, in my office, was something I will never forget. This bill will not bring his son back. It will not bring back those who have died. But what it will do for those families is give them some compensation, some help to deal with their medical expenses. Equally important, it will be a very clear signal to them and to the country that when a mistake is made, when the Government does not do what it should do, when people suffer as they have suffered, that justice will be done. This bill is about justice. 
It is now on its way to the President. Again, I thank all of those who have been involved in this: Senator Lott, Senator Jeffords, Congressman Hyde, Senator Bob Graham, Porter Goss in the House, the prime sponsor in the House, as well as Speaker Gingrich.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will now take a moment to discuss one of the most important accomplishments of this Congress. It is an accomplishment that occurred about 4 1/2 hours ago. Back in July, I, along with a bipartisan, bicameral core group of legislators, came to the floor and introduced a bill that called for a major new effort to restore a balance to our drug interdiction and eradication efforts. Today, just this morning, after a few short months, this important effort has been included in the omnibus bill that we passed. It is included in the bill that is being sent to the President and that, with his signature, will then become law. 
This bill, this effort, is about restoring balance to America's antidrug efforts. Restoring balance to America's antidrug effort is a major accomplishment of this Congress. It is vitally important to the future of America's children. Our drug interdiction efforts, keeping drugs out of this country, are lagging way behind where they ought to be. Drugs are far too plentiful, far too easy to find, far too cheap, far too easy to obtain. It is so easy. The amount of drugs in our country is at an unprecedented high level. 
Back in the 1980s and 1990s we used to have a balanced antidrug strategy. We provided the right balance of resources to fight drugs. What do I mean by balance? I think we have to take a multifaceted approach to the drug problem. We have to have treatment for those who need that and who are willing to go into treatment. We have to have education and other methods to stop people from starting drugs. We have to have domestic law enforcement, most of which is handled at the local level but, of course, it also includes the DEA and the FBI. And, we also have to have international drug interdiction, stopping drugs from leaving the source countries--Peru, Bolivia and Colombia--stopping them on the high seas, stopping them at the border. We have to have all four components. What this bill does is restores that balance, or a better way of saying it, frankly, a more accurate way of saying it, is it begins to restore this balance. 
This effort is not just about providing resources. It is demonstrating, rather, the will to stop drugs before they reach our borders. This is not just about dollars. It is not just about dollars and cents. It is also about leadership. It is the Federal Government's--our--responsibility, and the Federal Government's alone to stop drugs at the source or in transit to our borders. In the other areas, where we talk about treatment, or domestic law enforcement, prevention, education, all of these are shared responsibilities of the local communities and the State and the Federal Government and the private sector and the nonprofit groups. But when we talk about drug interdiction, that is the one thing that nobody else can do but the Federal Government. That is our responsibility and the buck does, in fact, stop here. 
It is the Federal Government's responsibility, and the Federal Government's alone, to stop drugs at the source or in transit to our borders. I have seen it firsthand. I have been to the Caribbean, I have been to the Bahamas, I have been off the coast of Haiti and off the coast of the Dominican Republic. I have been along the border in El Paso. I have been into New Mexico. I have talked directly to the men and women of this great country who are fighting this war. We have great people who are doing that. I have seen firsthand that what we are currently providing to uphold this responsibility is simply not enough. It is, frankly, inadequate. Just as we need military readiness to defend America against war, we need drug interdiction readiness to defend America against drugs. 
We do know how to do it. We do know how to do it. We have great people. We got our ideas for this legislation from the experts, from men and women of key agencies such as the Coast Guard, Customs, DEA. That is where the ideas for this legislation that will now become law came from. Their resources have been dramatically reduced, tragically, in recent years. This bill begins--and I say begins--to fix this problem by providing the very resources they need. We could not be here today without their assistance. 
This was a bipartisan effort. We worked with both sides of the aisle. We had Gen. Barry McCaffrey's involvement and his help and cooperation and assistance. Today we certainly can be proud of this victory, but today is just the first step. We have a long way to go to restore this balance. We will be back next year to continue this war. But make no mistake about it, this bill is a major step towards keeping drugs out of our country. This bill will mean more planes in the air, more ships at sea, less drugs on the streets of America. We are back in the business of putting the drug lords out of business. 
I thank my good friend, Bill McCollum, Congressman McCollum from Florida, for leading this effort in the House of Representatives. I thank Denny Hastert, chairman of the Speaker's drug task force, who did a remarkable job in securing close to $700 million to get this initiative started. I also thank our bipartisan core group on drug interdiction--Senators Paul Coverdell, Bob Graham, Al D'Amato, Dianne Feinstein, Lauch Faircloth, and of course Porter Goss, Chuck Grassley and Kit Bond. 
The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and Majority Leader Trent Lott, both were absolutely instrumental in getting this included in the budget package that we just passed. But for them it simply would not have happened, and we know that. 
The two chairmen of the Appropriations Committees, Senator Ted Stevens and Congressman Bob Livingston, deserve our thanks for taking the lead to include our initiative in their omnibus bill. 
This legislation will make a huge difference in our efforts to win back America's future from the drug lords. It is just the beginning to restore the balance but it is a major, significant beginning. It is a major victory. I thank my colleagues who worked so very hard on this.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like now to turn the Senate's attention to a very important foreign policy, as well as humanitarian, measure, a measure that has also been passed by the Congress. I am referring to the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act. 
Back in July, Senator Sarbanes and I introduced legislation on the Senate floor to promote small-scale agricultural and rural development in Africa, a bill cosponsored in the House of Representatives by our colleagues, Doug Bereuter and Lee Hamilton, a bipartisan effort, a bill that will save lives, a bill that will help people help themselves. 
The Africa: Seeds of Hope Act represents a commitment to seek ways to help farmers in sub-Saharan Africa through sustainable agriculture, research, rural finance and extension projects. The bill will also recognize important benefits such overseas agricultural advances could hold for America's farmers. The Senate and House have both passed the bill. It is now on its way to the President. 
We need to sow seeds of hope in Africa. There are a vast number of people in Africa who go each day without the necessary nourishment that we in our country take for granted. In many parts of Africa, women and children struggle daily to find the food that will barely sustain them for another day. 
The problem in Africa has worsened over the last 30 years, and this is in spite of the fact that in many parts of the world the situation is getting better, and in Africa it is getting worse. The number of Africans who are unable to produce the food and provisions they need to lead healthy, productive lives is tragically rising. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, around 215 million people are undernourished in sub-Saharan Africa, and this number is expected to increase--increase dramatically--into the next century. 
Food is the basic necessity of life. It is an unfortunate reality that many of the African people lead lives of needless suffering because they don't have the skills and tools necessary to help themselves. As a result, many African countries are dependent on the outside world for humanitarian assistance and basic nutrition. These countries import a large percentage of the food they consume. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8 million metric tons in 1990, to more than 25 million metric tons by the year 2020. Mr. President, this is a very, very dangerous trend, and it must be changed, it must be reversed. 
The bill we just passed is based on the insight that the most effective way to improve conditions for Africa's poor is to increase the productivity of their agricultural sector. Whenever I travel to developing countries, I always like to spend time looking at that country's agricultural sector. I have seen firsthand in many countries that their rural areas can succeed through agricultural development and through the right kind of assistance, the assistance that uses the expertise that we have in this country at our universities, the expertise that we have among our farmers, to share that knowledge and that know-how. 
About 70 percent of Africa's poor live in rural areas. That is where the major problem is, and that is where this bill can make a difference, because not only do we want to see and help these individuals in rural areas feed themselves, we also understand that if they cannot feed themselves, what they do is move to the cities. When they move to the cities, many times the conditions are even worse than the conditions they left in the rural areas. It is a trend we see worldwide, and it is a trend that is very, very dangerous. It breeds instability, and it breeds other problems. 
Rural and agricultural markets play a critical role in the majority of the African workforce. It has been reported that 70 percent of African employment is in the agricultural market. If we are serious about opening up new trade relations with the continent--and we should be--then we need to be aggressive in helping to strengthen the foundation for their survival. 
Let me outline a few highlights of this bill. 
This legislation first encourages agencies and organizations to make rural development issues a priority by teaching effective farming methods to small-scale African farmers and entrepreneurs. This is people to people, farmer to farmer and not dealing with many of these governments. 
It provides African small farmers and entrepreneurs with improved access to credit and other resources necessary to stimulate production in microenterprise. 
It mobilizes new resources for investment in African agriculture and rural development through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation. 
It facilitates the coordination of national and international agricultural research and extension efforts aimed at developing the skills of African researchers, African extension agents, farmers and agribusiness people. In fact, the bill would allow American universities to play a pivotal role in this effort. 
Finally, this bill requires the U.S. Agency for International Development, when providing nonemergency assistance through the Public Law 480 title II programs, to include assistance programs for people who are otherwise unable to meet their basic food needs, including feeding programs for the disabled, for the orphaned, for the elderly, for the sick and for the dying. 
African farmers and the African people are in dire need of agricultural development. This bill can help them gain the knowledge they need for this important development. At the same time, the legislation will help our own agricultural producers by opening new export markets for American farmers, especially those who deal with value-added goods. 
Mr. President, as the economies in sub-Saharan Africa develop, their citizens' incomes will increase, thus raising their standard of living. In turn, they will be in a better position to purchase a new variety of goods, including American agricultural commodities and equipment. This is where our export markets can flourish. As a citizen of Ohio, I am excited at the export prospects for the hard-working farmers of my own State. 
Another significant point to consider is that food stability is a critical factor in preventing civil strife within nations. Our investment in international agriculture and rural development will help reduce demands for U.S. disaster and famine relief. 
International agricultural development assistance has depleted over time. In fact, over the past decade alone, money for this program has dropped by 70 percent. We should refocus our efforts in this important program, and this bill will do that. 
Under this bill, USAID will be called upon to use its resources for programs and improved food security and agricultural productivity for African farmers. 
This legislation has the ability to make a real difference in the lives of real people. As a compassionate Nation, we should want to aid those less fortunate to better help themselves. The bill will help these individuals make important progress in meeting human needs. In passing this bill, the U.S. Congress has done some very important work, and I congratulate my colleagues for the bill as we send it on its way to the President.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if I can turn to a much sadder topic. One of the saddest duties of public life is having to express moral truths. It is sad because it should be unnecessary. Thomas Jefferson two centuries ago enunciated some truths that he said `we hold to be self-evident.' We hold to be self-evident. 
It should be self-evident that in a country of liberty, a country of rule of law and respect for human rights that we should condemn the murder of any human being. We should, as a logical consequence of this principle, condemn the murder of people who have killed because the murderers disapprove of some aspect of the murder victim's personal life. 
That is why our national attitude toward the atrocity that took place in Laramie, WY, on October 7 is so very important. 
Let us all, as Americans, leave no doubt that the murder of young Matthew Shepard was a vicious, despicable crime. 
Again, it should--I repeat--should be self-evident. But Mr. President, I have seen news reports that protesters, demonstrators, hecklers went to this young man's funeral to spew hatred and venom. Some might say their demonstrations are protected by the first amendment, and that may or may not be true--and I am not going to deal with that and talk about that today --but what I wish to underscore today is that I, too, have first amendment rights--we all do--a right to tell the truth about these demonstrators' conduct. And to do so, polite phrases might not be enough. 
So let's make it very clear: The people who committed this crime are despicable, they are scum. And the people who intruded on the privacy of this poor family, the family of the deceased, the people who intruded on their privacy at that hour of sorrow, to mock the deceased, mock this young man, these people who did this are lowlifes--they should be condemned by all Americans. They deserve the contempt of all civilized people. 
Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Virginia has been on the floor for some time. I also note the majority leader may be coming back at any moment. I would advise my colleague, the majority leader, as well as my colleague from Virginia, that I have some additional comments about another topic that would be fairly extensive. I would be more than happy to yield at this point, either to the majority leader or to my colleague from Virginia, just with the understanding that I will have the opportunity before the Senate does go out of session for the year to make these comments. 
Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. If I could reclaim my time, just for a moment --and the majority leader I do not think was on the floor when I made the comment--I advised my friend from Virginia, as well as the majority leader, that I do have some additional comments about a separate issue. I know the majority leader needs to do the final wrapup. I am not sure whether he is ready to do that.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a few short minutes the curtain will fall on this Congress. Today we complete our legislative business. Yet the business of global peace and national security will continue. Issues such as our global economy, regional stability, nuclear proliferation, proliferation of biological and chemical weapons--just to name a few--determine the condition of this business. It is a business that requires the daily attention of our world leaders, including the President of the United States, including his advisors, and including, yes, this Senate. 
Yet today it is claimed that our national attention is not focused on the kinds of affairs that have a huge impact on our national security. It is claimed that our focus is not made on foreign affairs. Even our President, we are told, is not able to devote to foreign policy the level of commitment and leadership our country needs. We are told he is distracted. Some say he was distracted first by a lengthy independent counsel investigation, and now distracted by a congressional impeachment process. We are told he is distracted needlessly from doing the job at hand. 
Distracted. That is a word that has gotten quite a bit of mileage lately. It has found its way into our editorial pages and into our Sunday morning talk shows. We are told by the political columnists and TV pundits that all of us were distracted in this country--all of us--by the Starr investigation and the Starr report. 
Soon it will be the House impeachment process that draws our attention. We are told that all of us are distracted--the American people, the Congress, and first of all, the President--by all of this. We are told that that distraction is dangerous--dangerous because it could send the wrong signal to a rogue nation or a terrorist group or further complicate an already complex global economic slowdown. 
The conclusion that seems to be reached by a number of people is that it is in our best interest, perhaps even our national security interest, to achieve an expedited resolution of the impeachment process, and to do it quickly. Some argue that what we need is an alternative to the impeachment process itself. Some have used the term `censure' or `reprimand.' I am deeply concerned that the upcoming impeachment process is perceived as a distraction, one that inhibits the kind of vision and strategic planning that we must expect from the leader of the world's sole superpower. 
This perception is not lost on those around the globe who have a stake in American leadership. And who doesn't have a stake in American leadership? One European Finance Minister here in Washington for the annual IMF World Bank talks was quoted in the New York Times with the following: 
You might find that the leader of the world's biggest economy could spend more time figuring out ways to save the world economy if he was not trying to save his job. 
There is no reason for the President of the United States to be distracted to the point of even remote danger to our national security. In other words, we must not let the perception of distraction dictate the reality. We can and must address our interests here and abroad in the midst of this constitutional impeachment process. 
For that reason, we cannot let this perceived distraction in any way undermine our constitutional duties as Members of Congress. Perhaps most important, we cannot let this argument of distraction serve as an excuse to avoid the kind of long-range planning and decisionmaking, the strategic thinking, that we need, and should expect, from our President in regard to the American foreign policy during these very difficult times. 
These are difficult times, perhaps the most difficult and the most challenging period in the post-cold-war era. Since the end of the cold war we have experienced a combined period of peace and prosperity probably not seen in this country since the 1920s. However, ours has not been a tranquil peace. The President had to send ground troops to Somalia, Haiti, and most recently to Bosnia. We have taken to the air with swift military action in Iran, Sudan and the hills of Afghanistan. We made a show of force in Iraq, the Taiwan Straits, and recently in Serbia. If the last 7 years have proven one lesson, it is clear that the challenges of peace do not end with its achievement. It must be protected, enforced and advanced with the same vigilance and determination we used in the past to arrive at this point in history. As Henry Kissinger reminded our young allies more than 10 years ago: 
History knows no resting places. What does not advance must sooner or later decline. 
The world has not been resting. Indeed, this has been a time of increasing restlessness. At no time since the fall of the Soviet Union has the world needed either individual or collective leadership more than it does today. We are in need of leadership that strives not just for quick fixes but solutions that look beyond the short term. When the world looks for leadership, it can only look one place, and that is to the United States. If the United States does not lead, there is no 
one else who can lead, no one else who will lead. We must lead. 
The issues we face are numerous, complex, interrelated and potentially self-destructive. As we near a new millennium, we find ourselves at a virtual crossroad in so many different areas. We stand on the brink of a nuclear arms race in Asia and the Middle East. Nationalism raised the prospect of war in several regions, from Central Europe to Asia, and most ominous, we face a worldwide economic dislocation, and perhaps a global recession, a global recession that threatens to undermine, if not overwhelm, the progress of the democracies that we have seen springing up in virtually every corner of the world. Each one of these challenges has serious economic and security consequences for our own country. Each one of these issues requires leadership from the United States. 
Let me expand briefly on each of these challenges. First, the threat of a nuclear arm race in Asia and the Middle East raises serious questions about the effectiveness of our own unilateral and our multilateral efforts to control the flow of materials, to control the flow of technology and information that is needed to build a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver. In May of this year, as we all recall, India and Pakistan both reinforced their status as nuclear powers. China, as we all know, has gone to great length to advance its own ballistic missile capability. And 3 years after an agreement with the Clinton administration to cease its nuclear weapons program, North Korea may still be moving forward to acquire nuclear weapons. In August, North Korea tested a two-stage ballistic missile that demonstrated its capability to deliver a nuclear payload. 
When the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, both sides agreed to a U.N. Security Council resolution that required the destruction and banned future possession and development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in Iraq. But time and time again, Iraq has demonstrated its clear resolve never to abide by this resolution. The United Nations demonstrated it has no resolve to insist on compliance. 
Iran continues to actively pursue a nuclear weapons program. The capability, if obtained, could fuel a nuclear arms race throughout Asia and the Middle East. Perhaps of greatest concern, nuclear proliferation in this region raises the risk that a nuclear device could end up in the hands of terrorist organizations or other elements hostile to the United States or hostile to the free world. 
While these nations have challenged international nuclear nonproliferation policies and agreements, others are asserting nationalism as well as ethnic prerogatives, prerogatives which have tested the United Nations and our NATO allies. 
Certainly we can point to the success of the stabilization forces to sustain the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia. However, when will the ultimate end game be in sight? At what point can our troops return home? At what point can real peace sustained by the Bosnians themselves ever be achieved? 
While we struggle to find the end game of peace in Bosnia, we are just beginning to make the opening moves and struggle to restore peace in the neighboring Serbian province of Kosovo. Milosevic has pledged to abide by U.N. demand, but only after the United States and our NATO allies started speaking with force, showing that they are ready. Bosnia has taught us hard lessons. We cannot rest on a commitment made by a war criminal, and the actions or inactions over the last week clearly reinforce that, as well. 
To the east, Turkey finds itself in military buildup against two adversaries, Syria and Greece. This administration now has been in a week-long struggle to revive, once again, the single issue that has kept peace and democracy bottled on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. 
The regional tensions I have just described are fueled by ethnic and historic tensions that clearly go back for generations, go back centuries. It is safe to say that to achieve stability all sides have to defy the history of violence and bloodshed that preceded. While these nations attempt to reinforce their place in history, other nations are trying to save or achieve the economic and democratic success stories of recent history. 
Currency downturns across all of Asia now threaten the economic vitality in Latin America, particularly in Brazil. International drug trafficking from South America to the U.S.-Mexico border also undermines legitimate economic development efforts by countries in the production and transit zones. Our own efforts have to look to the larger global economic picture. For example, forcing a drop in the U.S. currency relative to the yen may make Japanese products less expensive, but it effectively makes products made by their Asian competitors more expensive, which could stall economic growth in places like Thailand or Singapore. 
Mr. President, I have outlined a series of challenges. Each of these challenges offers no simple solutions. Let's be very clear and honest about that. Each has long-term consequences, though, for U.S. national security. All of them are really interrelated. For example, the harder it is for Russia to right herself economically and politically, the harder it will be for Russia to avoid marketing its own destructive assets--those assets, of course, being nuclear technology. 
Mr. President, President Clinton is looking to leave a legacy; surely, he must be. The challenge to leave such a legacy to advance global peace and prosperity into the next century is there for the taking. Mr. President, the American people should not accept the upcoming impeachment process, or investigation--however we want to phrase it--as an identified impediment to achieving that legacy. What it would reveal instead is an administration that is lacking in the creative administrative capacity to articulate and advance a long-term foreign policy agenda. It is that failure to articulate and then stand by that agenda that poses the real risk to U.S. interests around the world. 
Mr. President, it is important that we put the impeachment process launched by the House of Representatives in its proper perspective. We are not faced today with a constitutional crisis. Instead, we are beginning a constitutional process. We don't know the ultimate outcome of that. It is a constitutional process designed by our Founding Fathers, designed to be a check on the potentially abusive power of a President. It is up to us in Congress to ultimately determine what `high crimes and misdemeanors' mean, and to ultimately determine what the facts are. It is up to us to follow that constitutional process that was laid out over 200 years ago by the founders of this country. 
Mr. President, for impeachment, the Constitution provides Congress a way to preserve the integrity of the President and, more to the point, to define this process and the kinds of practices that would fall into the category of high crimes and misdemeanors. Certainly a President faced with this constitutional process will have to devote time and effort to overcome the possible removal from office. We know that. But should we seek to limit or alter this process arbitrarily because it takes him away from other perhaps more pressing duties? Certainly not. 
Mr. President, impeachment is not the only process in our Constitution that can result in removal of a President. The Constitution provides a regular formal check on the President's powers known as `elections'--the electoral process itself. As we all know, a President who is subjected to this constitutional process has to devote a great deal of time and attention to prevent his removal from office by the people. It is called running for election and running for reelection. Campaigns have become longer and more expensive. They demand more and more of a President's time and energy. This has taken place in the midst of challenging times. Not one time was this normal election process altered because of its potentially adverse affects on a President's ability to lead in times of difficulty, or even in times of crisis. Abraham Lincoln fought both a military war to save the union and a political war to save his Presidency in 1864. Franklin Roosevelt battled economic depression, and then Nazi and Japanese aggression, through three reelection campaigns. All of his successors, except one, from Harry Truman to George Bush had to wage and win a cold war, stop and dismantle communism, run a campaign and, at the same time, remain in office. 
I cite these examples because we expect our Presidents to exercise leadership even when they are being subjected to a political process that could result in their removal from office. Although the impeachment process raises very serious issues, it is no more a constitutional crisis than the very electoral process itself. Even today, in the days when Presidents are actively involved in reelection campaigns that begin almost immediately after being sworn into office, we expect our President to not let the campaign distract him from exercising leadership on the larger issues that are vital to this country. Nor have we ever postponed an election because of any fear that it would disrupt or threaten our Nation's security --not even when our Nation was at war, not even when our Nation was bitterly divided. 
Mr. President, with that in mind, we should not allow the current impeachment proceedings to be used as an excuse for not confronting the more important challenges we face in the world 
today. As I said in the beginning of my remarks, the business of national security and global peace is never-ending. This makes Presidential leadership a full time job, no matter what constitutional processes are utilized to remove the President from office by those who elected him or those tasked to protect the integrity of that office, whether it is what we consider to be the normal every-four-year reelection process or this extraordinary, unusual process that is clearly prescribed in the Constitution--the impeachment process that we are about today. 
Therefore, Mr. President, any process to address the charges raised by the independent counsel, short of that provided for in the Constitution, would be a grave mistake. I am confident that the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Henry Hyde, will conduct a thorough and fair hearing. Congressman Hyde will not let the process last a day longer than is needed. It is a process that will consume the time of many members of the legislative and executive branch of Government. However, it is a process put in place by the founders of this country to preserve the integrity of representative government. We have a duty to follow that process. It is not in anyone's interest to cheapen or weaken this process in a way that compromises our system of Government. 
With that said, the process must continue. I am confident that the House and the Senate will conduct themselves in a way that will give confidence to the American people that we are following the Constitution and that we are doing what we think is right--whatever the outcome. 
Mr. President, I urge the President of the United States to demonstrate that we are a country capable of following our Constitution and maintaining our position of leadership in the world. That could only occur if the President brushes aside the talk of distraction and takes on the numerous challenges before us. Ultimately, Mr. President, the truest sign of weakness is not a President focused on the constitutional process at hand, but an entire administration that is not prepared to exercise the leadership needed to work with our allies, develop sound policies, and then abide by them. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the resolution of ratification of two treaties that are of unsurpassed importance to America's prospects in the global economy of the 21st century. 
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties are hardly the topics of everyday conversation in my home state of Ohio, or in any of my colleagues' home states. But they are critically important treaties. Every country that ratifies these treaties is required to update its laws against the piracy of copyrighted materials, and to extend those laws to the electronic commerce marketplace epitomized by the Internet. That outcome will be great news for Ohioans, and for all Americans. 
American creativity is the envy of the world today. Our music, movies, computer software, video games and published materials are in great demand in almost every country in the world. In fact, taken as a whole, the industries dependent on copyrighted are our country's single biggest export earner, with an estimated $60 billion in exports and foreign sales in 1996. No wonder studies show that the creative industries are one of most dynamic sectors of our economy, accounting for some 3.5 million U.S. jobs. 
The greatest single threat to this economic success story is piracy. New technology heightens this threat. The Internet and other digital media offer great potential for bringing the fruits of American creativity to new markets; but they also make it easier than ever before for pirates to make unlimited numbers of perfect copies of our creative works, and distribute them around the world--literally at the touch of a button. 
That's where these two new treaties come in. By requiring countries to upgrade their copyright laws, and to update them for the digital age, the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, provide critical new legal tools in the fight against piracy worldwide. That will help make overseas markets safer for the export of U.S. music, movies, software and books--and encourage the further growth of this key sector of our economy. 
Ratification of the WIPO treaties advances another important goal--one that does not simply translate to dollars and cents. It helps to underscore the need for responsible conduct on the Internet. People who would never even consider shoplifting a CD or a videocassette from a store sometimes think the same rules about respecting private property should not apply in cyberspace. Ratifying these two treaties helps to dispel that illusion. That's good news, not only for the creative community--songwriters, performers, software designers, authors--but also for all our families as they explore the exciting new territory of the Internet. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I worked with my colleagues to hammer out the legislation needed to implement the standards of the WIPO treaties in U.S. law. Since our copyright law is already strong, only a few provisions had to be added--but, some provisions were contentious, and I am pleased that we were able to achieve a balanced, compromise solution that commanded almost unanimous support. That legislation, which also made other important improvements to our copyright law, is on its way to the President's desk, and I urge him to sign it. 
Today's action complete the job, by authorizing the Administration to formally ratify the two treaties. It will also send a powerful message to our trading partners--some of whom must make many more extensive changes to their copyright laws in order to meet the standards of these treaties--that now is the time to move forward on this critical task. 
I commend my colleagues in the Foreign Relations Committee for moving this measure to the Senate floor so promptly after the Senate's adoption of the implementing legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of ratification.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our former colleague, Bill Gradison. Bill served as a highly respected member of the House of Representatives from Ohio from his election in November 1974 until his retirement from the House of Representatives on January 31, 1993. I personally was fortunate to serve with Bill in the House for eight years. As many of my colleagues know, at the end of the year Bill will be stepping down from his presidency at the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA), where he has served with great distinction for the past 6 years. 
During his years at HIAA, Bill demonstrated the same knowledge, commitment and skills that he did when he served in Congress. Bill Gradison is truly an expert in health care policy. And he has worked diligently over the past few years to improve the nation's health care system and the health of the American people. Equally important, he did so at all times with great thoughtfulness and by truly being a gentleman. 
In Bill's 18 years representing Ohio in the House of Representatives, he had a strong influence on many areas, including health care, the budget, taxes, social security, trade, and governmental self discipline. 
Of all the issues which he studied and tackled, though, he found health care to be particularly absorbing and challenging. In Congress and out, Bill has worked tirelessly to ensure that all Americans have access to health care that is both high quality and reasonable in cost. 
In Congress, Bill worked enthusiastically to promote hospice care, an innovative, compassionate approach to caring for the terminally ill and their families. In 1982, legislation which he sponsored with then Representative Leon Panetta to allow hospices to provide care under the Medicare program, was enacted. Over the years, Bill sponsored numerous other hospice-related measures that received strong bipartisan support and were subsequently enacted. Today, this humanitarian yet cost effective end of life care is widely accepted. 
One of Bill's most significant non-health Congressional achievements was indexing income tax brackets and the standard deduction for inflation. Bill also was a major participant in developing the 1983 social security measures that restored the system, then teetering on bankruptcy, to solvency. 
Mr. Speaker/Mr. President, I invite all my colleagues to join me in congratulating Bill on his years of dedicated service to Congress and to the HIAA, and wishing him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors. I know we will continue to be enriched by Bill's contributions to the health care debate and to public policy generally for a long time to come.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the greatest musicmakers in the history of the Buckeye State, the legenday `Polka King,' Frank Yankovic, who died yesterday at age 83. 
Frank Yankovic was from Cleveland, OH, but he had fans not just in Ohio but all over America. He brought joy to millions with his lighthearted polka hits--songs whose very titles can occasion a smile--songs like and `Champagne Taste and a Beer Bankroll' and `In Heaven There Is No Beer.' 
Frank Yankovic won a Grammy Award, and was nominated for three more. With his passing, the world of music, and indeed all Americans who believe that music is supposed to be fun, have lost a true friend. 
The voice of Frank Yankovic resounds through the decades, asking the question that most everyone in northeast Ohio grew up with: `Who stole the kishkes?' 
Mr. President, it is my hope and strong belief that St. Peter is even now answering this question for Frank Yankovic--as he welcomes him to the polka band that used to be known as the heavenly choir. 
On behalf of the people of Ohio, let me say thank you to this great Ohioan--for a lifetime of entertainment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to hail the passage last night of the Bailey Fix Act, also known as the use or carry bill, after two Congresses. This legislation will provide enhanced mandatory minimum penalties for those criminals who use guns while trafficking in drugs or in the commission of violent crimes. When the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Bailey versus United States in 1995, the Court dealt a serious blow to law enforcement. Prior to that decision, drug traffickers who `used or carried' firearms during or in relation to their drug trafficking crimes were subject to mandatory minimums of five years under Section 924(c) of Title 18. With this decision, the Court significantly limited prosecutors' ability to put gun-using, drug trafficking criminals away. 
In Bailey, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, announced that in order to receive the sentence enhancement for using or carrying a firearm during a violent or drug trafficking crime under Title 18 U.S.C. 924(c), the criminal must `actively employ' a firearm. This decision severely restricted an important tool used by federal prosecutors to put gun-using drug criminals behind bars. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, there were 9,182 defendants sentenced nationwide from 1991 to 1995 under 924(c). The Commission notes that the vast majority, about 75% of these cases are drug trafficking and bank robbery cases. Since the Bailey decision, the number of federal cases involving a 924(c) enhancement has declined by about 17%. 
The question before this Congress for almost four years, two Senate hearings, and seven bills was how to restore this crime fighting tool. Across the political spectrum there is a consensus about the problem. There is also a consensus, I believe, that the purpose of this `use or carry' provision is twofold; to punish criminals who use guns, and to be a deterrent to would-be criminals not to use a gun. So, 924(c) comes with a message: `If you mix guns and drugs, or guns and violence, we're going to come after you--and the price will be high.' 
The final bill attempts to address the issue: `Where do we draw the line in constructive possession cases?' How do we address those situations when the gun is not in the direct possession of the criminal when either the crime is committed or he is caught for the crime. 
This legislation, however, is meant to embrace not only instances of brandishing, firing or displaying a firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, but also to those situations where a defendant kept a firearm available to provide security for the transaction, its fruit or proceeds, or was otherwise emboldened by its presence in the commission of the offense. Many of these instances, frankly, are simply an issue of proof. To that extent we must acknowledge our limitations in addressing a solution. 
This bill would change the wording of Section 924(c) to add to `uses, carries' `in furtherance of the crime, possesses a firearm.' The original S. 191 did not contain this `in furtherance language' that modifies `possesses.  
[In pertinent part, Section 924(c) would read: 
`. . . any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which a person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall . . .'] 
The purpose of adding the `in furtherance' language is to assure that someone who possesses a gun that has nothing to do with the crime does not fall under 924(c). I believe that the `in furtherance' language is a slightly higher standard that encompasses `during and in relation to' language, by requiring an indication of helping forward, promote, or advance a crime. This provision applies equally to the individual simply exercising his or her right to own a firearm, as well as the prosecutor who would bring a 924(c) action where there is, arguably, an insufficient nexus between the crime and the gun. 
This bill will: 
Provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for anyone who uses, carries or possesses a firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense; 
Provide a seven year sentence for `brandishing' by making known the presence of a firearm during the commission of a crime. 
Raise the penalty to ten years if the gun is discharged. 
Mr. President, I have always believed that that this is an eminently fixable problem. Our prosecutors need full use of this provision now, and it is my hope and my belief that this legislation will accomplish that purpose.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, almost everyone has heard of the impending `Year 2000' or `Y2K' problem, also commonly known as the `millennium bug.' The problem itself is fairly simple. In the early years of computers, programmers set aside only two digits to denote the year in dates. To the `minds' behind computers and other technology-driven devices, the year 2000 is indistinguishable from the year 1900. The problem is present in billions of lines of software as well as billions of small computer chips embedded in electronic devices used by Americans every day. Without the necessary checks to ensure that electronic devices can operate by January 1, 2000, the impact of this computer bug could be wide-ranging and even disastrous. Household gadgets like garage door openers or VCRs could break down. Traffic delays could be caused by non-complaint traffic lights. Stock exchanges and nuclear reactors could shut down. 
Although the problem is easy to describe, it has proven difficult and time-consuming to solve. To make the necessary corrections, each line of computer code must be hand-checked by a computer programmer, and all computer chips must be tested. In the United States alone, it is estimated that it will cost over $600 billion to correct the millions of lines of computer program code. Not only are these corrections expensive, the process of analyzing, correcting, testing and integrating software and hardware has become a heavy management burden on all levels of government as well as the private sector. 
Although the federal government has been working to meet the time constraints of the Y2K deadline, the General Accounting Office has found that problems still remain with computer systems at every federal agency they examined. Overall, it is estimated that the federal government must check at least 7,336 mission critical computer systems. Some larger systems, those used by the Internal Revenue Service, for example, have more than 60 lines of code per system. The Office of Management and Budget has 
established an interagency committee to facilitate federal efforts to instruct each federal agency on the best possible solutions. 
Some federal agencies are closer to achieving Y2K compliance than others. The Treasury Department's Financial Management Service, responsible for paying Social Security disability and retirement benefits, Veterans' benefits, and IRS refunds, installed two new Y2K compliant systems earlier this month. Treasury Department officials are confident they will be ready and checks will arrive on time. 
The Federal Aviation Administration is among the agencies furthest behind in this process. This is of particular concern to me. A recent survey by the Air Transport Association of America shows that 35 percent of our nation's airports surveyed do not yet have a Y2K plan and that only 20 of 81 of our country's larger airports are on schedule to fix their Y2K problems. Although FAA officials testified that they will, in fact, be fully compliant by the end of June 1999, this will not give their administrators much time for testing the updated systems. The Transportation Department is prepared to shut down unsafe aviation systems domestically and will be working with the State Department to access the safety of international systems so they will be ready to stop flights to unsafe airports. Unless we can accelerate Y2K compliance at our airports, the rippling Y2K effect on air travel could make air travel inconvenient and costly to the American traveler. 
During this session of Congress, we have devoted a great deal of attention to the Y2K challenge. A special Senate Subcommittee on Y2K, headed by our colleague from Utah, Senator Robert Bennett, held several hearings to raise awareness of this problem and to discuss possible solutions. To expedite the federal government's efforts to correct all agency computer systems, last year Congress provided $86 million to perform Y2K updates at the Federal Aviation Administration, the Treasury Department and the Health Care Financing Administration. This fall, Congress is expected to provide another $3.25 billion in emergency funding to ensure the federal government can fully meet the Y2K challenge. 
We also need to encourage companies, large and small, to meet this challenge. During congressional hearings, representatives from the private sector discussed hesitancy to disclose any information about their own Y2K progress. Companies are reluctant to work together based almost entirely on fears of potential litigation and legal liabilities. For example, in my state of Ohio, NCR, a world-wide provider of information technology solutions, has been working on Y2K solutions since 1996. NCR made valuable progress in research on its own preparedness for Y2K and in finding solutions to help other businesses prepare for 
the millennium. Unfortunately, they were hesitant to deliver these statements for fear that they would be sued. In order to encourage the private sector to share valuable information and experiences, these lines of communication need to be open. Congress recently passed legislation, S. 2392, to encourage companies to freely discuss potential Y2K problems, solutions, test results and readiness amongst themselves. This law will provide businesses the temporary protection from lawsuits regarding statements made about Y2K. 
As the chairman of the Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition Subcommittee, I am usually reluctant to support any exemption from our antitrust laws. As a general proposition it is very important that these laws apply broadly to all sectors of the economy to protect consumers and allow businesses to operate in an environment of fair and rigorous competition. However, I do support the narrow, temporary exemption passed by Congress as a part of our overall effort to address the Y2K problem. 
This exemption does not cover conduct such as price fixing or group boycotts. Even with these important limitations this antitrust exemption should provide significant protection for those who might otherwise be reluctant to pool resources and share information.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago we introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This bipartisan legislation, which now has over one-third of the Senate as cosponsors, calls for an additional $2.6 billion investment in international counternarcotics efforts over the next 3 years. With the additional resources provided in this legislation, we can begin to restore a comprehensive eradication, interdiction, and crop substitution strategy. I say `restore.' I say restore because we currently are not making the same kind of effort to keep drugs from entering the United States that we used to. Drugs are now easy to find and easy to buy. As a result, the amount of drugs sold on our streets and the number of people who use drugs, particularly our young people, is at an unprecedented high level. The facts demonstrate the sobering trends. 
The August 1998 National Survey of Drug Abuse report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration lists the following disturbing facts: One, in 1997, 13.9 million Americans age 12 and over cited themselves as `current users' of elicit drugs, a 7 percent increase over 1996's figure of 13 million Americans. That translates to nearly a million new users of drugs each year. 
Second, from 1992 to 1997, the number of children age 12 to 17 who were using illegal drugs has more than doubled and has increased by 27 percent, just from 1996 to 1997 alone. 
For children age 12 to 17, first-time heroin use--which as we all know can be fatal--surged an astounding 875 percent, from 1991 to 1996. The overall number of past-month heroin users increased 378 percent from 1993 to 1997. 
We cannot in good conscience and with a straight face say that our drug control strategy is working. It is not. More children are using drugs. With an abundant supply, drug traffickers now are seeking to increase their sales by targeting children age 10, 11, 12. This is nothing less than an assault on the future of our children, on our families, and on the future of our country itself. This is nothing less than a threat to our national values and, yes, even our national security. 
All of this, though, begs the question: What are we doing wrong? Clearly there is no one, simple answer. However, one thing is clear: our overall drug strategy is no longer balanced; it is imbalanced. To be effective, our national drug strategy must have a strong commitment in the following three areas. One is demand reduction, which consists of prevention, treatment and education programs. These are, of course, administered by all levels of government: Federal level, State level, and the local community as well as nonprofit and other private organizations. The second component is domestic law enforcement which, again, has to be provided by all three levels of government. And finally, No. 3, international eradication and international interdiction efforts, which is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government, our sole responsibility. 
These three components are really all interdependent--you need them all. A strong investment in each of them is necessary for each to work individually and to work collectively. For example, a strong effort to destroy or seize drugs at the source or outside the United States, both reduces the amount of drugs in the country and drives up the street price. As we all know, higher prices will in fact reduce consumption. This, in turn, helps our domestic law enforcement and demand reduction efforts. 
As any football fan can tell us, a winning team is one that plays well at all three phases of the game--offense, defense, and special teams. 
The same is true with our antidrug strategy. All three components have to be effective if our strategy is going to be a winning effort. 
Mr. President, while I think the current administration has shown a clear commitment to demand reduction and domestic law enforcement programs, the same, sadly, cannot be said for the international eradication and interdiction components. This was not always the case. Let me turn to a chart. 
In 1987, a $4.79 billion Federal drug control budget was divided as follows: 29 percent for demand reduction programs; 38 percent for domestic law enforcement; and 33 percent, one-third, for international eradication and interdiction efforts. This balanced approach worked. It achieved real success. Limiting drug availability through interdiction drove up the street price of drugs, reduced drug purity levels and, consequently, reduced overall drug use. 
From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 percent, cocaine use dropped by 35 percent, and there was a 25-percent reduction in overall drug use by adolescent Americans. 
This balanced approach, however, ended in 1993, and by 1995 the $13.3 billion national drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent for demand reduction, 53 percent for law enforcement, but only--only--12 percent--only 12 percent for international interdiction efforts. 
Though the overall antidrug budget increased almost threefold from 1987 to 1995, the percentage allocated for international eradication and interdiction efforts decreased dramatically. This disruption only recently has started to change. Unfortunately, the imbalance is still there, and the figures still show that. 
In the President's proposed $17 billion drug control budget for 1999, 34 percent will be allocated for demand reduction, 52 percent for law enforcement, and 14 percent for international and interdiction efforts. Those are the numbers. But what really matters is what these numbers get you, what they buy, in terms of resources. The hard truth is that our drug interdiction presence --the ship, the air, and the manpower dedicated to keeping drugs from reaching our country--has eroded dramatically, and here are just a few examples. 
One, the Department of Defense funding for counternarcotics decreased from $504.6 million in 1992 down to $214 million in 1995. That is a 57-percent decrease in only a period of 3 years. As a result, flight hours by our AWACS planes dropped from 38,100 hours in 1992 down to 17,713 hours by 1996, a 54-percent reduction. 
Another example: At the beginning of the decade, the U.S. Customs Service operated counternarcotics activities around the clock. This made sense because drug trafficking is a 7-day, 24-hour enterprise. Today, the Customs Service does not have the resources to maintain these around-the-clock operations. In a recent hearing on our legislation, the original piece of legislation we introduced, a representative of the U.S. Customs Service testified that the Customs Service has 84 boats in the Caribbean in drug apprehension efforts, and that is down from 200 vessels in 1990--200 down to 84. 
The Customs Service estimates that they expect to have only half of the current fleet of 84 vessels by the year 2000, if present trends and projections continue--half again. 
These, I believe, are shocking statistics, and, perhaps more than the budget numbers themselves, these statistics demonstrate the imbalance in our overall drug strategy. We have to have a balanced strategy. All portions are needed. 
I have witnessed the lack of our resources and commitment in the region firsthand. This past year, I traveled to the Caribbean several times to see our counternarcotics operations there. I met with the dedicated people on the front lines of our drug interdiction efforts. I witnessed our strategy in action and sat down with the experts, both military and civilian--our experts who are charged with carrying out the monitoring, the detection, and the interdiction of drugs. 
On one of my recent trips, I saw, in particular, Haiti has become the attractive rest stop on the cocaine highway. You can tell, when looking at the map, why that would be. It is strategically located about halfway between the source country, Colombia, and the United States. As the poorest country in the hemisphere, it is extremely vulnerable to the kind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade needs in order to flourish. 
Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving through Haiti has dramatically increased. A U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine movement found that the total amount of cocaine coming from the United States through Haiti jumped from 5-percent in 1996 now up to 19 percent by the end of 1997. 
In response to that, we initiated a U.S. law enforcement operation called Operation Frontier Lance. Operation Frontier Lance utilized Coast Guard cutters, speed boats, and helicopters to detect and capture drug dealers on a 24-hour-per-day basis. This operation was modeled after another successful interdiction effort that was first done off the coast of Puerto Rico, and that operation was called Operation Frontier Shield. Both these operations were done in two different time periods. Operation Frontier Shield utilized nearly 2 dozen ships and aircraft, and Operation Frontier Lance utilized more than a dozen ships and helicopters. 
To make Operation Frontier Lance work ultimately required that we borrow a few ships and helicopters from operations elsewhere in the Caribbean. Because of our scarce resources, frankly, we had to rob Peter to pay Paul, as they say. But these operations produced amazing results. The 6-month operation in Puerto Rico resulted in the seizure of more than 32,000 pounds of cocaine and 120 arrests. The 3-month operation in Haiti resulted in 2,990 pounds of cocaine seized and 22 arrests. 
Mr. President, these operations demonstrate we can make a big difference--a big difference--if we provide the right levels of material and the right levels of manpower to fight drug trafficking. They worked. 
Having had this success, one would think that these operations would serve as a model for the entire region, that we would be able to duplicate them, replicate them. Instead of maintaining these operations, we ended them. This potential roadblock on the cocaine highway is no more. Now in Puerto Rico, we only have a combined total of six air and sea assets doing maintenance operations. 
So this figure, Mr. President, represented by these helicopters and ships has been dramatically changed. That is what has happened. 
That has been the change--down to six in that region. 
In Puerto Rico today, we only have a combined total of six air and sea assets doing maintenance operations. 
In Haiti and the Dominican Republic--off the coast of Haiti and the Dominican Republic--we only have one ship and one helicopter devoted for the drug operation. That is what we are down to here--just one. So we can take all of these off at once. 
We should keep in mind also that since refugees remain a major problem in this area, these very few vessels are not dedicated solely and exclusively to the antidrug effort. Amazingly, no sooner than we built an effective wall against drug traffickers we tore it down. 
While in the region, I was surprised to learn in the eastern Pacific, off the coast of Mexico and Central America, the coast is literally clear for the drug lords to do their business. This is, without a doubt, unacceptable. That whole region--that whole region--is literally clear for the drug lords, the entire eastern Pacific. 
Again, we have no presence there because we lack the resources. An interdiction plan does exist for the region which would involve the deployment of several ships and planes in the region. This operation, however, unfortunately, was canceled. It was canceled before it even got started because the resources were needed elsewhere. To date, the coastal waters in the eastern Pacific remain an open sea expressway for drug business. 
Mr. President, through my visits to the region I have seen firsthand the dramatic decline in our eradication and interdiction capacity. The results of this decline have been a decline in cocaine seizures, a decline in the price of cocaine, and an increase in drug use. This has to stop. It is a clear and imminent danger to the very heart of our society. That is why this legislation is timely. We need to dedicate more resources for international efforts to help reverse this trend. 
I want to make it very clear, as I think I have time and time again, that I strongly support our continued commitment in demand reduction and in law enforcement programs. In the end, I believe that reducing demand is the only real way to permanently end illegal drug use. However, this is not going to happen overnight. That is why we need a comprehensive counterdrug strategy that addresses all components of this problem. 
There is another fundamental reason, why the Federal Government must do more to stop drugs, either at the source or in transit, as they are coming into the United States. If we do not, no one else will. Let me remind my colleagues that our antidrug efforts here at home are done in cooperation with State and local governments and scores of nonprofit and private organizations. However, only the Federal Government has the ability and the responsibility to keep drugs from crossing into this country. Only the Federal Government has the ability to help deal with the problem at the source level. Only the Federal Government has the ability to stop drugs in the transit routes. That is our responsibility, and the buck should stop here. 
But, it is not just an issue of responsibility. I think it is an issue of leadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on an international level if we expect to get the full cooperation of source countries, where the drugs originate, countries such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, as well as countries in the transit zone, including Mexico and the Caribbean island governments. There is little incentive for these countries to invest their limited resources and risk the lives of their law enforcement officers to stop drug trafficking unless we provide the leadership and the resources necessary to make a serious dent in the drug trade. 
Our bill is designed to provide resources and to demonstrate to our friends in the Caribbean and in Central and South America that we intend to lead once again. With this legislation, we can once again make it difficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our country and make drugs far more costly to buy. 
It is clear drug trafficking imposes a heavy toll on law-abiding citizens and communities across our great country. It is time we make it a dangerous and costly business once again for drug traffickers themselves. A renewed investment in international and interdiction programs will make a huge difference, both in the flow and the cost of illegal drugs. It worked before and we believe it can work again. 
As I said at the beginning, my colleagues and I reintroduced this legislation a few weeks ago. Since we introduced our original bill in July, we have received a number of suggestions on ways to improve the legislation, including several provided in conversations I personally had with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional 
minutes to conclude my remarks.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleagues and I thank the Chair. 
Some of these suggestions we incorporated in the House bill first introduced by Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida and Congressman Dennis Hastert of Illinois. The House passed the McCollum-Hastert bill with overwhelming bipartisan support. The final vote was 384-39. Clearly, the overwhelming bipartisan show of support for the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act is a wake-up call--a wake-up call--for leadership. It is time the United States once again led the way in a comprehensive and balanced strategy to reduce drug use; and the time for leadership is now. 
Since House passage of the bill, I have reached out once again to the drug czar and to my friends on the Democrat side of the aisle to try to determine how we can work together to strengthen our drug interdiction efforts and our overall antidrug strategy. Again, we have received very constructive suggestions, and I am hopeful this dialogue will yield positive results in the future. 
Mr. President, the resources we would provide in our legislation should be of no surprise to anyone involved in our drug control policies. The vast majority of the items in this bill are the very items which the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Coast Guard and Customs Service have been requesting for quite some time. Many of these items are detailed, practically item per item and dollar amount, in the United States Interdiction Coordinator report, known as USIC, which was originally requested by the drug czar. 
The new drug bill that we have introduced represents a good-faith effort by the sponsors of this legislation to get something done this year. It includes almost all of the changes made in the House-passed bill and incorporates virtually every suggestion made by the drug czar. Of central concern to the general, as he expressed in his recent testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was the need for greater flexibility. And I agree and I understand. 
Our new bill provides flexibility for the agencies to determine and acquire the assets best needed for their respective drug interdiction missions. It also provides more flexibility for the administration in providing needed resources to Latin American countries. 
Mr. President, thanks to the suggestions we have received, the bill is a better bill. It has far more bipartisan support than the first version. Again, the growing support for this legislation is not surprising. This is not a partisan issue. We need to do more to fight drugs outside our borders. 
But let's be frank. In this antidrug effort, Congress is the antidrug funder but the agencies represented here--the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs, Coast Guard, State and Defense Departments, and the Drug Czar's Office--they are the antidrug fighters. They are the ones who are doing the job. The dedicated men and women of these agencies are working to keep drugs out of the hands of our children. And all we are trying to do is to give them the additional resources they requested to make that work result in a real reduction in drug use. This bill is just the first step in our efforts to work with the agencies represented here. I expect to do more in the future. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that while this bill is an authorization measure, I have already started the process to request the money needed for this bill over 3 years. Even though we introduced the bill for the first time in late July, we have already secured $143 million through the Senate passed fy 1999 appropriation measures. Senators Coverdell, Graham of Florida, Grassley, Bond, Faircloth, and myself requested these funds through the various appropriation measures. 
Given that it will take some time to dedicate some of our larger assets, such as boats, airplanes, and helicopters, we need to start investing in these resources as soon as possible. 
I recognize that even as we finally are beginning to balance our budget, we still have to exercise fiscal responsibility. I believe effective drug interdiction is not only good social policy, it is sound fiscal policy as well. It is important to note that seizing or destroying a ton of cocaine in source or transit areas is more cost-effective than trying to seize the same quantity of drugs at the point of sale. But more important, are the short and long term costs if we do not act to reverse the tragic rise in drug use by our children. 
Let me remind my colleagues that there are more than twice the number of children aged 12 to 17 using drugs today than there were 5 years ago. With more kids using drugs, we have more of the problems associated with youth drug use--violence, criminal activity, and delinquency. Children are dying--either from drug use or drug-related violence. We will have more of the same unless we take action now to restore a balanced drug control strategy. We have to have all the components of our drug strategy working effectively again. 
We did it before and we succeeded. 
If we pass the Western Hemisphere drug elimination bill we can take the first step toward success. We can provide the resources, and most importantly, the leadership to reduce drugs at the source or in transit. 
In the end, Mr. President, that is what this bill is about--it is about leadership--effective leadership. We have an opportunity with this legislation to show and exercise leadership. I hope we can seize this opportunity to stop drug trafficking, and more important, to save lives.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the distinguished career of Walter G. Sellers of Wilberforce, Ohio--who has recently completed his term as president of Kiwanis International. 
Mr. Sellers is the first African-American to serve as Kiwanis International President. For 32 years, he was a member of the Kiwanis Club in Xenia, Ohio. In 1990, he was elected to the Kiwanis International Board of Trustees. He served as Vice President and Treasurer before becoming President. 
All Ohioans are proud of Mr. Sellers' outstanding stewardship of one of the largest service clubs in the world. But we also know that his service to our community extends beyond his work with the Kiwanis organization. He has served as President of the Xenia Board of Education and President of the Ohio School Boards Association. And he has done great work on many other public-service boards in Ohio. 
Walter Sellers has dedicated his life to improving the lives of the people of Ohio, especially in the field of education. We are all extremely grateful for his efforts--and I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him all the best in his next endeavors. 
Mr. President, on a personal note, I have known Walt Sellers for many, many years as a community leader in my home county of Greene County. I also have known Walt for the great work he has done at Central State. I know when I served on the Board of Trustees at Central State in the late 1970s, Walter was there to help guide. So he has been a great asset to that wonderful institution as well.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know, my distinguished colleague from Ohio, John Glenn, is busily preparing for his extraordinary and inspirational return to space. As our best wishes are with him and his wife Annie as they begin the next chapter in their wonderful lives, I would like to take a moment to read a fine tribute to Senator Glenn by those who also dedicated their lives to public service--as members of John Glenn's staff. I am honored to read the following letter addressed to him: October 9, 1998. 
The Hon. John Glenn, U.S. Senator, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator: As your four terms in the United States Senate come to a close and as you prepare to return to space for the first time since your historic 1962 orbital flight, those who have had the honor and the privilege to serve as members of your Senate staff would like to express our gratitude to you. 
Although there have been many staff changes over the years, you have allowed us to pursue extraordinary careers in government and experience opportunities that few can ever know. Some of us have been on your staff since 1975 and many more have served well beyond the average tenure. Beyond our professional careers, you and Annie have made us feel welcome. You generously shared your time with us as our families and children have grown. Your commitment to family is evident in your 55 years of marriage to Annie and that example must have contributed to the eight office marriages in which both spouses first met as staff members. 
We have always been proud to assist a public servant who is held in such high regard. We witnessed that admiration and respect firsthand as we accompanied you in your travels throughout the country and around the world and when we see the many people who come to your offices to conduct business. 
Your patriotic service in war and peace, in space and in the Senate is an inspiration to us. While you remind us that there may be no cure for the common  birthday, you have proven time and again that with determination and hard work dreams do come true. 
Thank you for helping our dreams come true, too. Godspeed John Glenn.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a landmark report released a week ago about asthma, and about how well we as a Nation are dealing with it. The report, called `Asthma in America', frankly concludes that we are doing a poor job. Asthma is a disease that we know how to treat and that we know how to manage. But every year, thousands of Americans die from asthma--and millions more have to be rushed to hospitals to treat emergency asthma symptoms. Let me repeat--we have people dying from asthma--even though we know how to treat this disease. This really is something that we as a nation must address. 
Mr. President, there's been enough public attention about asthma that I would hope we all know the basics by now. But let me restate some basic facts. Asthma is a chronic lung disease caused by inflammation of the lower airways. During an asthma attack, these airways narrow--making it difficult and sometimes impossible to breathe. 
Nearly 15 million Americans have asthma--and 5 million of them are children. for some reason, the prevalence of asthma is rising--in the last two decades, the number of asthma cases have doubled. 
The good news for the 15 million Americans with asthma is that we know a lot about how to treat and manage the disease. We know how to handle asthma attacks once they occur. The most common way, of course, is to use one of the types of asthma inhalers, 
inhalers such as the one I carry with me just about every day. Millions of Americans use this type of inhaler. 
Importantly, we now know a lot about how to prevent asthma attacks. Through drug therapy and through avoiding many well-known triggers that cause asthma attacks, we know enough to make sure these attacks and other complications from asthma are rare indeed. In fact, our knowledge is comprehensive enough that the National Institutes of Health have set some ambitious--but reachable--goals for 
asthma treatment. For example, one of the NIH goals is zero missed days of school or work. Given what we know, we should be able to reach this and the other goals NIH has set. At a minimum, we should be able to come close. 
But the bad news for Americans with asthma is that we are not managing this disease well--and we are not coming anywhere close to meeting the NIH goals. This is the bad news that was spelled out very clearly in the Asthma in America report. Let me go over a few of the findings from the report. 
The NIH goal is that Americans with asthma miss zero days of work or school. But the report tells us that 49 percent of children with asthma and 25 percent of adults with asthma missed school or work because of the disease last year. 
The NIH goal is that the sleep of people with asthma should not be disrupted by difficulty to breathe. But the report tells us that almost one in three asthma patients awaken with breathing problems at least once a week. 
The NIH goal is that we have only a small need for emergency room visits or hospitalizations due to asthma attacks. But the report tells us that nearly six million Americans were hospitalized, treated in emergency rooms, or required other urgent care for asthma in the last year. One out of every three children with asthma--about 1.5 million of them--had to go to an emergency room because of asthma. 
The NIH goal is that individuals with asthma should be able to maintain normal activity levels. But the Asthma in America survey shows that 48 percent of asthma patients say that asthma limits their ability to participate in sports and recreational activities, and 36 percent have difficulty maintaining their usual levels of physical activity. 
Mr. President, all of this is simply unacceptable. If we know how to do better, we must do better. As a nation, we need to seriously evaluate why these shortcomings in the treatment of asthma remain--despite the fact that we do know better. All of us--policymakers; doctors; health insurance companies and HMOs; people with asthma and parents of children with asthma--all of us need to look at this report and try to figure out what's going wrong. 
The report released Tuesday should be viewed as a wake-up call. We knew there were some problems with how well we deal with asthma, but I don't think anybody realized it was this bad. We must and can do better. 
For example, Asthma in America suggests that one of the reasons we are not meeting the national goals for asthma is lack of knowledge among patients. Many of the survey participants were not able to state what the underlying cause of asthma is, how asthma medication should be used, and how to prevent asthma attacks from occurring. It is clear that we should be doing a better job of educating patients, their families and health care providers about the importance of properly managing asthma. 
As a United States Senator, as an American with asthma, and as the father whose children have had asthma, I intend to look at this issue to see what I can do personally and what the federal government can do to address the shortcomings in asthma treatment this report reveals. We only have a day or two left in the 105th Congress. But if we need legislation--if we need greater resources to deal with this problem--I will do everything I can to make sure the 106th Congress addresses this issue and does what is necessary.

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help protect America's abused children. The bill is called the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 1998. I am very proud to be joined in this effort by Senators Rockefeller, Landrieu, and Chafee. I realize that time is running very short in this Congress, so my cosponsors and I will look to move this legislation during the next Congress. 
Mr. President, last year Congress passed a historic piece of legislation called the Adoption and Safe Families Act. The purpose of that bill was to encourage safe and permanent family placements for abused and neglected children--and to decrease the amount of time they have to stay in the foster care system. 
One of the requirements of that new law is more timely decisionmaking by the courts with regard to adoption and other permanent placements for children. The time-lines instituted by the Adoption and Safe Families Act, however, have increased the pressure on already overburdened courts that deal with abused and neglected children. 
If we provide assistance to the courts--so that administrative efficiency and effectiveness are improved--the goals of last year's important legislation will be more readily achieved. Improved courts will help more children find permanent homes more quickly. 
That is the purpose of the bill I am introducing today. While acknowledging that abuse and neglect courts are already committed to quality administration of justice, this bill would further strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the courts in the following five areas:

This morning the Senate will begin a period of morning business lasting until 12 noon. Following morning business, the Senate may consider any legislation that may be cleared by unanimous consent. 
All Members should be aware that yesterday the Senate passed a 2-day continuing resolution that will keep the Government operating until midnight Wednesday, allowing the Congress to continue negotiations on the omnibus appropriations bill. If good progress can be made today, the spending bill may be ready for Senate action as early as Wednesday afternoon. 
As a reminder to all Members, it is hoped that the remaining legislation of the 105th Congress can be cleared by unanimous consent. However, if a rollcall vote is needed on the omnibus bill, all Members will be given ample notice in order to plan their schedules accordingly.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- N O T I C E   If the 105th Congress adjourns sine die on or before October 14, 1998, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the 105th Congress will be published on October 28, 1998, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.   All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through October 27. The final issue will be dated October 28, 1998, and will be delivered on Thursday, October 29.   If the 105th Congress does not adjourn until a later date in 1998, the final issue will be printed at a date to be announced.   None of the material printed in the final issue of the Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any event that occurred after the sine die date.   Senators' statements should also be submitted electronically, either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to the Official Reporters of Debates at `Records@Reporters'.   Members of the House of Representatives' statements may also be submitted electronically on a disk to accompany the signed statement and delivered to the Official Reporter's office in room HT-60.   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the Government Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to oppose the nomination of William Fletcher to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Ninth Circuit. On May 21, 1998, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported out this nominee by a vote of 12 to 6. 
I voted against the nominee. I would like to take a moment this afternoon to explain to my colleagues in the Senate why I voted no on that date and why I intend to vote no today. I intend to vote no today, Mr. President, and I base my opposition on the fact that Mr. Fletcher's writings and statements simply do not convince me that he will help to move the Ninth Circuit closer to the mainstream of judicial thought. And that is the criteria that I applied and will continue to apply in regard to the Ninth Circuit. 
Although some Senators oppose this nominee because of their reading of the antinepotism statute and their concerns in that area, the fact that Mr. Fletcher's mother also serves on the Ninth Circuit, who, as my colleague pointed out, will take senior status, does not trouble me. As I said in the Judiciary Committee, I am not in favor of legislation that, based on family relationships, restricts the power of the President or the power of the Senate to either nominate or confirm judges. 
Having said that, Mr. President, let me restate what does concern me about this nomination. All of us--all of us--should be concerned about what has been going on in the Ninth Circuit over the last few years. Based on the alarming reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit, I have said before and I will say it again for the Record today, I feel compelled to apply a higher standard of scrutiny for Ninth Circuit nominees than I do for nominations to any other circuit. 
Mr. President, I will only support nominees to the Ninth Circuit who possess the qualifications and whose background shows that they have the ability and the inclination to move the circuit back towards the mainstream of judicial thought in this country. Before we consider future Ninth Circuit nominees, I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the evidence, evidence that shows that we have a judicial circuit today that each year continues to move away from the mainstream. 
I believe the President of the United States has very broad discretion to nominate to the Federal bench whomever he chooses, and the Senate should give him due deference when he nominates someone for a Federal judgeship. However, having said that, the Senate does have a constitutional duty to offer its advice and consent on judicial nominations. Each Senator, of course, has his or her own criteria for offering this advice and consent. However, given that these nominations are lifetime appointments, all of us take our advice and consent responsibility very seriously. 
We should keep in mind that the Supreme Court of our country has time to review only a small number of decisions from any circuit. That certainly is true with the Ninth Circuit as well. This means that each circuit, the Ninth Circuit in this case, in reality is the court of last resort. In the case of the Ninth Circuit, they are the court of last resort for the 45 million Americans who reside within that circuit. To preserve the integrity of the judicial system for so many people, I believe we need to take a more careful look at who we are sending to a circuit that increasingly--increasingly--chooses to disregard precedent and ultimately just plain gets it wrong so much of the time. 
Consistent with our constitutional duties, the Senate has to take responsibility for correcting this disturbing reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit. I think we have an affirmative obligation to do that. And that is why I will only support those nominees to the Ninth Circuit who possess the qualifications and who have clearly demonstrated the inclination to move the circuit back towards the mainstream. 
Mr. President, I will want to apply a higher standard of scrutiny to future Ninth Circuit nominees to help ensure that the 45 million people in that circuit receive justice, and justice that is consistent with the rest of the Nation, justice that is predictable and not arbitrary nor dependent on the few times the Supreme Court reviews and ultimately reverses an erroneous Ninth Circuit decision. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two important provisions in this bill--provisions that honor two distinguished Ohioans who are retiring from public service this year--Lou Stokes and John Glenn. 
Mr. President, the bill before us would name the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center. That is a fitting tribute for a number of reasons. 
First, Lou Stokes is a veteran, serving our country in the U.S. Army during the Second World War. 
Second, as ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, Lou Stokes has demonstrated that he is a true champion on behalf of his fellow veterans. 
Third, Lou Stokes in recent years has dedicated his attention to improving the quality of care at the facility that will bear his name. He has been working tirelessly with me to provide funds to improve this facility for our veterans in northeast Ohio. This bill in fact contains $20.8 million to improve the ambulatory care unit at the Stokes Medical Center. This is the latest of a lifetime of examples of how Lou Stokes has made a difference--a difference for veterans and for all his constituents. 
I also am pleased and proud that the bill before us contains a provision that, in my view, represents the deepest feelings of the people of Ohio regarding our senior Senator John Glenn. 
Mr. President, it would be fair to say that the imagination of Ohio, and indeed of all America, has been captured by Senator Glenn's impending space voyage. It is an inspiring odyssey. It is exiciting--it reminds us of the spirit of American possibility we all thrilled to when John Glenn made his first orbit back in 1962. 
Senator Glenn's return to space as a member of the crew of the space shuttle Discovery marks the culmination of an incredible public career. 
This is man who flew 149 heroic combat missions as a Marine pilot in World War II and the Korean war--facing death from enemy fighters and antiaircraft fire. 
And none of us who were alive back in 1962 can forget his historic space flight. I was in Mr. Ed Wingard's science class, at Yellow Springs High School in Yellow Springs, Ohio--we were glued to the TV. Our hearts, and the hearts of all Americans, were with him that day. 
John Glenn reassured us all that America didn't just have a place in space. At the height of the cold war, he reassured us that we have a place--in the future. 
And that, Mr. President, brings me to the purpose of the legislation I am introducing. Even as we speak, in 
Cleveland, Ohio, there are some hardworking men and women of science who are keeping America strong, who are keeping us on the frontier of the human adventure. They are the brilliant, persevering, and dedicated workers of the NASA-Lewis Space Research Center. 
People who understand aviation know how crucially important the cutting-edge work of the NASA-Lewis scientists is, for America's economic and technological future. 
Mr. President, what more fitting tribute could there be to our distinguished colleague, Senator Glenn, than to rename this facility--in his honor? 
That, Mr. President, is the purpose of this legislation. It recognizes not just a man's physical accomplishments--but his spirit. It inspired us in 1962. It inspires us this year. And it will remain strong in the work of all those who expand America's frontiers. 
The facility would be renamed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field--to honor our distinguished colleague, and also the aviation pioneer for whom it is currently named. George Lewis became Director of Aeronautical Research at the precursor to NASA in 1919. It was then called the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, or NACA. 
Lewis visited Germany prior to World War II. When he saw their commitment to aeronautic research, he championed American investment in aeronautic improvements--and created the center which eventually bore his name. 
He and John Glenn are pioneers on the same American odyssey. Ohio looks to both of them with pride--and with immense gratitude for their leadership. 
And I am proud, today, that we were able to include this in the bill. I thank my colleagues for that, and I also want to thank our good friend, Louis Stokes, who has been instrumental in shepherding this measure honoring Senator Glenn in the other body. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report to implement the WIPO treaties. I also strongly support the copyright term extension legislation that we recently passed by voice vote. 
While I would like to congratulate the conferees and their staff for working out a consensus on so many controversial provisions, I feel it is necessary to express my disappointment that we are unable to pass some form of database protection this year. It is unfortunate that a consensus could not be reached on an issue that is so vital to so many people in our country. Agricultural databases, for example, are relied upon by our farmers and by others in our farming supply industry. While computers and the Internet make access to information available at our fingertips, we need to provide adequate protection for those who compile that information in such a user friendly format. Such easy access is essential to health care workers, for example, who need to have fast access to accurate information about which drugs have adverse reactions to other drugs or which antidotes are most effective in counteracting certain poisons. 
I see my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is on the floor, and I would like to ask if he would agree that Congress should pass database legislation as early as possible next year to ensure that those who invest their time, money and effort in compiling and updating databases are protected from having their work pirated both domestically and internationally? Would the Senator from Utah agree that without such protections, database creators may decide that the risk of loss from piracy outweighs any potential gains from creating or updating databases.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, final passage of this bill--S. 2022, comprising the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 and the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act of 1998--is truly a historic achievement. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in both Houses of Congress, for their hard work on this legislation. S. 2022 is based on the principle that technology is the future of police work. It is the number one edge our law enforcement officers are going to have in the struggle against criminals, well into the 21st century. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act (CETA) authorizes $1.25 billion over the next five years in grants administered by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) in the Department of Justice, with reliance upon the expertise of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), also in the Department of Justice, to help every state to establish or upgrade its use of information and identification and forensics technologies across the entire criminal justice system. Title II of the Act, the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act, establishes an Interstate Compact which binds the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, upon approval by the state legislatures, the states to participate in the non-criminal justice access program of the Interstate Identification Index (III) in accordance with the Compact and established system policies. 
I would like, first, to address Title I of this legislation.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for this bill offered by our distinguished colleague from Rhode Island. I want to thank Senator Chafee for all the work he has done, and especially his effort to addressing some of the concerns I had about the bill. 
The North American Wetlands Conservation Act, or NAWCA, is a blueprint for successful environmental protection--through voluntary cooperation among government agencies, private conservation organizations, and landowners. It is a matching fund which involves state, federal, and private partners in protecting and restoring wetlands across the country. 
Mr. President, this is very important for the environment. Wetlands serve a multitude of purposes. Obviously, they provide critical habitat and breeding grounds for migratory birds, fish and aquatic plants. But their benefit goes far beyond wildlife habitat. Wetlands are nature's sponges--absorbing heavy rains and minimizing the damaging effects of floods and erosion. Wetlands are also natural filters, trapping and isolating potentially damaging pollution and improving the quality of our lakes and rivers. 
Since 1990, there have been 9 NAWCA projects in Ohio which have protected almost 9,000 acres of critical wetlands. NAWCA has contributed $3.3 million towards these projects--and those funds were matched by $6.9 million from groups such as Ducks Unlimited and Ohio's Division of Wildlife. 
Last summer, I was able to visit one of these projects, Metzger Marsh in northwest Ohio. I was impressed, not only with the beauty and diversity of the wildlife at this marsh, but also with the cooperation among government, private agencies, and landowners that protected this area. 
While there are several partners working together on this effort, I would like to mention one organization in particular. Ducks Unlimited is a national nonprofit conservation organization with over 18,000 members in Ohio alone. It has contributed over $80 million in matching funds to support NAWCA projects across the country. This is over three times the amount contributed by any other conservation organization. In light of the longstanding commitment of Ducks Unlimited to this project, I believe they should continue to serve on the NAWCA Council--and I would like to thank Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, Inhofe and Hutchison for insuring that the organization's membership on this council will continue. 
Mr. President, this is a very important piece of environmental legislation, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a 1985 speech attended by President Ronald Reagan, the acclaimed writer and lecturer Elie Wiesel, a witness and survivor of the Holocaust, recounted the lessons he learned over the years since this dark chapter in our history. He said: 
I learned that in extreme situations when human lives and dignity are at stake, neutrality is a sin. It helps the killers, not the victims. I learned the meaning of solitude, Mr. President. We were alone, desperately alone. 
Mr. President, years from now, we may hear similar words from some of the survivors of the recent atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia. This past week, Americans and people from all over the world have been witness to some horrific images coming from the tiny province of Kosovo in the Republic of Serbia. These images, of murdered ethnic Albanian civilians, from the very young to the very old, are the latest in a series of systematic attacks over the last 7 months by Serbian military and security forces against Albanian Kosovars--both rebel insurgents and unarmed civilians. 
The victims of this latest massacre included old men, women, and children. The death toll since last February is estimated to be as low as 500 and as many as 1,000 although, frankly, no one knows how many victims there have been. Homes have been firebombed. Entire villages have been bulldozed to the ground. Hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars literally have run for their lives and are seeking refuge in the forests and mountains of Kosovo, or in the neighboring states of Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia. 
Mr. President, what perhaps makes last weekend's attack more difficult to bear is that it causes us to pause and wonder if these lives could have been saved if NATO had stepped in sooner. I think we all know the answer to that. 
Congress has struggled with the issue of brutal violence in the Balkans for the better part of this decade. The images broadcast this week are a somber reminder of very similar pictures that came from places not far from Kosovo--places like Mostar or Tuzla in Bosnia. I can recall, as I am sure can many of my colleagues, during our many discussions on Bosnia in 1995, several of our colleagues, including our former Majority Leader, Bob Dole, warning us that tensions in Kosovo could lead to the level of outright violence and ethnic cruelty that crippled Bosnia. 
I am certain that this is one instance in which Senator Dole today wishes he had been wrong. 
It has long been thought that Kosovo was an area where America's national resolve was clear. In 1992, President George Bush warned President Milosevic that violent acts against Albanian Kosovars would lead to military intervention. 
President Bush's warning was prompted by President Milosevic's single-handed efforts to strip Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989, and abolish Kosovo's parliament and government 1 year later. 
At that time, the Albanian Kosovars, which represent 90 percent of the total population of Kosovo, chose to exercise a form of nonviolent protest against the Serbian government. A shadow government, parliament, and society emerged. Besides electing their own President and legislature, Kosovars established their own education and medical systems. 
Although there were scattered reports of human rights violations against Albanian Kosovars during this period, they were not connected with the reports of an extensive ethnic cleansing campaign underway in Bosnia. Many factors were involved, but perhaps most important was the threat of a larger regional war that could be sparked if the carnage in Bosnia spread to Kosovo. Besides the United States, the countries of Albania, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece at one time or another warned that violence in Kosovo could force any one of these countries, if not all of them, to intervene. Certainly, with his resources engaged in the conflict in Bosnia, Serbian President Milosevic could not risk taking action in Kosovo. 
Now, with instability in Albania and 
Macedonia, and the growth of the pro-independence faction of Kosovars known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, President Milosevic has engaged his security and military forces in Kosova under the guise of putting down the KLA. 
Mr. President, from the evidence that we have, Mr. Milosevic has gone beyond a simple police action. This has been a seven month campaign of intimidation and conquest. 
Our government, as well as European governments, vowed not to allow in Kosovo a repeat of the vicious war crimes we found in Bosnia. Yet, some who have recently visited the region, believe these crimes have already happened. The extent of these crimes cannot be confirmed. Relief workers and humanitarian organizations are being barred from reaching victims and refugees. 
Should this be a surprise to any of us? Certainly not. Slobodan Milosevic is a cold, calculating tyrant. He is a war criminal. He was not moved by diplomatic threats in Bosnia--what drove him to the Dayton peace talks was the military success of the Bosniak-Croat alliance in reclaiming land once held by the Serbs. 
Kosovo is no different. Milosevic and his subordinates often have pledged to end the carnage in Kosova. Yet, no pledge has been followed by a clear cessation of hostilities. Mr. Milosevic has demonstrated that he will not withdraw his forces until he feels he has achieved the most from the use of violence. And he will not engage in peace talks unless he believes that no other course of action will preserve his position or advance his goals. 
So it should not be a surprise to any of us that now, as NATO prepares for a military response, the Serbian government has declared victory and now is making plans to reduce its military and police presence in the region. 
We have been witness to a brutal military and police action against unarmed civilians that was done with the expectation, if not certainty, that both Europe and the United States would not respond, or indeed would not even know how to respond. 
There is little to ponder about what must occur. 
The threat or actual use of military action by NATO, such as air strikes, is needed if some form of Serbian withdrawal or cease fire in the Kosovo province is going to occur. 
I believe we cannot escape the fact that, in the short term, some form of NATO or United Nations presence on the ground will be needed to police any cease fire or withdrawal, or to ensure the transport of needed food, medical and other supplies to the refugees. In addition, war crime investigators will need to be able to determine the actual atrocities committed and who is responsible. 
It is uncertain if ground forces will be called for by NATO. In fact, we know very little of what NATO plans to do beyond air strikes. That is of concern to me because a number of uncertainties remain--uncertainties that if left unresolved will not deal with the root cause of the conflict between the Serbs and Albanian Kosovars. The administration needs to articulate a clear strategy or plan to address the current humanitarian crisis, and the even larger questions about the political future of the Kosovars over the long term. 
For example, what fate lies ahead for the estimated 300,000 Kosovars who were uprooted from their homes and villages and forced to seek refuge as far away as Albania, Macedonia, or Bosnia? And of those refugees, what lies ahead for the 50,000 or more who are in hiding in the hills within the province--without shelter, food, or medicine--with winter just around the corner? 
Clearly, our first and foremost goal is to achieve a cease-fire. I am hopeful NATO air strikes can ensure a cease-fire. Second, we must ensure humanitarian organizations can safely reach out to these refugee populations without fear of obstruction or even destruction by hostile Serbian forces. 
And once they get cared for, when can the displaced Kosovars return home? And what kind of home do they expect to see when they return? It is estimated that approximately 200 villages in the province have been completely destroyed or heavily damaged. When can they expect to see some restoration of the kind of livelihood that affords them the chance to live in peace? 
These are the harder questions, but right now, it seems that NATO has yet to consider how they are to be answered. These issues must be addressed and answered if this conflict is going to be contained over the long term. 
I'm sure we all agree that these issues must be addressed and answered not at either end of a rifle, but at a conference table. Yet, how can NATO get both sides--the Kosovars and the Serbs--to the conference table? That remains unclear. 
And should some kind of long-term agreement be reached, how will that be enforced? What role, if any, can we expect NATO to play to ensure long-term peace in Kosovo? That too remains unclear. 
What is clear is that the actions we take in the next few weeks have implications for long-term peace not just in the province but throughout the Balkans. That's why it's in NATO's interest to act, and act with resolve. Unfortunately, the only resolve we see is to strike at the Serbs by air, but nothing more beyond that. 
NATO needs to begin to look at these larger questions and soon if our resolve for peace will achieve results and be real over the long-term. It's in our interests to do so. We still risk the threat of a larger conflict in the region, involving Albania, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece. We also put in jeopardy the progress we have made thus far to maintain peace in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, we cannot and should not dictate the terms of any agreement between the Serbs and Kosovars, but NATO can insist--through force if necessary--that peace be achieved through cooperation, not conquest. 
This, Mr. President, ought to be the U.S. policy. I thank the chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Employment Security Financing Act of 1998, a bill which seeks to reform the unemployment insurance program by giving states greater control over the management of their unemployment insurance system. 
Specifically, under this legislation, beginning January 1, 2000, states would begin to collect Federal unemployment taxes, or `FUTA taxes,' in addition to the state unemployment taxes that they currently collect. The legislation also repeals the `temporary' 0.2 percent FUTA surtax in 2004, restructures the accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund and reduces paperwork for employers. Most importantly, this legislation will return to the states the funding necessary to effectively operate their employment security systems and services. 
Reform of the unemployment insurance program is essential to a state like Ohio which receives less than 39 cents of each employer FUTA dollar. This shortfall in funding has led to the closing of 22 local employment service offices during the past four years. In order to make up for the shortfall of FUTA dollars, the Ohio legislature has appropriated more than $50 million during the last four years to pay for employment services, something that should be funded by FUTA dollars. This appropriation of state tax dollars forces Ohio taxpayers to pay twice to fund unemployment services. 
Ohio is not alone--since 1990, less than 59 cents of every employer FUTA tax dollar has been returned to the states for funding employment security. As a result, $2 billion sits in Federal accounts rather than being used as it was intended--to help put people back to work. 
This is an important issue that Congress needs to consider. While this legislation obviously will not be considered before adjournment, I look forward to working with Representative Clay Shaw, the House sponsor of this bill, on legislation that can meet the budget rules, yet still achieve necessary reform of the unemployment insurance program.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of former Representative Chalmers Wylie, who passed away on August 14, 1998, at the age of 77. 
Chalmers Wylie was elected to the House of Representatives in 1966, and went on to serve thirteen distinguished terms. His career included service as Ranking Member of the House Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs Committee. 
Mr. Wylie dedicated his life to public service--and especially to the service of the people of Ohio's 15th district. While serving in the Army during World War II, he received the Purple Heart for wounds sustained while aiding fallen soldiers in Germany. In addition, he was awarded the Silver and Bronze Star, the Presidential Unit Citation with two oak-leaf clusters, the French Croix de Guerre and the Belgian Fourragere. 
Undoubtedly, Mr. Wylie's war-time service provided him with a special understanding of the needs of veterans. This experience was particularly apparent in the House Veterans' Committee, where he fought for veterans and was instrumental in improving veteran access to medical care in Columbus, Ohio through the establishment of the Veterans' Affairs Outpatient Clinic. 
Along with my distinguished colleague Senator Glenn, I am introducing legislation today to name the Department of Veterans' Affairs Outpatient Clinic, located at 543 Taylor Avenue in Columbus, Ohio, the `Chalmers P. Wylie Veterans Outpatient Clinic.' This is a companion bill to H.R. 4602, which was introduced by our distinguished House colleague Deborah Pryce, with the support of the entire Ohio delegation. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will support the swift passage of this fitting tribute to our friend Chalmers Wylie, for his years of dedication to veterans, to Ohio, and to America.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with over 25 of my Senate colleagues to reintroduce the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Our bipartisan legislation calls for an additional $2.6 billion investment in international counter-narcotic efforts over the next 3 years. With the additional resources provided in this legislation, we can begin to restore a comprehensive eradication, interdiction and crop substitution strategy. 
I say `restore,' Mr. President, because we currently are not making the same kind of effort to keep drugs from entering the United States that we used to. Drugs are now easy to find, and easy to buy. As a result, the amount of drugs sold on our streets, and the number of people who use drugs, especially young people, is unprecedented. 
The facts demonstrate this sobering trend. The August 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration list the following disturbing facts: 
In 1997, 13.9 million Americans age 12-and-over cited themselves as `current users' of illicit drugs--a 7% increase of 1996's figure of 13 million Americans. That translates to nearly a million new users of drugs each year. 
From 1992-1997, the number of children aged 12-to-17 who are using illegal drugs has more than doubled, and has increased by 27% just from 1996-1997 alone. 
For kids 12-to-17, first time heroin use, which can be fatal surged an astounding 875% from 1991-1996. The overall number of past month heroin users increased 378% from 1993 to 1997. 
We cannot in good conscience and with a straight face say that our drug control strategy is working. It is not. More children are using drugs. With an abundant supply, drug traffickers now are seeking to increase their sales by targeting children ages 10 through 12. This is nothing less than an assault on the future of our children, and the future of the country itself. This is nothing less than a threat to our national values, and yes, even our national security. 
All of this begs the question: What are we doing wrong? Clearly, there is no one simple answer. However, one thing is clear: our overall drug strategy is imbalanced. To be effective, our national drug strategy must have a strong commitment in the following three areas: (1) demand reduction, which consists of prevention, treatment, and education programs. These are 
administered by all levels of government--federal, state and local--as well as non-profit and private organizations; (2) domestic law enforcement, which again, has to be provided by all three levels of government; and (3) international eradication and interdiction efforts, which are the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. 
These three components are interdependent. A strong investment in each of them is necessary for each to work individually and collectively. For example, a strong effort to destroy or seize drugs at the source or outside of the United States both reduces the amount of drugs in the country, and drives up the street price. And as we all know, higher prices will reduce consumption. This in turn helps our domestic law enforcement and demand reduction efforts. 
As any football fan will tell you, a winning team is one that plays well at all three phases of the game--offense, defense, and special teams. The same is true with out anti-drug strategy--all three components have to be effective if our strategy is going to be a winning effort. 
While I think the current administration has shown a clear commitment to demand reduction and domestic law enforcement programs, the same cannot be said for the international eradication and interdiction components. This was not always the case. 
In 1987, the $4.79 billion federal drug control budget was divided as follows: 29% for demand reduction programs; 38% for domestic law enforcement; and 33% for international eradication and interdiction efforts. This balanced approach worked. It achieved real success. Limiting drug availability through interdiction drove up the street price of drugs, reduced drug purity levels, and consequently reduced overall drug use. From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 percent--cocaine use dropped by 35 percent. And there was a 25 percent reduction in overall drug use by adolescent Americans. 
This balanced approach ended in 1993. By 1995, the $13.3 billion national drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent for demand reduction; 53 percent for law enforcement; and 12 percent for international and interdiction efforts. Though the overall anti-drug budget increased almost threefold from 1987 to 1995, the percentage allocated for international eradication and interdiction efforts decreased dramatically. This distribution only recently has started to change, but the imbalance is still there. In the President's proposed $17 billion drug control budget for 1999, 34 percent would be allocated for demand reduction; 52% for law enforcement; and 14% for international and interdiction efforts. 
Those are the numbers, but what really matters are what these numbers get you in terms of resources. The hard truth is that our drug interdiction presence--the ship, air and man power dedicated to keeping drugs from reaching our country--has eroded dramatically. Here are just a few examples: 
The Department of Defense funding for counter-narcotics decreased from $504.6 million in 1992 to $214.7 million in 1995, a 57% decrease in only three years. As a result, flight hours by Airborne Warning and Control Systems--known as AWACs planes--dropped from 38,100 hours in 1992 to 17,713 hours by 1996, a 54% reduction. 
At the beginning of the decade, the U.S. Customs service operated its counter-narcotics activities around the clock. This made sense because drug trafficking truly is a 7 day/24 hour enterprise. Today, the Customs Service does not have the resources needed to maintain around-the-clock operations. At a recent hearing on our original legislation, a representative of the U.S. Customs Service testified that the Customs service has 84 boats in the Caribbean conducting drug apprehension efforts--down from 200 vessels in 1990. The Customs Service estimates that they expect to have only half of the current fleet of 84 vessels by the year 2000. 
Mr. President, these are shocking statistics. And perhaps more than the budget numbers themselves, these statistics demonstrate the imbalance in our overall strategy. I have witnessed the lack of our resources and commitment in the region fisthand. This past year I traveled to the Caribbean several times to see our counter-narcotics operations there. I met with the dedicated people on the frontlines of our drug interdiction efforts. I witnessed our strategy in action, and sat down with the experts--both military and civilian--who are charged with carrying out the monitoring, detection and interdiction of drugs. 
On one of my recent trips I saw that in particular, Haiti has become an attractive rest-stop on the cocaine highway. It is strategically located about halfway between the source country--Colombia--and the United States. As the poorest country in the hemisphere, it is extremely vulnerable to the kind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade needs in order to flourish. 
Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving through Haiti has dramatically increased. A U.S. government interagency assessment on cocaine movement found that the total amount of cocaine coming to the United States through Haiti jumped from 5 percent in 1996 to 19 percent by the end of 1997. 
In response, we initiated a US law enforcement operation called Operation Frontier Lance, which utilized Coast Guard Cutters, 
speedboats, and helicopters to detect and capture drug dealers on a 24 hour per day basis. This operation was modeled after another successful interdiction effort that was first done off the coast of Puerto Rico, called Operation Frontier Shield. 
Both these operations were done at two different time periods. Operation Frontier Shield utilized nearly two dozen ships and aircraft; and Operation Frontier Lance utilized more than a dozen ships and helicopters. To make Frontier Lance work required that we borrow a few ships and helicopters from operations elsewhere in the Caribbean. Because of our scare resources, we had to rob Peter to help Paul. 
These operations produced amazing results. The six month operation in Puerto Rico resulted in the seizure of more than 32,900 pounds of cocaine and 120 arrests. The three month operation in Haiti and the Dominican Republic resulted in 2,990 pounds of cocaine seized and 22 arrests. 
These operations demonstrate we can make a big difference if we provide the right levels of material and manpower to fight drug trafficking. One would think that these operations would serve as a model for the entire region. Instead of maintaining these operations, we ended them. This potential roadblock on the cocaine highway is no more. 
Now, in Puerto Rico we only have a combined total of 6 air and sea assets doing maintenance operations. 
In Haiti and the Dominican Republic, we have only 1 ship and 1 helicopter devoted for the drug operation. Keep in mind that since refugees remain a major problem in this area, these very few vessels are not dedicated solely to drug interdiction. Amazingly, no sooner than we build an effective wall against drug traffickers, we tear it down. 
While in the region, I was surprised to learn that in the Eastern Pacific, off the coast of Mexico and Central America, the coast is literally clear for the drug lords to do their business. This is, without any doubt, unacceptable. 
Again, we have no presence there because we lack the resources. An interdiction plan does exist for the region, which would involve the deployment of several ships and planes in the region. This operation, unfortunately, was canceled before it even got started because the resources were needed elsewhere. To date, the coastal waters in the Eastern Pacific remain an open sea expressway for drug business. 
Mr. President, through my visits to the region, I have seen firsthand the dramatic decline in our eradication and 
interdiction capability. The results of this decline have been a decline in cocaine seizures, a decline in the price of cocaine, and an increase in drug use. This has to stop. It is a clear and imminent danger to the very heart of our society. 
That is why the legislation I am introducing today is timely. We need to dedicate more resources for international efforts to help reverse this trend. Now I want to make it very clear that I strongly support our continued commitment in demand reduction and law enforcement programs! In the end, I believe that reducing demand is the only real way to permanently end illegal drug use. However, this will not happen overnight. That is why we need a comprehensive counter drug strategy that addresses all components of this problem. 
There's another fundamental reason why the federal government must do more to stop drugs either at the source or in transit to the United States. If we don't, no one else will. Let me remind our colleagues that our anti-drug efforts here at home are done in cooperation with state and local governments and scores of non-profit and private organizations. However, only the federal government has the responsibility to keep drugs from crossing our borders. 
It's not just an issue of responsibility--it's an issue of leadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on an international level if we expect to get the full cooperation of source countries, such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, as well as countries in the transit zone, including Mexico and the Caribbean island governments. There's little incentive for these countries to invest their limited resources, and risk the lives of their law enforcement officers to stop drug trafficking, unless we provide the leadership and resources necessary to make a serious dent in the drug trade. 
Our bill is designed to provide the resources and demonstrate to our friends in the Caribbean, and in Central and South America that we intend to lead once again. With this legislation, we can once again make it difficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our nation, and make drugs far more costly to buy. It's clear drug trafficking imposes a heavy toll on law abiding citizens and communities across our country. It's time we make it a dangerous and costly business for drug traffickers themselves. A renewed investment in international and interdiction programs will make a huge difference--both in the flow and cost of illegal drugs. It worked before and we believe it can work again. 
Mr. President, as I said at the beginning, my colleagues and I are reintroducing this legislation. Since we introduced our original bill in July, we have received a number of suggestions on ways to improve the legislation, including several provided in 
conversations I personally had with General Barry McCaffery, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy--otherwise known as the Drug Czar's office. Some of these suggestions were incorporated in the House bill first introduced by Congressmen Bill McCollum of Florida and Dennis Hastert of Illinois. The House passed the McCollum/Hastert bill with overwhelmingly bi-partisan support. The final vote was 384 to 39! Clearly, the overwhelming, bipartisan show of support for the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act is a wake up call for leadership--it's time the United States once again lead the way in a comprehensive and balanced strategy to reduce drug use. And the time for leadership is now. 
Since House passage of the bill, I have reached out once again to General McCaffrey, and to my friends on the Democrat side of the aisle, on how we can work together to pass this legislation before we adjourn. I made it clear to General McCaffrey of my commitment to work with him and the Administration to strengthen our drug interdiction efforts, and our overall anti-drug strategy. Again, I received several suggestions to improve the bill from the General, but the Administration has shown no interest in getting this bill passed this year. 
The resources we would provide in our legislation should be of no surprise to General McCaffrey or anyone involved in our drug control policies. The vast majority of the items in this bill are the very items which the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Coast Guard and Customs Service have been requesting for quite some time now. Many of these items are detailed, practically item per item and dollar amount, in a United States Interdiction Coordinator report, known as USIC, which was requested by the General. 
The bill we introduce today represents a good faith effort by the sponsors of this legislation to get something done this year. It includes almost all the changes made in the House-passed bill, and incorporates virtually every suggestion made to me by General McCaffrey. Of central concern to the General, as he expressed in his recent testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was the need for greater flexibility. The bill we introduce today provides flexibility for the agencies to determine and acquire the assets best needed for their respective drug interdiction missions. It also provides more flexibility for the Administration in providing needed resources to Latin American countries. 
Mr. President, thanks to the suggestions we have received, the bill we are introducing today is a better bill. It has far more bipartisan support than the first version. Again, the growing support for this legislation is not surprising. This is not a partisan issue--we need to do more to fight drugs outside our 
borders. 
Let's be frank--in this anti-drug effort--Congress is the anti-drug funder, but the agencies represented here--the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs, Coast Guard, State and Defense Departments, and the Drug Czar's office--they are the anti-drug fighters. The dedicated men and women at these agencies are working to keep drugs out of the hands of our kids, and all we're trying to do is to give them the additional resources they have requested to make that work result in a real reduction in drug use. This bill is just the first step in our efforts to work with the agencies represented here. I expect to do more in the future. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that while this bill is an authorization measure, I have already started the process to request the money needed for this bill over three years. Even though we introduced the bill for the first time in late July, we have already secured $143 million through the Senate passed FY 1999 appropriation measures. Senators Coverdell, Graham of Florida, Grassley, Bond, Faircloth, and myself requested these funds through the various appropriation measures. 
The cosponsors of this bill also are requesting the assistance of Senators Stevens and Byrd--the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations committee--in obtaining funding as part of any emergency supplemental appropriations bill we may consider before we adjourn. Given that it will take some time to dedicate some of our larger assets, such as boats, airplanes, and helicopters, we need to start our investment as soon as possible. I understand a similar effort is underway in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, I recognize that even as we finally are beginning to balance our budget, we still have to exercise fiscal responsibility. I believe effective drug interdiction is not only good social policy, it is sound fiscal policy as well. It is important to note that seizing or destroying a ton of cocaine in source or transit areas is more cost-effective than trying to seize the same quantity of drugs at the point of sale. But more important, are the short and long term costs if we do not act to reverse the tragic rise in drug use by our children. 
Let me remind my colleagues that there are more than twice the number of children aged 12 to 17 using drugs today than there were five years ago. With more kids using drugs, we have more of the problems associated with youth drug use--violence, criminal activity and delinquency. We will have more of the same unless we take action now to restore a balanced drug control strategy. We have to have all the components of our drug strategy working effectively again. 
We did it before and we succeeded. 
If we pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Bill we can take the first step toward success. We can provide the resources, and most importantly, the leadership to reduce drugs at the source or in transit. 
In the end, Mr. President, that's what this bill is about--it's about leadership--effective leadership. We have an opportunity with this legislation to show and exercise leadership. I hope we can seize this opportunity to stop drug trafficking, and more important, to save lives.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the Child Custody Protection Act of 1998, which would make it a crime to transport a child across state lines to circumvent a state law requiring parental involvement or a judicial waiver for a minor to obtain an abortion. 
Twenty-two states have laws saying a parent or guardian has to be notified or their consent given if a child is trying to get an abortion. What's happening now--far too often--is that people who aren't parents or guardians are taking the children across state lines, secretly, to get abortions in another state where parental notification isn't required. 
It is my hope that this bill will achieve two important goals--to protect the health of children and to protect the rights of parents. In fact, Mr. President, I believe that empowering parents is the single biggest investment we can make in ensuring the health of our children. 
Parents have the right and duty to be involved in the moral and medical decisions that affect their children's welfare. 
When it comes to parental notification on abortion, the American people have reached a clear consensus. By a huge majority--80 percent--they favor parental notification. And 74 percent favor not just parental notification, but parental consent. This is a clear expression of the national wisdom. This legislation is an effort to make that kind of informed decision possible. 
Earlier this year, we worked on another bill, one that is now law. In that bill, the Administration and the Congress mandated that the flight of a parent to another state to avoid paying child support is a Federal crime. I worked with Senator Kohl to champion the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act in order to protect the interests of America's children. We have to pursue zealously those who would harm our children, either by omission or by commission. 
Mr. President, the very same principle is embodied in the Child Custody Protection Act. There are those living among us who would place our children in harm's way by transporting them across state lines to achieve dangerous goals, both physically and emotionally. One such goal is abortion. The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding the rights of parents is completely violated by the ability of others to transport children to another state to obtain an abortion. As a nation, we must use all the resources available to us in order to protect our children, and our families, from this conduct. 
That is our purpose here today. I thank Senator Abraham for his strong leadership in bringing this legislation forward. 
I am sorry that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have rejected our unanimous consent agreement. It was a fair agreement that provided unlimited debate on germane amendments to this bill. Unfortunately, the vote that we will take shortly to invoke cloture to end debate on the bill, may really be a vote to kill the bill if it fails. Let's be frank those voting to continue debate are really voting against the health of our children and the rights of parents. I would implore my colleagues on the other side to vote for cloture--for our kids.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, for arranging this opportunity to address some of the key accomplishments of the 105th Congress. 
In just a matter of weeks, we will close the curtain on a productive and arguably historic Congress. Certainly, our most significant achievement was passage of the first balanced budget plan in a generation. Few pundits took us seriously when the Republican Congress came to power pledging to balance the budget by 2002. We were not only serious, but we're on the verge of success. A strong U.S. economy, spurred in part by a Congress committed to ending runaway deficit spending, has brought us to a balanced budget four years ahead of schedule. Now, for the first time, we're having debates on government surpluses, not government deficits. 
We've changed the debate on taxes as well. Last year, we passed the first real tax cut in 16 years. We provided a $500-per-child tax credit for working families; inheritance tax relief; capital gains tax relief; flexible individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to encourage savings; and Alternative Minimum Tax relief for all businesses--large and small. And we're far from finished. We're on the verge of putting an end to the marriage penalty, and giving small business owners and family farmers the ability to fully deduct health insurance--something 
that is long, long overdue. And I know the current occupant of the Chair has been very much involved with that throughout the years. 
We've not only changed the Tax Code, we've also reformed the tax collector. Our IRS reform bill will put a stop to IRS abuses against law-abiding citizens, create an improved management structure for the IRS, and establish new protections and rights for all taxpayers. 
Ours has been an agenda designed to make a difference in the lives of ordinary Americans. I'd like to talk about three achievements I have focused on--issues that will improve and save lives, and further move our country forward.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in approximately 40 minutes, this Senate is going to cast a historic vote. We are going to have the opportunity to, again, define who we are as a people. 
I urge my colleagues, as I have in the past, to vote to override the President's veto. I ask unanimous consent that a letter which I have be printed into the Record. This is a letter dated May 8, 1997. This is a letter that is signed by a number of law professors.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this letter addresses a lot of the concerns that were expressed on the floor yesterday about the constitutionality of this piece of legislation. I call Members' attention to portions of this letter. They will have an opportunity to, of course, read the entire letter. This is what, in part, the letter says: 
We write to you as law professors in support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban. . . . We do not write as partisans. We are both Democrats and Republicans, and we are of different minds on various aspects of the abortion issue. We are concerned, however, that baseless legal arguments are being offered to oppose a ban on partial-birth abortions, and we are unanimous in concluding that such a ban is constitutional. 
The destruction of human beings who are partially born is, in our judgment, entirely outside the legal framework established in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. No Supreme Court decision, including these, ever addressed the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of partially born children. In fact, Roe noted explicitly that it did not decide the constitutionality of that part of the Texas law which forbade --and still forbids--killing a child in the process of delivery. 
Even should a court in the future decide a law banning the partial-birth procedure is to be evaluated within the Roe/Casey `abortion' framework, we believe such a ban would survive legal scrutiny thereunder. The partial-birth procedure entails mechanical cervical dilation, forcing a breech delivery, and exposing a mother to severe bleeding from exposure to shards of her child's crushed skull. Before viability, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional only if it creates an `undue burden' on the judicially established right to have an abortion. A targeted ban of single, maternal-health-endangering procedure cannot constitute such a burden. 
The letter goes on to quote C. Everett Koop, who has been quoted on this floor before on this issue. 
Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure could impose a significant threat to both her immediate health and future fertility. 
It is abundantly clear that this law is constitutional. I again ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the override. 
I first had the opportunity to listen to this debate several years ago when a nurse from my home State of Ohio, nurse Brenda Shafer, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is the first person, really, to draw public attention to this procedure. She was pro-choice. She was called in on a temporary basis to go to Dr. Haskell's abortion clinic in Dayton, OH. What she saw and what she described, I think, has shocked the Nation. This pro-choice nurse became a person adamantly opposed to partial-birth abortion. She described it in detail, as has been described on this floor many, many times. It is something that no civilized society should tolerate. 
This vote that we are going to cast in a moment is about who we are as a people, what we tolerate, and what we do not tolerate. It is time for this country, for the Senate, and this Congress, to say this barbaric procedure we simply will no longer tolerate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, let me congratulate my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania. 
Senator Domenici said it very, very well: Keep trying and keep trying, and eventually we will succeed, because I believe what we are trying to do is right. The vast majority of the American people agree with us. We will succeed. 
I congratulate Senator Santorum, my friend from Pennsylvania, who has fought so hard, who has argued so eloquently on this floor. 
I would also like to associate myself with the Senator from New York, the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator from Arkansas, who just in the last few minutes so eloquently argued in favor of our override of this veto tomorrow morning. 
Mr. President, I think it is truly regrettable that we still have to debate this after so many years. 
We are talking about a procedure that is morally wrong. The facts are really not at issue. No one denies this procedure is designed to kill, to kill a living, partially delivered baby, a baby that is usually 5 to 6 months old, 5 to 6 months in gestation. 
No one denies that only a few inches separate this barbaric practice from outright murder. Partial-birth abortion is perhaps the only legal procedure where live birth and death become virtually simultaneous. 
The vote we will cast tomorrow morning will be a clear moral decision about life and about death. It is a decision really about who we are as a people, our moral identity as a people. Banning this procedure represents the moral consensus of the American people by an overwhelming margin. 
Dr. LeRoy Sprang and Mark Neerhof stated in the Journal of the American Medical Association: 
Partial-birth abortion should not be performed because it is needlessly risky, inhumane and ethically unacceptable. 
Mr. President, I strongly agree with this characterization, as do the American people. It is no secret that America has been experiencing a moral crisis, and we have reached a crossroads. The questions which I asked on this floor just about a year ago, I guess, about partial-birth abortion really remain unanswered. These questions are more profound than ever. What does our toleration for this immoral practice say for us as a country? What does it say about us as a people? I believe one judges a country by what it is for but also you judge a country by what it is against. We judge a country by what it tolerates. We tolerate too much in this country. We tolerate a lot in this Nation. But at some point we simply have to draw the line. We have to stop hiding behind the phrase, `Oh, I really don't like this but it's someone else's private matter and I don't want to interfere. We will put up with it. It's not my business.' 
We have to stop hiding behind that. In a country that is based on respect for freedom, this is, of course, a very important principle. But it does have limits, limits that are based on the same respect for human rights that is the very foundation for freedom itself. Why, after all, is the argument based on personal freedom so powerful in our political debates? It is because we all have in our hearts the immortal words of Thomas Jefferson, the words that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that we have the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is our profound moral conviction. 
But what does it say about our moral convictions when we continue to allow in this country this barbaric practice? What does it say about us as a people? Does allowing this practice bespeak a commitment to the sanctity of human life, of a human person? No, if we do not say at some point that our tolerance draws the line on a practice so brutal and so inhumane, we run the severe risk of eroding this moral foundation that really lies at the base of all our other freedoms. A country that allows this barbaric procedure to be inflicted on innocent human lives is a country that cannot be trusted when it proclaims a respect for other freedoms. What freedom will such a country not discard in the name of mere convenience? 
For me, the decision is clear. This is where we draw the line. Now is the time that we draw it. We must ban this uncivilized, this barbaric, this immoral procedure, and we must do it tomorrow morning. 
Many people agree that this procedure is closer to infanticide than it is to abortion. One of the reasons banning this procedure has been supported by doctors, including the American Medical Association, the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, and even by otherwise pro-choice individuals, including even some abortionists, is because it is a procedure that is never a medical necessity. It is never a medical necessity. The evidence is overwhelming. It is done for sheer convenience. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, while it does not support this bill, could nevertheless not identify any circumstances in which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of a mother. 
Most people in America oppose this procedure. And they oppose it for the simple reason they know what it is. For those who do not or who need to be reminded of what it is, let me again describe it. And I know this is a procedure that has been described on this floor many, many times, but it goes to the heart of this debate. 
Partial-birth abortion involves the partial delivery of a baby by its feet. The head is left inside the mother's womb. The head remains in the uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing scissors into the base of the child's head, suctioning out the baby's brain with a small tube, then completing the delivery of a now dead child. In this barbaric procedure, Mr. President, the abortionist does not even administer an anesthesia to the fetus. 
A moment ago, the Senator from Arkansas pointed out that dogs are treated better than this. The dogs that are used in medical research are required to be given pain management therapy under Federal standards. The treatment of these human fetuses that we are talking about would not even meet the bare minimum Federal standards for dogs used in medical research. Knowing that, why then have we not banned this procedure? Why are we still here debating again what should be self-evident, that this practice is a crime against our common humanity? 
The answer, I am afraid, is very simple. My friend from Pennsylvania spent a good amount of time in this Chamber outlining the reason. The case supporting this procedure is built on misinformation. It is built on lies, and they are intended to poison the public debate and obscure the truth. That is the fact. 
In the beginning of the partial-birth abortion controversy, many people were misled to believe that this procedure was rare. We were told it was rare. Now, today, we know that simply is not true. Almost everyone is aware by now that Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Providers, admitted that he lied. He said, `I lied through my teeth'--when he said partial-birth abortions were performed rarely and only in extreme medical circumstances. He admitted later after the debate that that was a lie. 
In the interest of medical accuracy, let me emphasize and be specific about how Mr. Fitzsimmons lied. He lied plainly and, in his own words, he `lied through his teeth.' We were misled again when we were told that this procedure was the only late-term abortion procedure that could be used in certain instances to save the life of the mother. Again, that is not true. It is simply not true. This procedure is not medically necessary. It is not medically indicated ever, nor is it the only option available. That is not based on what Mike DeWine says or what Rick Santorum says. That is based on the American Medical Association. 
Mr. President, we were told yet another falsehood--lie. We were told that this procedure was to preserve the health of the mother. We were misled about that as well. This is simply not true. Dr. Martin Haskell, the man who invented this procedure, said that 80 percent of the abortions he performs are elective --80 percent. This is the abortionist. This is the man who invented this procedure. He said 80 percent of the ones he performed are elective. 
A survey which asks women who had late-term abortions why they waited found that 71 percent did not know they were pregnant or misjudged the age of the baby. This procedure is being performed for convenience, pure and simple. 
We have also been told the procedure is appropriate because the baby is not viable anyway. But even this is certainly not always true. Many times it is not true. Research in a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine found 56 percent of babies are viable outside their mother's womb at 24 weeks. At 25 weeks, 79 percent of them are viable. 
I am sure many of my colleagues have had the same experience that I have when we have gone home to our home States, visited neonatal intensive care units at children's hospitals or other hospitals, and we have seen 22-week-old children, 23-week-old children that have been born prematurely who are fighting for life. Many of them do, in fact, make it. We have seen that with our own eyes. We have all talked with doctors who are frantically trying, working so hard every day to save them, and many can be saved. 
Unfortunately, the President of the United States, in vetoing this legislation, as in his veto of the previous legislation, has justified his position precisely on these types of falsehoods. In fact, if you look at his veto message last time, what you find is all these facts that are outlined there, that he says are facts, are simply not true. The President, tragically, is wrong. While it is true that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, none of us is entitled to our own facts. And the facts clearly indicate that what the President put down in his veto message is wrong. 
The falsehoods spread by defenders of partial-birth abortion are, frankly, offensive. But even more offensive than some of these lies is when the proponents of partial-birth abortion tell the truth. For example, when they say the partial-birth abortion procedure is needed in order to get rid of `defective' infants. The late Dr. James McMahon, who had performed thousands of these partial-birth abortions, said he performed some of these abortions because the baby had a cleft lip. That is right, a cleft lip. Maybe it is time to rewrite our sacred documents to say, `We hold these truths to be self-evident, that most of us are endowed with inalienable rights, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but people with cleft lips or other problems, other `defectives,' are to be the victims of a painful and barbaric murder.' 
No, that is not the moral attitude of the America that I want to believe in or that I do believe in. That is the moral attitude of another civilization, one that arose in this vicious century only to vanish from the face of the planet by the force of American arms and, more important, American values. It is in our power to say no to this throwback to the days of the Nazis, to say no to the selection of the fittest, to say no to infanticide. That is what we are about today on the floor of the Senate. That is what we will be about tomorrow morning when we cast our vote. 
I would like to note briefly that a number of State statutes have sought to ban these partial-birth abortions. Some States have had success and others have not. Many of those statutes which have been struck down, however, are very distinguishable from this legislation. I would like to talk about this constitutional aspect of this bill, because the issue has been raised time and time again on the floor of the Senate. So let me turn to an examination of the bill, based on our Constitution, based on Roe v. Wade and Casey and the other Supreme Court decisions. 
First, let me say of the cases, of the statutes that have been struck down, the proposed statute that is before us is clearly distinguishable. For example, the first law to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure was enacted in my home State of Ohio. Unfortunately, this law was recently struck down as vague, as overbroad, particularly as it banned more than just partial-birth abortion. But the bill we are voting on today has, frankly, none of these problems. 
Partial-birth abortion bans are fully in effect in seven States of the Union. Several State and district courts have enjoined State statutes attempting to ban partial-birth abortion. However, no appellate court has ruled on the constitutionality of any of these laws. 
Unfortunately, in the decisions that I have reviewed, none squarely confront the constitutional issue that this Federal bill presents; namely, the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of a partially born child. Because that is what this legislation is truly about, what the issue is, is the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of a partially born child. 
Roe v. Wade explicitly avoided deciding that issue, so it cannot be cited and should not be cited as an argument against this piece of legislation. Roe v. Wade explicitly avoided deciding that issue, which was actually part of the Texas law in question in that case, a law that prohibited `killing a child in the process of delivery.' In fact, Texas case law is consistent with both Louisiana and California law. An early California court aptly said:  
It should equally be held that a viable child in the process of being born is a human being within the meaning of the homicide statutes, whether or not the process has been fully completed. 
While many of the State court decisions have relied on Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that case does not reach the question of the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of a partially delivered baby either. However, under the Casey analysis, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional only, only if it creates an `undue burden,' on the legal right to abortion. Banning a single dangerous procedure such as we are doing in this case, when there are other alternatives available--which is true--should not constitute a burden under this Casey analysis. 
Doctors, those who are for, as well as those, some of whom are against this legislation--agree that partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility, and is never the only option. Over 30 legal scholars who have looked at this question agree that the United States Supreme Court is unlikely to interpret a postviability health exception to require the Government to allow a procedure that gives zero weight to the life of a partially born child and is itself a dangerous procedure. 
The bottom line is that there is no substantive difference between a child in the process of being born and that same child if she is born. No difference, really, between a child that is in the process of being born and a child that is born. A current illustration, I think, is very helpful. This is a true story, one that occurred in our minority leader's home State, South Dakota. 
On January 5 of this year, Sarah Bartels was pregnant with twins. She was 23 weeks into her pregnancy. Doctors were unable to delay the birth of one of the twins, Sandra, who was born at 23 weeks old. Sandra weighed 1 pound, 2 ounces--23 weeks. 
Mr. President, 88 days later Sandra's sister Stephanie was born. Both children are alive and well today. Yet Stephanie was not a `legal person,' and could have been the victim of a partial-birth abortion any time after that 23-week period. 
Stephanie's life had zero worth until she was completely born, though Sandra was alive and well outside the same womb that held her sister. 
Mr. President, the delivery of 80 percent of a child--the child is almost all the way out--a living baby certainly should have some value, some rights, some respect under our law. There is no moral justification for killing a live, partially delivered baby using a procedure that is neither medically necessary nor safer than childbirth. I believe we must make it the national policy to prohibit the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
My friend, Henry Hyde, who you quoted and cited a few moments ago, Mr. President, is one of the most eloquent--the most eloquent really--defenders of human rights in this country today, one of the most eloquent defenders of human rights, frankly, who has ever been in this country. Henry Hyde likes to say in defending these powerless humans, we are `loving those who can't love us back.' I think he is absolutely right. 
I will add the phrase, `those who can't love back' includes not just fetuses in the womb, but also the future generations who will live in this country and the moral climate we are choosing to build for them. 
The vote we cast tomorrow morning will help determine, Mr. President, that moral climate. Banning partial-birth abortion is the just, it is the right thing to do, and we should do it now. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, this week, Americans across the country will be participating in events to pay tribute to Americans Missing in Action and former Prisoners of War (MIAs/POWs). With that in mind, I would like to talk about an event that took place on February 12th, 1973. On that date, a United States Air Force C-141 landed at the Gia Lam Airport in Hanoi, North Viet Nam. The crew's mission was to pick up and return to the United States the first American POWs from Viet Nam. This historic mission signaled the beginning of the end of a period of uncertainty for many American POWs and their families. The flight for freedom from captivity came to a joyous conclusion when the aircraft carrying these soldiers landed at Hickham Air Force Base, Hawaii, where for the first time in many years, the former POWs once again stepped proudly and honorably onto American soil. 
On that day in February 1973, the tail number of the aircraft dispatched to Gia Lam was 660177. As the primary cargo aircraft for the Air Force at that time, the C-141, and specifically aircraft 660177, had flown cargo missions in support of U.S. operations in Viet Nam. To this day, many of the former POWs that were on board that first freedom flight still remember the tail number--660177. In tribute to the historic mission competed by this particular aircraft, flight crew members informally named the aircraft the `Hanoi Taxi.' 
Following the conclusion of activities in Viet Nam, the `Hanoi Taxi' continued to serve the Air Force as a cargo aircraft. Throughout the years, the role this aircraft played in our military history went largely unnoticed. 
In 1992, aircraft 660177, was assigned to the 445th Airlift Wing of the United States Air Force Reserve at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. At that time, members from the maintenance squadron of the 445th Airlift Wing noticed the words `Hanoi Taxi' on a label above the flight engineer's panel. M/Sgt. Dave Dillon became very interested in this unusual appearance and with the assistance of T/Sgt Henry Harlow, S/Sgt. Jeff Wittman and T/Sgt. Susan Denlinger, they worked to piece together the story behind the name. When they learned of the historic mission that gave aircraft 660177 the name `Hanoi Taxi', personnel from the 445th Airlift Wing began the process of transforming the aircraft into a flying tribute to honor those former Prisoners of War and those that are still Missing in Action. 
Today, nose art on the `Hanoi Taxi' represents the emblem of the 4th Allied Prisoner of War Wing and a plaque adorns a position of high visibility near the flight deck honoring the first 40 individuals that made that first flight from Hanoi on February 12, 1973. In addition, photographs of the historic mission are placed throughout the aircraft to allow those passing through the cabin to see those brave individuals who were forced to surrender their own freedom to protect ours. 
For many of the POW's that were on board the `Hanoi Taxi', some of the memories of their captivity have faded over the years, but today the number 660177 is the number of freedom--the number of the aircraft that reunited them with their friends and families. 
Notable passengers on board the `Hanoi Taxi' include retired Navy Rear Admiral Jeremiah Denton, who later served as a United States Senator. Then Air Force Captain Ed Mechenbier also was a passenger. Today, Brigadier General Ed Mechenbier still serves his country in the United States Air Force Reserve. The significance of the `Hanoi Taxi' is best illustrated by the following comments General Mechenbier provided in a recent interview:  
This airplane is more than a tribute to the POW's that were fortunate to be released in 1973. It reminds us of the service of more than a million Viet Nam era veterans, and it says to those POW/MIAs who did not share in our joy, you are not forgotten. 
This week our Nation honors the sacrifices and dedication to duty, honor and country that those Missing in Action and former Prisoners of War have provided. As we remember the sacrifice that has been made, let us not forget the continuing sacrifice that our present members of our armed forces have made as we forge pathways of peace in an ever changing environment of world events.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is very simple: It is to make it a crime to transport a child across State lines if this circumvents State laws requiring parental involvement or if it circumvents State laws requiring a judicial waiver for a minor to obtain an abortion. It is that simple. 
Many States, as we know, have laws saying a parent or guardian has to be notified if a child is trying to get an abortion. But not all States have these laws. What is happening now, far too often in this country, is that people who aren't parents, who aren't guardians, are taking these children across State lines, secretly, to get abortions in another State where parental notification is not required. It is that simple. 
What we are addressing in this bill, and what Senator Abraham is addressing, is an obvious circumvention of these State parental consent and notification laws. This bill, then, has two purposes: to protect the health of children and to protect the rights of parents. In fact, it might not be much of an exaggeration to say that these two purposes really boil down to just one purpose, because, Mr. President, empowering parents is the single biggest investment we can make in ensuring the health of our children. 
What we are saying with this legislation is that, yes, parents have the right to be involved in a moral and medical decision that affects their children's welfare. They have the right to do this. They have the duty to do this. When it comes to parental notification on abortion, the American people have reached a clear consensus. By a huge majority, 80 percent, favor parental notification; 74 percent favor not just parental notification but parental consent, as well--74 percent. This is a clear expression of the national wisdom. This legislation is an effort to make that kind of informed decision possible. 
Now, earlier this year, we in Congress worked on another bill, one that is now law. In that bill, the President and the Congress mandated that the flight of a parent to another State to avoid paying child support would be a Federal crime. I worked with Senator Kohl to champion the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act in order to protect the interests of America's children. We have to pursue very vigorously those who would harm our children, either by omission or by commission. 
Mr. President, the very same principle is embodied in the Child Custody Protection Act that we are considering today. 
There are those living among us, Mr. President, who would place our children in harm's way by transporting them across State lines to achieve dangerous goals, both physically and emotionally. One such goal is abortion. The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding the rights of parents is completely violated by the ability of others to transport children to another State to obtain an abortion. As a Nation, we must use all the resources available to us in order to protect our children and our families from this conduct. 
That is our purpose here today. Senator Abraham has shown strong leadership in bringing this legislation forward. I thank him for his work on this important bill, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment reflects a significant change in course on how we administer U.S. assistance in Haiti. From a practical standpoint, the amendment will not decrease our total commitment to the people of Haiti. However, it does place very clear restrictions on assistance to the Haitian government. 
To best understand the reasons for this amendment--and why we have chosen to place more conditions on direct aid to the government of Haiti--it is important to first talk about the current situation in Haiti. 
Mr. President, I have visited Haiti six times in the past three years. I have taken a great interest in assisting the people of Haiti as they establish, develop and sustain democracy, economic stability and a better quality of life. Through these visits, I have had the opportunity to see what changes have taken place and the general direction of events in Haiti. 
My colleagues may recall that on April 3, 1998, I provided the Senate an update on the current economic, and political state of Haiti. At that time, I stated that Haiti's political system was not stable. Little has changed for the better since then. This continued instability is of direct concern to the United States. The concern of course is that this unstable democracy could descend into outright chaos. If this occurs, the result could be an exodus of boat people coming to our shores. 
Mr. President, let me mention a few key facts to describe the current situation there. 
First, it has been over 14 months since then Haitian Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned due to his frustration with the government's inability to resolve an electoral dispute and implement his economic modernization plan. Since then, a Prime Minister has not been confirmed by the Parliament. 
The Prime Minister is designated as the Chief Executive of the Government. He appoints the Cabinet and basically runs the government. Without a Prime Minister, the country simply cannot function. Bills that may be passed by the Haitian Parliament cannot be signed into law and the privatization of any government industries cannot be fully implemented. 
It is truly unfortunate, that to date, this vacancy has not been filled. The current Education Minister has been nominated for the position. It is, however, unclear if he will be confirmed by the Haitian Senate. One of the main reasons for this continued delay stems from the Haitian government's inability to resolve the serious discrepancy surrounding the April 1997 elections. 
This current political impasse stems from pervasive fraud and improper vote tabulation regarding elections held in April of 1997. Not only have the Haitian opposition political parties demanded that the April 1997 elections be annulled, the international community, including the United Nations, has also deemed the elections--which produced only a meager five percent turnout--fraudulent. The opposition political parties continue to insist that they will not move forward to confirm a Prime Minister until the April 1997 electoral dispute is resolved. 
This paralysis in government is being felt everywhere: economic reform efforts have stalled. The legislature still has not passed a budget. It has not enacted structural reforms needed to free up over $100 million in foreign assistance, nor has it approved loans for millions in technical assistance. The process of privatizing key government industries is dramatically slow, as are plans to downsize the public sector. With progress impeded by a political stalemate it is no surprise that potential investors who could play a key role in uplifting Haiti's economic development are discouraged from going forward. 
Complicating matters even more was an upcoming national/municipal election in Haiti slated for November 1998. Hundreds of seats were up, including the entire lower chamber of the Haitian Parliament, up to two-thirds of the Senate and all municipal seats. Since there continues to be no resolution to the irregularities surrounding the previous election, however, the elections that constitutionally should be held in November have not been scheduled nor is there reason to believe that they will occur any earlier than next spring. All of this raises even more questions and concerns on Haiti's ability to administer future elections, including the presidential elections scheduled for the year 2000. 
Democracy literally is at a standstill in Haiti. And it will remain stagnant until previous electoral disputes are resolved, and a credible, nonpartisan, competent electoral commission to oversee elections is established. 
The composition of the electoral commission is the key source of controversy. A number of opposition parties in Haiti would like to have some representation on the commission, or at least make sure that the commission is neutral and not biased. 
Mr. President, I understand that Haitian President Preval recently said he will move forward with naming a provisional 
electoral council. There is concern that he intends not to consult with all opposition parties--meaning that the interests of other political parties will likely be excluded. This step would not seem to be an effective way to resolve the current political impasse. 
When I spoke about Haiti last April, I urged that no U.S. assistance be used to underwrite the proposed November elections until a settlement of the April 1997 electoral dispute is reached--and until a fair and independent Electoral Council is established in accordance with the constitution. I am pleased that these conditions on funding are currently in the pending Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, as well as in the House version. 
Even if the electoral disputes are resolved and an electoral commission appointed, democracy cannot be sustained as long as lethal violence is seem as an effective tool to achieve political goals. To date, not one single case of the dozens of political killings that have occurred in Haiti since the early 1990's have been resolved. As a result, no one has been convicted and sentenced for any one of these crimes. 
Mr. President, according to a House International Relations Committee staff report released just last week, fears of a new wave of political killings are on the rise following the recent murder of a Catholic priest who was a vocal critic of the current government, as well as of former President Aristide. The report also states that `A key opposition leader expressed concern that three other political figures may be targeted for assassination.' 
Not only have opposition political leaders been allegedly threatened, Haitians working for democratic institutions such as the International Republican Institute have also been targeted for intimidation and threats on their lives. One Haitian IRI employee was even held at gunpoint for his involvement in democratic activities in Haiti. 
Mr. President, I also am concerned about new reports of drug corruption within the Haitian government. Specifically, there have been numerous reports in Haitian newspapers that Haitian National Police employees were arrested for involvement in drug trafficking. Haiti has become increasingly attractive as a transit point for international drug traffickers. Unless we address this situation soon, Haiti could turn into a full-fledged narco-state. And that means more and more illegal drugs coming through Haiti to the United States. 
Mr. President, I have given you a brief outline and assessment of the current political situation in Haiti. 
It has been the policy of this Congress for three years that until the Haitian government is able to meet specific economic, political and social reforms, our assistance to that government should be extremely limited. The money, instead should go to benefit Haitians directly. 
That was the fundamental purpose of an amendment originally offered by our former Majority Leader, Bob Dole in 1995. Under the original Dole amendment, benchmarks for reform had to be met if assistance was to be provided. If these conditions were not met, government assistance would be transferred to non-governmental organizations, of NGOs. In the end, the President called for and received from Congress the power to waive these conditions and allow aid to go forward if he believed restricting aid to the Haitian government posed a national security concern to the United States. Congress included this national security waiver with the hope that things would improve in Haiti. Each year for the past three years, we have renewed the Dole amendment with some marginal modifications. Each year, the President has exercised his waiver authority to keep U.S. aid flowing to the Haitian government. And each year we hope the Haitian government will finally get its act together. 
Well, Mr. President, three years have gone by. And the situation remains bleak. Based on a review of that situation, I now believe that it is necessary to go back to the original Dole proposal by removing the national security waiver. We have tried--patiently--for three years to work with the Haitian government to establish and sustain democracy there. Yet, I find it extremely difficult to invest in a government that is not willing to make changes to advance democracy and its economic health. We have spent well over $2 billion in the past four years in Haiti. 
We should continue to fund programs through NGOs that will benefit Haitians. But giving the government money for programs if they are not willing to implement needed political and economic reforms is wasted money. 
Mr. President, let me turn now to an explanation of my amendment to the this bill. Let me first make it clear that this amendment does not prohibit assistance to Haiti. Just like current law, this amendment conditions our assistance to the Government of Haiti--but not the Haitian people. That means that any funds distrtibuted to Haiti through NGOs for the benefit of Haitians will not be threatened nor compromised in any manner. 
Let me first outline the important general conditions that the Haitian government must meet before we believe it receives any additional funding from the US government. These conditions are outlined--almost verbatim--in the pending Senate and House 
Foreign Operations Approprations bill. 
These general conditions include: 
First, the Haitian government must re-sign the Agreement on Migration Interdiction and Operations with the United States and must cooperate with the US in halting illegal emigration from Haiti. It has been nearly four years since this agreement expired and the US government has been waiting for Haiti to resign this agreement. 
The second condition is that the Haitian government must conduct thorough investigations of extrajudicial and political killings and that it must cooperate with US authorities in these investigations. There have been dozens of political murders in Haiti over the past several years. Not a single one has been solved. That has got to change. 
Third, the Haitian government must take action to remove from the Haitian National Police, and other national palace and ministerial guards, individuals who are credibly alleged to have engaged in or conspired to conceal gross violations of human rights or to have engaged in narcotics trafficking. 
Fourth, that the Haitian government must complete privatization of at least three major public entities. The Haitian government is now years behind its own drafted scheduled in privatizing several key public entities. 
The final condition is that the Haitian government must implement the counter-narcotics agreements recently signed between both countries last October. There are a total of six counter-narcotics agreements including the Ship Rider and Maritime Pursuit Agreements which allow US law enforcement to patrol Haitian waters for drug interdiction matters. These agreements basically allow for instantaneous implementation of drug enforcement activities between the two countries. 
These are very important and reasonable conditions that must be met before the US government releases any general assistance directly to the government of Haiti. Many of them are not new. 
Let me now address a more controversial question--whether the Administration can waive these conditions for national security reasons, and allow funding to go forward. For the past three years, the Administration has exercised its waiver authority to allow funding to go to the government. The pending bill before us continues this waiver; the pending House bill does not. My amendment would adopt the House version on this point. We must send a message to the government of Haiti that we cannot continue to give them money if they lack political will to make necessary reforms. 
Mr. President, while my amendment would remove the national security interest waiver; there are several important exceptions to this amendment as well as in the pending bill that would enable the US government to continue funding certain important government programs. Taken together, these exceptions include--counter-narcotics assistance; support for the Haitian National Police's Special Investigative Unit; the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program; customs assistance; anti-corruption programs; urgent humanitarian assistance; and education. There is also a separate provision on conditioning electoral and administration of justice assistance to the government of Haiti under a separate set of conditions. 
One additional point I want to make is while I have included several additional exceptions to the Limitation of Assistance provision to the government of Haiti--I intend to explore during the conference of this bill the possible need to limit the total amount of money the Haitian government can receive if conditions set for in this amendment are not met while assistance to the government in these areas continues to flow. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I would like to mention two essential assistance programs that we provide to Haiti through NGO's. 
First and foremost, US assistance through P.L. 480 Title II feeding programs to the poor is absolutely critical and should be continued. There are impoverished people in Haiti--particularly children--who desperately need help. They are not responsible for the country's political crisis. They should not have to suffer because of it. 
Mr. President, there has been a proliferation of facilities in Haiti which must care not only for a vast number of orphans but also for an increasing number of abandoned and neglected children. The capital city, Port-au-Prince, has seventy orphanages--all of these which are run by only one relief organization, Christian Relief Services (CRS). There are many other orphanages throughout the entire country which take care of thousands and thousands of orphaned and abandoned children in Haiti. 
I have visited these facilities in Haiti and I can give you a first-hand account of the heart breaking stories. The flow of desperate children into these orphanges is constant and these institutions face an increasing challenge in accommodating all of these needy children. The sad part is that these many of these orphanages get no other means of support other than the food 
administered to them through CRS, which in turn receives its resources through AID. 
Last year and again this year, I have worked with Senators Cochran and Bumpers--the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee--to ensure we continue the emergency feeding programs in Haiti through the PL 480 Title feeding program. I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers for their assistance in funding this program last year and for doing so again in this year's bill. 
Similarly, I have worked with Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy to include up to $250,000 to support a pilot program to assist Haitian children in orphanages. The objective behind the program is to find ways to help orphanages better organize and manage themselves to seek outside help for resources for these children. I thank the Chairman, and Senator Leahy for funding this initiative last year and for doing so again in the pending bill. 
Another very important assistance program that should be maintained, if not expanded, is agricultural assistance programs. Agricultural production in Haiti is extremely low. In the long run, agricultural production is necessary if Haiti is to provide jobs and food for its population. 
Haiti today imports two thirds of its food. Every day, thousands of Haitians leave rural areas where they are unable to provide for themselves, and flood into the cities which are unable to sustain the population pressures. In the long run, agricultural and rural development is crucial to the goal of providing jobs, income and food for Haiti's people. 
To further develop the rural and agricultural sectors of Haiti, attention needs to be given to a decentralized development strategy. I believe that continued focus on non-governmental organizations is appropriate. In fact, current USAID funding for agriculture and environmental programs in Haiti is all administered through NGOs. I believe that we should be promoting regional development and that associations linking private sector interests with local government need to be established. One way to do this is to link our own successful foundations and institutions of higher education together with local Haitians interested in pursuing this goal. 
Given the importance of developing and expanding sound agriculture and environment programs in Haiti, I intend to work with Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy to ensure that at least 20% of our total assistance for Haiti be for the promotion of agriculture and environment programs in Haiti. It is my hope that they will accept this request in conference report language. 
Mr. President, I cannot overestimate enough the need to continue assistance programs to Haiti through the NGO community. We want to help Haitians in terms of feeding programs, agriculture and environment programs, and other initiatives such as basic health and education. 
Mr. President, as you can see from the specifics of my speech, I have given serious thought to our assistance policy toward Haiti. U.S. policy toward Haiti is complicated. As I said at the beginning of these remarks, establishing, developing and sustaining democracy in Haiti is an important national interest. 
One thing is clear: The U.S. cannot do for Haiti what it will not do for itself. The Haitians first have to realize the need to solve their political crisis. They clearly have not yet hit rock bottom; maybe that's what it will take to create the political will to move forward. Unfortunately, I do not yet see the requisite political will and determination in Haiti. 
In the meantime, we cannot just walk away from Haiti completely. We must find ways to help the Haitian people, primarily through NGO's--since the Haitian Government has proven itself to be incapable of providing for its own people. 
There's a tough road ahead for Haiti. With this amendment, we are helping to set some realistic conditions whereby that country can succeed.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for the Child Survival and Disease Program Fund. I understand that the House Committee on Appropriations, as a part of its Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Bill, has recommended that $650 million be allocated to the Fund's programs for fiscal year 1999. On the House side, Subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead in protecting these child survival programs and I commend him for his leadership on this issue. The Clinton administration, however, has reduced direct funding for child survival programs. In order to preserve the benefits of these important programs for children worldwide, I believe the Senate should accept in conference the House language that was agreed to in Committee for this Fund. 
It is a tragedy that millions of children die each year from disease, malnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both preventable and treatable. The programs of the Child Survival Fund, which are intended to reduce infant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of children, address the various problems of young people struggling to survive in developing countries. It places a priority on the needs of the more than 100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or have become orphans. 
The Fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of communicable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. In the underdeveloped world, the Fund works towards eradicating polio as well as preventing and controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
Aside from addressing issues of health, the Fund also supports basic education programs. An investment in education yields one of the highest social and economic rates of return--because it gives children the necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each additional year of primary and secondary schooling results in a 10-20% wage increase and a 25% net increase in income. 
The programs supported by the Child Survival Fund are effective because they save three million lives each year through immunizations, vitamin supplementation, oral rehydration therapy, and the treatment of childhood respiratory infections, which are the second largest killer of children on earth. This year the Kiwanis International are leading a global campaign to raise seventy-five million dollars toward the elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder which is the world's most prevalent cause of preventable mental retardation in children. Eliminating the symptoms and causes of this poverty is not only the humane thing to do--it is also a necessary prerequisite for global stability and prosperity. 
In my view, Congress needs to maintain its support for these valuable programs. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee will accept the House language. The Child Survival and Disease programs are effective and are important. They should be continued. I would like to commend Representatives Tony Hall of Ohio and Sonny Callahan of Alabama for their tireless leadership in the effort to eliminate global hunger. 
I see the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, later today, the U.S. Senate will vote on the nomination of Kim McLean Wardlaw to be a judge for the ninth circuit. The Judiciary Committee approved this nomination by a voice vote. At that time, I noted my opposition to this nomination for the record. Today, I expect the Senate will approve this nomination by a voice vote again. Again, Mr. President, I note my opposition for the record. 
When we vote on the nomination of a Federal district or circuit court judge, I am sure all of us do so only after deliberation and consideration. I believe that the President of the United States has very broad discretion to nominate whomever he chooses, and I believe the U.S. Senate should give him due deference when he sends us his choice for a Federal judgeship. 
Having said that, however, I believe the Senate has a constitutional duty, and it is prescribed in the Constitution, to offer its advice and consent on judicial nominations. Each Senator has his or her own criteria for offering this advice and consent. However, since these nominations are lifetime appointments, all of us must take our advice and consent responsibility very seriously, and rightfully so. 
Earlier this year, when the Senate Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of another nominee to be a judge for the ninth circuit, in this case William Fletcher, I expressed my concerns about how far the ninth circuit has moved away from the mainstream of judicial thought and how far it consistently--consistently--strays from Supreme Court precedent. 
At that time, considering that nomination to the ninth circuit, I also stated that when the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for the ninth circuit, I feel compelled to apply a higher standard of scrutiny than I do with regard to other circuits. 
I have come to this conclusion after an examination of the recent trend of decisions that have been coming out of this ninth circuit. Simply put, I am concerned that the ninth circuit does not follow Supreme Court precedent, and its rulings are simply not in the mainstream. The statistics tell the sad story. 
In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed 27 out of 28 ninth circuit decisions that were appealed and granted cert. That is a 96-percent reversal rate. 
In 1996, 10 of 12 decisions for that same circuit were reversed, or 83 percent. If you go back to 1995, 14 of 17 decisions were reversed, or an 82-percent reversal rate. 
In other words, what we are seeing from 1995 to the present is an escalating trend of judicial confrontation between the ninth circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Let's keep in mind that the Supreme Court only has time to review a small number of ninth circuit decisions. This leaves the ninth circuit, in reality, as the court of last resort for the 45 million Americans who reside within that circuit. In the vast, vast majority of cases, what the ninth circuit says is the final word. 
To preserve the integrity of the judicial system for so many people, I believe we need to take a more careful look; I believe this Senate needs to take a more careful work at who we are sending to a circuit that increasingly chooses to disregard precedent and ultimately just plain gets it wrong so much of the time. 
Consistent with our constitutional duties, the U.S. Senate has to take responsibility for correcting this disturbing reversal rate of the ninth circuit. That is why I will only support those nominees to the ninth circuit who possess the qualifications and have shown in their background that they have the ability and the inclination to move the circuit back towards that mainstream. 
Mr. President, as the statistics reveal, the ninth circuit's reversal rate is an escalating problem. It is not getting better, it is getting worse. So today, this Senator is drawing the line. I am providing notice to my colleagues that this is the last ninth circuit nominee that I will allow to move by voice vote on this floor. 
Further, until the ninth circuit starts to follow precedent and produce mainstream decisions, I will continue to hold every ninth circuit nominee to a higher standard to help ensure that the 45 million people who live in the ninth circuit receive justice that is consistent with the rest of the Nation, justice that is predictable, justice that is not arbitrary, nor dependent on the few times the Supreme Court actually reviews and ultimately reverses an erroneous ninth circuit decision. 
Mr. President, all this leads me back to this nominee for the ninth circuit, the nominee that we will later today be considering, Judge Kim Wardlaw. There is simply, in my opinion, no evidence that this nominee will help to move the ninth circuit closer to the mainstream. And it is largely for that reason that I rise today to oppose this nomination. 
On November 9, 1995, the Judiciary Committee approved Kim Wardlaw's nomination to be U.S. district judge by unanimous consent. Further, the full Senate did the same thing on December 22, 1995. Today, we are now considering her nomination for elevation to the ninth circuit. 
Mr. President, during Judge Wardlaw's nomination hearing last June, I asked her to explain or describe the significant cases in which the Women's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the WLALA, filed amicus briefs during the time Judge Wardlaw served as president of this organization from 1993 to 1994 and the role she played during that time in the selection of these cases. That was my question. 
Judge Wardlaw responded that when she was president there was a `separate Amicus Briefs Committee that would take requests for writing briefs.' She described one case she remembered from that year in which the WLALA filed an amicus brief. Our dialogue in the committee then continued as follows. I asked her to `tell me again--you had this committee. Did you sit on the committee?' She responded, `No, I did not.' Then I asked her, `Did the president sit on the committee?' She responded, `No.' 
In written followup questions that I sent to her, I stated--and I quote--`In further reviewing the questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee, I noticed that you responded you were Amicus Briefs Committee chair (1997-98).' I then rephrased the question I asked her at the hearing. In her written response, Judge Wardlaw apologized, `if my response to your question at the hearing was narrower in any way than the scope of your intended question'--she then explained she thought my question and `ensuing colloquy' only referred to the years 1993 and 1994 that she was president of the Women's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, and not to the year she served as the Amicus Briefs cochair from September 1977 to 1988. 
Mr. President, I believe her written response was sincere. I do, however, think that she could have been more forthcoming in this response. I believe she could have been more forthcoming in her response during the hearing in order to clarify that she had, in fact, served as one of the chairs of the Amicus Briefs Committee during another point of her entire membership of the WLALA, which by the way, began in 1983. 
Mr. President, further, in Judge Wardlaw's 1995 responses to the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire for her nomination to be U.S. district court judge, she noted she was a member of the California Leadership Council for the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, California Leadership Council. However, she omitted this information from her 1998 questionnaire. 
When recently asked orally to explain this omission, she noted that the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund's California Leadership Council `was not an organization'--it `was not an organization.' So she said that she should not have even noted her affiliation with the organization in her original district court nomination questionnaire. 
Mr. President, I think, again, this, in my view at least, reflects a reluctance to be totally forthcoming with the committee. It is required of a nominee to include all information that is requested in the committee's questionnaire. And it is up to each committee member to weigh the importance, then, of the nominee's responses. Let me make it clear, Mr. President, people can make mistakes on questionnaires. I believe, however, the evidence shows--the totality of the evidence shows she has not been as forthcoming to this committee as, frankly, we should expect. 
This nominee has a 12-year affiliation--12-year affiliation--with the Women's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles. She has not only been a member, but has served as an officer. She has served as Amicus Briefs Committee chair and as vice president. She was elected as president of the organization, and served as chair of the Nominations Committee, which selects the officers of the organization. 
During the time she served in a leadership capacity, this organization filed amicus briefs in the Supreme Court in cases such as William Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the case of Rust v. Sullivan, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. 
I only cite these cases as further examples of her position as a leader of an organization that, in fact, took public stands on issues that were contrary to what the Supreme Court ultimately decided. For me, this serves as evidence that Judge Wardlaw would not help move the circuit more to the mainstream. This is not simply a matter of this nominee being a mere member of an organization that took these positions. Rather, this is a matter of her being a recognized leader of this organization who states, however, that she was not aware of the legal positions taken by this organization. 
In response to Senator Thurmond's written questions, Judge Wardlaw stated that `Once a position was voted upon . . . it was the position of the organization as a whole, not necessarily the view of any individual member.' That may be, Mr. President, but she did not offer to the Judiciary Committee any details on the role she may or may not have played in the development of these positions. 
Judge Wardlaw also stated that she `would not have publicly opposed a position taken by the organization.' I believe anyone who voluntarily holds numerous leadership positions in an organization--leadership positions ranging from president to secretary to chair of various committees--I believe that person adopts, helps shape, or at the very least condones the positions taken by that organization. 
After all, our committee asked all nominees if they belong to any organization that discriminates on the basis of race, sex or religion; and if so, we ask what the nominee has done to try to change these policies. These are not exactly comparable, but the point simply is, when we ask the questions about membership, we asked it for a reason. It does not mean we hold someone accountable for everything, every position that a committee or organization took that they belong to. No. We weigh the totality of the circumstances, and we try to be fair. But the evidence is overwhelming of her leadership positions. 
Frankly, quite candidly, this is not the first nominee who has come before our committee who has been involved with amicus briefs, who has been in an organization that files these briefs, who has held a leadership position, and who then says, `Oh, no, really, I didn't have anything to do with the formulation of those briefs or the decision about filing them.' That is a troubling position. And it is a position that we keep hearing from nominee after nominee. 
Let me put future nominees on notice that, at least for this U.S. Senator, that type of response is not acceptable. 
Mr. President, considering all of these factors, I oppose this nomination. I recognize the reality that this nominee would have been approved if a vote had been taken on the floor. One of the things we learn to do in this business, Mr. President, is to count. And I can count. Therefore, I do not want to put my colleagues, as we begin to leave for the August recess, through the necessity of a rollcall which would slow this process down or inconvenience them. But I felt I had to come to the floor this morning and state my position. 
Mr. President, before we consider future ninth circuit nominees, I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the evidence--evidence that shows that we have a judicial circuit that each year moves farther and farther from the mainstream and more and more in a confrontational role with the U.S. Supreme Court and with Supreme Court precedents. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I intend in the future to seek rollcall votes on all nominees for the ninth circuit. Until we reverse this disturbing trend, I believe the Senate needs to be on the record as either part of the problem or part of the solution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the Senate continues consideration of the Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 Defense appropriations bill, I would like to take a moment to express my concerns regarding the funding and administration of the Air Force's Financial Information Resources System (FIRST) program. This is a controversial program for a number of reasons. First, legitimate questions have been raised about the necessity of this program. It is my understanding that even though all the military departments and agencies were to move toward a single system for program, budgeting and accounting (PBAS), the Air Force has not moved in that direction. 
The Air Force intends for the FIRST program to perform the functions intended for PBAS, which would make the program duplicative. This issue was raised by the house National Security Committee, which zeroed out funding for the FIRST program in its version of the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill. 
The House National Security Committee also noted in its Committee report that the Air Force has chosen to utilize the Global Combat Supply System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) contract for the program, rather than competitively bid for the program. This decision raises both fiscal and policy concerns because this would be work outside the scope of the GCSS-AF contract. The GCSS-AF contract was advertised and awarded for `base-level systems modernization.' In contrast, the FIRST program involves a budget system modernization plan that would impact all Air Force functional levels: base level, wholesale level, major air command, and headquarters. Clearly, the FIRST program would exceed the scope of the GCSS-AF contract. 
I should also point out that the Air Force's decision to utilize GCSS-AF for the FIRST program was made after the Air Force announced an open competition, and after eighteen companies acted in good faith and submitted qualification applications for evaluation and screening. This course reversal, and the rational behind it has not been made clear to me or others that are concerned about this decision. 
Mr. President, I also believe the Air Force's decision merits close review because it's not clear to me that it would be wise for the Air Force to place a disproportionate amount of its systems modernization work all in one contract. 
Finally, the entire process raises policy concerns with respect to organizational planning within the Air Force. Currently, the development and execution of corporate information management systems for combat support is, in my view, not conducted in a coordinated and integrated fashion. In other words, the way the FIRST program is being administered is a symptom of a much larger organizational issue that deserves review by Congress and the Air Force. 
In short, given all the issues that I have briefly described, I believe we should withhold going forward with the FIRST program until we can sort these and any other related issues that others may have. In fact, I had intended to offer an amendment that would allow for the Defense Department to use these funds for drug interdiction programs, but I have worked with the chairman and the ranking member to find other ways to help our drug interdiction strategy. 
Mr. President, we cannot understate the importance of information technology programs to the future of our armed services. Thousands of people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and in the surrounding Miami Valley area play a leading role in the development of these programs. However, these programs have to be pursued with an eye toward fiscal soundness and effective coordination with similar systems defense-wide. I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee on the floor and I hope that he will take the issues and concerns I have raised into consideration as he proceeds to conference with the House of Representatives.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, for yielding to me and thank him also for the tremendous work he has done on this bill. He has been working on this for a number of years. This is the culmination of a great deal of work. 
We are about to pass the conference report. Once the bill is sent on to the President and signed by the President, it will represent a major accomplishment of this Congress. This bill consolidates over 70 federally funded job training related programs--over 70 of them consolidated. This bill will make job training, federally funded job training, in this country much more accountable. It will also involve the business community much more in the development and design of job training. 
The one thing Chairman Jeffords and I have learned as we have held hearings on this matter over the years is that if you want job training to work, it has to be run locally and it has to have great input from the local business community. This bill will make sure that we have that local input. We have to remember who the consumers are. When you are talking about job training, there are two consumers. One is the person who wants the job and wants to be trained for the job. But the other, equally as important, is the company or the individual who wants to hire that person, and so you have to involve them both in the design of job training. 
That is what this bill does. This bill also dramatically reforms Job Corps. Job Corps is a Great Society-era job training program, residential, that is run by the Federal Government. It costs over $1 billion a year. It is targeted at our most at-risk young people in this country, people who desperately need our help, desperately need our assistance. What this bill does is make sure that $1 billion will be correctly spent. And again, we do that by measuring the results. 
One of the things that Chairman Jeffords and I, I think, and the rest of the committee, were so shocked about when we held hearings several years ago on this--actually former Senator Kassebaum was chairman--was that Job Corps did not really measure success or failure of the young people. It didn't measure the success or failure of a particular job training program. They looked at it and saw whether or not a person had a job for 2 weeks. If they kept a job for 2 weeks after graduating from the program--and it didn't matter what the job was--the program was considered a success. The contractor who was in charge of getting that person a job got paid, and then no one ever looked back. 
What we do with this bill is say we are going to measure success or failure after 6 months. We are going to measure success or failure after 12 months. And then we are going to be able to tell which programs work and which do not work in regard to Job Fair. 
Another change we are making in Job Corps is to involve the local business community. Too often Job Corps has herded young people from 500, 600, 700 miles a way. They go to the Job Corps. They stay there for awhile, they complete their program, and then they go back home, and it is very difficult to involve the local business community when they know that person is not going to be there to work for them. And so we change those priorities in regard to Job Corps as well. 
We also in this bill make a major step forward to link the regular job training programs of this country with vocational rehabilitation. We do that by closing the gap. We do that by preserving the dedicated flow of money that will go for this targeted population, targeted population that is in need of our assistance, who wants to help themselves. We preserve that dedicated fund, those dedicated funds. But we give that recipient, that client, more resources. We empower that client to go to the vocational rehabilitation site or, if the services are not there, to make sure that the client has the legal right to go across the street or across the county, wherever that is, to get help and assistance from the regular system as well. It integrates the two. 
In conclusion, let me say this bill is a bill for workers. It is a bill for people who want to be workers. It is a bill for young people. It is a bill that literally empowers the person who is seeking the job training. It gives them a lot more, many more rights. It gives them a lot more flexibility. It puts them into the ball game as far as choosing what is the job training that is best for them. So it makes a significant difference. 
This bill also has a very significant component aimed directly at children. We set aside a significant sum of money for those young people between the ages of 14 and 21. We do it; 
we target it; we say it is important. There is nothing, I think, more important in this country than what we do with our young people and the assistance we try to provide for them. We have many young people in this country who we call at-risk youth. This bill will go a long way to give them direct assistance. However, even though we target it in this bill and say these funds are dedicated for these young people, we also at the same time give all the flexibility to the local community, States and local communities to allow them to design the specific program that will actually work for their young people in their local communities. 
This is a revolutionary bill. It is a bill that dramatically changes the status quo. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that Senator Wellstone worked on with me in the subcommittee. It is a bill on which Senator Kennedy worked with Senator Jeffords. 
It is a bill that Secretary Alexis Herman has been very, very much involved in. She has been involved in it up until the last 10 minutes, as we have negotiated the final portions of this bill. 
So, it is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill we can all be very proud of. It is a bill that will truly make a difference for our young people and for those who need to be trained in this country. 
Again, I thank my chairman for the tremendous work that he has done; for his persistence. One of the qualities I think you have to have in the U.S. Senate is perseverance and persistence, as well as patience. He has demonstrated all three very well. The culmination is what we see tonight, which is a bill we are about to send to the President of the United States for his signature. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Abraham, Senator Sessions, Senator Brownback, and Senator Santorum. 
This is an amendment that would maintain in force--and let me emphasize that--would maintain in force the current law, the status quo. This amendment would remain and keep in force the current Federal law restricting Federal employee health insurance coverage for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of a mother. 
This is the same amendment that was accepted by voice vote during the debate for fiscal year 1998, the Treasury-Postal appropriations. This is the same amendment that was accepted by this body during the debate for fiscal year 1996. And, in fact, this is the same language that has been consistently supported by a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives from 1983 to 1998, with the exception of only 2 years. So from 1983 to 1998, that has been the law of the land with the exception of only 2 years. 
Mr. President, I mention this to you and to my colleagues to make it clear that this amendment stakes out no new ground. It merely confirms what the status quo is today, what this body and what the other body have consistently voted in favor of. 
The principle that we are dealing with today is a very simple one, one that goes beyond the conventional pro-life, pro-choice boundaries. I think everyone in this Chamber knows that I am pro-life and, therefore, wish to promote the value of protecting innocent human life. 
I point out that the vast majority of Americans on both sides of the abortion issue--on both sides of the abortion issue--strongly agree that they should not pay for someone else's abortion, and that is what we are talking about today. Fairly stated, this amendment is not about abortion, it is not about the morality of abortion, or the right of women to choose abortions. This is a narrowly focused amendment that answers a key question: Should taxpayers pay for these abortions? 
Mr. President, Congress has consistently agreed that we should not ask the taxpayers to promote a policy, in essence, of paying for abortion on demand for a Federal employee. 
Again, this amendment would maintain the status quo. It limits Federal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother. 
The vast majority of Americans oppose subsidizing abortions. That is clear. Employers, as a general principle, determine the health benefits their employees receive. Taxpayers are the employers of our Federal workforce, and a large majority of taxpayers simply do not want their tax dollars to pay for these abortions. Taxpayers provide a substantial majority share of the funds to purchase health insurance for the Federal civilian workforce. Over three-quarters of that premium on an average is paid for by taxpayers. 
This amendment addresses the same core issue. It simply says that the Federal Government is not in the business of funding abortions. Abortion is a contentious issue, and we simply should not ask taxpayers to pay for them. 
Mr. President, this issue has been debated time and time and time again on this floor. I will say the identical language has been debated time and time and time again. 
Everyone in this Chamber has voted on this issue. Current law limits abortion availability in Federal employee health care plans to cases, again, of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. That is set in law. This has been the bipartisan position of the Senate and the bipartisan position of the House, and it has been approved by the President last year and the year before. We should not voluntarily take the money of many Americans who find abortion wrong to pay for those abortions. We should not go against the will of the people of this country. We should uphold the current law, and that is what this amendment would simply do. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation that would bring a new, comprehensive strategy to America's effort against illegal drugs. 
The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act would support enhanced drug interdiction efforts in the major transit countries, and support a comprehensive supply eradication and crop substitution program in source countries. This legislation has 16 other Senate cosponsors. 
Mr. President, this is a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over 3 years for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop substitution efforts. This important counter-drug initiative would restore a balanced drug control strategy by renewing our nation's commitment to international eradication and interdiction efforts--efforts that have proven successful in reducing the trafficking and use of illegal drugs. I believe that this is an important investment in the future of America--and the future of our children. 
The day after the new drug initiative was introduced, I offered an amendment to the Transportation appropriations bill to provide much-needed resources for the U.S. Coast Guard--resources that will increase their drug interdiction capability. Other cosponsors of this amendment included Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, and Grassley. This amendment, which was agreed to by voice vote, accomplishes two goals: First, it increases funds available for equipment devoted to drug interdiction by approximately $37.5 million. Second, the amendment sets aside resources needed to restore a much-needed drug interdiction operation in the Caribbean--an operation which I had the opportunity to visit earlier this year. 
Today, I rise again with Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, Grassley, and Mack to introduce an amendment to the Treasury, Postal appropriations 
bill. Specifically, we seek $15 million for enhanced drug interdiction efforts for the U.S. Customs Service in South Florida and the Caribbean. 
Mr. President, in May, I traveled to the Caribbean for a very short--36-hour--visit to look at our interdiction operations there. I visited with U.S. Customs officials in Key West, Florida. It was on this very trip that I gained a greater appreciation of the actual difficult task of drug interdiction. I learned that it is far from an easy task--it is in fact highly dangerous. 
U.S. Customs officials showed me video tapes of U.S. Customs go-fast boats pursuing Colombian go-fast boats in the middle of the night in high waves--waves that reached 5 or 6 feet. The videos showed Colombian boats ramming into our boats. 
One of the key problems I learned about on that trip was that U.S. Customs has very few go-fast boats--and the ones they have lack 1990's technology. Our boats have a top speed of 70 mph--while Colombian boats can reach 80 or 90 mph. I rode in one of our go-fast boats in Key West during a mock chase--and I can tell you that even during the day and in low waves, this is dangerous work. 
There can be no doubt that our U.S. Customs agents in Florida and the Caribbean need more equipment, better equipment dedicated to drug interdiction, and more personnel. Since 1986, the number of U.S. Customs vessels has decreased from 77 to 30. There has also been a significant decrease in maritime officers, from 124 to 23. In fact, U.S. Customs no longer runs a 7-day, 24-hour drug interdiction operation. 
Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would provide U.S. Customs with more go-fast boats and more manpower for South Florida and the Caribbean. Let me tell you what this amendment would accomplish. 
First, it would refurbish 22 interceptor and Blue Water Platform Boats. The interceptor boats are what is known as `go-fast boats.' The Blue Water Platform Boats are for deep waters and have command and 
control capability--these vessels can accommodate satellite communications equipment and radar to communicate with the interceptor boats to enable them to better interdict the drug traffickers. Right now, these 22 vessels cannot be used because of lack of funding for refurbishment. This small amount of money will make a huge, huge difference. The amendment would also appropriate money for 9 new interceptor go-fast boats. 
The amendment would also provide money for the hiring and training of 30 special agents--criminal investigators--for maritime operations. Finally, the amendment would provide resources for overhead coverage and operation and maintenance in the Caribbean. 
Mr. President, this is a very important amendment which will accomplish a lot with a small amount of resources. The amendment has bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, I see the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Subcommittee, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl. I thank them for their cooperation with this bipartisan amendment. 
First, I want to make clear that I intend to work with the conferees and the Treasury Department on alternatives to fund this amendment. While an offset has been identified in order to pay for this amendment, I want to work with them to find alternatives.

I also extend my thanks to the staff of the subcommittee for their efforts, which were nothing less than first rate. 
Mr. President, this amendment today is another important step toward restoring a balanced drug interdiction strategy. I expect there will be many more steps in the future--steps that are needed if we are going to restore a truly balanced, truly effective drug control strategy. This amendment represents a bipartisan effort to make a targeted and specific investment in stopping drugs before they reach America. It will take similar efforts over the course of the next 3 years to bring our drug strategy back into balance, and most important, back on the course of reducing drug use in our homes, schools, and communities. 
I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator Shelby, for the work he has done on this bill. It is not easy to balance the competing interests in any appropriations bill, but I think it is even more difficult on transportation appropriations. I would also like to call attention to one area of the Senate's bill which is very different than the House version. 
The Federal Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Program, which began in the late 1980's, is sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Weather Service (NWS), and the Department of Defense (DoD) and currently includes over 860 ASOS units. For its part, as of December 2, 1997, the FAA had procured 569 ASOS units. Yet only 297 of these units had been commissioned as of June 16, 1998. 
The current Senate bill provides $20.97 million for the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS). This amount is $11 million more than the Administration request. According to the Committee report, $9.9 million is to be used to commission systems that have already been purchased. This only makes sense. After all, the Federal government purchased these systems. They might as well be used. 
Last year, Congress appropriated $10 million more than the Administration request to procure nearly 30 more ASOS units. If the past is an accurate indicator, these units will sit idle until FAA finds the funds to commission them. In essence, what we are doing is purchasing technology with great potential but fraught with high maintenance costs and are going to be unusable for a number of years when, it is my understanding that there are other alternatives that cost less and can be used immediately. In fact, I understand that one of these alternatives, the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) is very popular in many states, including the Chairman's home state of Alabama. 
I would draw my colleague's attention to the action taken yesterday by the House Committee on Appropriations. In its companion to the bill before us, that panel declined to fund any of these systems for the coming fiscal year but noted the Senate Committee's action. The House report language says that both systems (AWOS and ASOS) are `meritorious' and takes the strong position that if additional funding beyond the Administration's request is provided in the final conference action, that `an equitable distribution' of the additional funding should be provided for both systems. 
I strongly support the action taken by our House colleagues and urge my good friend, the Chairman of the Subcommittee to join me to inject fairness, cost-effectiveness and competition into this program.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, yesterday 15 of my colleagues and I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, legislation that would restore balance to our comprehensive antidrug strategy. My friend from Florida, Congressman Bill McCollum, is leading a similar effort in the House of Representatives. 
This legislation is a $2.6 billion effort--$2.6 billion over the next 3 years. This is an outline. It is a blueprint to really restore balance to our antidrug effort. Unfortunately, over the years, the effort that we are putting in in regard to interdiction has gone down significantly as a percentage of our total budget. And we need to restore that balance. 
This legislation is a $2.6 billion, 3-year investment to reduce the amount of drugs coming into this country and to drive up the cost of drug trafficking. Taken together, this strategy will drive up the price of drugs and, most importantly, then drive down the incidence of the use of drugs in our country. This is an important investment in the future of America and the future of our children. 
Today, one day later, after having introduced this bill, the Senate will, I hope, take the first step towards realizing that investment. I am pleased to have just sent to the desk an amendment offered along with Senator Coverdell, Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Bond, and Senator Grassley, an amendment that will provide much needed resources for the U.S. Coast Guard, resources that will increase their drug interdiction capability. 
Specifically, Mr. President, our amendment would accomplish two goals. One, it would increase the funds available for equipment devoted to drug interdiction by approximately $37.5 million. Second, the amendment would set aside resources needed to restore a much needed drug interdiction operation in the Caribbean. 
Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, on the floor. I would like to engage in a colloquy with him to go over the particulars of the bipartisan amendment that I have offered. 
First, I would like, before I do that, to discuss the $37.5 million secured for additional resources. 
Specifically, Mr. President, with respect to sea-based resources, our amendment would enable the Coast Guard to reactivate one T-AGOS vessel and acquire two additional T-AGOS vessels. These vessels, originally Navy submarine hunters, have proved to be quite valuable for counterdrug operations because they have the room needed for command and control equipment, such as sensors and communications equipment. 
In addition, the amendment also would enable the Coast Guard to acquire a maritime interdiction patrol boat and satellite communications equipment for patrol boats. 
With respect to Coast Guard air operations, our amendment would allow for the reactivation of three maritime control aircraft. These are jet aircraft that would be used by the Coast Guard to track and pursue drug traffickers. 
Finally, our amendment would allow for the acquisition of forward-looking infrared systems. This technology enables the Coast Guard to track heat signatures in the water. 
Why is this important? Well, drug traffickers, drug runners in the Caribbean, use what we call, and they call, `go-fast' boats, boats that are too fast for detection in tracking using conventional radar. The infrared systems can detect `go-fast' boats and thus allow for more effective aerial surveillance.  
Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend from Alabama very much for his very kind words and for his leadership in assisting with this amendment. 
There is one additional component, Mr. President, of this amendment that I would like to discuss briefly this evening, and that is the set-aside that will enable the Coast Guard to restore a very effective drug interdiction program in the Caribbean. 
My interest in drug interdiction activities in the Caribbean stems, in part, from my interest in the island nation of Haiti. The hard reality is that the Caribbean--from Haiti to the Bahamas--is fast becoming once again a major illegal drug transit route. 
On one of my recent trips, Mr. President, I saw that, in particular, Haiti is becoming an attractive rest-stop on the cocaine highway. It is strategically located about halfway between the source country, Colombia, and the destination country, the United States. Haiti law enforcement, though slowly getting better, is, at this point, utterly unequipped, unprepared to put a dent in this drug trade. 
What is more, the Coast Guard fleet consists of a handful of boats. They are making progress. They have certainly a long way to go. As the poorest country in the hemisphere, Haiti is extremely vulnerable to the kind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade needs in order to flourish. Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving now through Haiti has dramatically increased. 
According to a U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine movement, in 1996 between 5 and 8 percent of the cocaine coming into the United States passed through Haiti. By the third quarter of 1997, the percentage jumped to 12 percent, and increased yet again to 19 percent by the end of that year. 
Accordingly, we responded to this crisis with an interdiction strategy called Operation Frontier Lance--Operation Frontier Lance--which utilized Coast Guard cutters, speedboats, and helicopters, all to detect and capture drug dealers on a 24-hour-per-day basis. 
Incidentally, this operation was modeled after another successful interdiction effort that took place off the coast of Puerto Rico called Operation Frontier Shield. 
Mr. President, last May I boarded the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Dallas and observed Operation Frontier Lance and observed the men and women who are on the front line--and were on the front line--carrying out our antidrug operation. And I came away thinking that this is the kind of effort, the kind of coordination of resources, that we need not just off the coast of Haiti and the Dominican Republic but also throughout the drug trafficking routes throughout the entire Caribbean. 
Mr. President, unfortunately--unfortunately--funding for Frontier Lance ran out last month. This once effective roadblock on the cocaine highway is no more. With our amendment, we can get that operation and/or similar operations in the region back up and running. 
Specifically, our amendment secures operations funding that will allow Operation Frontier Lance or similar operations to resume. And with the additional resources I described earlier, the Coast Guard has an even greater ability to flex its drug interdiction muscle in the entire region. 
Mr. President, I express my thanks again to the chairman and the ranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg, for their very effective efforts to assist me and the distinguished list of cosponsors of this amendment. I also send my thanks to the staff of the subcommittee for their effort. Their effort was great and it was first rate. This would not have happened without them. 
As I said at the beginning of my statement, Mr. President, this amendment today is a first step. I expect that there will be many more steps in the future, steps that are needed if we are going to restore a truly balanced, truly effective drug control strategy. 
This amendment represents a bipartisan effort to make a targeted and very specific investment, an investment in stopping drugs before--before--they reach America. It will take similar efforts over the course of the next 3 years to bring our drug strategy back into balance and, most important, back on the course of reducing drug use in our homes, our schools, and our communities. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me thank both of my colleagues, the ranking member and the chairman, for their great cooperation. I understand my colleague has expressed his concerns about the money situation. I look forward to working with both Members in regard to that. 
I appreciate your concern for the Coast Guard. I believe this is money very well spent. I think the Coast Guard knows what to do with its money. They know how to get the job done. I have been out literally in the field or on the sea with them to see what they can do. They do a good job getting it done. 
I understand the concerns with regard to the money. 
I don't know if there is any further debate.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation proposing a new and comprehensive strategy to deal with one of the central challenges facing America's young people--the plague of illegal drugs. 
Recently, President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich unveiled the latest investment in our war against illegal drug use: a $2 billion-dollar advertising campaign to send our children a hard-hitting message about the life-destroying dangers of drugs. 
Anti-drug ad campaigns like this one are important. But we should remember that the creative minds on Madison Avenue are not our best or only weapon to get people off drugs. History has proven that a successful anti-drug strategy is balanced and comprehensive in three key areas: demand reduction (such as education and treatment); domestic law enforcement; and international supply reduction. 
Today, though, we are on the wrong side of history. Our overall drug strategy is neither balanced nor comprehensive. That's because Washington has not done its part. It has not carried out its sole responsibility--to reduce the illegal drug imports, either by working with foreign governments, or by seizing drugs or disrupting drug trafficking routes outside our borders. 
That is why, today, I rise to introduce this legislation. It is a bill that will fix our current drug strategy deficit. I, along with Senators Coverdell, Graham and 11 other Senators will introduce the `Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act'--a bill to support enhanced drug interdiction efforts in the major transit countries, and support a comprehensive supply eradication and crop substitution program in source countries. 
Mr. President, this is a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over three years for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop substitution efforts. Let me mention a few highlights of what this bill would accomplish, very specifically. 
It would improve our aircraft, maritime and radar coverage of both drug-source and drug-transit countries. It would do this by (1) authorizing funds for construction, operation and maintenance of additional U.S. Customs/Defense aircraft, Coast Guard cutters and patrol vessels, and Customs/Coast Guard `go-fast' boats for drug interdiction efforts; (2) authorizing funds to establish an airbase to support counter-narcotics operations in the Southern Caribbean, Northern South America, and the Eastern Pacific; and (3) authorizing 
funds to the Department of Defense to restore, operate, and maintain critical radar coverage in these regions. 
It would enhance drug-eradication and interdiction efforts in source countries--by authorizing funds to the Departments of State and Defense to provide necessary resources, equipment, training and other assistance needed for the support of eradication and interdiction programs in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. 
It would enhance the development of alternative crops in drug-source countries, by authorizing funds to the United States Agency for International Development to support alternative development programs designed to encourage farmers to substitute for narcotic producing crops in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. 
It would support international law enforcement training--by (1) establishing three separate international law enforcement academies operated by the Department of Justice, to provide training assistance in Latin America, Asia, and Africa; (2) establishing a training center for maritime law enforcement instruction, including customs-related ports management; and (3) authorizing funds for the promotion of law enforcement training and support for Caribbean, Central American and South American countries. 
It would enhance law enforcement interdiction operations by authorizing funding to the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and Department of Defense for the support of counter-narcotics operations and equipment in drug transit and source countries. 
Mr. President, as you can see, this is a very targeted and specific investment. And it is necessary. The budget numbers tell an alarming--undeniable--story: In 1987, the federal government's drug control budget of $4.79 billion was divided as follows: 29% for demand reduction programs; 38% for domestic law enforcement; and 33% for international supply reduction. This funding breakdown was the norm during the Reagan and Bush Administrations' war on drugs, from 1985-92. 
During that time, drug interdiction was serious business. President Bush even tasked the Defense Department to engage in the detection and monitoring of drugs in transit to the U.S. As a member of the House of Representatives at that time, I can recall very well the major commitment we made to reduce the amount of drugs going into the U.S. 
After President Clinton took office in 1993, his administration immediately pursued policies that upset the careful 
balance in drug funding. For example, in 1995, the federal drug control budget of $13.3 billion was divided as follows: 35% was allocated for demand reduction programs; 53% for domestic law enforcement, and 12% for international supply reduction. Think of it--only 12% of our drug control budget was dedicated to stop drugs from coming to our country--down from 33% in 1987. Though the overall drug budget increased threefold from 1987 to 1995, the piece of the drug budget pie allocated for international and interdiction efforts had decreased. 
Key components of our drug interdiction strategy were slashed. For example, Coast Guard funding for counter-narcotics fell 32% from 1992 to 1995. Not surprisingly, Coast Guard drug seizures dropped from 90,335 lbs in 1991 to 28,585 lbs in 1996. In addition, interdiction no longer remains a priority within the Department of Defense, which currently ranks counter narcotics dead last in importance in its Global Military Force Policy. 
What were the results of these two clearly different approaches? The Reagan-Bush approach achieved real success. From 1988 to 1991, total drug use was down 13 percent. Cocaine use dropped by 35 percent. Marijuana use was reduced by 16 percent. 
In contrast, under the Clinton approach, since 1992 overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 rose by 70 percent. Drug-abuse related arrests more than doubled for minors between 1992 and 1996. Since 1992, there has been an overall 80 percent increase in illicit drug use among graduating high school seniors. Further, in 1995 number of heroin related emergency room admissions jumped 58% since 1992. And in the first half of 1995, methamphetamine related emergency room admissions were 321% higher compared to the first half of 1991. 
The price of drugs also decreased during this time period. For instance, the price of a pure heroin gram in 1992 was $1,647--and in February 1996 it was only $966 per gram. 
These negative effects have sent shockwaves throughout our communities and our homes. 
The rise of drug use is not at all surprising. With the Clinton administration's decline in emphasis on drug interdiction, it has become easier to bring drugs into the U.S. This makes drugs more available and more affordable. The Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that small `pieces' or `rocks' of crack, which once sold for ten to twenty dollars, are now available for three to five dollars. 
No question, continued investments to deal with the `demand side' of the drug situation are necessary. We have to find ways to persuade Americans, particularly young people, that doing drugs is 
wrong--that it destroys lives, families, schools and communities. As long as there is a demand for drugs, education and treatment remain essential long-term components of our anti-drug efforts. 
Casual drug users also are influenced by price, which is why a balanced anti-drug strategy includes fighting drugs beyond our borders. The drug lords in South America are well aware that the U.S. is no longer pursuing a tough interdiction strategy. I have seen Coast Guard operations first hand, and while the Coast Guard and other agencies can detect and monitor drug trafficking operations, they usually stand by helpless because they lack necessary equipment to turn detection into seizures and arrests. Of the total drug air events in the Bahamas from April 1997 to April 1998, there was only an 8% success rate in stopping drug air flights that have been detected. That means over 92% got away. Without doubt, the drug lords can get a larger flow of drugs into the U.S. 
With additional resources, we can make it more difficult to import illegal narcotics, and drive up the cost for the drug cartels to engage in this illicit and immoral practice. Interdiction drives up the price--and drives down the purity--of cocaine on the street. Also, seizing or destroying a ton of cocaine outside our borders is more cost effective than trying to seize the same quantity of drugs at the point of sale. 
Mr. President, that is why I think that this bill is absolutely essential. The bill can get us back on the right track. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Representative Bill McCollum's tireless efforts and dedication to this initiative. He has shown tremendous leadership on anti-drug efforts. 
Mr. President, it is time to reverse the current administration's policy and get right with history. It is time we returned to a comprehensive, balanced drug control strategy that will put us back on a course toward ridding our schools and communities of illegal and destructive drugs. The evidence clearly shows that with a balanced strategy, we were making great progress. We significantly reduced drug use. For the sake of our children, it is time for us to embrace the lessons of history, and stop trying to escape them.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski and other members of the appropriations subcommittee on the FY 1999 appropriations bill. The committee has faced tough budget constraints this year and I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. I would also like to call to the Chairman's attention an important project in Ohio that I believe is deserving of funding under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, specifically, the Economic Development Initiative funding for various community development projects. A number were listed by the Committee in its report on the bill. I am very interested in a project that has been supported by both the local community and the State of Ohio--the rehabilitation of the Medical Science Building at the University of Cincinnati's Medical Center. This facility ranks among the top in the nation for biomedical research, research which benefits both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Veterans' Administration, as well as contributing to the local economy in excess of $2 billion. Would the Senator from Missouri agree that an initiative which will rehabilitate a facility dedicated to such research be a worthy candidate for funding under the Committee's EDI provision?

Madam President, I would like to draw the attention of the distinguished Chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Bond, to the allocation of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for Economic Development Initiative projects. As the Chairman may recall, we had numerous discussions last year about my interest in preventing the permanent closure of the St. Joseph's Hospital complex located in the heart of Downtown Lorain. Thanks in large part to the assistance provided Lorain in the FY 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report, we were able to forestall closure and have now developed a solid group of tenants who wish to occupy the complex.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, while I will not detail every development at the St. Joseph's site which has occurred over the past twelve months, it is worth mentioning the highlights. Based on the expression of Congressional support, Community Health Partners agreed to transfer ownership of the facility to a community-based non-profit entity incorporated as South Shore Development Corporation. Community Health Partners has also agreed to provide 12 months of utilities and security for the facility while South Shore proceeds with its plans to convert the facility for non-hospital uses. Notwithstanding the need to attract additional funds to underwrite the conversion effort, the Veterans' Administration, the Lorain Public Schools system, the Lorain County Community College and the local Community Action Agency have all signed leases to implement community services from the 400,000 square foot facility. 
As the distinguished Chairman may recall, earlier this year I had expressed my support to him for a request for an additional $2,000,000 for the conversion effort. These funds would be utilized for the establishment of the Community College's distance learning center at the St. Joseph's facility. It is through this facility and the downlink site at the Community College that area residents would be provided access to the job training programs which would be offered by the Community College for veterans, the unemployed and others struggling to make the transition to the information technology marketplace. 
Inasmuch as the Committee was not able to accommodate my request in the bill reported from Committee, could my good friend the Chairman provide me with some insights on the prospects for funding when the House and Senate meet to resolve differences between their respective bills?

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation offered by our distinguished friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to ensure that the Energy Department has the resources to address an important public health issue and is not saddled with a massive unfunded mandate in the wake of the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). 
This privatization will entail the purchase of nuclear material from the Russians--material which it is clearly in our national security interest to have removed from the international market. There is currently a fund within USEC which deals with the `disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride'--and this fund contains an estimated $400 million. If no changes are made, this money will go to the U.S. Treasury when the Initial Public Offering occurs, possibly as soon as next week. 
This fund was created explicitly to handle the disposition of this kind of material. But if the law isn't changed, the Department of Energy (DOE) would have to find new funding sources in order to treat the material--and it may not be able to come up with the money. 
This would be a vary undesirable result. The material under discussion is highly toxic--and disposing of it is and should remain an important national security priority. That $400 million is needed to stabilize this material, and to process it so that parts of it can be recycled and other parts can be safely secured. 
This bill would provide that, `the Secretary of Energy shall prepare, and the President shall include in the budget request for fiscal 2000, a plan and proposed legislation to ensure that all amounts accrued on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation for the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used to commence construction of, not later than January 31, 2004, and to operate, an onsite facility at each of the gaseous diffusion plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, to treat and recycle depleted uranium hexafluoride.' 
The bill will address this key challenge. And it will also prevent a major economic dislocation in two communities--Portsmouth, OH (whose USEC plant has 2,400 employees) and Paducah, KY (whose USEC plant has 2,000 employees). This bill will support new decontamination and decommissioning jobs at these plants, which may experience limited job loss through the privatization. 
It is an important investment in these two communities--and in a sensible toxic-materials disposal policy for America. I thank Senator McConnell for his leadership on this legislation, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this effort.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about health care, managed care, and the several proposals in Congress that attempt to address these issues. 
Mr. President, just this morning, the assistant Republican leader, Senator Nickles, and his Republican working group, unveiled an outline of a bill they are developing, a bill that they intend to shortly introduce. 
This is clearly an issue that affects all Americans. Back home in Ohio, I hear constantly from my constituents about the issues involving managed care and the new world of health care that we all live in. 
Mr. President, I recognize and share the concerns that many Americans have with the cost and the quality of health care and of managed care. As the father of eight children, I visited emergency rooms and I visited pediatricians' offices. I hear and I understand parents' concerns about all the new hurdles in health care. I understand the problems of parents struggling to try to get a doctor's appointment for their children, the difficulty in trying to get managed care plans to authorize care, and the concern that their children will not get needed care if that care is not authorized. 
Mr. President, these are problems shared by millions of American families. They are problems Congress must deal with. But as we look at this issue, and all the problems and concerns that go with them, we need to be careful. We need to be careful that we do not create solutions that are really worse than the problems. 
For example, as we look at regulating managed care, we have to be careful about the impact of proposed regulations on the availability of that care. Certainly I do not believe any of us wants to see fewer people being able to get health insurance as a result of our good intentions. That is why we need to be sure that whatever Congress does, we do not cause health care costs to significantly increase. We know that the only result of higher costs will be a health care system that many companies and individuals will simply not be able to afford, meaning more Americans will be denied quality health insurance. 
So where do things stand right now? Obviously, several health care proposals already have been introduced and talked about, such as the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act, or PARCA, and also the Democrat's Patients' Bill of Rights. Other options are being developed. I already mentioned the legislation being developed by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, and a Republican working group. The House of Representatives is considering their own proposals as well. 
The bottom line is this: It is clear that Congress needs to consider managed care reform legislation. I am eager to work with my colleagues to make sure some crucial issues, particularly the issues that face America's children, are in fact addressed. 
Mr. President, while I would like to see specific language--after all, as we always say, the devil is always in the details--I believe that the legislation unveiled today by the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, and the rest of the working group, represents a positive--a positive--start on the road to reform. 
I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a guarantee that children will have direct access to pediatricians. I have said it many, many times on this floor, but let me say it again this evening--children are not just little adults. Their health care needs are unique. When a child goes to a doctor's office, that child needs to see someone who has been specifically trained to deal with the unique issues of pediatric care; that child needs to see a pediatrician. 
I am very pleased that my discussions with Republican task force members on pediatric issues has helped produce a provision in the working group bill that would guarantee our children will be, in fact, treated by pediatricians. 
Mr. President, there are several additional ways that we can further improve the quality of children's health care as a part of this overall managed care reform effort. I would like to talk about these additional ways right now. 
Specifically, Mr. President, I believe there are three key issues that would go a long way to addressing the health care needs of our children: No. 1, additional pediatric protections beyond what is already now in the bill. In addition to guaranteeing access to pediatricians, other basic protections for children should be addressed to help make sure that health plans are addressing specific pediatric needs. 
The most important of these is making sure that when a child faces a serious health problem that calls for specialty care, that that child has access to a health care provider with pediatric training or experience. This could mean that a child with a heart murmur would be guaranteed access to a pediatric cardiologist. It could also mean that a baby in need of intensive hospital care and monitoring has access to a children's hospital, a children's hospital to make sure that pediatrics-specific equipment and care is available for that baby. 
Mr. President, my wife Fran and I have personal experiences with our children and with children's hospitals. When your child--my child--has a serious medical problem, you want the best care, you want the best specialists. Many times, quite bluntly, that means going to a children's hospital. 
Specialists trained to treat adults often do not have the expertise that children need. That is not their specialty. I would hope that our efforts of managed care reform include making sure children have access to the necessary pediatric expertise, whether that be from the initial treating physician being a pediatrician, or whether it means ultimately going to a children's hospital. 
Mr. President, it is important that these basic protections are in place for children, because pediatric care is probably the part of managed care that we really know the least about. The truth is, we just don't know how well managed care takes care of our kids. The measures of quality and studies we have that evaluate managed care simply have not looked at children. In the absence of this evidence, I think that some basic protections for children are required, and they certainly make sense. 
I also don't believe the cost of these pediatric protections will amount to a great deal. As we all know, children comprise about 30 percent of our population, but a much smaller part of the cost of health care, a much smaller. I don't believe that making sure children can see pediatricians and pediatric specialists will have an increase on health care costs. In fact, it should have the opposite effect. It could and should reduce costs. This kind of access could cut down on unnecessary trips to doctors, emergency rooms, and work as a good avenue for preventive medicine. Preventive medicine is important for all of us, but nowhere is it as important as it is in dealing with our children. Let me say that again. As the father of eight, I think anyone who has had children knows that and understands that preventive care is the key. 
Let me move to the second point and the second suggestion, that is pediatric quality-related research. One important trend we have seen lately in our health care system is the effort to measure quality and improve the science of health care quality. The ability to measure this is vitally significant. But as with many parts of our health care system, not enough attention has focused on children. It is reported that only about 5 percent of this research is aimed at our kids. What is the result? We just haven't had the same type of advances and quality improvements for our children that we have seen for adults. 
I have introduced a bill that tries to fix this by focusing attention on pediatric quality-related research. Among other things, our bill includes dedicated funding to make up for the lack of health care outcomes and quality-related information for children. The legislation being developed by the Republican working group already includes a significant focus on health care quality research. My friend from Tennessee, Senator Bill Frist, has worked very hard on this part of the bill and he has done an excellent job. I believe we should build on that effort to focus specifically on children. I believe that would be an excellent and an important addition to managed care reform. 
Let me turn to the third item. The third area where I believe we can improve this bill, the third item with which I think this Congress must deal, the other improvement I would like to see considered, is language to strengthen the services provided by our Nation's poison control centers. Other than preventive care, much of the health care our children receive is based on emergencies, occurs when emergencies happen. One of the more common emergencies in children, of course, is poison. Each year more than 2 million poisonings are reported--2 million--over half of which occur in children younger than 6 years of age. 
While our Nation's poison control centers do a very good job, a very good job responding to these crises, they do face funding problems. Many of these centers have been financed through unstable arrangements from a variety of public and private sources. Funding difficulties are the primary reason that about half of our poison control centers are not certified, meaning that they may not be operating at all times or that fully qualified experts may not be available around the clock. 
I have written legislation that would deal with this problem by providing Federal supplemental assistance to poison control centers. In addition, the bill that I have sponsored, and is cosponsored by Senator Abraham, would create a single, simple, toll-free number so parents will always know who to call in the event of a poisoning emergency, so that they always know what number they can call. These measures not only would improve the quality of health care services available for children's health, they would be lifesavers as well. 
We have before the Senate a very important debate dealing with the quality and availability of health care. As always, when we talk about health care, we need to be sure we are meeting the needs of children as well as adults. So, as we begin the debate and consider the legislation, we have a great opportunity, a great opportunity to take action that improves the lives of our young people. This Congress already has enacted a number of important pieces of legislation that will save lives, that will save young lives. 
Last year, for example, we passed important bipartisan legislation to improve the quality and the availability of health care for low-income children. We also passed bipartisan legislation to reform our foster care system, vitally important legislation to reform our foster care system that will save lives and is saving lives. 
This Congress clearly has taken the opportunity to improve the lives of our children. I am hopeful we will take advantage of this opportunity that we face this week and next week, the opportunity that is before us, to find the solution that best provides for health care quality for our children and for all Americans.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment my colleagues for the unanimous passage of the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998. When I introduced this legislation, S. 1976, I wanted to increase public awareness of the plight of crime victims with disabilities--by developing a research and statistical basis from which to understand the nature and extent of crimes against people with developmental disabilities. 
Gauging from the favorable response of my colleagues, the press, and people in the disability community itself, public awareness of the crime victims with developmental disabilities has increased by the very introduction of this legislation. But we recognize that this is only the tip of the iceberg--the larger problem is crimes against people with many other kinds of disabilities as well. 
Passage of this legislation comes not a moment too soon. It is time that we began a new, hopeful chapter in the lives of the many disabled individuals who live quietly in fear of crime and violence. 
There are too many victims who cannot communicate what has happened to them--who find it more difficult than most crime victims to seek comfort, counseling, reassurance, and protection. These victims must relive the violence for the rest of their lives. 
Today, as a governing body, the United States Senate has spoken collectively on this increasing challenge. We know that for a number of reasons, more people are being born developmentally disabled. Among the factors are poor prenatal nutrition, increases in child abuse, and substance abuse issues, including fetal alcohol syndrome. 
It is my hope that the Department of Justice will engage the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council to produce seminal, multi-disciplinary research that will encourage further academic research in this area, and develop useful new strategies to reduce the incidence of crimes against the disabled. America should not have to rely upon foreign countries to infer research and statistics about our own citizens. 
Passage of this legislation is an important recognition of the severity of the impact crime has on these people's lives. It is an attempt to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. We will not let the disabled suffer alone and in silence any longer. As a country we must understand them, learn to communicate with them, and reassure them. 
This is a very important step forward for American society. 
I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise tonight to make some comments about America's strategy in the long and vitally important struggle we are waging against illegal drugs. When it comes to ensuring a bright future for our children, there are very few things we can do that are more important than protecting them from drugs. 
Earlier today, President Clinton and Speaker of the House Gingrich unveiled a major billion-dollar advertising campaign, a campaign approved by this Congress to reach our children with a hard-hitting message about the dangers of drugs. Mr. President, in my view, this is a very worthwhile project; it is something that we should do; it is something that I believe will in fact make a difference. It comes not a moment too soon. 
Advertising is important in virtually every sector of our society. Those of us who run for public office use TV and radio; products are sold every day. I think the evidence is clear that we can reach our young people; we can reach everyone through very effective antidrug advertising. 
Mr. President, investing in antidrug education campaigns is important, but education is just one of the key components. It must be part of a balanced overall strategy if we are to truly fight drug abuse. To succeed, we have to rely on more than just creative minds on Madison Avenue. We need the help of teachers, doctors, parents, and many more, to help reduce demand through education and through treatment. We need the help of law enforcement officers, we need the help of prosecutors, judges, to arrest and then send drug pushers to prison. And we need drug enforcement agents, Coast Guard crews, and even members of our military to seize drugs at the source or in transit before they come into our country. It takes all these individuals, and so many more, to wage a comprehensive--to wage a balanced, effective war on drugs. History proves the fight against drugs is only successful when it is balanced and when it is in fact comprehensive. 
Mr. President, sadly--sadly--our overall drug strategy today is neither balanced nor comprehensive. Our drug strategy today is imbalanced because of a lack of commitment for the international and for the interdiction components of the antidrug effort. Let me repeat, I believe that we are not making enough effort in the international area and in the interdiction components of the antidrug effort. 
Now, what do I mean by the interdiction component? What do I mean by the international component? Let me define `international effort,' what I mean by that, and what I mean by `interdiction efforts.' 
International efforts include any direct assistance, resources and training the United States provides to foreign countries specifically for counternarcotics matters. 
By interdiction efforts, I mean to include the seizing of drugs, the disruption of drug-trafficking routes outside our borders from where the drugs are produced in source countries, through the so-called transit zones, then up until they reach our border. 
Basically, Mr. President, what we are talking about is 
everything from the production of the drugs all the way until they hit our border. It is in this effort in the past few years we have not made the effort, not made the sufficient effort. 
Sadly, the current administration, despite its promises in this area, has been either unwilling or unable to maintain the support needed for a successful comprehensive and balanced international and interdiction strategy. 
It is, Mr. President, because of this imbalance that the current administration has failed to uphold the tremendous successes of the Reagan and Bush administrations in reducing illegal drug use, particularly among young people. In fact, the evidence shows that drug use has been on the rise. This must be of great concern to all Americans. 
Mr. President, I am going to be talking in the balance of this speech about that lack of effort in the international area and that lack of effort in the interdiction area. I want to also say, though, that part of the problem has been that initially this administration did not focus on the drug problem. It was not a high priority. The President, for years, did not use the bully pulpit of the Presidency to talk about this issue. And I think this contributed to the problem as well. 
The fact is, over the course of the previous decade, international and interdiction programs beyond our borders were essential parts of a balanced plan to reduce drug use, a plan that also included drug education, drug treatment, and local law enforcement efforts. When we used all of these, Mr. President, we made some progress. 
But beginning in 1993, the administration abandoned this balanced approach and shifted resources away from the international and interdiction components of our antidrug efforts. Simply put, this administration has deemphasized effective strategies beyond our borders that are designed to keep drugs from entering our country and infecting our communities. 
Mr. President, I believe it is time to reverse this current policy. This evening, I call on my colleagues to join me in restoring--in restoring--a balanced drug control strategy that will put us back on a course toward ridding our schools and our communities of illegal and destructive drugs. 
By doing this, we can in fact make a difference. By restoring our prior commitment to source and transit zone interdiction efforts, we can once again reduce the trafficking of drugs. 
Let me address this issue in more detail. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, effective international and effective interdiction programs are a necessary and key component of any national drug control strategy. 
During the period from 1985 through 1992, the U.S. Government waged a comprehensive and a balanced antidrug effort. The evidence clearly shows that with a balanced strategy we were making great progress. We significantly reduced drug use. 
In 1987, the Federal drug control budget was divided as follows: 29 percent for demand reduction programs. These, of course, include education, treatment, prevention. Thirty-eight percent of the budget in that year--38 percent of the budget--went for domestic law enforcement, and 33 percent went for international and interdiction efforts. 
The total national drug control budget at that time was $4.79 billion. Now, what were the results of this very balanced--very balanced--approach? We achieved some progress, with some success. 
In 1988 to 1991, total drug use was down 13 percent, 
cocaine use dropped by 35 percent, marijuana use was reduced by 16 percent. 
How did interdiction contribute to this decline? First, major efforts to limit the easy access to drugs by street dealers caused the number of potential drug users to fall off. Second, limiting success through interdiction drove up the street price of drugs dramatically. Because of interdiction, drugs became more difficult to find and more expensive to buy. 
During this period of time, our drug interdiction strategy was serious business. President Bush called illegal drugs the `gravest domestic threat facing our Nation today.' In 1989, President Bush tasked the Defense Department to play an important role in the drug war. Specifically, the Defense Department was tasked to engage in the detection and monitoring of drugs in transit towards the United States. As a Member of the House of Representatives at that time, I can recall very well the investment we dedicated toward the international and toward the interdiction components of the war on drugs. These investments did make a difference. 
All this changed in 1993. The Clinton administration immediately pursued policies that upset this careful balance in drug funding. Although we have seen a considerable increase in the overall national drug control budget, the proportion of resources dedicated to international and to interdiction efforts has dramatically declined over the past 5 years. 
In addition, interdiction no longer remains a priority within the Department of Defense. In fact, the Defense Department currently ranks counternarcotics dead last in importance, dead last in its global military force policy. 
Let me spend a few minutes talking about this major shift in policy. Let me refer Members of the Senate to my second chart. Of the $13.3 million national drug control budget for the year 1995, 35 percent was allocated for drug demand reduction programs--35 percent--53 percent for law enforcement, but only 12 percent for the international and the interdiction components combined. So we went from one-third of the total budget to 12 percent, a dramatic change. Think of it--only 12 percent of the total drug control budget was dedicated to these efforts, down from 33 percent just a few years before. Although the overall drug budget increased threefold from 1987 to 1995, the piece of the drug budget pie allocated for international and interdiction efforts has dramatically decreased. This is not only unfortunate, it is also unacceptable. 
There was then and continues to be no real effort made, no real commitment made, no real resources given, for international and interdiction efforts. We are spending some money, but it has been a dramatic decrease in the message of our total effort. I believe the results are clear and the consequences have been devastating. 
Counternarcotics funding for defense fell 57 percent between 1992 and 1995. Coast Guard funding fell 32 percent during that same period. As a result, a number of Defense Department and Coast Guard ship days devoted to drug interdiction dropped from 4,448 in fiscal year 1993 to 2,845 in 1995. Further, not surprisingly, Coast Guard seizures dropped from a little over 90,000 pounds in 1991 to a little over 28,000 pounds in 1996. In addition, the number of flight hours by airborne warning and control systems, AWAC planes, dropped from 38,100 hours in fiscal year 1992, clear down to 
17,713 hours in fiscal year 1996, a 54 percent reduction. Had it not been for the change in leadership in Congress in 1995, this very troubling situation would have been far, far worse. 
However, the damage of an unbalanced strategy has been done. Cocaine seizures had dropped, the price of cocaine had dropped, and there was an increase in drug use. Overall drug use among teens aged 12-17 rose by 70 percent. Drug-abuse-related arrests more than doubled for minors between 1992 and 1996. Since 1992, there has been an overall 80 percent increase in illicit drug use among graduating high school seniors. This negative effect has sent shockwaves through our communities and our homes. 
The rise of drug use is not at all surprising. With the decline of emphasis on drug interdiction, it became far easier to bring drugs into the United States and thus far easier to purchase drugs. A significant price decline caused by the increased availability of cocaine and heroin made it easier for casual adult users and our youth to buy these drugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that small `pieces' or rocks of crack once sold for $10 to $20 and are now available for $3 to $5. 
Mr. President, what disturbs me about this current national drug control strategy is that this unbalanced trend continues. As we can see in the second chart, in the late 1980s there was a generally balanced distribution among the three different functions--demand reduction, law enforcement, and international interdiction efforts. In 1987, you can see, they are fairly balanced. Compare that to the distributions for the years 1994, 1995, and then 1998. One can see that our previous balanced approach certainly no longer exists. 
The red on the chart is the international and interdiction components--again, Mr. President, basically our entire antidrug effort from the source countries to the transit zones, right up to the border of the United States. That is what this red represents. What you find is, it was basically a third when we started, when we looked at 1987, but by the time we get to 1995 and 1998 it is a much smaller percentage, down to as low as 12 percent. That is the problem. 
Our previous balanced approach simply no longer exists. The strategy has changed, and, sadly, so have the results. This really is the untold story of what has gone on in regard to our antidrug efforts during the past few years. It is a story that I think has to be told, and it is a story that I think the Senate, the House, and the American people simply have to pay attention to. We have to change this trend. We need to restore a balance, a balanced strategy. 
Let me make it clear that I strongly support funding to keep with the demand side of the drug situation; that is, finding a way to persuade Americans, particularly young people, that doing drugs is wrong, that it destroys lives, families, schools, and communities. Truly, in the end, reducing demand is the only permanent way to really overcome the threat of drugs. As long as there is demand for drugs, there will always be a supply. That is why education and treatment, both--education and treatment--remain essential long-term goal components of our antidrug efforts. 
However, reducing the demand for drugs is not going to happen overnight. It will take many years to change minds regarding the use or abuse of drugs. I believe one way to reduce demand is to have an effective interdiction policy, one that will seriously reduce the level of drugs into this country. We must find ways to raise the costs of narcotics trafficking, making it far more difficult for drug lords to bring these drugs to our Nation and in making the drugs far more costly to buy. 
It is sad to say, the drug cartels don't have a budget process or a bureaucracy to slow them down. Unfortunately, the job is not getting done. As I have mentioned before, the Caribbean is becoming more and more the transit route of choice for drug traffickers. I have made two visits to the transit zone in the Caribbean in the past few months. During my last visit, I learned that our agents in the Bahamas seized more cocaine in the first 3 months of 1998 than in the previous 3 years combined. This may sound great, it may sound like we are making progress, but our agents there inform me that although they would like to take tremendous credit for these seizures, their belief, their concern, is that the higher amount seized represents probably just a small fraction of the total amount of drugs coming through this area. 
They told me that they think the amount of drugs coming through is significantly up, and they are only getting a fraction of what is coming through. 
For example, Mr. President, of the total drug air events in the Bahamas from April 1997 to April 1998, our U.S. agents told me that they believe there was only an 8 percent success rate in stopping drug air flights that had been detected. They are working hard and they are doing the best they can, but that means that over 92 percent got away. Without a doubt, there is a larger, larger flow of drugs entering the United States and a larger, larger flow of drugs coming through this part of the world. 
Mr. President, when I was in Key West for a short visit in May, I was briefed on specific interdiction efforts in the Eastern Pacific. I was surprised to find that in the Eastern Pacific the coast is literally clear today for the drug lords to do their business. We have virtually nothing going on to stop drug trafficking in this area. It is wide, wide open. This is simply unacceptable.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Moynihan, Senator Murray, and Senator Johnson, to introduce the `Africa: Seeds of Hope Act'--legislation to promote small-scale agricultural and rural development in Africa. The bill also would recognize the important benefits such overseas agriculture advances could hold for our own farmers here in the United States. 
Mr. President, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, around 215 million people are undernourished in sub-Saharan Africa. This number is expected to increase dramatically in the next century. Similarly, the number of Africans who are unable to produce the provisions they need to lead healthy, productive lives is rising. 
Food is the most basic necessity of life. Yet, millions of Africans lead lives of needless suffering because they don't have the skills and tools necessary to provide for themselves and others. As a result, many African countries are dependent on the outside world for humanitarian assistance and basic nutrition. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the year 2020. 
Mr. President, I believe that the most effective way to improve conditions for Africa's poor is to increase the productivity of their agricultural sector. Whenever I travel to developing countries, I try to spend time looking at the countries' agriculture. I have seen firsthand that rural areas can succeed through innovative agricultural development. It does in fact work. 
Mr. President, about 70 percent of Africa's poor lives in rural areas. That's where the major problem is, and that's where this bill can make a difference. 
This legislation has an important link with another bipartisan trade bill--the African Trade Growth and Opportunities Act, which I cosponsored and hope the Senate will pass sometime in the near future. That legislation is also an important step in aiding a continent in need of strong economic leadership. 
Before we can have effective trade, however, there needs to be a reciprocal market--a springboard from which we can foster substantive trade relations. This is why this bill we are 
introducing today is so critical to American interests in that region. 
Mr. President, let me outline a few highlights of this bill: 
First, it would encourage Federal agencies and international organizations to make rural development issues a priority--by teaching effective farming methods to small-scale sub-Saharan African farmers and entrepreneurs; 
Second, it would provide African small farmers and entrepreneurs with improved access to credit and other resources necessary to stimulate production and micro-enterprise; 
Third, it would mobilize new investments in African agriculture and rural development through the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation; and 
Fourth, it would facilitate the coordination of national and international agricultural research and extension efforts aimed at developing the skills of African researchers, extension agents, farmers, and agribusiness people--in fact, the bill would allow American universities to play a pivotal role in this effort. 
Mr. President, African nations are in dire need of agricultural development. This bill can help them gain the knowledge they need to succeed. At the same time, as a Senator from a State with a rich agricultural tradition, I believe we must be sensitive to the needs of our own American farmers. I believe the United States and our farmers could benefit from the passage of the bill. 
This bill could open new export opportunities for American farmers, 
especially those who produce value-added goods. As the economies in sub-Saharan Africa develop, the overall standard of living will increase. In turn, the people of Africa will be in a better position to purchase a variety of goods, including American agricultural commodities and equipment. This is where our export markets can flourish. 
Another significant point to consider is that food stability is a critical factor in preventing civil strife within nations. Our investment in international agriculture and rural development will help reduce demands for U.S. disaster and famine relief. 
Also, the most rapidly increasing markets for U.S. products are in developing countries. Hence, helping these economies grow through their agricultural sector will in the end help our own economy. 
Mr. President, international agricultural development assistance has decreased over time. In fact, in the past decade alone, U.S. AID money for this program has dropped by 70 percent. We should re-focus our efforts in this important program and this bill will do that. 
I want to commend my House colleagues, Doug Bereuter and Lee Hamilton, for their work on the companion bill, H.R. 3636. Through their vision and leadership, they are building bipartisan support for this initiative as well. 
Mr. President, this legislation has the ability to make a real difference in the lives of millions of people. Doing so serves our humanitarian and economic interests. This bill would help these countries make important progress in meeting basic human needs. I encourage and urge my colleagues to support this important and timely measure.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset bill. I am pleased that Senators Hollings, Ford, Dodd, Byrd, and Rockefeller have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. My friend and colleague from Ohio, Congressman Ralph Regula already has introduced similar legislation in the House. This bill represents a strong step towards creating a more level playing field for domestic producers. It strengthens the Tariff Act of 1930, which currently imposes duties and fines for dumping and subsidization. 
This new bill takes the 1930 Act a step further, by transferring the duties and fines to injured U.S. companies to compensate for damages. This approach is designed to discourage foreign companies from dumping and subsidization, since it would actually assist U.S. competitors at their expense. In order to counter the adverse effects of foreign dumping and subsidization on U.S. industries, the Senate should pass this bill. 
Current law has simply not been strong enough to stop harmful trading practices. It is an unfortunate truth that foreign producers have continued to engage in dumping to increase or maintain unfair market shares. This dumping occurs in the face of existing U.S. trade laws and international agreements within the WTO. 
Specifically, the problem with the law is that foreign producers are willing to pay current U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties out of the profits of dumping. In other words, there is no real disincentive to stop dumping. It's still good business for foreign companies. Furthermore, since some foreign producers receive continued subsidization, this enables them to maintain market share that unsubsidized prices would not sustain. As a result, U.S. companies are continually injured by the actions of these foreign producers. 
The law also does not contain a mechanism to help injured U.S. industries recover from the harmful effects of foreign dumping and subsidization. The foreign practices have reduced the ability of our injured domestic industries to reinvest in plan, equipment, people, R&D, technology or to maintain or restore health care and pension benefits. The end result is this: continued dumping or subsidization jeopardizes renewed investment and prevents additional reinvestment from being made. Unless we act, domestic firms will face continued price depression. This is an unfair and unacceptable trading practice by foreign firms. 
Under current law, any fines and duties imposed on foreign traders for illegal dumping practices go directly into U.S. Treasury coffers. It is important to note that U.S. trade laws are not intended to raise revenue for the Treasury. Rather, such laws are intended to see that U.S. companies face conditions of fair trade in the market. The bill I am introducing today would further that good by helping create a more level playing field and two ways mentioned earlier: 
First, the legislation would award duties and fines to injured domestic companies, and provide businesses relief from adverse effects of foreign dumping and subsidization. 
Second, this transfer of funds from foreign companies to their U.S. competitors may provide the disincentive to dump, which is a fundamental problem with current law. This would reduce the economic benefits of dumping and subsidizing. 
Many companies and workers are currently not being given the level playing field intended by our trade laws and international trade agreements. The Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset bill is the first strong step to correct his real problem by assisting domestic companies and further discouraging unfair trading practices by foreign traders.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will offer a few brief comments in regard to this very important piece of legislation that the Senate is now considering. In my work on the Labor Committee, one of the things I have been focusing on is the issue of quality teaching in our classroom. Really, there is nothing more important in regard to education than the teacher. Our children deserve to be taught by teachers who really understand their subject, understand the subject matter. 
I have worked hard to incorporate measures concerning good teaching into this bill. I want to thank Chairman Jeffords for the assistance that he has given me and the cooperation in getting these sections incorporated into this very good bill. 
Title II of this legislation is entitled `Improving Teacher Quality.' Here are some of the measures that I have been promoting that I am pleased to say have been included in this bill. One, the bill funds programs that establish, expand, and improve alternative routes to State certification for highly qualified individuals from other occupations and for recent college graduates with records of academic distinction. 
Two, this bill would develop and implement innovative efforts aimed at reducing the shortage of highly qualified teachers in high-poverty urban and in high-poverty rural areas. These efforts might include the recruitment of highly qualified individuals from other occupations--again, through alternative certification programs. 
Three, this bill would provide prospective teachers with alternatives to traditional preparation for teaching, through programs at colleges of arts and sciences or at nonprofit educational organizations. 
I am pleased that this bill has a strong focus on alternative certification or licensure of teachers. I introduced S. 1742, the Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act back in February of this year. I introduced it because I wanted to give highly qualified people who like to teach, who want to teach, a chance to do so. These 
are people who can serve as mentors and who can serve as role models, real life examples of how a good education can make a huge, positive difference in a student's future. These are the types of individuals that we should be encouraging to become teachers and to get into education. 
I also take a moment to talk about the commonsense Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act, which I introduced last July. I am pleased that this provision has also been included in this bill. Members can find it incorporated in title IV of the bill before the Senate. 
Now, Mr. President, the Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act provides school loan forgiveness to individuals who earn a degree in early childhood education or in related fields and who then obtains employment in a child care facility. I think we must recognize the extraordinary need that exists today for quality child care. Recent studies have shown that more than 80 percent of child care centers provide mediocre or poor quality services. The indications are that a mere 14 percent of the centers surveyed met levels of quality that were high enough to adequately support a child's development. The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act will help ensure that our children get higher quality child care. It will do it by encouraging more people, better qualified people, to teach in these facilities. It will encourage students who are in college to major in this area and to make their lifework early childhood development. Again, I don't know what could be more important. 
Finally, let me say I am glad that this bill includes important legislation I sponsored having to do with the underground railroad. The Underground Railroad Education Culture Act will provide for the establishment of programs to research, display, interpret, and collect artifacts and other items relating to the history of the underground railroad. The history of the underground railroad is important to this country. It is important to Ohio, and it is important to me personally. In the 20 years prior to the Civil War, it is estimated--no one will ever know what the true figure is--but it is estimated that more than 40,000 slaves, 40,000 human beings escaped bondage and made their way to free soil on the trail of the underground railroad. 
This is a great story. It is a great story that every schoolchild in America should know about. More than 150 underground railroad sites have been identified in my home State of Ohio alone. We are sure there are many, many more besides that. These are sites that symbolized at the time freedom for thousands and thousands of enslaved Americans. When I visit these places, as I have with my family, it gives me real pause for hope about the future of our country. 
When we talk about race relations in this country, we would do well to remind ourselves that at one of the darkest points in our history--maybe our darkest point, the period of slavery--some blacks and some whites took immense personal risk to work together for freedom, to work together for liberty. It is a great story. This is a part of the American story that we should be proud of and we should build on. In Ohio, we are very proud of the part our ancestors played in this great story. This is why I think this legislation is so very important. 
I want to again thank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, the chairman of our committee, and my other colleagues on the Labor Committee, for agreeing to place this legislation in the managers' amendment. 
It was very important to recognize this period in our history. 
Let me conclude, Mr. President, by mentioning briefly what I believe to be the next step on education policy. I have introduced legislation that would provide assistance for the creation of nonprofit teacher training facilities across the United States, facilities that would help train teachers--teachers who are already in the classroom, or individuals who are about to enter this great profession. S. 1742, the Teacher Quality Act, which I have introduced, is a commonsense piece of legislation that would assist school districts in their struggle to maintain the highest possible academic standards for their children. I hope that in the weeks ahead we will consider this bill as well. 
Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan effort and will vote in favor of its passage. Again, I congratulate Senator Jeffords and the other members of our committee who have worked so long and hard to bring this very good and comprehensive bill to the Senate.

Mr. DeWINE. One of the key priorities for America today is protecting our young people from drugs. We need to stay on the lookout for new and different ways that we can make even a small difference in this important fight. This morning, along with Senators, Grassley, Kohl, Abraham, Sessions, and Coverdell, I am introducing a bill that is neither monumental in approach nor grandiose in scope--but it will break on of the links in the chain of the drug trade. 
There is now a loophole in Federal law that permits large quantities of a certain class of drugs known as controlled substances to pour into our country at an alarming rate. Included among these are some dangerous hallucinogenics and so-called date-rape drugs. 
The reason for this current loophole is that, under present law, an individual is permitted to transport a 90-day supply of a controlled substance into the United States. By `controlled substance' we mean a substance that is either banned or regulated by the Drug Enforcement Agency. This `personal use exception,' as it is called, is well intentioned. It was created to allow Americans who become ill or injured abroad to carry their necessary medication back to the United States. I want to emphasize that this bill would by no means end that very legitimate practice. That is not our intention at all. However, this legislation would stop the blatant exploitation of that exemption which is allowing some drug traffickers to operate freely in the United States. 
Let me explain. Specifically, these narcotics are being legally purchased in another country without any sort of documentation of medical need, then brought across our border, and then illegally sold on our streets in this country. By closing this loophole, we will empower our law enforcement to stop what amounts to nothing more than another form of drug trafficking in the United States. 
The remedy we seek today is both effective and sensible. It would limit the amount of these controlled substances that can be carried back to the United States by Americans to 50 doses. According to the DEA, that is about a 2-week supply, enough time to go get a new prescription before running out of that medication. 
I would also like to note some things that this legislation will not do, so we can explain it very clearly to Members. It will not change the law with respect to noncontrolled prescription drugs, drugs such as insulin or Premarin, and it would not affect the ability of people to obtain drugs to treat heart disease or cancer or AIDS or other serious illnesses, because these medication are not on the Controlled Substances List at all. I also indicate to my colleagues that there is support for this among the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs--they all support this approach. They recognize the problem and would like to see it resolved. 
Let me again emphasize, this legislation is not complex. All we are really doing is closing a loophole to stop this illegal trafficking of controlled substances in the United States. If we are really going to make drug interdiction a priority, then it makes a great deal of sense to take this relatively small but effective and meaningful step. We need to take this step today. 
Before closing, I would like to compliment my friend and colleague from the State of Ohio, Congressman Steve Chabot, from Cincinnati, who has shown great leadership on this issue, and many issues. It was through his active and tireless efforts in raising the profile on this issue that I was first made aware of the problem. I look forward to work with him and my other colleagues on this very important new initiative. It is my hope the Senate will act quickly and decisively to approve this very commonsense piece of legislation.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in 1989, President George Bush called drugs `the gravest domestic threat facing our nation today.' Almost nine years later, that threat still exists. 
That same year, President Bush tasked the Defense Department to play an important role in the drug war. Specifically, the Defense Department was tasked to engage in the detection and monitoring of drugs in transit towards the United States. At that time, counter narcotics, and drug interdiction were key components of our nation's drug control strategy. As a member of the House of Representatives at that time, I can recall very well the investments we dedicated toward the international and interdiction components of the war on drugs. These investments made a difference. We made a dent in the drug industry. The price of cocaine increased. Drug use declined significantly. 
That was 1989. In 1992, the focus and the level of commitment toward a comprehensive drug control strategy has diminished. The drug threat is as strong as ever, but the same cannot be said for our drug interdiction efforts. It's not just a case of fewer resources, it's a case of diminished priorities. In fact, in its list of priorities, the Defense Department currently ranks counter-narcotics dead last in its mission statement. 
This is an unfortunate mistake. 
Mr. President, it's time we re-ordered our priorities. That is why last week, my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, myself and Senator Grassley and Senator Helms, introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. This amendment, which was adopted by the Senate last week, simply states that a higher priority should be given within the Defense Department to drug interdiction and counterdrug activities. Specifically, our drug control mission should be ranked at the same level as our peacekeeping operations. I thank my colleagues for accepting my amendment by unanimous consent. It is my hope that the final bill will contain similar language. 
The facts bring us to no other conclusion--it's time to make drug interdiction a priority again. In 1988, close to 2 million adolescent Americans were drug users, and by 1992, that number was down by 25%. At that time, we had a balanced drug control strategy--with sufficient investments in the key components: interdiction, treatment, education and law enforcement. During that same period, marijuana use dropped by over 16 percent and cocaine use was down 35 percent. Our efforts were concentrated and effective--with inspiring results. 
Mr. President, that progress ceased in 1992, and since that time, teenage drug use has more than doubled--and the ramifications have been far-reaching. For example, drug-abuse related arrests for those under the age of 18 in 1996 were twice those of 1992. Health costs continue to rise as this plague spreads uncontrollably. 
Youth drug use is on the rise because drugs have increasingly become both more available and more affordable. The Office of National Drug Control Policy has reported that small `pieces' or `rocks' of crack, once sold for ten to twenty dollars, are now available for three to five dollars. The street price of drugs is decreasing and our efforts to limit their supply are failing. 
Mr. President, this increase in illicit drug use can be traced in part to the decline in counter-narcotics as a priority for national defense policy. In 1992, Department of Defense funding for counter-narcotics activities in transit areas was over $500 million. A steady trend in decreased funding brought it down to an all-time low of $214 million in 1995. Mr. President, that is more than a 50% decrease in funds. Thankfully, due to efforts by my Senate and House colleagues, last year's allocation was increased to $300 million. However, we are nowhere near the 1992 levels. 
In recent years, the Department of Defense has been called upon to support counter narcotics activities in transit areas in the Caribbean. However, assets critical to the drug interdiction effort have been consistently diverted to matters considered a `higher priority.' 
Mr. President, this decrease in funding has had an unfortunate impact on our drug interdiction efforts in the Caribbean. For example, the number of days per year that our ships spend patrolling the Caribbean has shrunk by two-thirds. Some of our key interdiction agencies have reported that the ships and manpower needed for effective interdiction are unavailable. Also, there radar system is less extensive--and even if drug traffickers can be identified, we lack the manpower necessary to intercept and seize the illegal drug imports. In 1996, only half of the known maritime drug events detected resulted in apprehension or seizure. Our defenses are down and the drug lords are taking advantage of this weakness. Added to this decline in resources is the increase in more sophisticated resources utilized by the drug cartels. 
According to the State Department, about 760 metric tons of cocaine were produced in South America in 1996. Of that, 608 tons were destined for the United States through the transit zone. U.S. government agencies that deal with cocaine seizures indicated that with additional equipment, annual cocaine seizures can be significantly increased. The Department of Defense, however, has indicated that it will not be able to provide these additional assets because of other priorities. 
Mr. President, this attitude was not acceptable in the late 1980's and it should not be acceptable now. It is necessary that we once again implement an effective transit zone operation as an integral measure to limit the availability of illicit drugs to our youth. 
It is time to renew drug interdiction efforts, provide the necessary equipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and make the issue a defense priority again. I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment and helping turn the tide of the drug crisis in our country.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, to offer an amendment to restore a piece of history for our veterans. This may be the last opportunity we have to bring an Ohio-built ship back to the state of Ohio--where so many U.S. Navy ships were built. Our amendment would allow for the restoration of the tank landing ship, the U.S.S. Lorain County  (LST-1177), so that it may be restored and serve as a memorial to Ohio veterans. 
A number of individuals deserve credit for this initiative. First, I commend my friend and colleague Congressman Paul Gillmor. Congressman Gillmor is a true friend of Ohio Veterans. He took the lead in adding similar legislation to the House of Representatives' version of the Defense Authorization Bill. Secondly, I would like to recognize the efforts of the members of Ohio War Memorial, Inc. Their patriotic devotion to this memorial is very worthwhile and highly admirable.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today on behalf of myself and my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, is a very simple, straightforward amendment. It would simply require that all Defense Department physicians have unrestricted licenses in order to practice medicine. In addition, our amendment would require the Department of Defense to set up a monitoring system to ensure that military physicians obtain continuing medical education in his or her specialty. This amendment is about ensuring that the men and women of our armed forces, as well as their families, are guaranteed a physician corps that meets the same professional standards of civilian practitioners. 
A number of individuals deserve credit for this initiative. First, I commend my friend and colleague from Springfield, Ohio, Congressman Dave Hobson. Congressman Hobson is one of the true best friends of our military families, and he has been a true leader in Congress to ensure these families have available to them a high quality health care system. He is the lead sponsor of similar legislation in the House of Representatives, along with thirteen of his colleagues. 
Congressman Hobson is not the only one from the Dayton area that has shown an interest in health care quality for military families. Last October, a series of articles were written by the Dayton Daily News on the quality of military health care. 
One particular issue highlighted in this series involved the license requirements for doctors who practice medicine at military facilities. While civilian doctors hold a license in the state where they practice, military physicians can hold a license from one state and practice medicine in U.S. military facilities in all fifty states and around the world. This exemption is needed obviously because military doctors frequently are transferred to other facilities. 
That general requirement makes good sense. After all, it is impractical to have more than 13,000 military doctors applying and testing for a new license every time they move, which can average one move for every two to three years, and does not include the possibility of no notice deployments and yearly exercises. Two of the key requirements of military health care is mobility and flexibility, and both must remain to be the case. 
Generally, the system works well. Unfortunately, one state has been offering `special' licenses for doctors practicing at mental institutions, Indian reservations, and military facilities. 
The Dayton Daily News reported last year that 77 military doctors received `special' medical licenses, which were easier to obtain and has less rigorous testing requirements. In essence, the `special' license lowered the level of standardized competency. 
The amendment I introduced today will eliminate this loop hole. Specifically, it will require the Defense Department to have their physicians carry a current `unrestricted' license. 
To their credit, our armed forces, through the regulatory process, already are moving toward the very same goals of this legislation. Our amendment simply codifies in the law this basic requirement--to ensure that there is a minimum standard of professional competency. 
Just as important, under our amendment, the mobility and flexibility of military health care would be maintained by allowing the `unrestricted' license to be issued by any state, but it will not be a `specialized' license that would be able to circumnavigate proficiency standards. 
Military personnel and their families deserve to have the peace of mind that no matter where they are stationed, or where they are treated, they will receive the same level of competent health care. 
This amendment, Mr. President, gives military personnel and their families this peace of mind.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to pass S. 1379, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. I introduced this legislation along with my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, and fifteen of my colleagues on November 5 of last year. Our Judiciary Committee Chairman, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, Senator Leahy, strongly support this bill. Indeed, I want to thank Senator Leahy and his staff for their tireless work in helping to bring this legislation to the floor. As an authority on the Freedom of Information Act, or `FOIA' (pronounced FOYA), Senator Leahy has made very useful suggestions that I have incorporated into the substitute. These changes satisfy privacy concerns raised by FOIA and Privacy Act professionals. Finally, I want to underscore that we would not be here today without Senator Moynihan and his staff. He has brought to our work the unique insights on the classification system that he gained as chairman of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy Classification. 
The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act represents what I hope will be the culmination of work begun in the last Congress to release U.S. government-held records of Nazi war criminals, the Nazi Holocaust and the trafficking of Nazi-held assets. 
Just two years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, and with it, the end of the Nazis' death grip on an entire continent. Since that time, searingly detailed accounts of the Nazi Holocaust have provided more and more evidence of the true magnitude of the atrocities that were committed. 
We have learned so much. Yet, if the last few years are any indication, we still have a great deal more to learn. 
After the fall of communist rule, Russia and several former Soviet-bloc nations opened volumes of secret files on Nazi war crimes. Argentina has cooperated in the public release of its files. British government records are being declassified and made available for public scrutiny. And over the course of last year, Swiss banks and the Swiss government have been under intense international pressure to make a full accounting of unclaimed funds belonging to Holocaust victims, as well as Nazi assets that may have once belonged to Holocaust victims. 
Mr. President, here at home, our own government has been gradually making records available about what it knew of Nazi-related activities and atrocities. Last year, a government-conducted study revealed new information about what the U.S. Government knew regarding the transfer and flow of funds held by Nazi officials. This report found that the U.S. government was aware that the Nazi mint took gold stolen from European central banks and melted it together with gold obtained in horrible fashion--gold obtained from tooth-fillings, wedding bands and other items seized from death-camp victims. 
Mr. Chairman, the photos I have on display are several aerial U.S. intelligence photographs taken in 1944 of Auschwitz, with prisoners being led to the gas chambers. These pictures were discovered by photo analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1978. They confirm what we had heard from the Polish underground that a `death camp' did in fact exist at Auschwitz. They also demonstrated that our government had photographs of these camps as these atrocities were occurring. 
These pictures tell a grisly story. How many more such pictures or documents exist? With the legislation before us, we intend to answer that question. 
Both Congress and the President have taken action to promote the release of government-held records during this tragic era. On April 17, 1995, the President issued an executive order calling for the release of national security data and information older than 25 years. Late in the 104th Congress, thanks to the tireless efforts of my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, and Representative Carolyn Maloney and several others, we passed a sense of the Congress resolution, which stated that all U.S. Government agencies should make public any records in its possession about individuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes. The President agreed, noting that learning the remaining secrets about the Holocaust is clearly in the public interest. 
The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is designed to put the concerns expressed by the last Congress into strong action. First, the bill would allow for expedited processing of FOIA requests of survivors of Nazi persecution. These individuals are growing older every day, and the time remaining for them to obtain answers to the questions that have troubled them for five decades will soon come to an end. We owe it to those who suffered--and to those who seek to prevent future genocides--to disclose fully and completely all the records in the United States on this issue. 
Second, the bill would establish the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group. This Working Group would to the greatest extent possible locate, identify, inventory, declassify and make available for the public all Nazi war records held by the United States. This means that all materials would be required to be released in their entirety unless a Federal agency head concludes that the release of all or part of these records would compromise privacy or national security interests. The agency head must notify Congress of any determination to not release records. Thus, we in the Senate would be in a position to review the material being withheld to ensure that it was being done for valid reasons consistent with this legislation. 
The Director of the Holocaust Museum, the Archivist of the United States, and the Historian of the Department of State are specifically appointed to sit on the task force because of their unique expertise on this subject. Further, to help the interagency group complete its task, the President is authorized to appoint the head of any other Agency and up to three additional people with expertise on this subject who can assist with the identification and disclosure of relevant documents. 
This pro-active search is necessary, because a full government search and inventory has never been completed. For example, some documents that surfaced this spring were found among materials related to Southeast Asia. 
Our bill is targeted toward two classes of Nazi-related materials: First, war crimes information regarding Nazi persecutions; and two, any information related to transactions involving assets of Holocaust and other Nazi victims. 
In summary, what we are trying to do with this bill is strike a clear balance among our government's legitimate national security interests, the legitimate privacy interests of individuals, and the people's desire to know the truth about Nazi atrocities. These records, once released, will be held in a repository at the National Archives. 
Let me enumerate several changes which we have made since the bill was unanimously reported out by the full Judiciary Committee last March: 
Section 3(b)3(B) was revised to make clear that the standard of judicial deference currently accorded to 
agency classification decisions under exemption (b)(1) of the FOIA applies to exemption decisions rendered by Heads of Agency's making a withholding decision under Section 3(b). As the Committee of Conference recognized when exemption (b)(1) was amended in 1974, executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into what possible adverse effects might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record. Accordingly, it is expected that federal courts, in reviewing a decision by an Agency head that disclosure and release of a Nazi War Record would be harmful to a specific interest identified in an exemption herein, will accord substantial weight to an agency's affidavit or other submission concerning the record in question. 
Records held by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the Department of Justice are specifically exempted. Nonetheless, because of the substantial expertise at OSI, it can reasonably be expected that OSI will be asked to assist with the review of records held by other agencies. OSI is currently engaged in an effort to close ongoing investigations and prosecutions of alleged war criminals. Thus, to ensure that the high priority investigations continue and all relevant documents found during the search are quickly reviewed for declassification, my colleagues and I have asked the Appropriations Committee to provide a small increase of $2 million in OSI's budget to enable the staff to take on and complete both of these tasks. 
Section 2(b)(1) has been revised to extend the life of the interagency group from one to three years in recognition of the fact that there are extensive document holdings that must be reviewed. The bulk of this work should be done in the first year. The three year life of the Working Group cannot become an excuse to proceed slowly. 
This bill not only addresses the acts of Nazi War Criminals, but also addresses those who transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of assets involuntarily taken from persecuted persons by, under the direction of, or on behalf of, or under the authority of the former Nazi Government of Germany or any nation then allied with that government. 
This bill is a bipartisan effort to ensure the Federal Government has done all it can to ensure Holocaust victims and their families can obtain the answers they need. 
The clock is running, and time is running out for so many victims of the Holocaust. They, and history itself, deserve to know as much as possible about this tragic chapter in the story of humanity. 
I thank my colleagues for their strong support for this legislation.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the Coverdell-Craig amendment. As the Chair knows, and Members know, the Coverdell-Craig amendment was offered yesterday to the underlying McCain tobacco bill. I congratulate my colleague from Georgia and my colleague from Idaho for this very worthwhile amendment. 
Let me first, though, begin by saying, again, what I have said numerous times on the Senate floor in the last few weeks, and that is I support the underlying McCain bill. 
It represents a unique and critical opportunity to change attitudes and to save young lives from the debilitating effects of smoking. All of us know, Mr. President, all too well, that youth smoking is a component of an even larger and more dangerous reality, the tragedy of youth drug use. 
If we had to talk about the health problems in this country today, particularly if we want to talk about the preventable health problems in this country, we would talk about illicit drug use, we would talk about smoking, and we would talk about abuse of alcohol. Those three are clearly the three biggest, the things that will ultimately kill tens of thousands of Americans. They prey on our young. 
So I think it makes sense, as we struggle in this Senate to come up with a comprehensive bill that deals with our tobacco problem in this country, that we also use this as an opportunity to deal with another problem, and certainly a related problem, and that is the use of illicit drugs. So I congratulate my friends and colleagues from Georgia and Idaho, Senator Coverdell, Senator Craig, for this very good amendment. 
I think we need to use this unique opportunity to address youth smoking. But we also need to take it one step further and address youth drug use. Doing so would make this even more effective, this current bill, the McCain bill, even more effective in changing the young lives for the better. 
Mr. President, drug trafficking remains a tragic reality of life in this country today. Let me share some facts with my colleagues. 
Fact: Recent reports suggest that heroin trafficking from Mexico has dramatically increased. 
Fact No. 2: The Caribbean is fast becoming once again a major illegal drug transit route. 
Fact: While drug production and trafficking have been on the rise, our resources we, as a country, have dedicated for drug interdiction have dramatically declined. 
In 1987, approximately 27 percent of the entire national drug control budget was dedicated to interdiction. During that period of time, the United States did, in fact, make a dent in the trafficking of narcotics. Cocaine seizures, for example, were significantly up. 
However, Mr. President, starting in the early 1990s, the percentage of drug control funds devoted to interdiction has declined dramatically. In fact, by 1995, only 10 percent of the national drug budget was dedicated to interdiction--a very significant drop. By 1998, the percentage still remained at 10 percent. Looking at it another way, in 1992, over $2 billion was dedicated to interdiction purposes. But by 1995, only $1.2 billion was set aside for this specific matter. 
Mr. President, let me be very clear. I strongly support--strongly support--increased funding to deal with the demand side of the drug situation 
that is finding ways to persuade Americans, particularly young Americans, that doing drugs is wrong, that it destroys lives, and destroys families, schools, and communities. 
In a sense, Mr. President, we could argue that in the end reducing demand is the only real effective way to ultimately overcome the threat of drugs in this country today. As long as there is a demand for drugs, there will always be a supply. That is why education as well as drug treatment remains central long-term goals. 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Idaho recognizes the need to invest in demand-reduction efforts, as well as the need to invest in interdiction efforts. However, reducing the demand for drugs is not going to be achieved overnight. It will take years, if not generations, to change minds and attitudes regarding the use or abuse of drugs. 
I believe one way to reduce demand is to have an effective interdiction policy, one that will put a serious dent into the flow of drugs into this country. We must find ways to raise the cost of narcotics trafficking, making it far more difficult for drug lords to bring these drugs to our Nation and making the cost of drugs on the streets--whether that be the streets of New York, Los Angeles or Cleveland--making the cost of those drugs go up. Just like the underlying bill, we can impact demand by raising the street value of drugs, and we can do that by going after the supply routes. 
There is an inverse relationship between the cost and consumption. I believe that is true with drugs. I believe that is also true with cigarettes. That is the basic principle of the McCain bill. I think it is logical to extend that principle, as my colleagues have done, Senator Coverdell and Senator Craig, in this amendment. 
As I mentioned, I do want to make it very, very clear: Drug interdiction, which I am talking about this afternoon, is only one of the things that we have to do. We have to have good domestic law enforcement. We have to deal with the problem of treatment. Treatment does work. It is tough but it can, in fact, work. We can save lives. We have to continue to invest in treatment. Education prevention--that works, as well, as long as we are consistent. As long as we do something consistently through a child's life, it works. So we need to focus on that, as well. 
Let me turn now to what I was talking about a moment ago, that is the need to increase our emphasis on drug interdiction. As I mentioned before, the Caribbean is becoming more and more the transit route of choice for drug traffickers. I made two visits to this transit zone in the Caribbean in the last several months. During my last visit, I learned that our agents in the Bahamas have seized more cocaine in the first 3 months of 1998 than in the past previous 3 years combined. With sufficient funding, interdiction efforts can make a huge difference. Clearly, drastic funding reductions have drastic consequences when it comes to results. 
I had the chance on these visits to meet with the soldiers on the front lines, or sailors on the front lines of our war on drugs. I witnessed our strategy in action. I sat down with the experts, both military and civilian, the people who are actually on the front line, the people who are charged with carrying out the monitoring, the detection, and the interdiction of drugs. Given what I have learned during these visits and the 
conclusions I have reached, the amendment by the Senators from Georgia and Idaho could not have come at a better time. There is a dire need for a renewed commitment, a rededication of resources toward drug interdiction. 
With energy and with adequate resources, our drug interdiction efforts can be improved. We cannot ask those tasked to implement our drug interdiction strategy to conduct their missions without the proper level of resources to do the job. One reason why is simple: This drug interdiction puts the lives of these law enforcement officers in danger. That is the nature of the business. We have to ensure that they have the best equipment, the best resources and the best intelligence so that they can carry out this mission, not only so they can be effective, but so they can do it in as safe a way as humanly possible. The men and women charged with interdicting drugs face a ruthless enemy who will go to great lengths to protect their cartel. We are dealing with millions and millions of dollars. 
When I visited the Caribbean last month, I saw videos of drug traffickers in `go-fast' boats--that is what they are called, go-fast boats--that are made almost exclusively for the only purpose of bringing drugs up from Colombia, bringing up drugs from that part of the world. I saw videos of the go-fast boats literally running over Customs vessels in the shallow waters south of Florida during a nighttime interdiction pursuit. I believe we owe it to these law enforcement officers to ensure they have the proper equipment and manpower to do the job they were asked to perform. After all, it is unfortunate reality that the drug cartels don't have a budget process or a bureaucracy to slow them down. These drug cartels, these drug lords, are constantly adjusting to their environment and updating their equipment. 
What kind of resources are we talking about? What kind of resources do I believe we are lacking? Let me use the U.S. Customs Service operating in south Florida as just one example. In 1986, Customs had 77 vessels and 124 maritime officers. Today, they are now down to 30 vessels and 23 officers. Funding for the Maritime Enforcement Program is down from $13.25 million--that was the figure in 1992--to $5.2 billion. So we have gone from $13.25 million in 1992 to $5.2 million in 1997. 
Further, Customs no longer has a 7-day, 24-hour operation. To make matters worse, Customs not only lacks basic resources, they also lack 1990s technology. A Colombian go-fast boat can go between 80 and 90 miles per hour, while the few Customs go-fast boats that are available only top about 70 miles per hour. So not only does Customs lack resources in general, they lack the state-of-the-art equipment needed to match those of the drug lords. 
On my most recent trip, I visited the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force located in Key West, FL. This is the primary hub for detection, monitoring, and interdiction efforts. During these visits, I saw firsthand that our government agencies there--and there are many--have tremendous monitoring and detection capability, and they are doing a good job. They can detect when a small, drug-carrying aircraft is leaving Colombia and making the journey across the Caribbean. 
Unfortunately, however, while we may have the capability to detect and monitor drug trafficking in the Caribbean airspace, we do not have adequate resources and capabilities for the end game--the actual seizing of illegal drugs in transit. And the drug lords know this. For example, I was informed that of the total drug air events in the Bahamas from April of 1997 until April 1998, our U.S. agents state that there was only an 8-percent success rate of stopping drug air flights that have been detected--8 percent. That means approximately 92 percent got away. And though cocaine seizures are up, their concern is the higher amounts seized represent probably a fraction of the total amount of drugs coming through the area. 
While in Key West, I was also briefed on specific interdiction efforts in the eastern Pacific. I was surprised to find out that in the eastern Pacific, off the coast of Mexico and Central America, up this region that is cut off on the map, 
the coast is virtually, literally clear for drug lords to do their business. Mr. President, this is simply not acceptable.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of final passage of the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act authored by my distinguished colleague, Senator Herb Kohl from Wisconsin. Senator Kohl has worked tirelessly to strengthen our child support laws, and I have been happy to lend my support to this effort. 
The House bill we pass today mirrors the Senate-passed version that we sponsored earlier this session. I believe children should not have to suffer twice for the decisions of their parents to divorce; once when they decide to divorce, and again when one of the parents evades the financial responsibility to care for them. 
Let me tell you just one story from my home state of Ohio. Marcia Walsh, the mother of seven children, became one of the working poor when she and her husband divorced, and he neglected his child support order. He left Ohio, leaving Marcia to support seven children, ages 6 to 15, on food stamps and a $14,000-a-year night job. When Marcia turned to our federal Child Enforcement Program, she discovered a failed program whose collection rate is only about 19.4 percent. 
Mr. President, people like Marcia and her children deserve better than that. 
Our bill will help address situations like theirs, in two ways. First, the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act gives federal law enforcement an incentive to bring more of these cases against deadbeats by making this offense a felony. Second, this legislation would make movement from state to state to avoid child support payments a crime. Today, nonpayment of child support is a class B misdemeanor, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is frustrated at having to chase deadbeats for just a class B misdemeanor. Federal prosecutors are equally discouraged about trying misdemeanor cases. 
It is currently not a crime to move to another state to avoid having to pay child support. Under this bill, not paying child support for two years, owing more than $10,000 in back child support, or going to another state to avoid child support payments would be penalized by a fine or two years in jail, or both. If the parent flees the state where the child resides, and owes more than $5,000, the same penalty described above would apply. 
Mr. President, making sure parents live up to their financial responsibilities for their children is a very important national priority. We have serious laws in this country protecting life and property--it's highly appropriate that we protect with equal seriousness the interests of our most precious national resource, America's children. 
I thank Senator Kohl for his work on this important bill.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his very kind comments. I think the charts of the Senator from Massachusetts tell a great story, actually a sad story, but it is a very effective story and really illustrates the need for this bill. 
I also thank my other colleague from Massachusetts for his kind words about this amendment a few moments ago. 
The amendment that Senator Durbin and I have offered really will make a few, but very necessary, improvements to the so-called look-back provision of the underlying McCain bill. Let me start my remarks this afternoon by talking a little bit about the look-back concept, and then the specific look-back provisions in the McCain bill, because I think an understanding of the broad concept of look-back is essential to understanding what the McCain bill tries to do in this area, and is also essential to understanding what Senator Durbin and I are trying to do with our amendment. 
Conceptually, the purpose of look-back--whether in the original tobacco settlement, the McCain bill, or in the Durbin-DeWine amendment--is to change the incentives for tobacco companies. Until now, tobacco companies have always had an incentive--potential profits--to convince children to use their products. The look-back approach simply flips this incentive--it turns it around by giving tobacco companies incentives to help reduce the number of minors using their products. This incentive structure, through which tobacco companies will work with us rather than against us in our goal to reduce youth tobacco use, is created by imposing assessments on tobacco companies if they do not meet targets reducing youth tobacco use. 
It is simple: If the targets are not met, the companies will have to pay. If the targets are not met to reduce teenage smoking--and these are targets that the tobacco companies all said they could do, all made a commitment to do in the settlement they reached with the attorneys general--if those targets are not made and are not met, then the tobacco companies will have to pay. 
Before I get into the specifics of the McCain look-back provision and our amendment, I would like to reiterate what I have said several times on the floor of the Senate before, and that is that the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, has done a great job in bringing this tobacco bill to the Senate floor against some very, very difficult odds. This is a comprehensive bill. Something like this, frankly, has never been tried before, so I commend my colleague from Arizona for his great work. 
This bill includes many different parts, each of which is important if we are really going to reduce youth use of tobacco. The look-back provision that our amendment deals with is an 
important and integral part of this campaign to reduce youth use, but is only one of several things the bill does, all of which are important, to have a real impact on youth smoking. Again, I congratulate Senator McCain, as well as his colleagues on the Commerce Committee, for facing this difficult issue and meeting it head on with a very sound piece of legislation. 
I will now turn to a quick overview of the Durbin-DeWine amendment. Madam President, the Durbin-DeWine amendment will make two changes to the look-back provision in the underlying McCain bill. 
First, our amendment will shift the emphasis from an industry-wide look-back to a company-specific look-back. Let me make it very clear, both the McCain bill and the Durbin-DeWine amendment blend the company look-back with the industry-wide look-back. Both are blends. The difference is the Durbin-DeWine amendment puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the individual tobacco company. We follow what I consider to be, frankly, a more conservative point of view, and that is accountability, that the tobacco companies should have to live with the consequences of their actions or even their inactions. That is the conservative way to look at it, but more important than that, it is the right way to look at it. 
The second provision of the Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for increasing the McCain bill's targets for the reduction of youth tobacco use. Yes, by setting a higher target of reduction, the goal is to have fewer kids smoking. But having said that, let me emphasize that our provision effectively takes us back to what the cigarette companies agreed to over a year ago when the cigarette companies and the attorneys general reached this agreement. Our provision takes us back to what the tobacco companies said they could do in June of last year. 
I'll repeat that: We are simply increasing these reduction targets to levels the tobacco industry and companies agreed was achievable just last year in the attorneys general agreement. 
Let me discuss in more detail these two specific changes in the look-back provision that we are providing in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. I will first start with the company-specific emphasis and how we would require more accountability from the individual tobacco companies. 
The first important change that I mentioned our amendment makes is that it shifts the emphasis from an industry-wide look-back to a company-specific look-back. What does this really mean? Let me explain by using an example and by talking about my early concern of last year's settlement which only contained an industry-wide look-back and had no company-specific piece in it. 
Under a pure industry-wide look-back, the industry is measured and judged as a whole on how well it does in reducing youth tobacco use. What this does, in effect, is dilute the incentive for each company to do everything it can to make sure children are not using its products. 
Why do I say that? Simply because the effects of whatever that company does--positive or negative--is spread across the entire industry. In a sense, this is a form of socialism. Whatever they do, however well they do it, they only get a portion of the credit, and they only get a portion of the blame. The intent is to share--everybody is in this together. You can have one company that does everything it can to reduce teenage smoking, and you can have another company that completely ignores everything and goes about its business to continue to try to hook kids. It doesn't matter; each one is treated equally under a pure industry system. I think that is wrong. 
Let me raise a specific case that I brought up a few weeks ago when I talked about this issue on the floor--a case that involves the Philip Morris company, the maker of Marlboro. This company, Philip Morris, through the use of the Marlboro Man and other marketing campaigns, has been extremely successful in selling cigarettes to our young people. 
They know what they are doing. They are very, very good at marketing their product. They did such a good job that by 1993--if you can believe this--60 percent of all teen smokers in this country used Marlboro--60 percent. But in the overall market of all cigarettes sold, the legal market, Marlboro only had 23.5 percent of the market. So 60 percent in illegal sales--60 percent to kids--and only 23.5 percent to legal, adult market. The Marlboro Man and other advertising did a fantastic job, tragically, in hooking young kids. 
How would an industry-wide look-back approach affect Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro? After all, Philip Morris is responsible for a majority of youth smoking, meaning this is the main company the look-back incentives should be aimed at. 
Madam President, the industry-wide look-backs in the original settlement and in the McCain bill would allocate the industry-wide assessments to each company based on its adult market share--not its share of the youth market. So if the cigarette industry as a whole misses its reduction targets, under the original settlement reached last year, Philip Morris would only be responsible for 23 percent of the total industry-wide look-back assessment, even though Philip Morris is responsible for 60 percent of all the youth smoking in the country. 
So once again, let me ask the question that I have asked previously: What do we think Philip Morris will do under this industry-wide look-back if we had a pure industry-wide look-back provision? Will the look-back succeed in getting Philip Morris to try to reduce the number of children who use its products? I do not think so. For the industry-wide look-back, it is pretty clear to me that the answer is no. Philip Morris will probably not try to reduce youth use of its products at all. Why? Well, it's simple: the incentive is not there. The industry-wide look-back forces other companies to pay for the sins of Philip Morris. Philip Morris is simply smarter to simply ignore the look-back. 
So an industry-wide look-back in this case would fail to do what it is supposed to do. In the case of Philip Morris, it would fail to give the proper incentive to the very company with the most responsibility for stopping kids from using its products. 
So, Madam President, what can we do to make sure the look-back provision is effective and really gives tobacco companies the right incentives? The answer is simple. We need to hold each company responsible individually for meeting the youth reduction targets, and allow each company to reap the rewards or face the consequences of its own behavior. 
Madam President, it is the American way. It is the right way. Let us hold them responsible. Let us hold them accountable. Let us measure their success or their failure. 
Right now about 3 million children, it is estimated, smoke Marlboro cigarettes which are made, as I mentioned, by Philip Morris. Instead of focusing a look-back provision on what the industry as a whole does, it is so much more powerful to simply say to Philip Morris--this is what we ought to say to them--`You have 3 million children who use Marlboro cigarettes--3 million in this country. You need to do everything you can to help us reduce that number. That's your responsibility.' 
That is what the look-back provision should hold them to. That is what the Durbin-DeWine amendment says. By focusing on a company-specific rather than industry-wide look-back, we are simply telling each tobacco company that it is responsible for its own behavior. In this way we create a more powerful incentive for each company to help us achieve the ultimate goal of this legislation. Let us never forget that ultimate goal; that is, to reduce youth smoking in this country. 
Let me talk, if I could, Madam President, about the second part of our look-back change that we make in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. Part of our amendment, as I mentioned, was to set higher reduction targets for youth smoking than those set in the McCain bill. What this means is that tobacco companies are given an incentive to try to get even more children to stop smoking. 
Using the current level of youth smoking as the baseline, the Durbin-DeWine amendment would aim for a 67-percent reduction in youth smoking in ten years. This compares to the 60-percent goal contained in the McCain bill. But this, I think, is the important thing: in real terms what this means is that 450,000 fewer children will smoke if the companies meet the reduction targets in our amendment. Since we know that one-third of smokers die young as a result of their habit, this means that 150,000 fewer children will die early as a result of smoking. 
These are real kids. These are real children that we are talking about, and they are quite possibly real deaths. So let me say it again. If tobacco companies meet their reduction targets in our amendment, it will mean 450,000 fewer youth smokers and 150,000 fewer early deaths due to smoking. 
What we need to remember is that the reduction targets in our amendment in real terms are actually equal to the targets from last year's settlement. Our amendment has the same targets to which the industry agreed to last year. 
To me, Madam President, this is an easy issue and it is an easy decision. In effect, the industry has already agreed that it is possible to prevent almost half a million more kids from smoking than the underlying bill calls for. Let us pass this amendment which stops these kids from ever becoming smokers at all. 
Again, I emphasize our amendment merely takes us back in real terms to what the industry, the tobacco companies and the attorneys general, agreed to last June. The 67 percent in our amendment is really equal to the 60 percent they agreed to last June because of the change in the baseline. The raw numbers are the same. 
Madam President, I would like to respond for a moment to some of the criticism that we have heard about this amendment. And let me just comment about a few things. 
Some Members have come to the floor and have argued that this might be too punitive. Some have said that the potential assessments under this amendment are just too high. 
First, I would like to say that my sincere hope is that we never see any assessments under a look-back, because this would mean we will have met our reduction goals for youth smoking. Once again, since the industry, the tobacco industry, has agreed that these reduction goals are achievable, I think it is likely we will never see any assessment under the look-back, at least that is what our goal is. 
But this will only be true if we create a strong incentive for each company to meet the reduction targets. This is what our amendment, the Durbin-DeWine amendment does. The company-specific payments in the Durbin-DeWine amendment are higher than the McCain bill. However, the industry-wide payments are lower. When you add the two types of look-backs, company-wide and industry-wide together, you really will not find a huge difference between our amendment and the McCain bill. We have a different blend. We change the emphasis, but overall there isn't a great deal of difference. 
Let us take an example. Let us suppose that each and every company misses the reduction target in a given year by 10 percent. If this happens, the combination of industry-wide and company-specific payments in the McCain bill would add up to a total of $1.8 billion. In the Durbin-DeWine amendment, under those same set of facts, it would add up to $2.4 billion. There is a difference, but the difference is really not huge. 
Madam President, the real difference between our amendment and the McCain bill is not the size of payments, but rather the emphasis. The company-specific focus of the Durbin-DeWine amendment places more incentive on each tobacco company individually to change its behavior and to stop children from using its products. 
Madam President, others have argued to address another issue that has been raised, that company-specific look-backs are unfair because the company cannot really control whether kids use its products. Well, we know from experience and seeing what these tobacco companies have done in the past that that simply is not true. There are many things that tobacco companies can do to prevent kids from using their cigarettes. There have been many things that the tobacco companies have done to get kids to use their cigarettes. We know there are many things they can do to stop them as well or reduce it. 
Those who make that argument aren't giving the tobacco companies enough credit. The most basic thing tobacco companies can do is make sure its advertising is not appealing to kids. 
Now, some of this is already taken care of and addressed in the McCain bill. We do this by placing marketing restrictions on tobacco companies, such as prohibiting the use of cartoon characters or human images. That is in the bill. But advertising is a subtle thing. The tobacco industry has proven a real expert at dealing with this. There is simply no way Congress can specifically prohibit every type of advertising that might appeal to children. We are not that good. We can't write legislation that specific. 
The advantage of a company-specific look-back provision is that each company is given the incentive to think about other ways its advertising may be attracting children and then to stop it. But even beyond the issue of advertising, companies can still have an impact on how many kids use their products. For example, they can initiate their own antismoking advertising campaigns or their own education programs that would build on efforts called for elsewhere in this bill. They could do it if they wanted to do it. Again, the buck stops with them under our provision. 
A company could also work with retailers to find ways to be absolutely sure that none of its products were being sold to minors. The relationship between retailers and tobacco companies is a very close one. They have used it over the years to build sales. They can certainly use it in the next few years to reduce illegal sales to minors. 
So I think those who say that, gee, the tobacco companies can't be held for liability on this, this is all beyond their control, I think that argument is absolutely absurd. 
As we can see, companies have any number of ways or tools to make it harder or less likely for children to use their products. We need to make sure they have a strong incentive to put that great genius to work. The only way to place a strong incentive on each company separately is with a strong company-specific look-back penalty like that contained in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. 
The choice before the Senate is simple. We have the opportunity when this amendment comes for a vote, the Durbin-DeWine amendment, to vote on an amendment that will prove the basic purpose of this legislation, and that is to reduce youth smoking by holding individual tobacco companies more accountable for failing to reduce youth smoking, and by restoring the original target set by the tobacco companies themselves and agreed to themselves. The Durbin-DeWine amendment will make a real difference in young lives. I, once again, urge my colleagues to join us on behalf of our young people and support the Durbin-DeWine look-back amendment. 
Some of my colleagues and friends have come to the floor, and I have heard legitimate talk about the problem of the illegal use of drugs. That is a major problem. It is a major problem in our country today. It is a major problem with our young people. If we had to tick off two of the major problems we have with our general population, but particularly with our young people, we certainly would include cigarettes and we certainly would include the illegal use of drugs. 
As I have listened to some of those debates, and I agree with what they have said and I do not disagree in any way--in fact, I am struck by the similarity between the two issues--cigarettes and drugs. I think as we approach, really for the first time in this Congress, the issue of trying to comprehensively deal with tobacco use, and as we for the first time try to structure a comprehensive program to reduce the number of young people who start smoking cigarettes, who start to use tobacco, that the lessons we have learned as a society over the last few decades in regard to the illegal use of drugs and how we deal with that and how we try to reduce that, I think are very apt. I think we ought to look at that effort in that war. 
What have we learned? We have had some success in the war against drugs and we have had an awful lot of failures, as well. We have seen the use go up and we have seen the use go down. There are times in our history where we have driven the use down and at times we have driven the use back up, particularly among our young people. I think we have learned a great deal. 
What have we learned that might be applicable to what we are trying to do in regard to cigarettes? A couple of things. One, price. Why do we spend so much time, effort, and money to try to keep drugs from coming into this country? Why do we go to the source countries? Why do we try to help Colombia? Why do we have Coast Guard cutters today off the coast of Haiti to try to interdict drugs? Why are we working in the Bahamas? Why are we working in Mexico? Why are we doing everything we can to try to stop drugs from coming into this country? 
The answer is not only do we want to keep drugs out of the hands of anybody who might buy them in this country, but at the same time we are trying to drive up the price of drugs. We know there is a direct relationship between the cost of drugs on the streets of Cleveland, OH, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and the cost on the drug traffickers to get them there; and we know there is an inverse relationship between the price of those drugs and the use of those drugs. So if it is true with illicit drugs, and I think it is true for just about any product, it certainly is true and the statistics have shown us that it can in many cases be true in regard to tobacco, as well. 
Now, I happen to think, and I have argued on this floor, that price alone is not enough, driving up the price of tobacco is in and of itself not enough. We have seen that the studies have been conflicting in regard to the price issue. But I am convinced that price is an important factor. 
What else have we learned about a war on drugs in general? We have learned that when we have come forward with very effective antidrug advertising campaigns that are focused in the media, that are focused on radio and television--we know when the genius of Madison Avenue is utilized, we know they can be effective, and they are effective. We know when we focus public attention on the issue that we can make a difference. Advertising does work. Counteradvertising works, as well. Again, another lesson from our war on drugs. We know what works and we know what doesn't. 
The same is true with education. We know that when you combine the increase in cost, the price on the street of a drug, you combine that with counteradvertising, you combine that with education sustained year after year after year in school, that it will make a difference. Part of the problem with our anti-education programs that are anti-illicit drugs, we only do them for 1 or 2 years. We might have a 5th or 6th grade DARE program, and then a young person might not get another dose of that until 11th or 12th grade in health class. We know that is a problem. Every study has shown the only way education is effective is starting in kindergarten, preferably before that, and start K through 12, every single year. 
This is not rocket science. This is not difficult. It is the same way with tobacco. The lessons we have learned, sometimes the hard way, in regard to how you deal with illicit drugs in this country--sometimes we act like we haven't learned those lessons, but those lessons can be applied in regard to stopping young people from smoking cigarettes. 
What we are trying to do in this bill is to take the knowledge that we have and come up with a comprehensive package that will in the long run save tens of thousands of our young children's lives. That is what we are about. So as we debate this bill and we talk about different provisions, whether it is the look-back provision or other provisions, let us keep our eye on the ball. Let us keep our eye on what are the bare facts and what the goal is. The goal is to reduce teenage smoking. 
The only way that we can do that is to come up with a comprehensive approach that combines education, antismoking advertising, reduction in advertising aimed at children, good law enforcement, and an increase in price. When you put all of those things together you have a good, good, fighting chance to dramatically reduce teenage smoking in this country, which is what our goal is. That is why I continue to support this legislation and continue to urge my colleagues, no matter what their position is on individual amendments as they come up, to keep our eye on the ball and keep pushing this bill forward. It is essential that we get it passed. We have a great responsibility to get that job done. I hope we will continue to do it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to offer this amendment, an amendment to make the tobacco companies more accountable in our collective effort to reduce youth smoking. 
Specifically, our amendment would make a few improvements--a few improvements, but significant ones--to the so-called look-back provisions of this current legislation. The look-back provision in the current bill sets targets for the reduction of teen tobacco use. And, then, it imposes assessments, or surcharges, on individual tobacco companies and the entire tobacco industry if these reduction targets are not met. 
Our amendment would make two simple modifications to Chairman McCain's look-back provision. 
No. 1, our amendment, like the McCain bill, would impose a surcharge on specific companies as well as the entire industry, if reduction targets are not met. Both our amendment and the McCain amendment are blends of those two formulas. They are different, a different blend, as I will talk about in a moment. 
Our amendment puts a larger emphasis, though, on the company-specific surcharge. We do this because we believe the threat of a surcharge against specific companies will give them a much stronger incentive to limit teen tobacco use. In a sense, it is sort of the American way. We hold people accountable. We hold them accountable--we give them the benefit of what they do as well as the detriment if they do something wrong.

Mr. DeWINE. Second, Mr. President, our amendment will increase the targets for reduction of youth tobacco use over what is in the McCain bill. But actually with our amendment, we are restoring, as Senator Durbin has pointed out, the original reduction targets that were agreed to by the industry last year in the global settlement. The net effect of our amendment is to restore what the tobacco companies said and agreed to last year and said that they could do. 
Let me repeat, we are not increasing the final reduction targets. Rather, we are simply restoring the original targets that were agreed to in last year's settlement. 
Before getting into the specifics of this amendment, I first congratulate my good friend, John McCain, who has put together a very credible, a comprehensive, a good bill. He has faced a very difficult challenge and has crafted an excellent piece of legislation. This is a comprehensive package that attacks teen smoking in a variety of ways. I believe this thorough approach, when all the pieces of the puzzle are finally put together, will significantly reduce teen smoking. Let's make no mistake about it, that is our objective--to reduce teen smoking; to reduce the number of young people every day in this country who start smoking. 
I have followed the policy evolution of the look-back provisions since they were first proposed in that global tobacco settlement announced last June, announced by the attorneys general and by the leading tobacco companies' executives. That settlement contained a look-back provision. That settlement contained this brand new and innovative idea--the idea that we could enlist the tobacco industry in our fight to reduce teen smoking by simply giving them a disincentive to hook young people on tobacco. 
The look-back provision in the original settlement called on the companies to work with us to reduce youth smoking by 60 percent after the passage of 10 years. That 60 percent was to be phased in at several intermediate levels. The settlement negotiators, including the tobacco industry, all agreed to these reduction targets. They obviously believed that they were achievable. 
The settlement then gave the tobacco industry a big shove, a big shove to meet these targets by calling for an industry-wide surcharge in any year the targets were missed. The amount of the surcharge was to be based on how much the industry missed the reduction targets, up to a maximum or limit, a cap of $2 billion. 
While I look at this, I recognize really from the beginning, the look-back could be a tremendously useful tool in reducing youth smoking. The tobacco industry, driven by a profit motive, has been incredibly effective in convincing our children to start smoking. If the financial disincentive was strong enough, we would have a way to put the industry's expertise to prevent youth smoking and to turn this whole thing around. 
After studying the settlement's look-back proposal, I have two basic concerns: First, I was concerned that the proposed surcharges were not high enough to work as a significant deterrent to the tobacco companies. Second, I had some concerns about the settlement's way of distributing the surcharges across the entire industry; in other words, how they determined who was going to pay what. This was an issue I explored in several committee hearings, both in the Judiciary Committee and in our Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
This approach, frankly, if I can use the term, seems almost socialistic to me, the provision that was originally agreed to. The provision calls for looking back first at the end of 3 years and periodically after that to see how well the tobacco industry had done in reducing youth smoking, and then once we found that out, irrespective of how an individual brand did or individual company did in reducing youth smoking, to then say, `OK, we're going to spread it out in the industry; in fact, we are going to spread it out, not based on the percentage of youth who were smoking a particular brand, we are going to take that penalty and spread it out among adult users.' 
So if a particular company had 20 percent, for example, of the youth market, but 60 percent of the adult market, then, in fact, that company would end up taking 60 percent of the burden of the look-back penalty. It is, in effect, socialism. It is something I think that should offend every Member of the Senate. It is not right, it is not fair, and that is why we are changing it in this amendment. Frankly, that is why Senator McCain put together an amendment, a compromise, that did, in fact, begin to go down this road. Our amendment simply goes a little further. 
Any company under the original settlement that did its job in reducing youth tobacco use would have to share the benefit of this good behavior with its fellow tobacco companies. Likewise, a company that failed to reduce youth smoking would not bear the brunt of the resulting surcharges because the payments would be spread across the industry. 
This approach would have the effect really of diluting the incentive for individual companies to work as hard as they can 
to prevent teens from using their products. After all, why would a company try to prevent kids from smoking its cigarettes, perhaps creating a competitive disadvantage for itself in the larger adult market when other companies would share in the reward for whatever success they had in reducing teen smoking? It just doesn't make sense. 
The way the payments are allocated to the specific companies in an industry-wide approach on the basis, as I pointed out, of the adult market share, would also dilute the incentive for companies to do a good job. Let's take a quick look at the example of Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro. 
This company, through the use of the Marlboro Man and other marketing campaigns, has been unbelievably successful in selling cigarettes to our underage smokers, to our kids, to our children. In 1993, 60 percent--60 percent--of all teen smokers used Marlboro, when in the overall market for adults, Marlboro only had 23.5 percent of the market share. 
Let's look at how the industry-wide look-back approach would affect Philip Morris. After all, Philip Morris is responsible for a majority of youth smoking. This is the main company at which look-back incentives should be aimed. 
Industry-wide look-backs allocate the industry-wide assessments to each company based on its adult market share. So if the company misses its reduction targets and is then required to pay, Philip Morris is only responsible for 23 percent of that total, because that is the total market they have, even though Philip Morris is responsible for 60 percent of youth smoking. 
In the case of Philip Morris, under these statistics, if in a year the tobacco industry did not meet its targets and there was a penalty that had to be assessed under the law, the division clearly would not be equitable. Philip Morris is responsible for 60 percent of the problem, 60 percent of the kids smoking, 
and yet they would only pay 23 percent under this straight provision. 
Let me again point out that Senator McCain has changed this and moved it in the right direction. Our amendment moves it even further towards more emphasis on company-specific penalties. 
Mr. President, what do we think Philip Morris will do under this industry-wide look-back? Will the look-back do what it is supposed to do, get Philip Morris to try to reduce the number of children who it sells to? Mr. President, to me it is pretty obvious what would happen. Because this industry-wide look-back forces other companies to pay for the sins of Philip Morris, I would expect Philip Morris would simply ignore the look-back. The industry-wide look-back in this particular case would fail to do what it is supposed to do. In the case of Philip Morris, it would fail to give the proper incentive to the very company with the most responsibility for stopping kids from using its products. 
That is why, Mr. President, I started calling for a tougher look-back than the original settlement and for one that would be imposed on individual companies that fail to reach the targets rather than on the entire industry. In other words, an effective look-back proposal is one that would commit each company, each tobacco company to feel the impact--whether good or bad--of its own behavior. 
And let us not kid ourselves, Mr. President. The tobacco companies will be able to, through marketing techniques, through their dealings with their dealers, through what advertising they will still be able to do, they will be able to have a substantial impact on youth smoking. 
Yes, the Government is going to come in under this bill and we will have some anticigarette campaigns. The Government will be involved in other things. This will not be brand specific. This will be across the industry. It will, we hope, have the effect we intend it to have. But the fate of each company will still remain in each company's hands. And they should be accountable for what they do. They should be given--sort of the American way, Mr. President--they should be given an incentive to do what is right and they should be, if I can use the term, `punished' if they do not do what is right. It is the right way to approach the problem. 
Mr. President, I worked with the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, to include a tough company-specific look-back in this legislation. Prior to the Commerce Committee's markup of S. 1415, I wrote to Chairman McCain to request that his legislation's look-back surcharges be higher than the original settlement, and that they be assessed against individual companies. 
Mr. President, by the time this legislation reached the Senate floor, Chairman McCain and the Commerce Committee had improved the bill's look-back provisions, and they had done it in two very significant ways. I commend them for it. In the version of this bill that came out of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain increased the level of the industry-wide surcharge and the overall cap in the look-back. This served to provide a stronger incentive for tobacco companies not to target youth. 
Further, the Senator from Arizona went even further in this regard in the managers' amendment he offered this week. Specifically, Senator McCain added a company-specific look-back surcharge in addition to the industry-wide surcharge. 
Mr. President, by including both a company-specific look-back and surcharges stronger than those in the settlement, Senator McCain's look-back provision represents a clear improvement from last year's settlement. It will be more effective. It will be fair. 
What the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I are doing as we offer this amendment is to simply refine and improve the McCain look-back provisions. And we do this in two fundamental but necessary ways. 
Mr. President, the most important modification included in the Durbin-DeWine amendment is a stronger company-specific look-back. The argument for this is simple. The higher the company-specific surcharge is, the more powerful an incentive each company has to prevent children from using its products. By putting more of the burden on individual companies, we can provide a much more powerful incentive for tobacco companies----

Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair and my colleague from West Virginia. 
By putting more of the burden on individual companies, Mr. President, we can provide a more powerful incentive for tobacco companies to meet these reduction targets, especially among those companies that have gained the most from the youth market. 
Basically, the Durbin-DeWine amendment would direct more of the surcharge amounts to be paid on a company-specific basis. The initial assessments--ones that are charged if a company 
misses its reduction target by a few percentage points--in our amendment would be higher than in the McCain amendment. In addition, unlike the McCain bill, our amendment would also bump up the surcharge once a company misses its reduction target by more than 5 percentage points. 
Let us look at one specific example to demonstrate the differences of the two approaches. Suppose we had two cigarette manufacturers--company A and company B. Each controls, let us assume, half the market, including half of the youth market. Let us say company A has succeeded in meeting its reduction goals for reducing youth use, but company B failed to reduce its targets and failed, in fact, by 10 percentage points. 
Company A has done the job. Company B has not. Here is how the total surcharges, to take a specific example--including both the company-specific and the industry-wide assessments--would break down under the McCain bill and the Durbin-DeWine amendment. 
Under McCain, company A, the good actor, the good company, is responsible to pay $200 million, but would only pay $100 million under the Durbin-DeWine amendment. 
Company B, on the other hand, the company that saw the increase, caused the increase in youth smoking, would be charged $750 million under McCain, but would pay $900 million under Durbin-DeWine. That is a 20 percent higher payment under the Durbin-DeWine amendment for the company that failed. More equitable. 
So, as you can see, our amendment would shift the financial burden toward the company or companies that are responsible for the continued youth smoking, but also away from companies that do the right thing. Because companies will know that they are on the hook for how well they do, they have that much more incentive to prevent children from using their products. 
Another way to demonstrate this, Mr. President, and to demonstrate the shift we are asking for in our amendment is to look at the overall bottom line. The McCain bill would impose an industry-wide cap, a potential maximum of $4 billion. This cap represents the maximum amount which would be assessed against the entire industry under these provisions. 
Although there is no cap in McCain for company-specific surcharges, let us assume each and every company missed its target by, say, 25 percentage points. In that case, the surcharges would all add to about $1.6 billion. So that is the bottom line for McCain--$4 billion imposed across the entire industry, shared among all the companies, and about $1.6 billion for the individual companies that had not met its goals. 
The Durbin-DeWine bottom line is as follows: The industry-wide cap is $2 billion, and the total amount of company-specific surcharges, under similar circumstances, would be $5 billion. That is only for that specific example. 
Mr. President, the real story I am trying to convey with these numbers is simple: Our amendment has a greater focus on the company-specific look-back and thus provides a stronger incentive for tobacco companies to prevent children from using their products. 
Mr. President, our amendment makes one other fundamental change to the McCain bill. Our ultimate reduction target--10 years hence--is a 67-percent drop in the number of teens who smoke. In the McCain bill, the end goal or target is 60 percent. On the surface, the McCain target appears to be the same as the 60-percent target in the original settlement the attorneys general reached last June. 
Again, I remind my colleagues, this is a settlement that everyone agreed to. And the tobacco companies said, `Yes, we will be held accountable. And, yes, we can get these targets.' So it seems as if it is the same under the current McCain language. 
But actually, on closer examination, the McCain target falls a little short of that original target in real terms. The reason why it falls short is the McCain and settlement reduction goals--although the same on the surface; appear the same--each use different starting points or different baselines. 
The McCain bill calls for a 60-percent reduction from a higher baseline figure than was used in last year's settlement. Because of this, the McCain youth reduction targets are easier to meet than the original settlement. Again, not a great deal of difference. But all our amendment does, very simply, is take us back effectively to that original settlement, which I think was our original intent of what we should do. 
What the Senator from Illinois and I are doing is restoring the original reduction goals from youth tobacco use from the settlement. The Durbin-DeWine amendment sets a reduction target of 67 percent, but after accounting for the different baselines--our reduction goal is equivalent to what is in the settlement. It is exactly what the tobacco industry last year agreed was reasonable and that they said they could reach. 
Again, I want to thank my friend from the land of Lincoln, Senator Durbin, and his staff for their work in putting this proposal together. Let me also thank Senator Wyden, who will speak in a moment, Senators Chafee, Wyden, Daschle, Snowe, and Collins for joining us as original cosponsors of this amendment. This is truly a bipartisan amendment. I also appreciate the work of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and others in the public health community for their assistance and support. This amendment also has had the active support of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop--and I certainly appreciate that. Finally, I am pleased that the New York Times has expressed its support for the amendment in an editorial in yesterday's edition. 
Mr. President, the choice before us is simple--we have the opportunity here to vote on an amendment that will improve the one basic purpose of this legislation: to reduce youth smoking. By holding individual tobacco companies more accountable for failing to reduce youth smoking, and by restoring the original targets set by the tobacco companies themselves, the Durbin-DeWine amendment will make a real difference in young lives. I urge my colleagues to join us on behalf of our young people and support the Durbin-DeWine lookback amendment. It is the right thing to do.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are ready to close down the Senate tonight, and we are about ready to end, really, the debate on the tobacco bill for this week. This bill will be back in the Chamber. We will be debating it in the future. I think we got off to a very good start. No one ever said that this was going to be an easy bill. This is a very complicated bill. Congress is doing something we have never done before. It is very complex. So we knew going in it was not going to be easy. 
Nothing important ever is easy. It is important that we continue to push on because there is a lot at stake. I would submit what is at stake, really, is the future of tens of thousands of our young people. We all know the statistics. We all know what the facts are. We all know how important it is we stop young people from starting to smoke. We know the reality that if the child does not start tobacco use at 19 or 20, hasn't smoked, the odds are the child isn't going to smoke. We also know most people start when they are young, start when they are way underage and it is illegal to smoke, cannot smoke if they do, and we know that is when they get started. 
We have heard the statistics. We know the statistics about the 3,000 children starting to smoke every day. We know the statistics that roughly a third of them will die premature deaths, some horrible deaths, because of smoking. So I think we all know what is at stake. 
I think it is important as we complete this week to remind ourselves that, yes, it is tough. This is a tough bill. This is a tough world. This is contentious. But that is what we get paid to do. That is why people send us here--to make tough decisions. I think we need to remind ourselves that this really is a historic opportunity. It is a historic opportunity that has been presented the country, and has been presented this Senate, and has been literally put in our laps. We can either take up this opportunity and do what is right and do something very constructive, or we can pass it by. This is a historic opportunity. It was really given to us because of the settlement that was announced last June by tobacco companies and by the attorneys general, an unprecedented settlement, 
a settlement that cannot go into effect without a comprehensive bill passing the Senate, passing the House, and ultimately being signed into law by the President. 
Let me commend Chairman John McCain for the work he has done in bringing this bill to the floor. Let me commend him for the work he has done this week, keeping this process moving forward. It is clear that, if we are going to reduce teenage smoking, there has to be a comprehensive approach. It is like most things in life, there are no simple answers. If there were simple answers, we would have found them a long, long time ago. 
Raising the price of cigarettes, raising the price of tobacco, is an important element to reduce teenage smoking. There is an inverse relationship, clearly, between the cost and the use. But we also know, based on every study that we have seen, everything that we have looked at, I think most of us have come to the conclusion that raising the price of cigarettes alone will not do it, that we have to do other things. We have to stop the advertising for cigarettes that appeal directly to children--get rid of the Joe Camels, or those who will follow Joe Camel; get rid of the Marlboro Man; get rid of the cartoon figures; get rid of the advertising that any parent looks at for 1 second and knows this is clearly targeted at children or, if it is not targeted at children, at least has a tremendous appeal for children. That has to be stopped. 
We have to have counteradvertising. We have to take all the ingenuity of Madison Avenue and use it, instead of killing people, use that ingenuity and use that talent to save kids. It is available, and it is out there, and we can do it. 
We have to worry about law enforcement. Again, it is no different than dealing with drugs in that respect. You have to have education, you have to have advertising, but you also have to have law enforcement. We risk, as we increase the price of cigarettes and tobacco, expanding the black market that already does exist in this country. We have to worry about that. We have to worry about the enforcement of the laws that every State has about underage smoking. We have to figure out better ways to enforce that law. 
So, we have to do all of these things. And as we proceed in the weeks ahead on this bill, and as we talk about it and we debate it and argue this point and argue that point, let's keep our eye on the ball. Let's keep our eye on the objective. For this Senator from Ohio, at least, there is only one objective, and that is to reduce the number of our kids who start smoking. If we can do that, if we can do it in significant numbers, we will have accomplished a great deal. 
That is what this bill that Senator McCain has brought to the floor is all about, and that is what we have to get accomplished. This is a historic opportunity. It is a unique opportunity. 
Let me talk for a moment, if I could, about the amendment that Senator Durbin and I have brought to the floor this evening. It is an amendment that we believe will make a difference. It is an amendment that will bring about more accountability, hold the tobacco companies responsible, make them liable for their actions, make them more accountable, and we think will make them do the right thing. 
Our amendment deals with what we call look-back. I think we have to keep in mind--I have had the opportunity to listen to a portion of the debate from some of my colleagues who followed Senator Durbin and myself, Senator Wyden--who spoke 
in favor of the amendment. I have listened to what some of my colleagues who have raised some questions about the amendment have had to say. 
In response, let me make a couple of comments. First of all, the people this is targeted at, the people we are targeting, are the tobacco companies. And the tobacco companies agreed to a look-back provision. They agreed to a very, very significant look-back provision. That was the provision which was included in the settlement that was announced last June. So they agreed to it. They are the ones who thought they could meet the 60-percent reduction target in 10 years, and that is a significant target. But they said, `We can do it.' So this isn't something that we dreamt up here in the Senate; this is something that the parties looked at, and all of them said, `We can do it.' And it is clear that they can. 
It makes sense, I think, what we have done in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. That is, we have taken John McCain's very good look-back provision, and I think we have improved it. We have made it more company-specific. What do you mean, company-specific? The original look-back provision was an interesting provision, really, in the sense that it was socialism. I don't know any other word to describe it. 
It basically said: Look, here are the targets. The tobacco companies agree on these targets. We are going to look back, after 3 years, and then after a few more, and ultimately after 10 years. And every few years, we are going to look back and see if the tobacco companies are hitting their targets in reducing teenage smoking. They said: We can get to 60 percent reduction in 10 years. And we phase that in--they phased it in, in their agreement, over that period of time. 
Every so often, we are going to look to see how we are doing. And if we determine that the reduction is not taking place, or the targets are not being hit, then the tobacco companies agreed--let me emphasize again--agreed that they would pay a penalty. 
The interesting thing is, when this was put together, however, how the penalty was calculated. The agreement was that it would be calculated industry-wide. So you would look to see what the total reduction in teenage smoking was. And then, each company--you figure out what that total penalty was. It is the penalty the tobacco companies agreed to. You take that pot of money, that penalty pot, and you divide it up among the tobacco companies, based on their total market share. So if one tobacco company had 30 percent of the market, they would get 30 percent of the cost of the penalty, irrespective of whether or not they were a leader in the sale of cigarettes to young people or whether they didn't sell a cigarette to a young person; it didn't make any difference. 
We looked at this and came to the conclusion that it really didn't make a lot of sense to base it entirely on that procedure. We came to the conclusion that the tobacco companies should be held accountable for what they did specifically. So we came up with this amendment with a variation of what Senator McCain had done, where he blended the penalties, basically making part of the penalties being applied industry-wide--that form of socialism we talked about--part of the penalties being applied case by case, company by company. 
We have kept a blend in the Durbin-DeWine amendment, but we put more emphasis on company-specific. We think it makes sense to hold the individual tobacco companies accountable for the 
reduction in their product that is being sold to kids. Now, some of my friends have come to the floor and said, `Well, look, that's not really fair. Tobacco companies can't control what they sell to kids.' 
With all due respect, that doesn't make any sense. They control it today. They control it by their advertising. They control it by whom they target. They control it by how they market the product. There is a reason that Marlboro has 62 percent of the market. There is a reason they beat everybody else out in getting the kids market, the illegal sales market, the kids-under-18 market. They have been darned good at it. So we have seen, decade after decade, these companies being very good at this and being able to figure out how they can target a niche market and how they can get into kids who are just starting to smoke. 
To say that, now, if we give them an incentive not to do it, give them a disincentive and charge them not to do it and they agree not to do it, to say they can't control what they are doing makes absolutely no sense. 
My colleague from Kentucky came to the floor and asked, I think, a very legitimate question--Senator Ford. He said--I will paraphrase what he said, but, basically: Look, you are holding the tobacco companies liable. But the Government is going to be the one who is going to be doing the counteradvertising. And the Government is going to be doing other things to reduce teenage smoking. 
I think the answer to what Senator Ford said is, yes, that is correct, the Government is going to be involved in countermeasures. The Government is going to be involved in trying to reduce teenage smoking. But that doesn't mean the cigarette companies will still not be players and still will not have things that they can control. 
Make no mistake about it, under this bill or any of the different versions of this McCain bill, tobacco companies still are going to be able to impact how teenagers smoke, and whether or not their product is marketed to teenagers, and whether their product is sold to teenagers, and whether they target teenagers. How can they do it? Well, they can do it in many ways. They can do it by advertising. The bill has restrictions on advertising. 
Yet, advertising is still going to be permitted. So how they target that advertising and what kind of advertising they place and where they place it is going to clearly impact on whether or not young kids underage buy cigarettes. 
Tobacco companies will control that. They will control advertising. They will control how they market the product as they do today. They will control how they target the product as they do today. They can run, if they want to--and this is clearly within their control--their own antismoking campaigns aimed at kids. They clearly can do that. 
We hope the more money they spend on that, the more emphasis they will put on that, it will reduce the consumption of their own product. Clearly, how the tobacco companies market and advertise will impact youth smoking. They have some responsibility. We have to hold them accountable. 
My friends, particularly on this side of the aisle, always talk about accountability. We are in an age of accountability, whether we are talking about welfare or whatever we are talking about. We are in an age of accountability where people need to be accountable for their own actions. What the Durbin-DeWine amendment says is the tobacco companies ought to be responsible for their own actions; the tobacco companies ought to be judged not by what they say but by what they do. The tobacco companies ought to be charged and looked at and judged by what the results are. That is all we are saying. 
I find that to be a pretty conservative point of view, and a point of view that most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle always talk about and, I think, support. If we look at it in this way, this is, in effect, a very conservative amendment. 
Mr. President, the Durbin-DeWine amendment changes the incentives. We get rid of the profit motive. We give the incentive to prevent kids from smoking. We give that incentive to the tobacco companies. 
Another issue that was raised a few moments ago in regard to the general look-back provision which our amendment contains and the McCain bill does, of course, is whether or not these surveys are accurate. The statement was made or the assertion was made, `How in the world can you hold tobacco companies liable for surveys?' 
First of all, they agreed to it. They agreed to it. They agreed to the broad survey of looking at the industry and looking at how much teenage smoking was occurring. They agreed to that. 
Second, these same tobacco companies rely on surveys to do advertising. They rely on surveys to do everything in regard to marketing. Mr. President, I don't think there is one of us in this Senate who has not come to the floor when we talk about illicit drugs in this country, not a one of us has not come to this floor and cited statistics based on surveys about whether the consumption of drugs among our young people is going up or going down. We take them at face value, we rely on them, we make policy based on them and we make decisions based on them. 
We have had a debate ongoing for the last 6 to 9 months in this Senate in which I have been involved on several different occasions where we have lamented the fact that among the very youngest of our children who are starting to use drugs, the consumption is going up at the same time the fear factor is going down. And we picked that up from the national surveys being done. Drug-Free Youth Group, we rely on that in our decisions. 
I think it is clear that surveys scientifically done, correctly done, clearly can tell us what percentage of the youth market is smoking and what percentage of the youth market is smoking Marlboros. There is no doubt about it. We can come within a very, very close percentage, a fraction of a percentage of getting that figure. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by again congratulating Senator McCain for bringing this bill to the floor. It is a comprehensive approach. At the end of the day, when all the days are over and this finally made its way through the Senate, if we are going to have something worthwhile, it has to be a comprehensive approach. 
We have to be concerned about driving up the cost, the price, because we know that will have an impact. We have to counter advertising. We have to have some control of the advertising and the cigarette companies ultimately need to agree to that. 
As this process goes through, it is sometimes not a pretty process, it is certainly not an easy process, but it is our process, a democratic process, and I remain optimistic that we will end up with a comprehensive bill that will reduce teenage smoking significantly, that will save lives and that will be a bill of which we can all be proud.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act. I'd like to commend Senators Abraham and Hatch for introducing such a well crafted piece of legislation. 
I think the title of this bill--the American Competitiveness Act--is especially appropriate, since we are talking about a bill that will make our companies stronger and more able to compete in the global marketplace. None of our businesses can run efficiently when they are understaffed--and in today's marketplace there are plenty of overseas competitors who will pick up the slack and take away our customers if we give them that opportunity. 
When the Commerce Department, using the Labor Department's data, projects that our economy will continue to grow at such a rate that more than 1.3 million new information technology jobs will be created over the next decade--but that our universities will produce less than a quarter of the necessary number of information technology graduates, simple math tells us that there will be a shortage of these highly skilled workers. 
It may surprise people that the high-tech industry is not just about Silicon Valley. Ohio now ranks 10th in the nation in high-tech employment and 8th in high-tech exports. In Ohio, these jobs, on average, pay close to $14,000 higher than Ohio's average private sector wage--$14,000. I want to keep these jobs in Ohio and I don't want to see them moved overseas. 
But let's look beyond statistics at what some of the largest employers in our country are telling us. They are the one we need to listen to. NCR, a leading high-tech company based in Ohio, has expressed concern that the estimated 340,000 high-tech worker shortage nationwide could affect NCR's ability to fill key high-tech positions. TRW, which is also based in Ohio, is a good example of how this shortage of skilled workers affects more than just the information technology industry. TRW, which produces safety equipment for the automotive industry and equipment for the defense industry, tells me that only one U.S. citizen for every 10 foreign students apply at TRW when they go onto a college campus to recruit. The company currently has 1,100 openings nationwide. These unfilled jobs are not helping this company to expand and create more jobs. 
Procter & Gamble is another Ohio-based company that uses H-1B visas to hire about six to ten foreign nationals a year. Some people may wonder why such a low number of employees are so essential to a company's productivity, but these specialized scientists, many with doctoral degrees, are needed for key projects. Reaching this year's arbitrary limit on H-1B visas will prevent all employers from filling such specialized positions until the next fiscal year begins, thus delaying some key projects for up to six months. When those key projects are delayed, this means other American workers cannot work, other American workers will not be able to work on these projects. In our global marketplace, competitiveness demands that our companies be able to beat their overseas competitors to market. Any delay in the product cycle--from innovation or creation to production--impedes such competitiveness and could result in such companies moving their operations overseas 
where such hiring limitations do not exit for their overseas competitors. 
Also, in a global marketplace, it only makes sense that small and large domestic companies must cater to a wide range of customer preferences and needs--they must know what the traditions and cultures of all of the countries are that they serve. I would rather have these companies hire a few foreign workers under our H-1B visa program, rather than have these companies move their base of operations--and American jobs--overseas. 
The best and the brightest of the foreign workforce are brought into our country under the H-1B system. These are productive men and women who create innovative technologies--many receiving patents for the U.S. companies they work for--and whose ideas launch new projects and, thus, create new jobs for our domestic workforce. 
I am a firm believer in educating and training our domestic workforce from within, so that this shortage of highly skilled labor may one day be solved. I strongly believe that part of the solution to this shortage depends on how we raise and educate our children and teenagers--this is why the 20,000 scholarships per year created under this bill (some for low income students) for math and engineering and computer science majors is such an important part of the bill, and such a strong contribution. I again salute my colleague from Michigan for inclusion of this Provision in the bill. Improving the educational process--whether it is job training focused on teens and adults, or math and science courses for children--is not something that can be achieved overnight. We must realistically face the shortage of highly skilled, high-tech workers and allow our companies to hire the workers they need to stay competitive in this global marketplace. The world will not wait for us to catch up in the math and science fields. We must move forward. 
The enforcement penalties included in the bill will also help us protect our domestic workforce form those who willfully violate the H-1B program. First, the bill increases penalties for such violators by 5 times the current penalty--by increasing fines from $1,000 to $5,000. The bill also provides for a 5-year probationary period during which spot inspections of the violating firms may occur at the discretion of the Department of Labor. The bill also adds a $25,000 fine per violation, and a two-year debarment from all employment immigration programs, in cases where an employer lays off a U.S. worker and willfully underpays a H1-B worker to replace the U.S. worker. 
This bill also modifies the per-country limits an employment based visas. This modification will help prevent further discriminatory effects that the current per-country limit creates for otherwise qualified people from China and India. 
I strongly support Senator Abraham's bill. I believe it contains essential provisions to protect our domestic workforce from willful violators by increasing fines and investigative or probationary periods. Out domestic employers and workforce need to have the cap on H-1B visas raised in order to remain competitive. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of the Abraham bill.  
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this coming Monday, the Senate will begin historic debate on tobacco legislation. This debate represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce teenage smoking, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save lives. 
The window of opportunity opened by last year's tobacco settlement is closing fast, and that means we simply have to keep this process moving. We have to pass a comprehensive bill and we have to pass it now. 
A comprehensive bill, Mr. President. That means we have to raise the price of tobacco. But it means much more than that alone. It means a public education campaign. It means limits on tobacco advertising. It means punishing tobacco companies if, in the future, we do not meet the goals we set for reducing teen smoking. Finally, it means enhanced enforcement so a black market does not develop. 
There will be a great temptation as we go through this lengthy debate for us to get sidetracked over the coming weeks into debates on countless side issues. It is important that we not give in to that temptation. We need to keep our eyes firmly on a much larger goal, and that goal is saving the lives of America's children from tobacco and from illegal drugs. Frankly, the only way we can achieve this goal is to pass a comprehensive bill, a comprehensive bill that is focused on our one goal, reducing tobacco and drug use among our young people. For the reasons that I will outline in a moment, a piecemeal approach simply will not work. A piecemeal approach will fail. 
I commend the majority leader, Senator Lott, for his leadership in bringing this matter to the Senate floor. Now it is up to all of us to make the most of that opportunity. That is what I want to talk about today. 
When a problem generates this much attention, we have to be all the more vigilant to make sure we pay attention to the light rather than to the heat; the facts, not the rhetoric. 
Fact: 3,000 children start to smoke every day. 
Fact: 1,000 of them are going to die early as a result of that. 
Fact: We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save these lives, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do this through comprehensive legislation to reduce teenage smoking. 
Fact: The number of legislative days we have left in this session in which to do this is rapidly shrinking. 
Fact: If we do not do this now, it may never happen. The opportunity may never come again. 
Fact: 1,000 early deaths caused every day by smoking. We need to act and we need to act now. 
These are the facts. We cannot allow tobacco companies to lie about these facts or to obscure the fact that tobacco and illegal drugs together pose America's greatest public health challenge to our children. This is a huge challenge to our future. 
And we need a truly comprehensive approach to meet this challenge of tobacco and of illegal drugs. 
What I would like to do over the next few minutes is examine some of the elements of the proposed tobacco legislation in a serious, and maybe even clinical, manner in an effort to try to determine which approaches work best in reducing smoking among our young people. 
What works, Mr. President? What works to reduce teenage smoking? That is the key question. In fact, it is the only question that we should focus on as we debate tobacco legislation. 
Let me begin by discussing the most controversial element of the various proposed tobacco bills--a tax on cigarettes. 
Mr. President, the question of whether tobacco taxes will work in reducing teen smoking comes down to the question of how sensitive teen smokers are to changes in price. The way the economists phrase this question is: How elastic is the demand? How responsive is it? Does it go down when prices go up? 
Mr. President, writing tobacco legislation would be a very easy task if the demand were very sensitive and responsive to prices. Then all we would need to do is increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes, and kids would stop smoking and their lives would be saved, and that would be it. 
Regrettably, it is not that simple. Reputable individuals and organizations in the field of public health have studied this very question and are certainly far from a consensus. 
In 1991, a study published in the Journal of Health Economics concluded that there is no statistically significant correlation between cigarette prices and youth smoking. However, a National Cancer Institute expert panel stated in 1993 that `a substantial increase in tobacco excise taxes may be the single most effective measure for decreasing tobacco consumption,' and that `an excise tax reduces consumption by children and teenagers at least as much as it reduces consumption by adults.' 
Mr. President, the confusion continues. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have data indicating that in five of the six States that raised cigarette taxes between 1993 and 1995 that teen smoking actually increased. 
Yet, two reports published by the Surgeon General in 1994 and 1998 reached the opposite conclusion--that young people are at least as sensitive to price increases as adults. 
Take all of these different findings together and they raise very serious questions about a tobacco-fighting strategy that is anchored solely by tax increases, or by an increase in the cost of cigarettes. 
Here is what I think, Mr. President, based on my experience in working over the years against illegal drugs, based on my experience in working against driving under the influence of alcohol, that crusade, that effort: There is no one single remedy. There is no one single solution. I believe that raising tobacco costs will have an impact, but will only have an impact if that is included as part of the comprehensive approach, if the increase in tobacco prices is accompanied by advertising, by counteradvertising, by pulling down the pro-tobacco advertising on TV, by strict law enforcement. All of these things, I believe, have to come together. You cannot succeed in this effort without that kind of comprehensive approach. Raising the cost of tobacco will help, but it is simply not enough. To meet this kind of challenge, we need a 
comprehensive approach, one that will harness many different elements in the common purpose of saving children's lives. 
In addition to raising the price of cigarettes, what else must we include in that comprehensive package? I outlined that a moment ago, but I would like to talk now in a little more detail about some of the other things that I think are necessary to do in addition to increasing the price of cigarettes. 
Public education. Let's start with public education. My own experience with public education on health issues, Mr. President, would indicate to me that it does, in fact, work. Let me give you and my other colleagues an example. 
Over the last several decades, we in this country have made tremendous progress in making our streets safer from alcohol-impaired drivers. Back when I was in the Ohio State Senate, I wrote legislation toughening our State's law on driving under the influence. But even more important than the laws we passed was the fact that we were able--all of us, collectively, working together--to begin to change public attitudes. This has been done by tough laws, but it has also been done by very effective advertising by groups such as the Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
It was a national campaign, and it made a difference. Talk to kids today and you will not find many who believe that driving while under the influence of alcohol is `cool' or a great thing to do. The people who do it today are treated with scorn, as they should be. See how often `designated drivers' are talked about today--a concept that 20 years ago nobody had ever heard about. Attitudes have been changed because of advertising. They have been changed because of what public officials--not just politicians, but people in the public sector--have been able to do and talk about. We have all, collectively, been able to change the culture. That is what we have done in regard to drinking and driving. That is what we have to do now in regard to teenage smoking. 
I think we have to implement a similar strategy in regard to tobacco. We have to make a massive national investment in educating our young people and in changing attitudes. We should flood the airwaves with the truth--a positive advertising and education campaign to leave no doubt where America stands on this issue, to leave no doubt what the facts are. Tobacco and the use of it may be legal, but it still kills people. Our message must simply be: stay away from it. 
Mr. President, we can do this. We have done it in other areas, and everything in our life and common sense indicates to us that it works. Those of us who are Members of the U.S. Senate, every single one of us, use a significant amount of TV advertising to get elected. Why did we do it? We did it because it works. Why do all the major products use advertising? Because it works. Why do all the national efforts in regard to drunken driving use this very creative type of advertising? Because it works. That is what we have to have in regard to this tobacco situation. 
Let me talk further now about another element, a third element, in regard to this comprehensive package that I think has to be part of the bill that we finally approve. That has to do with limiting the type of tobacco advertising. The third proposal to reduce teenage smoking is to regulate the broadcast media in an effort to block the pro-tobacco message. We begin to run into some constitutional problems here, which I would like to discuss. The more constitutional lawyers look into this suggestion, the more problematic it becomes. Basically, it is going to be hard to achieve this objective without the agreement of the tobacco companies. I think we have to understand that. 
In recent years, the Supreme Court has struck down as many as a dozen laws attempting to regulate commercial speech. In effect, the Court is reminding those of us in the legislative branch that the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech is an important constitutional value. As we look for national solutions to the tobacco-spawned health crisis, we would do well to remember that Congress cannot unilaterally restrict speech. 
Specifically, the Court would most likely apply to any of the proposed limits on tobacco advertising the four-pronged test established by the 1980 case of Central Hudson Gas & Electric corporation versus Public Service Commission. 
And it is more than likely, Mr. President, that the proposed limits would fail the tests laid out in that case--unless we had the agreement of those whose speech we seek to limit. 
Those are the facts. 
Under Central Hudson Gas, the first test to determine whether commercial speech is Constitutionally protected is: Is the speech false, misleading, or unlawful? 
Mr. President, the days are long gone when tobacco could run ads saying that smoking is good for your health. Those old advertising campaigns may have failed this test. I think today's campaigns are clever enough--and empty enough--not to make any false claims, at least under that court decision. 
The second test is: Does the limit on speech serve a substantial government interest? This is closely related to the third test: Does the limit on speech directly advance that substantial interest? 
And on these tests, Mr. President, the weight of Constitutional opinion is against unilateral limits on tobacco advertising. Two of America's foremost Constitutional scholars have testified in Senate hearings on this issue. 
Floyd Abrams--America's leading expert on First Amendment law--told the Commerce Committee, and I quote:  
Any legislation of Congress which would purport to do by law what the proposed settlement would do by agreement in terms of restricting constitutionally protected commercial speech is, in my estimation, destined to be held unconstitutional. * * * It is a basic tenet of First Amendment law that * * * the interest in protecting children from harmful materials `does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech directed at adults.' * * * The sweep of the proposed settlement's restrictions on speech are simply not tailored to its supposed aim of protecting children. 
And Harvard's Laurence Tribe--author of one of America's most influential Constitutional law textbooks--testified before the Judiciary Committee that, quote, `the proposed restrictions on tobacco advertising would raise very serious First Amendment questions if they were to be enacted into law by Congress.' 
The fourth and final test under this case asks: Is the limit on speech no more extensive than necessary to achieve the goal? On this too, the critics will note that if the same goal of reducing smoking can be achieved without recourse to speech limits, then the Constitutional claims of the speech regulators would fall. 
Let me stress, Mr. President, that I am not talking about my own opinion of the Constitutionality of these measures. That would be a subject for another speech, another day. What I am talking about is the immense practical problem posed for us, by the likely opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court based on those previous decisions. 
It's likely that the Supreme Court would find these unilateral measures unconstitutional. 
The tobacco companies would love that. They would love to change the subject. We must not allow them to do that. 
Remember the goal: We are trying to save children's lives. We are driving toward the end zone in the fight against these tobacco companies. We must not--must not--let ourselves get trapped into incurring useless penalties on the way. 
This fight is too important--we cannot let it be reduced to passing legislation that will never be enforced. Our goal is to pass effective legislation--not legislation that will tie up our anti-smoking measures in court for years and years. 
It's about results. It's about saving lives. We have to remember that. 
Let me now turn to a fourth and final element in proposed tobacco legislation--the lookback provision. In my view, Mr. President, the lookback provision is a key component of any solid and effective antitobacco bill. It's a way to hold the tobacco companies liable for the bottom line on this effort to reduce teen smoking. 
Put simply, Mr. President, the lookback provision says to the tobacco companies: If we fail to achieve our goal of substantial reductions in teen smoking, you--the tobacco companies--will pay. You will pay. You will pay a lot. 
We think that will serve as a deterrent. We think, Mr. President, that will affect the future conduct of tobacco companies. 
Now, on this one too, Mr. President, the constitutional lawyers are raining on our parade. They point out that the kind of lookback provision we need may well run afoul of Constitutional guarantees of substantive due process. They could hold the tobacco industry liable for actions and results not strictly under the industry's control--and thus be Constitutionally inadmissible. 
But I think the solution to this problem--and indeed to that of the First Amendment problem with ad limits--is relatively clear. The government may not be able to do these things by itself. But it can do them, if the industry agrees to them voluntarily. 
This, Mr. President, gives us--public officials who are concerned with public health--an incentive to insist on a comprehensive solution, and not a piecemeal approach. 
Acting unilaterally, we can punish the tobacco industry. And let me make clear--there's a great deal to be said for that. Their product has destroyed lives. 
But if we act not unilaterally, but instead approve a comprehensive solution, then we can harness all our efforts in the interest of the public good. And we can hold the tobacco companies accountable for 
helping reduce teen smoking.  
CONCLUSION 
Mr. President, America's attention is engaged by a children's health crisis caused by tobacco and illegal drugs. This is a rare and unique opportunity for us here in the Congress to create some positive change--change that will save lives. We owe it to the American people to write tobacco legislation that represents the best thinking on what will really work to get kids to turn away from tobacco and illegal drugs, and toward a more promising future. I will continue to work throughout our legislative process to make sure the bill we pass lives up to what the American people deserve. 
I hope the President of the United States will become more involved in this struggle. This, frankly, is an issue of great national importance--one that cries out for Presidential leadership. 
Mr. President, even after we pass a bill in the Senate, there will still be a lot of work left to be done on this legislation--and frankly and candidly, it won't get done until everybody sits at the table and gets ready for some heavy lifting. 
This includes the leadership of the Senate and the House, of course, and also the President of the United States. The President can make a huge difference in this process once he becomes fully engaged. 
Finally, Mr. President, I remain optimistic that we can pass a strong and comprehensive bill, not just to reduce teen smoking but also teen drug use. Last year's settlement through the States' attorneys general and tobacco companies has given us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
As this legislation moves through Congress, I believe we have to stay focused. We have to stay focused on the issue of saving children's lives. Let's vow to put together comprehensive legislation that really works. Let's do it now. And let's get it done. Mr. President, it will not be easy. 
I again congratulate the majority leader for his leadership and for his courage in bringing this bill to the floor. 
I congratulate all who have worked on this bill and other bills--Senator McCain, who has worked on this bill and brings this bill to the floor; Senator Hatch and others who have worked on other bills and other approaches. We are all going to have the opportunity next week to have our shot. We are all going to have our opportunity to work to try to fashion a good bill. 
The main thing, however, is that we keep the process moving, that we keep it moving in the Senate, that we pass a bill that is comprehensive, that is practical, that we send it on to the House of Representatives, and ultimately then get it into a conference committee and to the President of the United States. 
Frankly, it is only going to be at that time that tough, tough decisions are ultimately going to be made and that the package will finally be put together. But if we do not do our work in the Senate, if we do not keep the process moving, then we will have missed this historic opportunity. So the ball is in our court beginning next week. I fully expect the Senate to take up the bill, and I expect us to do what is in the best interests of our children and in the best interests of the future of this country. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, at this point I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of the most tragic drunk driving case in our Nation's history. Ten years ago today, on Saturday, May 14, 1988, a school bus filled with children heading home to Radcliff, KY, after having spent a day at King's Island Amusement Park in Ohio--that school bus was hit head-on by a drunk driver heading the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, KY, 10 years ago today. The collision caused the front gas tank of the bus to explode in flames. The crash caused the death of 24 children and three adults, and left many of the 36 survivors burned and disfigured. 
This crash did not just affect the 63 innocent victims who were on the bus that day. It had significant impact and changed forever many of the victims' families, friends and their community. This horrible tragedy helped fuel a nationwide movement which has helped to change our Nation's attitudes towards drinking and driving. This horrible tragedy helped spur State legislatures to enact more stronger drunk driving laws. It led to tougher enforcement and has caused people to think twice before drinking and driving. In short, it is no longer `cool' or `neat' in our society to drink and drive. And this horrible, horrible tragedy did impact people and has helped to galvanize public opinion in regard to drunken driving. 
The effects of this attitude change are well documented. In 1986, 24,050 people lost their lives in alcohol-related traffic crashes. A decade later that number had dropped by 28 percent; 17,274 people lost their lives in 1995 in alcohol-related accidents, a drop of 28 percent. This reduction is not attributable to one single event. It is not attributable just to this horrible accident, this horrible tragedy we are commemorating and thinking about today. It was a whole series of actions taken by people across this country--Mothers Against Drunk Driving, SADD chapters, grassroots efforts of survivors, grassroots efforts of victims and members of victims' families. 
We have begun, over that decade, to significantly change public attitudes. Unfortunately, after 10 years of improvement, after 10 years of fewer people dying every year due to drunken driving, these trends have now been reversed. I think our Nation has lost its focus. We no longer focus on this as a national issue. From 1994 to 1995, fatalities in alcohol-related crashes rose--did not decline--rose, and they rose by 4 percent. That was the first increase in over a decade. In 1995, 41 percent of the 41,798 motor vehicle crash deaths were attributable to alcohol use. Alcohol involvement is the single greatest factor in traffic-related deaths and injuries. In short, the trend is now moving in the wrong direction. We have not done enough. We must move to reverse this trend. 
I think what we have to do is to refocus and to put the emphasis back, again, and public debate, on this horrible, horrible problem. This year, Congress has the opportunity to help renew our Nation's focus on the evils of drinking and driving. During the Senate's consideration of ISTEA, we took the lead in helping our Nation refocus on the consequences of drinking and driving. 
Mr. President, there is no one single thing in the Senate's version of ISTEA reauthorization which will change attitudes by itself. Rather, the Senate did a number of things which, when taken together, will help renew our Nation's focus on this effort. 
First, the Senate voted to adopt an amendment which would encourage States to enact a statute that would make it illegal, in and of itself, to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher. This amendment was adopted by a 2-to-1 margin in this Senate Chamber. This was one of the few times I stated on the floor that day that Members of the Senate could come to the Senate floor and cast their vote and know that a `yes' vote would, in fact, clearly save lives. The individuals we will never know, but it is clear this legislation, if enacted into law, will save hundreds and ultimately thousands of lives over the next few years. Sixty-one of our colleagues chose to take advantage of that opportunity. 
Further, in the same bill, the Senate voted to adopt an amendment which would make it illegal to drive with one hand on the steering wheel and the other wrapped around a bottle of whiskey or beer. That is still legal in many places in this country. Under this legislation, it no longer would be tolerated. 
Finally, we included a provision which would establish mandatory minimum penalties for repeat drunk drivers--the worst of the worst of the worst. 
I can think of no better way to honor the memories of the victims of the deadliest alcohol-related traffic crash in our Nation's history, as well as the memories of all victims of drunk drivers, than to include these reasonable provisions aimed at renewing our Nation's focus on the tragedy resulting from drinking and driving in the final bill to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
This matter is in conference committee right now. The conferees are dealing with a number of very contentious and very difficult funding issues. We all have our own opinions about those issues. They are very contentious. But there is one issue where the overwhelming majority of the American people have spoken in public opinion poll after public opinion poll, and that has to do with the .08. There is one issue where the members of the conference committee can know that their vote to include the .08 provision will, in fact, save lives. 
Let me repeat, this Senate has spoken. Sixty-one of the Members of this Senate voted `yes' for a nationwide .08 standard. The House of Representatives did not have the opportunity to vote; they were blocked from voting on this measure. But I think anyone who has looked at this clearly understands that the House of Representatives also, if they had been permitted to vote on this, would have approved the .08. 
What we are asking the conference committee to do is very simple: Include this provision, which passed so overwhelmingly in the U.S. Senate, in the final version of ISTEA. If the members of the conference committee will do that, they will save lives. It has been estimated that between 500 to 1,000 lives in this country will be saved every year by going to a .08 standard. 
Mr. President, the statistics and facts are clear. The evidence is overwhelming. No one who tests .08 has any business being behind the wheel of a car. Think about it. If you were 
at a party at a neighbor's house or your own house, and you saw someone, an adult male weighing 160 to 165 pounds, and you watched him drink over an hour period of time--you timed it--four beers or four shots of liquor or four big glasses of wine on an empty stomach, then that person looked at you and said, `I want to take your little girl Anna to get an ice cream cone,' would you let your daughter get in the car with that person? We all know the answer. The answer is absolutely not--`Don't get near her; she can't go with you.' 
That is all we are saying. Mr. President, it takes that much alcohol consumption to reach .08. What we are saying is, we set a nationwide standard so that, no matter where we go in this country, we have some level of assurance that the laws of whatever State we are in--in my case, whether I drive out of Ohio into Kentucky or Indiana or Michigan or West Virginia, wherever I go, when I put my family in a car, I will have an assurance there is a national .08 standard, a bare minimum standard to protect our families. 
That is what we are asking for in the conference committee. I again urge the members of the conference committee to do what is right: Follow what the Senate has said, follow the vote in the Senate, and include this very reasonable measure. 
For my friends, my conservative friends, such as myself--we consider ourselves conservatives--I simply point out, this is the same type legislation that Ronald Reagan approved and supported and pushed through the U.S. Congress, when he was President of the United States, to go to a nationwide standard of 21 as being the age for drinking. It is the same mechanism, the same procedure, and the same basic principle. 
What Ronald Reagan said then, and I will paraphrase, is very simple: That in some areas of national importance, national concern, we can make small intrusions into States rights, small changes that will have monumental effects to save lives across the country, and in some areas we do need a national minimum standard. I urge the conferees to include this in the legislation. 
I see my friend, Senator Lautenberg, who has been a tremendous advocate over the years for highway safety, who sponsored the bill I just referenced that Ronald Reagan pushed through and Senator Lautenberg pushed through. Senator Lautenberg was the author of that bill in the 1980s. He and I were at the White House yesterday with the Vice President. We have been there with the President to support this. This is a bipartisan effort to save lives in this country. 
I yield to my colleague.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Act. This legislation will provide for the establishment of programs to research, display, interpret, and collect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad. 
Let me tell you how important the Underground Railroad is to Ohio--and to me personally. In the 20 years prior to the Civil War, more than 40,000 slaves escaped bondage and made their way to free soil on the trails of the Underground Railroad. More than 150 key Underground Railroad sites have been identified in Ohio--sites that symbolized freedom for thousands of enslaved Americans. 
When I visit these places, it gives me some real cause for hope about the future of America. When we talk about race relations in this country, we would do well to remind ourselves that at one of the darkest times in our nation's history--the period of slavery--some blacks and whites took immense personal risks to work together to liberate slaves. 
That is the part of the American story that we should be proud of--and build on. In Ohio, we are very proud of the part our ancestors played in this great story--and why I think this legislation is so important. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. It is very important to recognize this period in our history.

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss an important economic development matter for the people of Ohio. Currently included in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 is a technical correction that would attempt to resolve an apparent conflict that exists between consolidated return regulations and section 1059 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It is very important that this area of the tax code and regulations be clarified so that it does not create an impediment to the expansion of businesses in the State of Ohio and throughout the country. 
While the technical correction that was included in the IRS reform bill is a good start toward resolving this conflict of the consolidated return regulations and section 1059, further clarification is needed. I am hopeful that as the IRS reform bill proceeds to conference that the conferees will take another look at the technical correction and work toward correcting this conflict.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to speak on behalf of an amendment that Senator Collins and I have introduced to H.R. 2676, the IRS Reform bill. 
Our amendment is common-sense legislation that will repeal certain reporting requirements placed upon colleges and universities under Section 6050 S of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Here is the problem: Current law relating to the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit requires all colleges and universities to comply with burdensome and costly regulations. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contained a provision requiring colleges, universities and trade schools to begin issuing annual reports to students and the Internal Revenue Service detailing the students' tuition payments in case they apply for the new education tax credits. Preliminary analysis shows the reporting requirements will cost the 6,000 colleges in America more than $125 million to implement, and tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain. 
In realistic terms, if the new reporting requirement is not lifted off the backs of colleges and universities, those schools will be forced to raise tuition costs to cover the unfunded mandate. In effect, students and families will not benefit from the passage of the Hope Scholarship--because the money received from the tax credit will have to be used to pay the higher tuition. 
Mr. President, our amendment is simple, fair legislation that will greatly benefit any persons who want to obtain an education. 
In fact, similar legislation has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Donald Manzullo (R-IL). The House bill is supported by a bipartisan coalition comprised of 89 Members of the House. 
Senator Collins and I originally wanted 
to introduce the entire text of our legislation, S. 1724, as an amendment to the IRS Reform bill. Under current regulations, schools are required to report information to the IRS on 100 percent of their students, even though only a minority of students are expected to be eligible for the tax credit. S. 1724 would repeal this requirement. S. 1724 has been endorsed by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Community Colleges, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, the American Council on Education, and a bi-partisan group of 19 Senators. 
However, because of concerns which have been raised, we have modified our amendment. While this amendment does eliminate a regulatory burden placed on universities, it is only one part of what we want to accomplish. I want to assure everyone that is concerned about the increasing costs of higher education, that we will continue to fight to eliminate unnecessary costs. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support our amendment. It is common-sense, effective legislation. I also want to thank Senator Roth for his leadership on this issue and I appreciate his work with us on this amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me briefly state that the amendment offered by myself and Senator Collins fixes parts of the problem. It does not fix all of the problem. If we do not deal with the entire problem, this is something that every Member of the Senate is going to hear about. It is going to come back and you are going to hear about it from every college and university in your State. We need to fix the overall problem. 
I appreciate Chairman Roth's willingness to work with us on this. 
I urge adoption of this amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Jeffords for the work he has done on this bill. It is a real bipartisan bill, as we have pointed out many times on this floor; Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, myself. It is a bill that will truly change the status quo, a bill that will really make a difference. 
We will be voting on this bill in about half an hour. This legislation, S. 1186, will fundamentally reform our Nation's currently fragmented, duplicative and many times ineffective job training programs. I believe this bill will transform them into a coordinated, accountable, and flexible workforce investment system. 
Before the Senate votes, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the reasons why the Workforce Investment Partnership Act does enjoy such bipartisan support. One of the most historic, if not the most historic accomplishments of the 105th Congress was the legislation that revolutionized the American welfare system. In passing a bill to end welfare as we knew it, we were empowering the States and local communities to seek a better way to make work, not welfare, the way of life for millions of disadvantaged Americans. 
The bill we are considering this evening, S. 1186, is a very important extension of that basic welfare reform, continuing the devolution of Federal power to where it rightfully belongs--States, localities--and most importantly, the individuals who are voluntarily seeking training assistance. 
This bill, S. 1186, recognizes the leadership of States and localities which have show innovation and initiative over the last few years, even in the midst of many times onerous Federal barriers and obstacles. By eradicating outdated rules and regulations, we can remove the barriers that have stymied people in the past. We can empower States and local communities by giving them the tools, the tools and the flexibility that they need to implement real reform, reform that will allow them to provide truly comprehensive training services. 
This bill, S. 1186, also promotes free market competition. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act establishes an effective and accountable workforce development system, ensuring that training leads to meaningful, long-term employment. 
Under this bill, training services will be held accountable to high standards. This means they will have to prove training leads ultimately to meaningful, unsubsidized employment, showing how many people were placed, at what cost, and how many people remained employed 6 months, a year or 18 months later. That is true accountability. That is the true measure of whether job training works or does not work. Does the person have a job 6 months or 12 months later, and what kind of a job is it.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. Let me again thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, for the great work he has done on this bill, as well as Senator Wellstone and Senator Kennedy. 
I also thank the staff who worked on this bill. They spent a tremendous amount of time. It was a great effort. 
Mr. President, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act represents our commitment to the American people to recreate. 
Through State and especially local partnerships with business and industry, the nation's job training system will be able to identify the jobs that exist and the skills needed to fill them. 
Through consolidation and reform we establish a truly comprehensive workforce development system that brings together nearly 70 categorical programs and redefines the federal Job Corps program. 
By adding The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, we reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act, link the vocational rehabilitation system to States' workforce development systems and increase and simplify access for individuals with disabilities to job training services. 
Mr. President, this legislation is a milestone, and will no doubt prove to be one of our country's economy's greatest assets. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Wellstone, Frist, Collins, Harkin, and Dodd as well as the individual members of their staffs who have worked many long hours to make this bill possible: Patricia Morrissey, Sherry Kaiman, Jeff Teitz, Connie Garner, Brian Alhberg, Dave Larsen, Katie Braden, Julian Haynes, Sharon Masling, Jim Fenton, Jenny Saunders, Chas Phillips, Rick Murphy, Robin Bowen, Chad Calvert, Angie Stewart, a special thanks to Ann Lordeman and Rick Apling, from the Congressional Research Service and Liz Aldrige and Mark Sigurski, and finally my own staff--Dwayne Sattler, Aaron Grau, and Yolanda Rogers for their tireless efforts. 
I am confident that this bill will provide needed change and opportunities for the millions of Americans, both employers and job seekers, who need this improved job training system to help make our country more prosperous and more prepared for the next century. And I look forward to working with my friends in the House of Representatives in conference.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for holding this session where we have a chance to talk about the problems connected with the IRS. He has been a true leader in this issue. 
This is a matter of great importance and interest to the taxpayers across this country. Mr. President, it is becoming clearer every day that we simply have to reform the IRS. The facts of IRS abuse are, by now, well known. As the hearings continue, we get more information every single day. The essential facts are very disturbing. 
In 1996, the IRS answered only 20 percent of its phone calls. 
An IRS report released in January of this year showed that one out of every four IRS revenue officers and supervisors felt pressured to achieve enforcement goals. Tax collection statistics were used to evaluate the performance of employees--and the district offices were ranked on how much taxes they collected--collected from us. 
In 1993, the IRS gave incorrect information to taxpayers a stunning 8.5 million times. In 1987, the GAO said that 47% of the calls to the IRS resulted in incorrect information. 
A recent survey actually found that one out of two Americans would rather be mugged than audited.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first again just congratulate my colleague from Georgia on a great statement and echo what he has been saying this morning. He is the true leader in drawing the Senate's attention and public attention to the need for true reform in the IRS. 
The stories that he referenced, that I was talking about earlier today, that we have heard about in Toledo, superficially, may sound funny, but as he pointed out when he and I were talking about it, they are not funny, they are tragedies. They are real human tragedies. 
It is just hard to believe that the IRS has gone on for so long in this country unchecked. And I say to Senator Coverdell, if these are any demonstration of the need for congressional oversight, if there ever was an example of what hearings will really accomplish, it is the hearings that Chairman Roth held several months ago starting off with, when we saw the acting head of the IRS come in to that hearing and in 5 minutes, the first 5 minutes of testimony, he changed more IRS policy than has been changed in the last decade. That was a result of oversight hearings. 
Frankly, this Congress needs to do more of that, not just in regard to the IRS but in regard to all Federal agencies. It is part of our charge. It is part of our responsibility. It is what we ought to do. So I just again commend my friend and colleague from Georgia for taking the time this morning to talk about an issue that really affects the American people and that the American people are really interested in. We spend a lot of time on this floor talking about things that are important, but I am not sure the average American really thinks it affects their lives. Let me tell you, the IRS affects people's lives, virtually everybody in this country. 
So I salute and congratulate my colleague from Georgia.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to introduce, along with my good friend Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act. 
This bill is designed to protect the millions of Americans who use medical inhalers for diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. This Asthma Inhaler Protection Act is needed to make sure that the Food and Drug Administration is extremely--extremely--careful in how it phases out the use of asthma inhalers that contain chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. 
This bill that Senator Hutchinson and I are introducing today makes sure that as FDA phases out the use of inhalers with CFCs, adequate replacements are available that meet all patients' needs. That is the key. 
Mr. President, there are 15 million Americans who have asthma, almost all of whom regularly use asthma inhalers such as this one, 15 million Americans who have asthma, many of whom use inhalers just like the one I took out of my pocket. They use these inhalers to help them control their disease. Without having access to a drug that meets his or her specific needs, each of these Americans would be adding much greater risk of having an asthma attack or, if they have an asthma attack, not being able to control it short of going to the emergency room in a hospital, 
which is where many people had to go before they had access to these inhalers. 
I had the personal experience with our daughter Becky a number of years ago when she was small and she had asthma. The doctor finally, after we had been to the emergency room time after time, said I think she needs to use these new inhalers that are on the market, even though they had not been prescribed for children at that time. He said go ahead and use it. So Becky started using these and it made her life a lot easier, certainly the life of her parents, as well. 
Without access to a drug that meets these specific needs, each of these asthma sufferers would be in greater danger. Without an appropriate medication, they also would have a much worse chance of stopping an asthma attack once it has begun. 
What is the problem? The problem is almost all asthma inhalers currently on the market contain CFCs. Almost every single one of them changes this. Under international agreement, this country has agreed to the goal of eventually eliminating all uses--all uses--of CFCs. 
What this means for asthma patients is that over a period of many years new inhalers that don't use CFCs will be brought to the market, and use of the old inhalers that contain CFCs will be phased out. But as we do this, as we comply with this international agreement--and this, of course, is something that was agreed to because of the concern for the environment, and I understand that--I think as we do this we must make sure this transition process is done very, very carefully and that we do it with the utmost attention to those individuals whose quality of life may depend on the use of these inhalers. 
We must be absolutely sure that if and when we take an inhaler that contains CFCs off the market there are adequate replacements that meet the needs of each and every person that currently uses the old-time inhaler. My one and only goal when it comes to this transition is to make sure that all people, all people who rely on these drugs, continue to have access to inhalers that have been proven, already proven to meet their needs. All other issues are secondary to making sure that these patients are, in fact, protected. 
In March of 1997 the FDA released its first proposal on how to go about this transition. Now, simply put, the FDA's initial response does not meet the goal of fully protecting asthma patients. The medical and patient communities have been unanimous in expressing concern that the FDA's proposal, when it goes into effect, could take existing medications away from patients without adequate replacements being at that time available. The bottom line is that the FDA's proposal could and will put patients at risk. 
What do we do about it? Where do we go from here? I understand that many people believe the FDA has seen the light. Some people tell me they plan to correct the problems in their initial proposal during the next step of the process, the next step of the process being the proposed rule. Now, I would like to believe that this will happen, but I am not sure it will. 
It is now over a year since the FDA released its earlier proposal, but despite all the public criticism which has ensued there has never been a single public statement by that agency that it intends to change the policy to address these very legitimate medical concerns. That is why I feel congressional action is necessary. 
That is why Senator Hutchinson and I are introducing this 
bill today. We need to be sure that the FDA, as it pursues this transition, writes its policy so that all patients are protected. Because of this, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation, S. 1299, a bill that Senator Hutchinson introduced last year. Let me say that Senator Hutchinson has been someone who has taken the lead in this crusade. 
That bill lets the FDA know in the clearest of terms that its initial proposal was unacceptable and that bill further gives the FDA guidance on how it should proceed with the rules for this transition. 
Let me again congratulate my colleague from Arkansas for his leadership on this issue and for the introduction of his work on that bill. Since last year, Mr. President, I have continued to work on this issue. I have had my staff explore various options and various proposals. We have identified several additional ideas I believe are important to make sure that patients are protected and that should be included in any legislation on the phaseout of CFC inhalers. 
Recently, I have worked with Senator Hutchinson to develop these thoughts into this piece of legislation that we are introducing today, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act. Our bill does these things: First, it makes sure that the FDA, before it takes the next step of publishing a proposed rule, has looked at several issues that are necessary for the agency to make informed choices in this area. Second, our bill gives the FDA the broad outline of what the transition policy should look like so that all patients' needs are protected. Finally, our bill will help save FDA resources by telling the agency to not review any new drug applications for products that contain CFCs unless the new product represents a significant new medical advance. 
I want to make clear that this bill is not necessarily a finished product. We are open to additional ideas and suggestions. We will consider any additional thoughts and ideas on how to improve the bill to make sure that people who use asthma inhalers are truly protected. 
I hope my colleagues and anyone interested in the safety of Americans with asthma could look at this bill and consider supporting it. I believe this bill is crucial to get FDA back on the right course. It is absolutely necessary so that no asthma patients are ever put in a situation where they can't get the best inhalers that fit their very specific medical needs. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, which I believe is a matter of good common sense, and a bill that will help protect the asthma sufferers of this country.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we begin debate this morning on an important piece of legislation, which we have all been working on for the last few years--legislation that I believe is vitally important to the economic future of our country. As Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have so eloquently pointed out, this is a bipartisan bill. It is a bipartisan bill that will truly make a difference. 
Let me thank the full committee chairman, Senator Jeffords, the ranking minority member of the committee, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Wellstone, who is the ranking member of our subcommittee. I also thank all the members of the Labor Committee who unanimously approved and voted in favor of this legislation--Senators Coats, Gregg, Frist, Enzi, Hutchinson, Collins, Warner, McConnell, Dodd, Harkin, Mikulski, Bingaman, Murray, and Reed of Rhode Island--a truly bipartisan bill, in a committee that, as my chairman has pointed out so very well, has a great divergence of philosophical backgrounds and beliefs. We all came together because we new this bill would make a difference. We knew the status quo was simply not acceptable. 
Mr. President, S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, which we are considering this morning, will bring much-needed and overdue reform to our job training system. Mr. President, as chairman of the employment and training subcommittee, I have come to this Senate floor on numerous occasions to stress the immediate need to reform the Federal job training system. This need increases each day that Congress does not act. The status quo is simply not acceptable. 
In writing this bill, our subcommittee held a number of important oversight hearings on this issue over the last 3 years. Let me just pause for a moment to say how much I have enjoyed working with the ranking minority member of that committee, Senator Wellstone, as we have held these hearings and worked on this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, at 2 hearings in Washington, DC, we heard from officials from Los Angeles, from the State of Oregon, from Hennepin County, Minnesota. We heard from business groups, such as the Cleveland Growth Association. 
At a hearing in Cleveland, Ohio, we heard from concerned groups like the Akron Regional Development Board, the Lorain County Workforce Institute, the Lake County Employment and Training Administration, Cuyahoga County Community College, and Cleveland State University. 
What we heard, Mr. President, is that today's system is a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly focused job training and job training-related programs, administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack coordination, lack a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, and lack the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize these services--namely, those seeking the training, and those businesses seeking to hire these individuals. 
Mr. President, probably one of the most historic accomplishments of the 104th Congress was our legislation that transformed the American welfare system. In passing a bill to end welfare as we knew it, we were empowering the States, empowering the local communities, and private businesses to seek 
a better way--to replace welfare with opportunity. 
Mr. President, what the Senate is considering this morning is a bipartisan bill that would provide States and localities with another tool--a very important tool--to make work, not welfare, the way of life for millions of our fellow citizens. People on welfare need to know they have a real future, a bright future, a future based on opportunity and economic advancement for themselves and their families. They need to know that when they leave the welfare rolls, there is a job out there--a job for them. 
Mr. President, this is one major reason that our bipartisan job training legislation is so important. This really was the unfinished business of the last Congress. This really is the unfinished business of welfare reform. This bill--the Workforce Investment Partnership Act--that we are considering this morning, which again I point out passed unanimously out of the Labor Committee--would help States and local communities succeed in this crucial task of making welfare reform truly work. It would help make work, not welfare, a reality in the lives of America's disadvantaged workers. 
Mr. President, to achieve this goal, individuals need to be provided the opportunity to receive the education and skills and training necessary to obtain meaningful, long-term employment. However, tragically, the current job training programs have been unable to provide quality service on a consistent enough basis. 
Employers at every level are finding it increasingly difficult to locate and attract qualified employees for high-skilled, high paying, good jobs, as well as finding it difficult to attract qualified employees for level-entry positions. 
Let me provide my colleagues with a couple of examples. In northern Virginia, not far from here, 19,000 high-tech, high-paying jobs remain unfilled because individuals lack the basic skills to fill them. 
My home State of Ohio faces a similar predicament, as I am sure the Chair's home State of Georgia does as well. A Cleveland Growth Association survey recently showed that employers are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality and availability of the skilled labor which may ultimately impede their future growth plans. 
Nationwide, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs is estimated to be at about 350,000. The increasing labor shortage threatens our Nation's economic growth and our productivity and our ability to compete in the world. This, in turn, also threatens our historic welfare reform. 
Mr. President, it is clear that we must act immediately. S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, must pass the U.S. Senate and become law so that individuals may have the opportunity to increase their skills and to obtain meaningful, long-term employment. 
As a Member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I have spent the last few years examining our Federal job training programs. What we all have found is alarming. During our examination of these programs, it has become clear to all of us that these programs are in dire need of reform. As a result, Mr. President, the business community is frustrated because the current programs fail to meet their employment needs. 
States, localities and community activists are frustrated because the programs are many times confusing and duplicative. Individuals seeking assistance are frustrated because the system is so confusing they often don't even know where to begin, where to start. 
We need to reform the current job training programs. We need to provide States with the tools necessary to develop their own comprehensive system that works for workers and works for the States. 
Our bill, S. 1186, provides States and localities with the tools and the flexibility to implement real reform. It is the only way they will be able to provide comprehensive services to those individuals who are seeking training and education assistance. 
Our bill provides States and localities with the framework to establish a truly comprehensive workforce development system. 
The bill brings together nearly 70 categorical programs--including adult education, vocational education, training, welfare to work, the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Older Americans Act, the Rehabilitation Act, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and other job training programs. 
All in all Mr. President, nearly 70 categorical programs. 
Further, this bill that the Senate is considering this morning offers a reborn Federal Job Corps program--the oldest program of over 30 years, and the most expensive in the Federal system. We make this system anew, and we link it to local communities really for the first time in its over 30-year history. 
Further, our bill provides States with the option to submit a `Unified Plan' or a single State plan for the numerous education and training programs incorporated into the bill. 
And it establishes a `no wrong door' approach to training and education assistance. Under today's system, people have difficulty knowing where to begin to look for training assistance--because there are no clear points of entry and no clear paths from one program to another. Our bill makes sure that whatever `door' people go through--whatever agency they approach--they will receive comprehensive information about all the programs available to them. They will learn about the availability, eligibility, and quality of the programs through a `one-stop customer service system.' 
The bill also gives States and localities the flexibility they need to design their own workforce development systems. 
It authorizes and expands a modified `Work-Flex' program for all States, flexibility that is currently limited to only six demonstration States. 
Under `Work-Flex,' in our bill, the States have the authority to approve requests for waivers of statutory and regulatory provisions submitted by their local workforce areas. 
The bill allows States to consolidate the 15 percent `State Reserve' funds from each funding stream--adults, dislocated workers, and youth--in order to target their own State's priorities. 
Our bill provides Governors and local elected officials with the ability to designate local service areas, increasing the population threshold to 500,000. 
It increases the States' authority over the development of State performance measures--giving Governors the authority to set additional core measures of performance, and negotiate the expected levels of performance--more accountability. 
And finally, Mr. President, our bill eliminates numerous Federal requirements and mandatory set-asides. This is a very important measure giving States the flexibility, authority, and funding to design their systems.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise at this point today to discuss the pending amendment, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. 
This is bipartisan legislation, which I am presenting as an amendment, has the strong support for the work that has been done by our chairman, Senator Jeffords. It has the support of the work that has been done by the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and also the distinguished ranking member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator Wellstone. The work product also has the support of our distinguished colleagues, Senators Harkin, Frist, Collins, Reed, Chafee, and Bingaman. 
Mr. President, this amendment is the result of open and extensive negotiations that have earned it widespread and deep support both here in Washington, but more importantly at the State and local community level. 
The rehabilitation act I have submitted as an amendment is the country's only Federally funded program that provides job training and job placement services to individuals with disabilities. I believe the reauthorization of this Act gives us a perfect opportunity to build on and develop the positive changes that were made when it was last reauthorized, in 1992. 
The Subcommittee on Employment and Training began the reauthorization process last year by holding two hearings: the first in Washington, and the second in Columbus, OH. the Subcommittee listened carefully to the suggestions of vocational rehabilitation clients and their counselors, to administrators, and to service providers. 
We found many opportunities to build on the positive changes Congress made in 1992. I would like now to discuss some of the most important improvements we believe we have made to the 1992 Act. 
First of all, the amendment would link the Rehabilitation Act to the underlying job training reform bill that is before the Senate this morning. One of the problems we heard over and over again in our hearings was one we have already tried to address in the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. The fact is, there is a large disconnect between the vocational rehabilitation system and the rest of the country's job training systems. Too many disabled individuals are not receiving the basic job training information they need because they fall through the gap between the two job training systems. For example, a disabled individual may not meet the current legal definition of `disabled' and thus not qualify for services from their State's vocational rehabilitation system, yet that same individual could be turned away from his or her State's generic job training system because that person is seen as being disabled. They literally fall between the two systems, not technically qualifying for either one. We need to change that, and this amendment does that. 
Therefore, the most important change we undertake is to link the vocational rehabilitation system to the states' new workforce systems under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. No one should underestimate the importance of cooperation and mutual awareness between the two systems, and the strong statutory links that are necessary to ensure such cooperation. However, let me make it very clear, as Senators Kennedy and Jeffords have point out: Under no circumstances will the vocational rehabilitation system's integrity be compromised. That is the last thing we intend to do. Its funding will not be redirected to other populations. 
Our goal is clear. It is to improve vocational rehabilitation, not deplete its resources. 
Once these programs are joined, state vocational rehabilitation agencies will provide more people with either the basic information they need to begin their road to employment, or a referral to the state's new job training system. What makes this 
referral so much better than the current system is that employees in the state's new job training program will now be trained specifically to address the unique employment needs of disabled individuals. 
This simple solution will be achieved by the cooperative agreements and contracts required by this bill--between state workforce systems and state vocational rehabilitation systems. It will result in providing more disabled individuals with better jobs. 
These agreements or contracts may include the following: Arrangements for interagency staff training; arrangements for electronic sharing of labor market information and information on job vacancies; arrangements to use common intake procedures, forms, and referral procedures; and agreements to share client databases. 
However, let me be clear again. Vocational rehabilitation agencies will not be required to spend any of their federal allotment on activities other than those that help provide jobs for disabled individuals. 
This legislation also streamlines the vocational rehabilitation system, and allows state vocational rehabilitation agencies to save millions of dollars. They will now be able to use these dollars for job training and referral services instead of administration. 
For example, current law's so-called `strategic plan,' which really was duplicative, is eliminated. In Ohio, this means a savings of close to $3 million--and other states can expect the same kind of savings. 
Our bill also simplifies eligibility procedures--a common complaint we heard as we held hearings. For example, a person who qualifies for benefits or assistance under another program, such as Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, under our bill may use that qualification instead of having to go through a whole new process to receive vocational rehabilitation services. State agencies no longer will have to redo lengthy administrative procedures to determine a person's eligibility when they know that person clearly qualifies. This, too, will save valuable resources. 
Based on the information we gathered at our hearings and the suggestions we heard 
from the people who deal with vocational rehabilitation programs on a daily basis, we will reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act for 7 years. A longer period will allow states the opportunity to properly and effectively implement these positive changes and needed improvements. 
The witnesses who testified at our Washington hearing described their serious concerns about vocational rehabilitation clients' `independence,' their lack of opportunity for `self-assertion,' and they strongly emphasized that clients should have meaningful roles in developing their own `Individualized Rehabilitation Employment Plans.' 
We believe we have in this legislation taken care of these concerns. 
Empowered clients, who will always have the opportunity of working as a team with a VR counselor, may now exercise more consumer choice as to what employment goals they want to reach and how they want to reach them. 
Finally, one of the most positive changes our bill makes is to emphasize the value of self-employment. If a vocational rehabilitation client wants to be self-employed, there is no reason why he or she should not receive the training and assistance they need to reach their employment goal. 
At our Columbus hearing, I was surprised to learn that under current law, self employment is hardly, if ever, promoted. It is discouraged many times. Now, clients, together with their vocational rehabilitation counselors, have more flexibility and can develop plans to achieve self-employment. 
Mr. President, let me conclude my comments about this amendment by thanking once again the Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords; the Ranking Member of the Committee, Senator Kennedy; the Ranking Member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator Wellstone, Senator Collins, Senator Chafee, Senator Bingaman, and my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for all the work they and their staffs put into this process. I would also like to thank my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, and his staff for their contribution not only in the 105th Congress, but also for his contributions to developing links to our previous workforce bill in the 104th Congress. 
This bill streamlines the vocational rehabilitation system's administration allowing millions of dollars to go to job training services. This bill improves the lives of individuals with disabilities and provides opportunities for more jobs and better jobs. It creates a more user-friendly, consumer-driven program--and promotes the creation of a seamless job training program that will be able to serve more people more efficiently. 
Mr. President, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this amendment. At this time I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will be brief but I would like to rise at this point to speak in strong support of the amendment of Senator Ashcroft to S. 1186. This amendment prohibits the use of funds to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994. 
Let me state it was never--I repeat never--my intention to include funds for School-to-Work activities in S. 1186. The bill we are currently debating, I believe, reflects this intent. In fact, section 316(d)(2) of the bill clearly states: 
Funds . . . shall not be used to carry out activities that duplicate federally funded activities available to youth. 
This provision prohibits States and localities from using S. 1186 funding in any way to expand School-to-Work. The Ashcroft amendment--let me state I thank my friend and colleague from Missouri for this contribution to the bill--will simply clarify this language. It will clarify it by adding, quoting from Senator Ashcroft's amendment: 
None of the funds made available under this Act may be used to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994. 
This amendment is simple and it is straightforward. The Ashcroft amendment emphasizes, I believe, what the bill already clearly states. There has been opposition to S. 1186, driven by, I believe, a lack of understanding of this piece of legislation and a fear that our schools are going to be turned into training facilities that force children into career tracks. This is simply not true. This is the last thing--let me repeat, as I have stated on the floor before--this is the last thing this U.S. Senator would seek to do. This is the last thing this Member of the Senate would ever propose, would ever push, would ever write or, frankly, would ever even vote for.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss and explain that portion of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act that deals with States' `Service Delivery Areas.' 
As I have stated before, the current system of Federal job training programs is no system at all. Consumers, individuals seeking assistance, and businesses seeking to hire them face a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly focused programs that lack coordination, a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, and the confidence of the consumers who need to use the services. 
These problems are the result of numerous shortcomings that have developed over time and become part of a dated and neglected job training system that no longer considers the needs or resources of the States and localities it serves. 
One of the current system's largest shortcomings is its ineffective designation of over 600 Service Delivery Areas. These 600 plus regions are a tremendous burden on the country's job training system and one of the greatest contributors to `a complex patchwork of overlapping bureaucratic responsibilities.' 
Over the past 15 years, it has been the Federal government deciding where these Service Delivery Areas would be. 
Over the past 15 years, the Federal government used a general federal mandate and chose the number `200,000' to represent what it thought the appropriate population of Service Delivery Areas should be. 
Over the past 15 years, the Federal government's Service Delivery Area criteria remained stagnant while States continued to grow and change. 
The number 200,000 no longer adequately reflects the needs or resources of each and every State. It does not allow States to take their economic development or empowerment zones into account. It does not flex to reflect the ever-changing populations of cities and counties. In many urban areas it fragments a much larger labor market making coordination among State and local employment agencies difficult if not impossible. 
The `Washington-knows-best' `one-size-fits-all' approach no longer works and we have the past 15 years to prove it. 
To fix this problem--to clear out this bureaucracy--and to create a cleaner more accountable and more efficient job training system, we must do away with the paternalistic Washington mentality, return the Service Delivery Area designation decisions to the States and localities, and ultimately lower the number of Service Delivery Areas. 
To do this, the bill outlines four criteria to be followed in selecting the State's Service Delivery Areas: 
The States and their localities must ensure that there is a link between participants in workforce investment activities and local employment opportunities; 
The States and their localities must ensure that a significant number of people who live in the proposed area also work in the area; 
The States and their localities must ensure that neighboring Service Delivery Areas cooperate with each other and coordinate their activities; and finally 
The States and their localities must ensure that the State economic development areas are taken into consideration. 
Currently, it is the Federal Government that decides what regions will become Service Delivery Areas and what regions will not. 
Under this new law, this cleaner, more accountable, and more effective system, it is the States and local communities that will make these decisions; it is the States and local communities that will have a true understanding of how to best apply these four new criteria; and it will be the States and local communities that determine how their job training dollars will best be used. 
Mr. President, we can no longer afford the `Washington knows best' mentality. That is the thinking that created the current maze and bureaucratic patchwork of job training programs. That is the thinking that brings us here today--needing to change the system and fix its problems. We must put the decisions, such as Service Delivery Area designation, in the hands of those who are closest to their needs and resources. 
This bill, and the positive changes it makes to the way Service Delivery Areas are currently designated, will help eliminate the `Washington one-size-fits-all mentality' and allow States, their Governors, their cities, and their municipalities--through a consensus process--to change the status quo and develop a more effective and locally controlled job training system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, Senator Wellstone, concerning the initiatives covered by section 367 of the bill. Mr. President, I strongly feel that clarifying the intent of this section will be helpful in my efforts to ensure that a very worthwhile initiative in Northeastern, Ohio receives favorable consideration by the Department of Labor. 
As I understand it, section 367 authorizes the Secretary of Labor to carry out demonstration projects to develop new techniques, different approaches, and specialized methods to address communities; employment and training needs. This section also requires the community or entity to substantially contribute to their project's funding, have expertise in undertaking national demonstration projects, or have expertise in overseeing employment and training programs. 
The Ohio initiative I referred to establishes an Engineering and Training Center which will provide employers, employees, students, and the underemployed access to job training services and course work germane the region's existing manufacturing base as well as its fledgling information technology industries. For example, the Center would provide welders, who recently lost their jobs when Ford Motor Company closed its Thunderbird and Econoline plants, computer software instruction for new computer controlled welding equipment. The Engineering and Training Center would also contain working laboratories where employees would receive custom training on the latest technology equipment. 
Would the Senator agree that the establishment of such an Engineering and Training Center, whose principal focus is to provide job training to workers in a community suffering from the closure of auto and steel plants, is the type of activity section 367 encourages? And would the willingness of local foundations to provide half the cost of such an initiative satisfy the bill's substantial funding equipment?

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. It is the right thing to do, right now. 
Fifty years ago, President Harry Truman perceived the very real threat to our national interest posed by the rise of Soviet Communism in liberated Western Europe. He understood that although turning a blind, isolationist's eye to trans-Atlantic affairs may have seemed attractive in the short term, it could prove far more dangerous and costly to American interests in the long term. Therefore, it was absolutely in our national interest to promote and defend abroad our values of democracy and opportunity against an aggressive and oppressive Soviet regime. To that end, we fashioned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--a collective security agreement with fifteen of our allies. With NATO, insuring that Western Europe's democracies flourish--and that its economies grow--became a top U.S. priority, and rightly so. 
Fifty years later, the results are impressive and worth examining. By instituting collective security among its member nations, NATO achieved collective stability. This stability allowed Western Europe to enjoy one of its longest periods of sustained peace and economic development ever. It has recovered remarkably from the scourge of two World Wars, and free markets have thrived inside of democratic institutions. NATO not only deterred the Soviets from aggression, but so strong is our alliance that since its inception no NATO country has ever been attacked. Of course, this success has not been achieved without sacrifice or without cost. However, the price of peace is a mere fraction of the cost of war. 
Clearly, the mission of NATO needs to be adapted to the post-Cold War world. The threat is no longer the clearly defined ominous shadow of Communism; but the threat of instability is just as real. The Cold War has ended, and the Warsaw Treaty Organization has been dismantled, but now is not the time for passive complacency. Just as the war-torn countries of Western Europe did fifty years ago, the emerging democracies and economies of today's Eastern Europe need NATO security to rebuild and to thrive. And now, like then, it is in the national interest of the United States that this occur. 
Expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will sustain current and future economic reforms. It will promote cooperation and peace among neighbors. NATO's presence also will fill a dangerous military and political vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe, and further cement European security by uniting East with West. 
As well as increasing global security, NATO expansion will have tangible economic benefits. Free but untapped markets in this part of the world hold tremendous economic potential for U.S. exporters. And 
undoubtedly, the prestige, the security, and the validation that comes with NATO membership will have a profoundly positive psychological impact on the minds of foreign investors. 
Throughout this process it was important that the invited nations demonstrate that they are willing to make the sincere commitment required of NATO members, and it seems to me that they have. Politically, economically, and diplomatically, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland show great promise that they will become strong partners in our alliance. 
Poland, for example, has just witnessed its second democratic change of government since 1989 as a result of fully free and fair elections. Its new democratic constitution was approved last year by national referendum. Economically speaking, Poland is sound. Its economy has been one of the fastest-growing in Europe since 1993, and the private sector now accounts for two-thirds of its gross domestic product. Poland has also codified civilian control and parliamentary oversight of its military. On the diplomatic front, Poland has resolved outstanding differences with its neighbors, including Ukraine, with whom it recently signed a declaration of reconciliation. These diplomatic efforts would not have been possible but for the promise of NATO expansion. 
After forty years of dictatorship, democracy now reigns in Hungary. All six of its parliamentary parties support entry into NATO. The Hungarian government upholds human rights, freedom of expression, rule of law, and an independent judiciary, and it too has twice held free elections since the fall of Communism. While attracting almost $16 billion of direct foreign investment, Hungary has engaged in a strict stabilization program and cut its budget deficits substantially. And on the diplomatic front, Hungary has recently signed treaties with Romania and Slovakia, thus ending territorial disputes that had existed for generations. And the government has agreements with its neighbors, including Ukraine, to cooperate against organized crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking. 
The story is much the same in the Czech Republic, which has a constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press. Two national elections were held in 1996 for the legislature, and they were free and fair. Since 1989, the Czech Republic has engaged in tight fiscal policy, liberal trade practices, and privatization of state enterprises. As a result, unemployment is low and inflation is controlled. It maintains strong relations with its neighbors, especially Germany--its leading foreign investor--and with Poland, as the two countries have harmonized their approaches to European Union and NATO membership. 
I would now like to make some comments about some of the amendments we have voted on. 
First, I want to say that I opposed the amendment which would have linked admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to admission to the European Union. 
While NATO and the EU have overlapping membership, they have different missions. NATO is a collective defense organization designed to protect and defend the territory of its member states. The EU is not a military but an economic alliance of European states which does not include the United States. It also does not include Canada, Iceland, Norway--which by the way rejected EU membership--nor does it include Turkey. 
The question I have is why would we want to allow an organization of which the US is not a member, to dictate our security interests? Another concern I have about this amendment is that it would ultimately--and unnecessarily--delay NATO enlargement, since Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are not members and have only recently been invited to begin the process of joining. 
Second, I opposed the amendment which would have mandated a three year pause on new members. Article 10 of the NATO charter provides a mechanism to enlarge the alliance. This article has successfully worked for 50 years in bringing new member states into NATO. I strongly feel that this amendment would not have helped NATO, but rather have added an additional and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the process. 
The amendment also would have dampened the spirits of other countries who eagerly want to join NATO. Many of these countries have made significant sacrifices--both political and economic--to prepare themselves for future NATO membership. Enacting this amendment would have reduced the incentives of these countries to continue these important reforms. I would like to point out, however, that there is no commitment at this time to invite other nations to join NATO. 
Let me conclude. Through democratic and economic reforms, these three nations have invested in long-term stability. NATO membership promotes confidence in this regional stability, thus making it even stronger. 
If this century has taught us anything, it is that European instability ultimately becomes our problem. By admitting these committed and deserving nations to NATO, we will strengthen our alliance and expand the dividends of peace and prosperity to a level unprecedented in modern history. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. 
More than 20 years of experience working in the criminal justice system have taught me that information is absolutely crucial to successful law enforcement. As a prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio; as Lieutenant Governor overseeing Ohio's anti-crime and anti-drug efforts; and later as a member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, I have seen first-hand the importance of information and record-keeping to criminal justice. 
Our state and local law enforcement organizations--as well as our courts--need to develop and upgrade their criminal information and identification systems. The Federal Government has already invested billions of dollars in information and identification systems whose benefits will go largely unrealized--unless states receive the resources to be able to participate in these systems. Our national data bases are only as good as the information in which the states provide by their participation. 
Unfortunately, there is still a wide disparity between the criminal identification systems that are available--and the ability of state and local law enforcement to develop and use them. For example, while computer technology exists that allows law enforcement to match fingerprints electronically with criminal history databases, most states lack the equipment and resources necessary to connect on any broad scale with the databases operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
Too many States lack the resources to contribute state criminal histories to the FBI criminal history database in a timely manner or in a computer-ready format, and have inadequate equipment to retrieve information from the database quickly or on a widespread geographic basis. 
While we may disagree about the Brady Act, it funded the National Criminal History Improvement Program (N-CHIP), administered by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which has successfully helped states prepare to perform background checks. Unfortunately, N-CHIP expires this year--but not all states are fully operational. 
In addition, the FBI, the National Criminal Center (NCIC) 2000, and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System will be fully operational--and ready for states to participate--soon. 
Also, DNA casework testing has more than doubled in the last three years because of demand by law enforcement to provide DNA analysis in violent crime cases. In 48 states convicted offender DNA analysis is mandated by statute. Further, advances in the use of DNA to solve crimes based on automated searches of State and National CODIS DNA profile databases are producing DNA matches, generating even more demand for rapid testing of convicted felon DNA samples for 
database input. The demand for casework results and the need for convicted offender database analysis continues to grow at a rate that outstrips the capacities and capabilities of state and local crime laboratories. 
We need to make sure the states are able to make the fullest possible use of this breathtaking technology. 
That's the idea behind the bill I am introducing today. It would provide $250 million in each of the next five years for grants to the states. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is directed to make grants to each state to be used in conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to develop, update, or upgrade technologies, including the following: 
Centralized, automated criminal history record information systems, including arrest and disposition reporting. 
Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize fingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible with systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index (III). 
Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility determinations. 
Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and communicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, prosecution, and corrections. 
Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting of dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI, and to promote the integration of court systems with other criminal justice information systems. 
Ballistics identification programs that are compatible --and integrated--with the National Integrated Ballistics Network (NIBN). 
Information, identification and communications programs for forensic purposes, including for crime laboratory accreditation. 
DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes. 
Sexual offender identification and registration systems. 
Domestic violence offender identification and information systems. 
Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide statistical and research products including incident-based reporting systems and uniform crime reports. 
Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and programs. 
Mr. President, all these proposals have one thing on common: they are based on the principle that technology is the future of police work. It is the number one edge our law enforcement officers are going to have in the struggle against criminals, well into the 21st century. In this sense, crime-fighting is a lot like baseball. It's a game of percentages--and everything we can do to boost the average helps the team. 
We can continue to pursue increasingly sophisticated criminals with outmoded twentieth century technology--or we can substantially boost our team's average by providing states the Federal assistance required to effectively participate in these programs. If we are serious about reducing crime in America, the Federal Government has to step up to the plate on this key issue of promoting state and local use of available crime-fighting technology.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we observe, this month, National Child Abuse Prevention Month. On this occasion, I would like to give the Senate an update about the fate of a little girl about whom I testified previously before the Senate Finance Committee. 
In my testimony on October 8, 1997, I told the story of a little 2-year-old girl from Ventura County, CA, a little girl by the name of Joselin Hernandez. This poor little girl was beaten, bitten and slowly tortured to death by her parents. She first was taken into foster care when she was 6 weeks old, hospitalized with six fractured ribs, broken legs and burns to her hands and feet. She was also malnourished and dehydrated. The little girl, little Joselin, was placed at that time with her grandmother. But when her grandmother died, Joselin was returned to her parents, and 3 months later, as I testified before, she was dead. 
Now, after a 6-week trial, Joselin's father has been convicted of first-degree murder and torture, and her mother of second-degree murder. The judge sentenced Joselin's father to life in prison. He will be eligible for parole in 42 years. The judge sentenced her mother to 15 years to life, and she will be eligible for parole in 13 years. The judge, after listening to the evidence, after listening to this horrible story, this horrible tragedy, told Joselin's father:  
I have been in court with literally scores of people--some brutal, sadistic killers, but none of them were treated by society as Joselin was treated by her father. 
Joselin's mother's attorney asked the judge to take into consideration the mother has lost two children--Joselin and a 3-year-old son who was placed in foster care. The judge replied, I think correctly: 
She hasn't lost two children. She killed one and lost the other. And it seems the reason she did it was not a pretty one. She was getting what she needed, so it was acceptable. It was not unacceptable enough for her to lift a hand to make it end. 
These killers have been brought to justice. We, as Americans, I don't think, can truly believe that justice has been done when any child has been left to the mercy of people like this. The bill that we passed--my colleague in the chair helped pass last year--to reform the foster care system in this country to help liberate children from abusive parents, is just the beginning, just the beginning of a strong struggle to reduce the number of lives lost in this kind of senseless tragedy. 
We need to move children into safe, stable, loving and permanent homes. Just about a year ago, on April 30, 1997, I told the Senate about another little girl, and her story has a happier ending. This is a little Ohio girl. She was less than 4 months old when she was hospitalized in critical condition, suffering from shaken-baby syndrome. When she was released from the hospital she went to her first foster home. By the time this little girl was 4, she had been shuttled through eight separate foster homes in 4 short years of life. 
By the time she finally got out of foster care, she became hysterical whenever she saw a full black garbage bag. Why? That's because that was the luggage that was used whenever she had to be moved from one foster home to another. They always put her belongings in a plastic garbage bag. She knew when she saw that that she was going to be moved again. 
Last week this little Ohio girl finally got permanent adoptive parents. That is what she and every child in this country needs and deserves. I'm sure all my colleagues join me in wishing her well in her new home and her healing process. I'm sure all of my colleagues also join me in pledging that we will redouble our common efforts to help all of America's children find safe, stable, loving and permanent homes. 
In short, and in conclusion, the bill that we passed last year is doing some good. It will continue to do good. But it is only the first step. As long as there are half a million children in this country, as there still are today, who are in foster care at any one given moment, as long as children are in some abusive homes, as long as we continue to lose children every week who are killed by their caregivers, this Senate and legislative bodies across this country must remain vigilant. We must continue to examine this issue. We must do all that we can to make sure that every child has what we all want for our own children, and that is a permanent and loving home.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. The purpose of this legislation is to address the problem of child molesters and pedophiles who use computers, and the Internet in particular, to commit crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation against our most vulnerable citizens--our children. I appreciate Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison joining me in this important effort. 
The Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act is a comprehensive bill that combats the growing problem of criminals who misuse our information superhighway to contact children for purposes of sexual abuse and exploitation. Not only does this legislation send a strong message that America will not tolerate the abuse of its children, it will also make it easier to put these heinous criminals out of commission. 
Mr. President, my wife Fran and I have eight children--ages 6 to 30. There is nothing more important to parents than protecting their children from harm. There was a time, not so long ago, when parents could feel secure when their children were at home or in a library--that their child would at least be safe from danger in those places. But along with the tremendous benefit of the Internet, we have also unfortunately, unintentionally invited strangers into our homes, and sometime our children's rooms, just because computers may be located there. Strangers who sometimes have the immoral and criminal intent to lure our kids into deviant sexual, abusive, and illegal activity right under our noses. 
Not long ago, a 47-year-old Ohio man used the Internet to entice a 12-year-old girl in New Jersey to make pornographic videos of herself. He posed on-line as a 15-year-old, who promised that he would forward copies of the pornographic video to her favorite music band members. She made four sexually explicit videos before the man was apprehended by authorities. There are literally hundreds of these examples, and many even worse, occurring every day in America. It has become commonplace to hear about a child being lured across the country via the Internet by a pedophile. 
I hope, and believe, that through this legislation we can begin to restore the peace of mind parents should have when their children use the Internet at school, at the library, or in their home. 
This bill will protect children from cyber-stalkers and porn peddlers by prohibiting contacting of a minor on the Internet for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. It prohibits knowingly transferring obscene materials to a minor over the Internet. In addition, the maximum penalty is doubled for enticing a minor to travel across State lines for illegal sexual activity. Using a computer to persuade a minor to engage in prostitution or a sexual act will carry a maximum sentence of 15 years, and a minimum sentence of 3 years. 
Also, law enforcement is given the tools to quickly and effectively investigate sex and kidnaping crimes involving children. Pretrial detention is provided for Federal sex offenders, and administrative subpoenas are allowed in certain child exploitation investigations. In addition, the bill clarifies that kidnaping investigations do not require waiting 24 hours--they can be initiated immediately. Further, Federal jurisdiction is provided in kidnaping cases where a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce is used. 
Mr. President, a person today can get almost anything on the Internet. With this bill, we are trying to make sure that they cannot get our children.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are concluding National Organ Donor Week. I think as we conclude our week here in the U.S. Senate, it will be appropriate to pause for a moment and discuss the importance of this week. This is one of the few times when the mere talking about an issue actually will, in fact, make a difference. 
Why do we celebrate or why do we call attention to National Organ Donor Week? We do it because of a tragedy. The tragedy is that 7, 8, 9, in some weeks 10, of our fellow citizens die, die every week, because there aren't enough organs available. They don't die because medical science can't save them--medical science can save them. They die waiting on a list, waiting for an organ to become available, and seven, eight, or nine of them every week die. 
What can be done about this? What we can do is talk about this issue. As we talk about it, we can encourage people and their families around the kitchen table to talk about it. Talking about it does make a difference. Too many families, when faced with life's most horrible tragedy, which is the unexpected, usually sudden, loss of a loved one--a daughter, son, mother, father, wife, husband--when they are asked by the medical personnel at the hospital, `Can we use your loved one's organs to help save someone else?' they don't know what to say. They are faced with horrible trauma, something they have not expected. Too many of our fellow citizens say no, not because they don't want to help people, but they say no because they never thought of it. 
I am convinced if people talk about this issue, if they talk among the members of their family, that we will increase the number of people, when they are faced with that horrible tragedy, to in fact say yes, and we will save lives. That is why we set aside a week as National Organ Donor Week. 
The ribbon I am wearing symbolizes that. One of our great pages who was out in the hallway a moment ago asked me, `Senator DeWine, what does that stand for?' And I was able to tell her what this stands for. I think it is something that we want to share with all our fellow Americans. 
The Postmaster General and his committee will issue a postage stamp next August to remind us all as we put postage on our letters, as we receive letters, of how important it is to encourage people to become organ donors. I appreciate, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, having an opportunity to talk about this issue this afternoon.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have, with few exceptions, been very careful not to comment about the ongoing investigation, the Starr investigation, the independent investigation--however you want to characterize it. I have refrained from doing that for many reasons. 
I want to speak this afternoon about a very limited aspect of that investigation. I speak as a former county prosecuting attorney. I bring, I guess, to the Senate floor today that particular perspective. This past week, there have been news stories--and again I emphasize `news stories;' we don't know whether it is true or not true--news stories about the possible subpoena into the grand jury here in Washington of Secret Service agents. That has been the report. 
Before I go any further, let me say I don't know what the facts are. I don't know whether that is true or not true; nor do I know what the facts are underlying this investigation; nor do I know what Mr. Starr and his prosecutors have uncovered so far; nor, obviously, do I know what has occurred inside the grand jury. So my comments have to be qualified, and that fact has to be taken into consideration. My comments must be understood in that light, and they are given in that light. 
Former President Bush was quoted in the Washington Post in what was described as a private letter--it was in the Washington Post of Thursday, April 23, yesterday. This was a letter that apparently was privately sent to, directly to, the Secret Service Director, Lewis C. Merletti. 
And the Washington Post quotes the letter from former President Bush as saying, in part, the following: `I can tell you, sir, that I am deeply troubled by the allegations swirling around there in Washington and what all this might do to the office I was so proud to hold,' Bush wrote Merletti. 
Continuing the quote: `Regardless of all that, I feel very strongly that the United States Secret Service agent should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard.' 
Mr. President, I hope that this issue about the potential subpoenaing of Secret Service agents into a grand jury, if it's true, to testify about things they observed involving the President of the United States would be resolved not in the courts and not by legislation. As a former prosecutor, I hope that this matter will be resolved by the sound, good judgment of the special prosecutor in this case. It should be resolved by the proper use, the measured use, the reasoned use of what we refer to as `prosecutorial discretion.' 
Mr. President, the prosecutor in our system has a unique role. I don't know of any other country where the prosecutor has quite this distinctive a role. The prosecutor, really, in many respects, is the most important player in the criminal justice system. It is because of prosecutorial discretion the prosecutor must decide whether the evidence that has been gathered is sufficient to even summon a grand jury, to even present a case to a grand jury. A prosecutor carries a very, very heavy burden. It is a burden that is not carried by the defense attorney, whose job it is to present the defense. It is a burden that is really not even carried by the judge, who is not the principal acting force because, under our system, nothing really happens until a prosecutor says it happens. Nothing goes into play, so to speak. The game doesn't start until the prosecutor makes that decision. So the burden on the prosecutor of summoning people to a grand jury, of asking a grand jury to indict someone is an awesome, awesome responsibility. 
Let me talk for a moment--and again, I am talking in the abstract without all of the information. At least from this Senator's perspective, I can express my point of view as to how I hope and expect that prosecutorial discretion to be exercised in a very unique situation when we are dealing with the Secret Service that is sworn to protect the lives of the President of the United States and his family and when we are dealing with the President of the United States. Frankly, I am not concerned about an individual President; I am concerned about the office, and I am concerned about what precedent we may or may not be in the process of setting.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will turn to another issue I have spoken about on the floor a number of times. It is a question, in my opinion, of life or death. It is legislation that was approved by this body with an overwhelming--virtually a 2-to-1--vote. It is a matter presently subject to the conference committee between the Senate and the House. That issue, of course, is the issue of the .08 national DUI standard. 
Members of the conference committee are working on this, or preparing to work on this matter, so I think my comments are timely and I think it is important to emphasize what this whole question is all about. I believe that one of the most important provisions of the Senate version of this service transportation bill was a provision that we approved by an overwhelming majority of 62 in favor and 32 opposed. 
That division, if this Senate approved it, would move our country forward to a national .08 blood alcohol standard. 
As my colleagues know, the House Rules Committee voted, I think very unfortunately, to stop the House from even considering this matter on the House floor. 
Mr. President, the facts are that if this does not become law, there will be lives that will be lost that would have been saved if we would have enacted this very reasonable national standard. The need for this legislation will not go away, it will only increase. 
How did such a clearly valuable measure, a life-saving measure, end up being blocked in the House and remain in such legislative peril today? I think one major reason is an effort outside this Congress, a well financed campaign of what I believe are half-truths. 
There was a full-page ad that appeared in the Washington Times before the Rules Committee voted. It said that reducing the blood alcohol limit to .08 would transform the average American into a lawbreaker. Here is what it said. I quote. 
Reducing the limit to .08 would increase the number of law violators by about 60 percent. 
Mr. President, that is simply not true. That is wrong. It is not true. That is not what our bill does. Our amendment's purpose is not to get more people arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol but, rather, to get more people to change their behavior so that fewer of them drive under the influence. One might be asked: How do we know that would happen if our legislation passed? How do we know the results will be fewer people actually arrested? The answer comes from our largest State, the State of California. 
In 1989, the last year California had a .10 blood alcohol content limit, the highway patrol in California made 138,000 DUI arrests. In the first year after the law was changed, the first year of the new .08 limit, that number did jump almost 14 percent, to 158,000--138,000, 158,000. But every year since then, Mr. President, that number has declined, all the way down to the last available figures, which were 1997, and that figure was 91,014. Every year, it went down. That is the lowest level of DUI arrests in California since 1971. The efforts from our largest State could not be more clear. 
A .08 standard does not turn Americans into lawbreakers. It does not turn the average American into lawbreakers. That is simply not true. It takes impaired drivers off our streets. 
Because precious lives depend on keeping impaired drivers off the road, I promise that we will fight to keep this legislation in the final transportation bill. We will work to pass the legislation, because the facts are on our side. The facts tell a very disturbing story. 
During the recent break, when Members of the House and the Senate had a chance to be in their home States, on April 13 the Washington Post had an important, I think, revealing article laying out the facts. 
Fact: According to a Boston University study, passing this legislation would save, at a minimum, 500 lives a year. In fact, the majority says it is no more than between 500 and 1,000. But even to take a minimum of this Boston University study, it would be 500 families that would not be destroyed--500 families that would not have to bury a son, or a daughter, or a loved one. That is the fact. The only debate on this fact is, Is 500 lives a lot or a little? Is it worth doing something `just to save' 500 lives? I happen to think it is. This is an easy question, I think, to answer. If by making a minor adjustment in the law--this is a minor adjustment--we can save at least 500 lives across this country, I think it is very, very important and very significant, and I think we ought to do it. This legislation clearly would save at least 500 lives. 
The second fact, again, as contained in this what I think is a very well balanced argument: The blood streams of .08 drivers `carry enough alcohol to measurably impair the symphony of neurological responses necessary to drive a car well.' This is the conclusion of the Washington Post article based on the current state of research and based on their interviews with numerous experts, scientific experts, and medical experts in the field. 
The third fact, again from this article: `There is no question that nearly everything you can think of in terms of driving impairment is evident by a .08.' That is a quote from UCLA Professor Herbert Moskowitz, the president of the Southern California Research Institute. 
Science tells us that at .08, drivers have a lot of trouble dividing their attention between different visual stimuli. They also have trouble processing new information as fast as driving requires. Mr. President, these are absolutely critical driving skills, crucial skills, when you are driving a car. At .08, a person's ability to do both of these things is seriously impaired. That is a fact. 
I had a chance to talk to an old friend of mine, `KO' Martin, who used to be a highway patrolman. In fact, `KO' and I prosecuted a number of cases together. He brought a number of cases to me while I was a county prosecutor. He was a highway state trooper for many, many years. He told this story. Once he pulled over a motorist who was so impaired that `KO' had to literally carry him to the patrol car. He literally couldn't get him there, he was so impaired. That particular motorist tested at .05 blood alcohol level. Apparently, this man had received a promotion at work. They had just thrown a party for him. He wasn't used to drinking. He was clearly unable to drive a car after the drinks he had. He tested .05. Clearly, he should not have been behind the wheel. Someone who is so under the influence that he can't even walk is not going to be able to react fast enough to drive a car safely. That is the simple fact. 
My fourth fact: According to a study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol, `Drivers with readings between .08 and .05 had 1.4 times the risk of dying compared to people who had no alcohol in their blood. For people between .05 and .09, that risk was 11 times higher.' 
Again, Mr. President, that is a fact, a tragic fact that costs human lives. 
Another fact: There is evidence that a .08 standard will have a deterrent effect on the whole range of impaired drivers. Allen F. Williams of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says, `There seems to be a deterrent effect all across the whole range of blood alcohol concentrations, including the very high levels,' the very high ones all the way across on all drivers. 
Mr. President, let me mention in this regard that this last fact doesn't surprise me at all. 
In fact, in 1982, as a member of the Ohio State Senate, I wrote a law toughening Ohio's standard on impaired driving. That law went into effect March 17 of 1983. In the first year after our bill became law, we saw an across-the-board change in public attitude towards driving under the influence. The biggest impact our bill had was not who was being arrested but, rather, in the public perception of drunken driving, the public perception of driving under the influence. It happened all across Ohio. We saw auto fatalities from drinking and driving going down. We sent a very strong message. That message could be sent across this country in all 50 States by this Congress by approving what the Senate approved by a 2 to 1 margin, and that is to go to a very reasonable standard of a .08 national blood alcohol standard. 
No matter where someone was driving, whether they were driving in your great State of Kansas or my great State of Ohio, or Indiana or Kentucky or Maine or California, they would have some assurance that the law would be uniform; that when they put their child in a car, got behind the wheel, that whatever State they were in, the standard would be at .08. 
America needs this legislation, and I will make sure we keep returning to this issue until we get the job done. I urge the transportation bill conferees to consider these basic facts and to include what the Senate did, and that is the .08 legislation in the final transportation bill.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to what I believe is a truly excellent decision by the baseball Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee. On the 3rd of March, one of the true greats of baseball history, Larry Doby, was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame. I think we all know the story, at least the outline of the story. On July 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African American to play in the American League--just 3 months after Jackie Robinson had broken baseball's color barrier in the other league, the National League. 
The legendary Bill Veeck was at that time, of course, the owner and had control of the Cleveland Indians. Veeck saw that Larry Doby was leading the Negro National League with a .458 batting average and had at that time 13 home runs. He and Doby, Veeck and Doby, made the historic and courageous decision to break the color barrier in the American League. 
It is sometimes difficult for us to remember what the situation was back in 1947 or to really truly understand it. The Jackie Robinson decision was still highly controversial. It was really at this point by no means self-evident that support for integrated baseball would take hold. Larry Doby and Bill Veeck made an act of faith in America's future and in the American people. 
In his autobiography, Bill Veeck wrote that he `received 20,000 letters, most of them in violent, sometimes obscene protest.' But then he went on to say, `When Doby hit a tremendous home run to put us ahead in the fourth game of the Series, it could be observed that none of the people who were on their feet cheering seemed at all concerned or even conscious of Larry Doby's color.' 
Mr. President, it took courage for Larry Doby to get up to the plate, but once he got there his record of accomplishment silenced his critics. In 1948, his first full season, he led the Indians to victory in the World Series batting .318 and hitting a game-winning home run. He was named to the All-Star Team every single year from 1949 to 1955. In 1952, he led the American League in home runs and runs scored. Two years later, in 1954, he led the league in home runs and RBIs. 
He left the Indians in 1956 to play for the Chicago White Sox, and later the Detroit Tigers. He retired in 1959, but returned to baseball in 1978 to manage the White Sox--becoming only the second African-American manager in the history of the major leagues. The first, I might add, was the great Frank Robinson--who managed the Indians from 1975 to 1977, and who played as a player, of course, for the Cincinnati Reds and then for the Baltimore Orioles. 
Mr. President, I join all Ohioans--and indeed all lovers of baseball nationwide--in congratulating Larry Doby on this well-deserved recognition of a truly outstanding career.

Mr. DeWine. 
Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator Leahy to introduce the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. The purpose of this legislation is to achieve three basic goals: first, to increase public awareness of the plight of crime victims with developmental disabilities; second, to start collecting data to measure the extent and nature of the problem; and third, to develop strategies to address the safety and justice needs of these victims. 
Research in foreign countries has found that persons with developmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 times higher risk of becoming crime victims than those without disabilities. Studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that crime victims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization, because so few of the crimes against them are reported. Unfortunately, even when crimes against victims with disabilities are reported, there is sometimes a reluctance by justice officials to rely on the testimony of a disabled person, further making these victims a target for criminal predators. 
What do we know about similar crimes in the United States? Amazingly, little if any. No significant studies have been conducted in the United States. In fact, the Bureau of Justice Statistics in their annual National Crime Victims Survey does not specifically collect data about crimes against persons with disabilities. 
Research needs to be done in the United States to (1) understand the nature and extent of crimes against persons with developmental disabilities; (2) assess how the law enforcement and justice systems currently respond to crimes against the developmentally disabled; and (3) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promise for making our law enforcement and justice systems more responsive to crimes against persons with developmental disabilities. 
Our legislation today would accomplish these three research goals. Our legislation would direct the Attorney General to contract with the National Research Council through the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Law and Justice to develop a research agenda to increase the understanding and control of crime against persons with developmental disabilities. The National Academy of Sciences would develop a research agenda that includes convening an interdisciplinary panel of nationally recognized experts on crime victims with disabilities and related fields, to define and address critical issues to understanding crimes against people with developmental disabilities. Their research would focus on preventive, educative, social, and legal strategies, and recommend methods for addressing the needs of underserved populations. 
An authoritative report resulting from this process should provide some important answers. 
In addition, the bill would direct the Attorney General to begin collecting data for the National Crime Victims Survey of crime victims with developmental disabilities. The Attorney General is asked to study and report to the States and to Congress on how the States may collect centralized databases on the incidences of crimes against the disabled. 
One reason why this issue is so important, and why this legisation is necessary is because there are more and more people with developmental disabilities. The factors behind this rising population include poor prenatal nutrition and care, increases in child abuse, and substance abuse during pregnancy. 
I am hopeful that the research called for in this legislation will have broad, positive national policy implications. Greater knowledge about victims with developmental disabilities will help service providers target programs more effectively. Victims and their families will have a better understanding of crime risks. Justice and social service policy makers will have a greater understanding of how, where, and when these crimes occur, the characteristics of victims, and how these crimes affect victims and their families. Law enforcement may gain information on how to improve investigative and prosecution strategies, and how to use victims' testimony in conjunction with other case evidence. Clearly, what we're trying to do with this legislation is to raise considerably the national profile of this issue among research agencies and the academic community, and to continue to define and develop solutions to this problem.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues up to date on the situation in Haiti. Two weeks ago, I traveled once again to this troubled country. While I knew little about Haiti before becoming a Senator, this was my fifth trip to Haiti in the last 3 years. So I have had the opportunity to see what changes have taken place and the general direction of events. 
Later today, the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, will visit Haiti. She will find when she arrives a troubled country, but a country in which the United States does have a major national interest. 
Mr. President, let me begin by pointing out that wile Haiti is not of strategic importance to the United States, what happens there does have a impact on our country and on our citizens. 
Haiti's current political system is not stable. It is a struggling democracy in its infancy. If this unstable democracy descends into outright chaos, the result could be an exodus of boat people coming to our shores. 
It has, of course, Mr. President, happened before. Remember, Haiti is just 700 miles from Florida. During the early 1990s, after President Jean Bertrand Aristide was ousted from power, tens of thousands of Haitians risked their lives by boarding small boats, even rafts, hoping to reach the United States or other countries. Between 1991 and 1994, 67,000 Haitians were interdicted at sea--67,000. Our Government was forced to house more than 25,000 Haitians in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, at a cost of more than $400 million. 
Historically, our countries have important ties. Haiti is the second oldest republic in the hemisphere. Their defeat of Napoleon's army in 1804 led the French to sell us the Louisiana Territory. In 1915, the United States intervened militarily to restore order to Haiti, and we remained there until a new government was installed in 1934. So our interest in Haiti is not new--it is rooted in our history. 
Hundreds of thousands of Haitians live in the United States. In fact, there are more Haitians in the United States than any other country outside of Haiti, and thousands of U.S. citizens live in Haiti, either permanently or temporarily, for humanitarian purposes. I am amazed, as I travel throughout Haiti, at the number of Americans I meet. They can be found all over that small country. 
Haiti's troubles have a direct effect on the United States, and impact. Haiti's current political power vacuum already is being filled by dangerous drug lords. Today, 8 percent of the drugs on our Nation's streets come from Haiti or through Haiti. This is a clear example of how the current crisis in Haiti has a clear and direct impact on the people of my home State of Ohio, your home State of Washington, and the rest of this country. 
Geographic proximity has dictated U.S. interest in Haiti over the course of this century. It will continue to do so. In September 1994, the United States--in conjunction with the international community--sent over 20,000 troops, at a cost of over $1 billion, to restore President Aristide to power. This figure does not include the additional $120 million the United States provided the United Nations for peacekeeping operations. In addition, since then, the United States has invested well over $2 billion in nonmilitary assistance to establish and help sustain democracy in Haiti. 
Mr. President, I would now like to update my colleagues on where things stand in Haiti with regard to a number of specific topics. Let me first start with American civilian police presence there. 
One cause for optimism in Haiti is the American civilian police, who participate in the United Nations civilian police presence. Their mandate recently shifted from mentoring the cops on the streets, the Haitian police officers on the streets, to mentoring the mid-level management of the Haitian National Police. 
I had the distinct pleasure, when I was in Haiti several weeks ago, of accompanying American civilian policemen on duty in Cite Soleil--a slum in Port-au-Prince with probably the highest degree of violence in this whole country. Surprisingly, several of these American cops told me they had no problem moving through Cite Soleil both during the day and at night. We 
have, today, 31 dedicated U.S. police officers, Haitian-born U.S. citizen veteran U.S. cops, who are down in Haiti on a contract basis, mentoring the Haitian police. These 31 dedicated police officers from New York, New Jersey, Florida, L.A: they are all creole speakers. This enables them to communicate well with the Haitian population. In fact, the majority of these 31 Americans were born or have relatives in Haiti. These U.S. police officers told me they feel their work with the Haitian police is helping. It is beneficial. It is important. Mr. President, I commend them and I support the efforts of these fine Americans. 
Let me turn now to the Haitian police. One of the main missions of the United States after President Aristide was restored to power was to help train a brand new Haitian police force. This was a daunting, and remains a daunting, task. I don't know that it has ever been undertaken in the world at such a magnitude as we tried and have been doing in Haiti. We have trained over 5,000 new Haitian police recruits. Our men and women who travel to Haiti to do this did, and continue to do, an excellent job. 
The Haitian National Police, or HNP, are doing fairly well and have taken strides to professionalize the institution. Continued concerns of some human rights violations are being addressed in the newly formed inspector general's office. The United States has spent considerable money and effort in training the police force. In conjunction with other interested international donors, this training must continue. Furthermore, efforts should be made to address the lack of resources needed by this police force. 
When the international community restored Aristide to power in 1994, the Haitian military and police were then totally dismantled. A new police force was formed from scratch. Although a very young force, the Haitian National Police has been described as the only functioning institution in Haiti. 
When the U.S. Government decided to train the new Haitian police through the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program--this is our U.S. Government program known as `ICITAP'--we laid down three conditions: No. 1, that the old armed forces must be and were disbanded; No. 2, that the new police force must be civilian; and, No. 3, that the police must have reasonable means to overcome their historic corruption. 
While the Haitian police are generally doing a good job, some Haitians continue to fear HNP, the Haitian National Police. These Haitians particularly fear the crowd control/riot squad unit. This unit, which dresses in all black uniforms, including reflective sunglasses, is extremely intimidating and reminiscent of the previous military regime. Further, serious human rights abuses by the HNP officials continue, tragically, to occur. 
There is really only one solution, and that is to continue to work to help professionalize the police. That is what we are doing. A newly installed inspector general's office within the HNP is looking at these human rights violation cases. We will not see real progress in this area until and unless the IG moves these cases forward--and until and unless the judicial system successfully prosecutes policemen involved in these crimes. 
Efforts are being made to start integrating the Haitian police into the Haitian society. The concept of community policing is a concept that our men and women are taking to Haiti. Haitian President Preval has requested the HNP to engage in this community policing. American civilian police personnel are mentoring their HNP counterparts in this effort. Though this effort is only in its initial stages, it is a change in the right direction. The police are also attempting to change from a reactive force to become a more typically American proactive force. 
Our continued commitment to the professionalization of the Haitian police is essential. As all Americans know, a strong and effective police force is essential to any civil, democratic society. We must continue the ICITAP program, and urge the Haitian Government to continue its own efforts to professionalize the police, from the officer on the street to the midlevel management at headquarters. 
To succeed, a quality police force needs quality resources. The fact is resources are, of course, lacking in Haiti. For example, in Cap Haitien, the second largest city in Haiti that we visited with over 300,000 residents, 130 policemen have access to only six vehicles. This force also lacks simple phones and two-way radios. 
But perhaps most important is not the lack of physical resources, but the lack of human resources. 
The current police force--slightly over 6,000 for the whole country--is of course, too small. The Dominican Republic--Haiti's neighboring country--has roughly the same population and a national police force of 29,000. I urge the administration to consult with the international donor community--and together with the Haitian Government--discuss ways to (1) continue training; (2) continue mentoring this police force; (3) provide necessary and better equipment; and (4) slowly but steadily increase the size of the Haitian national police. 
Let me turn now to the issue of judicial reform. 
Mr. President, the police in Haiti is only one element of the judicial system. While we have made progress in police reform, there is not now a functioning judicial system in Haiti. Reforming the entire judicial system--the courts, prosecutors and defense attorneys--should be a priority for the Haitian Government. If any progress--economic or political--is going to happen, Haiti needs a working judicial system. To get there, the Haitian Government needs to demonstrate a real commitment--real political will--to make judicial reform a priority. We should make clear that our Government is willing to make a commitment--an investment--to create an effective judicial system, but only--only--if it is clear that the Haitian Government itself is willing to lead that effort. 
Although the 1987 Haitian Constitution requires a separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches, the Minister of Justice--an executive branch official--currently has control over the entire law enforcement system: the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys and the courts! Not only are the courts not independent, to make matters worse, I was informed by both U.S. and Haitian officials that the current Minister of Justice in Haiti is not committed to any real reform measures. The seriousness of this problem cannot be overstated. 
The credibility of the Haitian legal system is undermined by the perception that it is awash in corruption--and that justice is for sale. Until the Haitian Government demonstrates the political will to bring murderers to justice, for instance, the Haitian people will lack confidence in their own legal system, and vigilante-style justice will tragically continue. 
True judicial reform cannot take place unless and until Haiti political leaders exercise the political will to solve the high profile political murders. There have been dozens of political murders in Haiti over the past several years. Unfortunately, to date, not a single one has been solved. Despite the efforts of the Special Investigative Unit inside the Haitian national police, which has the specific mandate to investigate these high-profile murder cases, the Haitian Government has done nothing to help resolve these cases. Some argue that one of the reasons behind this fact is that some senior Haitian Government officials may be implicated in the crimes. 
Having said that, I still believe we must continue to fund the Special Investigations Unit, because, as one high ranking U.S. official told me when we were in Haiti: `It keeps pressure on the Haitian Government and keeps them halfway honest.' 
Mr. President, successfully solving and prosecuting even one of these political cases could serve as a turning point for reform of the judicial system. It could send the right signal. We need to do all we can to put pressure on the Haitian Government to make this a top priority. For example, last year, Congress enacted legislation I proposed which denies visas to Haitians involved in extrajudicial and political killings. The identity of many of these people who committed atrocities is well known. We should keep this law that we passed last year in place as a way of pressuring the Haitian Government--and sending a signal to the Haitian population that the U.S. cares about justice, and that they themselves should demand it. 
Any expressed commitment by the Haitian Government to judicial reform cannot be taken seriously without its cooperation in the identification, capture and prosecution of political murderers. That kind of commitment will give the judicial system the credibility 
it needs to be seen as a viable law enforcement agency for all Haitians. 
Furthermore, currently the Haitian judicial system is a system in name only. Although the number of arrests has increased, those arrested are not being prosecuted. At this time, justice begins and ends with the police. If this does not change, we can only imagine the negative impact this will have on police morale. All our efforts to reform the police could end up, in the long run, being in vain. Mr. President, without judicial reform, we cannot expect Haitian society--its government, its economy--to move forward. On the contrary, it will move backward. 
Since the Minister of Justice currently is not committed to reform, the U.S. Government has found ways to work around the Ministry by mentoring judges, for example. I was extremely impressed by our Department of Justice representative in Haiti who is helping train judges and prosecutors. He has found ways to work around the Ministry to start instituting positive change in that system. 
But we cannot make serious long-term progress until the Haitian Government--starting with the Minister of Justice--agrees to reform. Working around the Minister of Justice can only go so far. Serious judicial reform in Haiti begins with a commitment from the government's leaders. Therefore, I recommend the following: 
First, the United States, along with the international donors, must urge President Preval to appoint a new Minister of Justice who will demonstrate a commitment to work with the international donor community to together help create meaningful reforms in the judiciary. 
Second, the United States and the other international donors must get from the Haitian Government a serious commitment to reform the entire judicial system. Amazingly, the list of official priorities the Haitian Government has presented to the U.S. Government does not include judicial reform! Unless that changes, I suggest we reconsider any continued U.S. assistance for judicial reform. Without such a commitment, I am concerned that any money we send will simply be wasted. 
A true commitment by the Haitian Government to reform the entire judiciary system must include action on the following basic elements: 
An independent judiciary; 
New legislative laws regarding the judiciary, including a judicial career system, and reform of the penal codes; 
Increased budget for the national and local judiciary system; and 
Establishment of an appropriate career and salary structure for the judiciary system, including salary increases for committed prosecutors and judges; and creation of a functioning disciplinary body to oversee the entire judiciary, such as an inspector general's office within the Ministry of Justice. 
We must make clear that we stand ready to assist the Haitian Government if they are serious about taking the actions I have just described. We must make clear what that assistance would amount to. This year, we provided $11 million for judicial reform. In next year's budget request, the Clinton administration has proposed to reduce the judicial reform program from $11 million to $7 million and grant an additional $4 million (which together would equal $11 million) for human rights initiatives. Now, there are some who will argue that human rights is part of a judicial reform. While providing assistance to those who have suffered human rights abuses is a commendable effort, it should not and cannot replace an effort to reform the system that encourages these abuses. 
If the Haitian Government agrees to invest in judicial reform, we should at least maintain our current annual investment in judicial reform--the $11 million figure--and we should increase it if possible. After all, the level of our investment should reflect the degree of importance we place on this kind of reform. 
However, if the Haitian Government does not express and demonstrate a true political will to do these basic reforms, then the United States must reconsider its assistance in this area. 
Thus, Mr. President, we should set aside the same level of funding for judicial reform in this year's budget. But we must make it clear this money will not be spent, cannot be spent, until we have a commitment, a demonstrated commitment in action, from the Haitian Government to achieve these important benchmarks. 
Mr. President, before I conclude this section, let me tell my colleagues a quick story about the benefits of judicial reform in another country. During our recent visit to Haiti, we also visited the Dominican Republic where we focused on their efforts to reform the judicial system. Speaking with the President of the Dominican Republic, I got a sense of the Government's true commitment to the judicial reform process. When I asked the President what finally got the process underway, he said that first there had to be political will. Aside from that, the people must also want, if not demand, it. 
A well-known writer, Orlando Martinez, was murdered several years ago in the Dominican Republic. At the time, no one attempted to take on the case. No one would. The reason was that no one had trust or faith in the judicial system. Well, one courageous judge in early 1996 decided to take on that case. He made the case a priority and through the process did something unprecedented. He had a number of military officials arrested and successfully prosecuted and sentenced. 
Mr. President, to make a long story short, the prosecution of the individuals involved in this murder was a turning point in moving forward with judicial reform in that country. 
The case got tremendous media coverage, and the society was never the same--the Dominican Republic was not the same. Soon after the civil society started demanding important judicial reforms, the business community started demanding important judicial reforms. They felt invigorated by the prosecution of this one, but highly important, case. It gave them faith in the system. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, there have been a number of unsolved political murder cases in Haiti. The murder case in the Dominican Republic serves as an important example of an important transformation that took place in that society. We saw a similar scenario in El Salvador in the 1980s when high-profile murders were investigated and those responsible were successfully prosecuted and sentenced. That was something new in El Salvador and had an unbelievable effect on the society. Specifically, in El Salvador, high-ranking military officers were sentenced for the killing of Jesuit priests. The solving of even one political murder--the solving of even one political murder--in Haiti would do wonders to send a powerful signal about justice and the rule of law in that troubled country. 
Mr. President, let me now turn to another topic in regard to Haiti that is extremely troubling, and that is the drug situation. 
The need for a stronger judiciary, Mr. President, and a professional police force becomes readily apparent if you examine Haiti's situation with regard to drugs. When it comes to the matter of illegal narcotics, I must report to the Senate that the situation in Haiti is grave and even approaching a 
crisis. Because of Haiti's weak political and economic condition, this country is becoming increasingly attractive to international drug traffickers. The United States must pay close attention to this growing concern, for there is a threat that Haiti could turn into a full-fledged narcostate. That means, and would mean, more and more illegal drugs coming through Haiti into our country. 
For that reason, the Clinton administration must direct more Drug Enforcement Administration and Coast Guard personnel to Haiti to better combat the drug problem within the country and better control the drug trafficking in international waters surrounding Haiti. We should also incrementally increase our counter-narcotics assistance to Haitian Government agencies responsible for counternarcotics in terms of training, as they become more efficient and professional. 
According to a U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine movement, in 1996, between 5 and 8 percent of the cocaine coming into the United States passed through the country of Haiti. By the third quarter of 1997, the percentage jumped to 12 percent and increased to 19 percent by the end of that year. One of the reasons cited for the increase is the enhanced law enforcement effort that is being made in Puerto Rico, which has caused traffickers to move operations from there to Haiti. 
Responding to this trend, the Clinton administration added Haiti to the list of countries requiring annual certification in 1995, and though it has been certified as cooperative in the war on drugs each year since, the problem appears to be getting worse. 
Mr. President, most people are aware that most of the cocaine coming into our country is grown and processed in Colombia, but the transit routes are always changing. The drug traffickers continue to move them. As indicated on this map, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico are all located approximately halfway between Colombia and the United States. 
Drug interdiction efforts have increased to combat direct shipment of drugs from Colombia to Puerto Rico, forcing opportunistic drug lords to seek alternative routes. Thus Haiti, a mere 15 hours from Colombia by speedboat, seems a perfect candidate, a mere overnight passage in a boat. Because commercial shipments from Haiti to the United States are scarce, illegal drugs are transported from Colombia into Haiti and across Haiti into the Dominican Republic and then the short distance to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is only about 75 miles away at its closest point to the Dominican Republic. These drugs go into Puerto Rico disguised as legitimate commercial shipments. Once they are in Puerto Rico, they are virtually home free into the United States. 
Drug traffickers realize that once the drugs land in Puerto Rico, they are virtually home free because of the special status of Puerto Rico as a U.S. Commonwealth. That is the route. And it is increasing every single day, the transshipment through Haiti. 
Apart from the strategic location, Haiti has become increasingly attractive to international traffickers because drug interdiction efforts are minimal in that country. Haitian law enforcement authorities present no threat to the drug traffickers. The Haitian Coast Guard consists of only a few boats, and it is simply outnumbered and outgunned by the Colombian professional drug lords. 
The Haitian Coast Guard has had, with our help, a few 
successes. With the assistance of the United States, in 1998 Haitian authorities have seized 1,000 pounds of cocaine, 500 pounds of marijuana, and 25 pounds of hashish oil. But serious problems remain that when Haitian law enforcement succeeds and actually makes a seizure, Haiti's slow and ineffective criminal justice system does not act as a serious deterrent. 
In addition, the fledgling Haitian National Police has only 24 agents devoted to the drug problem--24. Granted, this counternarcotics unit was just established last year. I am told there are plans to slowly increase the number of personnel. There is apparently a leadership problem within the unit. Hence, more training is absolutely essential. 
Sadly, some evidence also exists that those responsible for upholding the law in Haiti are themselves part of the problem. Last year, the Haitian Government arrested 21 of its own policemen on narcocorruption charges. 
Money laundering appears to be on the rise as well. Until several years ago, only a handful of banks existed in Haiti at all. That number is said to have more than doubled, or even tripled, in the last few years. 
The transit of drugs in Haiti represents a serious threat to an already fragile democracy. The United States should pay close attention to this growing concern--for there is a threat that Haiti could turn into a full-fledged narcostate, completely controlled by the drug lords with institutionalized power. If Haiti's current political vacuum is filled by these drug cartels, it will then be too late. We simply must not allow that to happen.  
The Clinton administration's budget for next year in regard to drugs calls for $166 million for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs for all of Latin America and the Caribbean. Of that $166 million, no assistance is earmarked specifically for Haiti. Rather, any assistance for Haiti comes from a general fund. Through this general fund, Mr. President, Haiti is expected to get a meager $400,000, up from an estimated $300,000 in 1998--this despite the fact that a country like Jamaica has a requested earmark at $800,000 and the Bahamas have an earmark of $1 million. 
I believe the President's proposed budget would not do very much to stem the tide of drugs flowing through Haiti. A better effort to seize these shipments simply must be made. That means, of course, more investment in training the Haitian Coast Guard. We are doing some of that, Mr. President. It means, further, the Haitian police counternarcotics units must be professionalized. 
It also means a U.S. law enforcement presence in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. When I visited Haiti 2 weeks ago, there was one DEA agent in all of Haiti--one. I was told at the time that two more were on the way. Next door, in the Dominican Republic, when I visited the Dominican Republic, I found they have one permanent and one temporary DEA agent. That is three for the entire island. This is a very small presence considering the fact that Congress has authorized over 100 DEA agents for the Caribbean alone. I was disappointed to find the lack of serious counternarcotics plans for both of these countries. We do not have a plan. I recommended that we do more. 
I must say that I had the opportunity late yesterday afternoon to talk on the phone to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about this issue. She informed me and assured me yesterday when I talked about this that shortly the United States will be beefing up its DEA presence, the number of DEA agents in both Haiti and in the Dominican Republic. I applaud that. We need to do it, and we need to do it immediately. 
Let me make today my specific recommendations in regard to this area. One, we have to increase our DEA presence in Haiti. One is not enough. Two, we must increase Coast Guard personnel and boats in international waters around Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Three, we must slowly increase our counternarcotics assistance resources for Haiti. The Clinton administration's proposed fiscal year 1999 budget would provide foreign aid to Haiti in a total aggregate of over $182 million. That is the proposal. Yet the proposed budget by the Clinton administration only provides $400,000 in counternarcotics assistance. Clearly, we have to do more. 
When we consider the top priorities in U.S. policy toward Haiti, counternarcotics matters should be clearly at or near the top of the list. Having said that, it is important to note that just giving more money to the weak and inefficient Haiti National Police counternarcotics unit and to the Haitian Coast Guard won't solve the problem. It won't solve the problem, because these institutions are weak, and because they are weak, we first need to focus on training. As these institutions slowly become more professional and efficient, we must incrementally, then, increase our counternarcotics assistance to them. 
Let me turn now to probably the most serious problem that Haiti faces. That is the political impasse which has plagued 
this country for 10 months. The political impasse means there is virtually no Government in existence. A political impasse stops any kind of progress that this country might see. When we look at the challenges I have already described in regard to Haiti, challenges of social stability, law enforcement, and drug trafficking, all of these are symptomatic of a larger problem. The larger problem is the political paralysis that exists within the Haitian Government itself. 
Since the Prime Minister resigned from office last June, there has not been a functioning Government. Charges of election fraud in the April 1997 election still remain unresolved, halting any real democratic and economic progress. In conjunction with the international community, the United States must pressure the Haitian Government to, one, resolve the current crisis; and, two, allow for greater international administration and monitoring of the upcoming elections. 
Mr. President, almost 10 months ago, then Prime Minister of Haiti, Prime Minister Rosny Smarth, stepped down from his position due to his frustration with the Government's inability to resolve an electoral dispute and implement his economic modernization plan. Since then, a Prime Minister has not been confirmed by the Parliament. The Prime Minister is designed and designated as the Chief Executive of the Government. He appoints the Cabinet and basically runs the Government. Without a Prime Minister, the country simply cannot function. 
The current political impasse stems from pervasive fraud and improper vote tabulation in the April 6, 1997, elections. Not only have the opposition of the parties demanded that the April 1997 elections be annulled, the international community, including the United Nations, has deemed the elections--which produced only a meager 5 percent turn out--fraudulent. The political parties, led by OPL, insist they will not move forward on a Prime Minister candidate until the issues surrounding the 1997 April elections are finally resolved. 
This paralysis in Government is being felt everywhere. Economic reform efforts have stalled, the legislature has not passed a budget, it has not enacted structural reforms needed to free up over $100 million in foreign assistance, nor has it approved loans for millions of technical assistance. 
The lack of a Government has halted the process of privatization and made it difficult to implement civil downsizing. Finally, it has discouraged potential investors who could play a key role in economic development and in improving Haiti's image. Regardless of the countless visits to Haiti in the last year alone by very senior U.S. Government administration officials, up to and including Secretary Albright's visit this weekend, there has not been a real movement toward a solution to this crisis. 
One thing that is clear to me after my recent visit is that the United States cannot do for Haiti what it will not do for itself. The Haitians first have to realize the need to solve their political crisis. They have not yet hit rock bottom, and maybe that is what it will take to create the political will to move forward. Unfortunately, I do not yet see the requisite political will and determination in Haiti. 
What complicates matters even more is that there are upcoming national and municipal elections slated for November of 1998 in Haiti. Hundreds of seats are up, including the entire lower Chamber, up to two-thirds of the Senate, and all municipal seats. The problem is, there hasn't been a resolution to the 
irregularities surrounding the previous election, and as the clock continues to tick, we are getting closer and closer to even more elections, including the Presidential election scheduled for the year 2000. 
During my visit, the Haitian political parties made very clear the importance of this November's election. So far, however, the international community has not developed a united or current strategy for this crucial election. I recommended that the administration--our administration--work with the international community to take the following measures: 
One, we must pressure the Haitian Government to allow the international community to take a lead role in the upcoming election; two, we must insist on the establishment of a credible, nonpartisan, competent electoral commission to oversee that crucial election; three, we must insist there be a fair, equitable, and transparent resolution to the numerous controversies resulting from the 1997 electoral fraud; four, we must urge the Haitian Government to reform the electoral and political party laws to level the playing field; five, we must insist on attention to several important technical matters, such as the voter registration list, voter cards, access to state media, and access to state financial resources as stipulated in the Constitution and in the electoral law; six, we must ensure that the police do not become politicized, favoring certain factions or parties at the expense of others; seven, we must encourage a visit by a high-visibility delegation of notable world leaders to go to Haiti and observe the election. This kind of high visibility would help force the Haitian Government to agree to fair and transparent standards for the election. And, finally, we must provide funding for the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute to continue their political-party-building programs in Haiti. 
If the current election impasse is broken, the IRI and NDI will need money to help support the crucial institutional election programs that make for open, democratic elections. 
Unfortunately, several political parties made it clear to me during my visit that they viewed the U.S. Government as strictly aligned with the ruling party of Preval and Aristide, that they are not getting the attention they deserve regarding a resolution to the current crisis. I strongly believe that if we are going to help establish a true democracy in Haiti, we need to stress the importance of political party pluralism in that country. 
Mr. President, in light of these benchmarks, I strongly urge that no U.S. assistance should be used to underwrite the November elections until and unless a settlement of the impasse of the April 6, 1997, elections is reached--and until a fair and independent electoral council is established in accordance with the Haitian Constitution. 
Since 1995, Mr. President, the United States has provided almost $17 million for elections in Haiti. Strangely, of $182 million requested for fiscal year 1999, the Clinton administration has only asked for $900,000 for these upcoming elections. My first reaction to this is that this specific assistance request is simply not enough for this important election. But before we consider ways to sustain and consolidate democracy in Haiti, by building infrastructures and institutions, it is essential to have the first true element of any democracy; that is, the ability to have free and fair elections. Our administration should make the upcoming election a priority and work with the international community to pressure the Haitian Government to have a fair and transparent election. 
Having said that, Mr. President, if the Haitian Government is not willing to make the election a priority and agree to these simple and obvious benchmarks, then there is no use for the United States to administer this kind of assistance for any future election. The money would simply be wasted. We must have a commitment first. We need to know the Haitian Government is serious before we agree to get involved in the election. Our administration should coordinate with other international donors to develop a common front based on agreement to this basic principle. 
Let me turn to Haiti's economy. Haiti is an impoverished country that simply cannot afford further political shenanigans. 
The Haitian economy has experienced dismal growth while experiencing some growth in the underground market--primarily, contraband and drugs. Private investment is absolutely critical if Haiti is going to create new jobs and put an end to the cycle of poverty. Several key things the United States should pursue include: 1, extending trade preferences to the CBI beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act; 2, we should urge the Haitian Government to begin implementation of its long-delayed plan to reduce the civil service; 3, we should urge the Haitian Government to move forward with privatization efforts; 4, we should find ways to empower the chamber of commerce communities in Haiti, particularly those interested in economic development. We must empower these chamber communities; they have a tremendous potential. 
Mr. President, last year the Haitian economy experienced tepid growth of only 1.1 percent in the formal sector--down from 2.7 percent in 1996. The informal, or nontaxed, sector experienced slightly higher growth of 2.2 percent. It is important to note here that this growth is largely due to the tremendous amount of foreign assistance provided by the international donor community. The reality of the Haitian 
economy today is that but for the donor contributions to the economy, the economy would have negative growth during the last several years. 
This slow growth is causing problems for the Government, through increased tax revenues--and the failure to meet Haitians' expectation that Haiti would begin a period of sustained economic growth and job creation in a country with chronically high unemployment and underemployment. While economic growth is slow or nonexistent, it is well known in Haiti that the underground market--primarily contraband and drugs--is on the rise. 
The Preval administration in Haiti is faced with a difficult fiscal situation, compounded by the lack of a fiscal year 1998 budget, suspension of international donor disbursement, and an inability to significantly cut spending. 
The Government has trouble cutting spending because the bulk of Government funds go to pay the large civil service. Other factors include the Central Bank's financing of deficit spending, which has increased significantly in the first quarter of this year, and that is a very scary thought, Mr. President. Further, preliminary Government statistics indicate that tax revenues have dropped during the first quarter of this fiscal year, largely because of a strike in the tax office. 
The Government of Haiti is moving to implement a cash management program that would limit spending to expenditures. But President Preval will face difficulty putting such a program in place, never mind sustaining it, if Government workers press for wage hikes to keep up with inflation. Inflation was roughly 17 percent last year. Price hikes for basic foodstuffs will further impoverish more Haitians and could spark demonstrations against the Preval government in the coming months. 
Now let me turn to the important issue of privatization. 
Though at an extremely low pace, the Government of Haiti has completed the privatization of the country's flour mill, and the privatization of the cement mill will be completed as soon as the new Prime Minister is approved by the Senate. Three other high-priority privatization projects are said to be on track to begin the bidding process later this year--the airport, the seaport, and the telephone company. 
Resources have been made available by the international community to ensure that the bidding process is open and transparent and fair to prospective purchasers. During my recent visit, both U.S. and Haitian officials acknowledged the difficulty that can be expected in privatizing these three projects. The main reason that they will have difficulty, of course, is that these state-owned enterprises, particularly the seaport, are a source of revenue for the Government of Haiti. Furthermore, former Government cronies are allegedly involved in the telephone company. The U.S. Government needs to continue pressuring the Haitians to privatize these facilities. 
But budget balancing and privatization are just the beginning. Private investment is absolutely crucial if Haiti is going to create new jobs and end the cycle of poverty. To attract new investments, I propose the following specific steps: 
One, the United States should extend trade preferences to the CBI beneficiary nations under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. This would tell investors the United States is prepared to help Haiti and other island nations diversify their economies through special tariff breaks. 
Two, the Clinton administration should develop a new loan guarantee initiative for Haiti through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. These loan guarantees would help make small to medium-sized loans available, $10,000 to $100,000, to businesses that are prepared to move to Haiti and start new enterprises. Each job in the assembly sector supports at least another 7 to 10 Haitians and also creates secondary spinoff jobs. 
Three, we must urge the Haitian government to move forward with the privatization of the remaining state owned enterprises; 
Four, we must urge the Government of Haiti to begin immediate implementation of its long-delayed plan to reduce the size of the Haitian civil service. The necessary Haitian laws have been passed to begin this process. Unfortunately, however, the Civil Service Reform Act, which mandates the reduction in the civil service, has a sunset provision which expires this fall. The U.S. Government and the international community need to pressure the Haitian government to implement this important law. Further, $20 million in international assistance is available to underwrite this program. Implementation of this program would be a tangible signal to investors that the Haitian Government wants to work more efficiently. 
Five, we must work with the FAA and Department of Transportation to improve airport facilities and ensure that the airport meets all international safety standards. The airport is a vital access point for tourists and promotes the free flow of Haitians to and from the country. These Haitians help the economy with their remittances, and provide a healthy dialogue with on-island Haitians about the benefits of democracy. The FAA has a number of current concerns about the airport, and is currently addressing them. We must ensure that the airport is operated efficiently and safely, because it is the principal entry and exit point for Haiti. 
Sixth, work with the government to ensure the privatization of the sea port. Mr. President, the sea port is plagued with inefficiency and corruption. It is certainly the most expensive port in this hemisphere to ship into or out of. The port must be privatized and modernized for better efficiently and productivity. I also recommend that the Clinton Administration urge the Haitian government to privatize other ports in Haiti as well. 
Seven, find ways to empower the Chamber of Commerce communities in Haiti, particularly in the secondary cities. The Chamber of Commerce in Cap Haitien, for 
example, is energized--and is working with the local mayor and government to further develop the city. Mr. President, compared to Port-au-Prince, Cap Haitien almost felt like a different country. It's the attitude that was different. For instance, the business community is eagerly seeking foreign investors, and in fact have already been able to secure some investment. Currently, there are two cruise lines which occasionally visit Cap Haitien. The Haitians on the street welcomed us. I remember one elderly woman who came up to our delegation and said: `God bless you. I am so happy you are here. You give us hope.' They want tourists. They want people to come in. Findings ways to work with and encourage Haitians in areas such as Cap Haitien, where their willingness is more visible than in Port au Prince, is something we should pursue.  
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. President, let me now turn to one particular economic sector that is especially crucial to Haiti's future, and that is agriculture. 
Amazingly, tragically Haiti imports two thirds of its food. Every day, thousands of Haitians leave rural areas where they are unable to provide for themselves and flood into the cities which are unable to sustain the population pressures. Right now, approximately 20 percent of Haiti's population lives in Port au Prince. The rest live in secondary cities and the countryside. If this trend continues unchecked, Haiti will not be able to alleviate poverty and starvation. In the long run, agricultural and rural development is critical to the goal of Haiti providing jobs, income and food for its population. 
Agriculture production is extremely low for many reasons. 
Topsoil has eroded because most of the trees are harvested for charcoal--the major source of Haitian fuel. 
Technical skills are lacking--skills as basic as soil conservation techniques, tree planting, and caring for animals. 
Basic technology is lacking--including soil and water conservation techniques, tree grafting for higher quality products, crop improvement and improving the genetic base of crops. 
Rural infrastructure is deficient. Farmers do not have access to capital or credit, and little access to seeds, saplings 
and fertilizers. 
Delivery mechanisms, including market access and techniques are inadequate and need to be developed. 
During my visit, I was encouraged by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Productive Land Use System Program or PLUS Program. To increase output, PLUS works directly with farmers to improve techniques in the fields. These activities are undertaken in collaboration with Haitian farmers. The program deals with the environmental problem through the farmers' own self-interest. This kind of assistance is what works best. This partnership has been a success for local Haitian farmers and should be continued. 
In addition, I believe Haiti's strategies for development should focus on the preservation and reclamation of the natural resource base. Linking production and income generation with resource conservation and management activities is being done by field teams that reach farmers through the grass roots. This is similar to our own very successful cooperative extension program in the U.S. We do it better than anybody else. We are now trying to export it and are exporting it to Haiti. This is a good example of something that should be expanded throughout Haiti. 
To further develop the rural and agricultural sectors of Haiti, attention needs to be given to a decentralized development strategy. I believe that continued focus on nongovernmental organizations is appropriate. I believe that we should be promoting regional development and that associations linking private sector interests with local government need to be established. One way to do this is to link our own successful foundations and institutions of higher education such as Ohio State University together with local Haitian interested in pursuing this goal. 
The Haitian farmers I met understood that the sound environmental practices and productive agricultural and marketing techniques led to an improved standard of living. If we can help them expand these techniques, they can make the staying in the rural areas more attractive and stem the current tide of urban migration. 
AID has also been working to help establish marketing cooperatives. One such cooperative is Servi Coop. which has allowed some Haitian cocoa farmers to have a new market for their goods. Historically, Haitian farm prices have been keep down because farmers have only had one ultimate 
export source to sell their products to. This AID program is attempting to change that and to create competition. When they have competition, they bid up the price and Haitian farmers have already begun to see in certain areas that type of improvement in their prices. 
U.S. TROOPS 
Let me talk about the 475 that we have currently stationed in Haiti. Their mission is twofold. First, to provide a visible presence for stabilization. Second, to receive real-life training for readiness--training that can prove extremely beneficial in wartime. 
Through humanitarian and civil operations, our troops have built infrastructure and have medically treated thousands of Haitians. Their presence has had a positive impact in Haiti. Their presence, their mission, should continue. 
While in Haiti last week, I had the opportunity to visit with our troops. As I said, there are currently 475 of them--down from approximately 2,000 troops in 1996. This year's troop levels will likely range between 475 and 600 on any given day, depending on the number of military personnel at any given time temporarily deployed to Haiti to perform the various humanitarian and civic operations. 
Our troops engage in a variety of operations. Just in the last two years, U.S. troops have built or restored approximately 13 miles of roads, repaired or renovated 36 schools, dug 23 wells, and restored a University Hospital. They have treated over 50,000 Haitians and have trained over 200 Haitian health care providers. 
The goals for our troop this year include: continued humanitarian and civic operations, such as medical and infrastructure building; and port call visits. One new project our military will undertake is building a maritime operation center in Jacmel to be used by the Haitian Coast Guard. Because of Jacmel's strategic location as a potential drug transit area, this facility will be very helpful for counter-narcotics operations. By the end of this fiscal year, U.S. troops will have renovated or built two other schools, distributed over a million dollars in medical supplies, and treated over 18,000 Haitians.  
Our military presence there has had a profound and positive impact. Our troops repeatedly told me, as I talked to them, that they feel useful and generally feel safe. While significant violence is still taking place among Haitians, the U.S. troops that I talked to told me the Haitians understand their presence and, by and large, welcome them there. 
Further, the military officers that I talked to, our men and women, told me they have generally found no substantiated evidence of targeting of U.S. forces in Haiti. The vigilantes--those who take justice into their own hands and engage in serious violence through gangs--have apparently not targeted U.S. forces. 
Because the conditions in Haiti are so bad, our troops say that the humanitarian and civic work they do is having a tremendous impact, both on Haiti and on their own training. I was told a story by a U.S. military nurse in Haiti who recently treated a child who had conjunctivitis. The little girl was close to losing her eyesight. If it had remained untreated for 2 weeks, the doctors told me, she would have lost her eyesight. The nurse in this case, U.S. military nurse, treated this little girl with eyedrops which saved the girl's vision. The American nurse told us: `I feel useful every day. I feel like I'm doing something.' 
She is not alone. Thousands and thousands of U.S. citizens travel every year to Haiti to provide humanitarian assistance. When I arrived in Haiti 2 weeks ago, the morning I arrived our troops informed me that several of their key personnel were at that very moment involved in a medical emergency involving U.S. citizens. Three U.S. missionaries had just been in a very serious car accident. A U.S. civilian policeman overheard reports of the accident on his two-way radio and was able to get a helicopter to pick up the individuals and transport them to a medical facility at the American base. 
As I arrived that morning at the base, I saw one of the individuals literally being carried into an ambulance to be taken to the operating table. An hour later, during lunch that day, a soldier from Ohio, with whom I was eating lunch, told me he had helped treat the Americans, these American missionaries. He gave me an update on their condition. It was abundantly clear that our troops had saved the lives of these missionaries. This limited U.S. military presence is having a profound positive effect. If we maintain this limited mission then, in my view, our troops' presence should continue for the time being. 
The best news in Haiti, though--in addition to our troops who are there and the great work they are doing--the other good news in Haiti comes from the good works of thousands of individuals who are working to make a difference in the daily lives of Haitians. I met many innovative Haitians who were passionate about improving life in Haiti. They are not part of the Government, they are private citizens. And they have been joined by people from around the world who work in every aspect of society. They help the poor, the orphaned, the starving, the elderly, and the sick. It has been an inspiration to visit these people on my trips to Haiti and to visit their projects. 
Let me just talk about a couple. In 1980, Dr. Guy Theodore, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, founded a health clinic in Pignon to serve a poor rural Haitian community. Through Dr. Theodore's leadership, hard work, and his determination, the clinic has now one of Haiti's most successful 
comprehensive help and development programs. The hospital serves 150,000 people and provides health services, women's literacy programs, credit programs, an innovative water and sanitation program, and environmental and community development programs. 
It was here when we were traveling out in the country that we happened to meet a group of doctors from Fargo, ND. The eight men and women who traveled there traveled at their own expense. They raised $20,000--enough money to send them and their equipment to Haiti for a week of surgery and medical work. They were giving their time to make a difference to many suffering people. 
In Cap Haitien, we met three nurses from Georgia who were working through Emory University. They told me about the work they were doing, training local people about basic health and sanitation, and they encouraged me to urge other American universities to consider cooperative ventures to train more Haitians in these important works. One nurse whom I talked to had been coming to Haiti and working in Haiti for 17 years. 
On a previous trip, in the town of Lescayes, we met Father William Konicki, who gave us a tour of his home for the elderly. People who had nowhere to sleep, nothing to eat, people who were sick and disabled, they all found a place to live and be safe with Father Konicki. Without Father Konicki's tremendous efforts to make something out of nothing, these elderly people would have starved to death. 
Some of the most difficult stories have to do with Haiti's orphans. Because of extreme poverty, high premature death rates among adults, parents, and AIDS, thousands of Haiti's children have been orphaned or abandoned. Many end up in places that provide no more than shelter. The children come malnourished and diseased. Often the only food these children eat comes from the U.S. Public Law 480 title II feeding program. Last year, the administration announced a plan to phase out the part of this program that served orphans, the elderly, and individuals with AIDS. 
Through legislation, I worked closely with appropriators in Congress to secure funding for fiscal year 1998 at the same level as fiscal year 1997. I will continue to fight for this money for these children. It is the only food many of them have. If this money is not approved, we will literally be taking away the only food these children have to eat. 
These are pictures of the food ration that our Public Law 480 actually provides. This may not look too appetizing to us in the United States, but this is a meal that provides these children--they get one meal a day--it provides them with a well balanced, nourishing meal. It allows them to be healthier, frankly, than most children are in Haiti. That is what that Public Law 480 funds provide. There are tens of thousands of children like this in Haiti. 
There are many caring adults who run the orphanages I have referred to. Mr. President, 67-year-old Sister Veronique, a Haitian-born nun whom I have gotten to know and my wife has gotten to know over the last few years, picks up abandoned babies from the hospital every time that she has an open bed. These are children who are about ready to die. Many times they are not true orphans, they are brought into the hospital when people are so poor they bring the children in--they try to keep them at home, but then when they know they are about ready to die or think they cannot keep them any longer or they will 
die, they bring them into the hospital. What Sister Veronique does is, she goes to the hospital every time she has an open bed, she picks up another baby, and takes that baby back to her orphanage and tries to keep that baby alive. There are many, many success stories. Many of these children do, in fact, make it because of what Sister Veronique does. 
Another nun, Sister McGonagle, from San Diego, spends 6 months of every year raising moneys for the Kenscoff Orphanage, where she works the rest of the year. Father Stra, from Italy, a Salesian priest, provides shelter for homeless boys and training programs for street children. We also met an American couple who bring Haitian orphans into their own home in Port au Prince, hoping to find permanent homes for these children later in the United States. 
I am pleased that our United States Agency for International Development mission in Haiti is working to develop a local association of people to advocate for children and serve as a network for orphanages, so as to be able to share ideas and resources. This is an important idea and one that we should encourage and continue. 
Let me say that after five visits to Haiti, I can assure my colleagues in the Congress that we have, working for the U.S. Government, a number of very dedicated people in AID, a number of very dedicated and talented people at our Embassy as well. 
In conclusion, we should be clear. Haiti's democracy is not stable; it is in its infancy. As Americans, we find it hard to imagine a country that is not even able to hold elections. But the electoral fraud over Haiti's national and municipal elections last April, that cloud over those elections in which only 5 percent of the population even bothered to cast ballots, has brought government there to a halt. 
There has been a political impasse since last June, when President Rosny Smarth resigned. In fact, it seems that all the key players, the Haitian Government and the other parties, have decided not to resolve this crisis. 
That is why this weekend's visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is so critical. I understand she intends to meet with the two Lavalas parties, which I think is necessary. However, I am surprised to hear that she has no plans to meet with the other opposition parties. I think that is a mistake. It is critical that she meet with the other parties as well. This will encourage their participation in the next elections, and keep them involved in the national political dialogue and will send a signal to the current Government of Haiti of what true political pluralism really means. 
Until this political impasse has been resolved, we should not be pledging any kind of financial support for future elections. Indeed, our Haiti policy must be something more than a blank check. Without specific measurable goals, monetary aid to Haiti is an unguided assistance program in search of a policy. It seems to me that we must export our ideas along with our aid. It will take more than just money to bring stability to Haiti; it will require a comprehensive plan and Haitian political will. Without these key elements, all the money in the world will not do any good in Haiti. 
I think it is clear that the United States needs to work with the international community, develop a coherent and well-planned strategy, and together pressure the Haitian Government to first resolve the current political crisis. Furthermore, before Haiti can prosper--both democratically and economically--the government must address--and make a commitment to--three key factors: (1) hold free and transparent elections; (2) combat the increasing threat of drugs; and (3) reform the `broken' judiciary. 
I have suggested that in these three key areas--which do not currently receive significant funding from the United States; it is a relatively small amount of money that we put in Haiti--that increased funding should be considered if certain benchmarks are met as I have outlined. Current budget request figures for these three areas do not exceed $10 million, a relatively small part of the total Haitian commitment. These priority areas though are essential and our administration should pay close attention. We must pay close attention to whether the Haitians are willing to address these three specific problems: hold free and transparent elections; combat the increasing threat of drugs; and reform the broken judiciary. Unless they are addressed, it is very hard to see how any real democratic progress and economic development can possibly ever take hold in Haiti. 
In two of these priority areas--politial and judicial reform--we must find ways to work with the government. We have no choice. Simply, it will take political will by the Haitian Government to achieve any progress in this areas. Let me make it clear: The United States cannot and should not make an investment in these areas without a clear commitment from the Haitian Government. 
As I mentioned before, we can't do for the Haitians what they cannot and will not do for themselves. The political will must exist. 
However, Mr. President, there are areas where we can't stand by and wait for the Haitian Government to act. There are ways that the United States can work around the government to provide a semblance of hope for the Haitian people and some stability to that country. These areas include agriculture reform, feeding programs, and other areas of humanitarian support. With respect to drugs, here, too, we cannot wait--we must take action now to reduce the flow of drugs through Haiti. It is in our national self-interest. If we do not do that, we risk the entire nation turning into a narcostate with tragic consequences not only for Haiti but for the United States. No doubt, long-term drug control will require greater cooperation with the Haitian Government, but our Government should devote its resources now to respond to the current threat. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues both in the Congress and in the administration to address these priorities, and help create a strategic long-term vision for our policy toward Haiti. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank you personally for your forbearance this morning and this afternoon. I appreciate it very, very much. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my Sense of the Senate Resolution which I have introduced. 
In believe there is a crisis in teacher education in the United States. To me, that means we have to look to new ideas. If we are serious about restoring America as an academic power, I believe that we have to act immediately to find solutions. In the past, education reform has not been bold enough--and our children are suffering very serious consequences. 
Some alarming statistics really brought this home for me: 
36% of those now teaching core subjects--like English, math, science, social studies, and foreign languages--neither majored nor minored in those subjects. 
A study conducted by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future revealed that 
More than one-quarter of newly hired public school teachers in 1991 lacked the qualifications for their jobs, and nearly one-fourth of all secondary teachers did not even have a minor in their main teaching field. 
The Commission also found that 
56% percent of high school students taking physical science were being taught by out-of-field teachers, as were 27% of those taking mathematics and 21% of those taking English. 
This is bad enough--but there's also evidence that the least qualified teachers were most likely to be found in high-poverty and predominantly minority schools, and in lower-track classes. In fact, in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students had less than a 50% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who held a license and a degree in the field he or she taught. 
This is a prescription for disaster on a truly national scale. With this failure of investment in properly trained teachers, we should not be surprised that students are doing so poorly on standardized tests. After all, if the teacher does not understand the subject he or she is teaching, then certainly the students will not learn what they need to know. 
It is inexcusable that a country that leads the world in so many ways does not give its children the best academic resources available. The truth is, the United States will not remain a world leader unless we make a commitment to invest more in teacher quality--and soon. 
I am encouraged that we have bipartisan interest in reforming the education system. However, we must address the problem of quality teachers before we merely reduce class size and hire 100,000 new teachers. 
The answer, in my view, is to only certify quality teachers--and furthermore, to get the quality teachers to teach our neediest kids. All children, from K to 12th grade, deserve the chance to have well-educated, qualified teachers who will help them reach the limits of their academic potential. 
I have introduced legislation that would provide assistance for the creation of teacher training facilities across the United States that will help train teachers who are either already in the classroom, or about to enter the teaching profession. While it is important to stem the tide of unqualified teachers reaching the classroom, we must also focus on helping teachers that are already in the classroom and need assistance in becoming the best teachers that they can be. 
The Teacher Quality Act is common-sense legislation that will assist school districts in their struggle to maintain the highest possible academic standards for their children. The idea for this legislation developed out of my admiration for the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Mayerson Academy was established in 1992 as a partnership between the Cincinnati business community and its schools. Its mission is to provide the highest quality training and professional development opportunities to the men and women responsible for educating the children of Cincinnati. 
We also need to tap into the expertise of people who have a lot to offer our children, but who haven't trained specifically to be teachers. I have introduced legislation that will expand and improve the supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers, by helping States develop and implement programs for alternative certification or licensure of teachers. 
The Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act will give people who would like to teach a chance to do so. These are people who can serve as mentors and role models--real-life examples of how a good education can make a huge positive difference in a student's future. 
We need to bring the best possible people into America's classrooms--people who can inspire kids with their knowledge and experience. That's what this bill would accomplish. 
When it comes to education, our national task is clear: We have to develop an education system that will draw the best and brightest students into the teaching profession. The States need to be encouraged to provide incentives for people to become teachers, and restore a sense of pride to this profession. 
Without strong teachers, our children will continue to struggle. But if we start attracting the best possible people into the classroom, there's really no limit to what our young people can achieve. 
Please join me in voting for this Resolution so that we can begin a concerted focus on teacher quality in this country.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about the implementation of the immigration laws that Congress passed in 1996, since we are fast approaching an important deadline. Today is the deadline for those immigrants who have lived in the United States for one year who wish to apply for political asylum. 
The concerns I raised and shared during the debate on the 1996 Immigration bill are even more relevant today. People who have the most credible asylum claims--those under threat of retaliation, those suffering physical or mental disability, possibly as a result of torture they endured in their home country--may find themselves barred from ever applying for asylum if they miss this deadline. 
To protect those who flee persecution and abuse and seek refuge in the United States, the INS should, at the very least, promulgate a final rule that includes the broad `good cause' exceptions from the Senate-passed version of the 1996 immigration law. Senators Kennedy, Feingold, and I sent a letter on February 12, 1998 to INS urging that the final rule include the Senate's more expansive definition of `good cause' exceptions for missing that deadline. 
The INS should not issue regulations that might exclude the very applicants that the concept of asylum was meant to include. For this reason, our letter urges INS to promulgate a final rule that adopts the Senate's entire definition of `good cause' for missing the one-year filing deadline: 
`Good cause' may include, but is not limited to, [1] circumstances that changed after the applicant entered the United States and that are relevant to the applicant's eligibility for asylum; [2] physical or mental disabilities; [3] threats of retribution against the applicant's relatives abroad; [4] attempts to file affirmatively that were unsuccessful because of technical defects; [5] efforts to seek asylum that were delayed by the temporary unavailability of professional assistance; [6] the illness or death of the applicant's legal representative; or [7] other extenuating circumstances as determined by the Attorney General. [Section 193 of Senate bill; *numbers added for reference]. 
Mr. President, the very least our country should offer these victims of persecution, are clearly and fairly stated exceptions to this one-year filing deadline. 
My second concern is that the implementation of the summary exclusion or expedited removal provisions of the new immigration law may prove to be even more harmful to those who flee from persecution and seek refuge in the United States. When this bill was being debated in 1996, Senator Leahy and I sponsored an amendment that would have limited such expedited removal procedures to only emergency situations. While that amendment passed by one vote in the Senate, it unfortunately did not survive in conference. 
I said in May of 1996, and I still believe today, that victims of politically motivated torture and rape are the very ones who are most likely to have to resort to the use of false documents to flee from repressive governments--yet the use of such fraudulent documents subjects them to summary exclusion under the 1996 law. 
I also remain concerned that while the INS may instruct its inspectors not to assess the credibility of an asylum claim--but instead refer the claim to an asylum officer--who can say how this process is actually being implemented nationwide at all of our 260 ports of entry? Other outside agencies are not permitted to monitor this process. Some credible cases 
are being assessed at secondary inspection sites by INS officials who are not trained asylum officers. As a result, I urge the Attorney General to appoint someone from her office to oversee the functioning of secondary inspection sites to ensure that anyone stating a fear of persecution or abuse is not forced onto the next plane back to his or her persecutors.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1998, which reauthorizes the very successful Local Law Enforcement Grant Program. This program gives local governments the resources to fight crime, without the `Washington knows best' strings attached. I believe it is a mistake for Washington to try to micromanage how local communities spend their law enforcement dollars. Instead Washington should play the role of partner with local law enforcement to improve the tools they use to fight crime. 
My views on this issue are based on more than 20 years of experience in the criminal justice system: as a prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio; in the Ohio State Senate; as a United States Congressman on the Judiciary Committee; as Lieutenant Governor overseeing anti-crime and anti-drug efforts; and now, as a member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have had an opportunity to work on criminal justice issues from the local, state, and federal levels, and have been fortunate to see firsthand what Congress can do to help local communities be victors in the war on crime. 
Because 90 percent of all criminal prosecution is local, the fight against crime will be won or lost by local law enforcement, local prosecutors and courts, and concerned citizens in every community. I believe the best way for the federal government to help local communities fight crime is to return more money to those communities, because in the final analysis, it is they who will get the job done. For too long the Federal Government has had all the money--and local communities all the crime. Local communities know what works--and they should have the resources. 
From 1999-2003, this Act authorizes $750 million each year for direct grants to local law enforcement to reduce crime and improve public safety. Distributions are made by the Bureau of Justice Assistance on a formula basis, directly to local governments. Grants may include, but are not limited to, equipment and law enforcement personnel, enhancing school security measures, violent offender adjudication, drug courts, crime prevention programs and youth intervention programs. 
One of the most frequent uses of this grant money in Ohio, and by local law enforcement across the country, has been for crime fighting technology. I believe there is a critical need to modernize the crime fighting tools used by local law enforcement, who have been fighting increasingly sophisticated criminals with outmoded tools. That's why I am expressly providing that funds may also be used for information and identification technology, such as criminal history information, fingerprint dissemination, and DNA and ballistics tests. 
Let me underscore here that this Act leaves to local governments the decision regarding what their funding priorities should be, while at the same time requiring accountability as to how funds are ultimately used. Local advisory boards also have an opportunity to recommend how monies are spent as well. These funds will help local law enforcement meet the critical local needs, by letting them put the resources where they are needed most.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a major threat to the life and health of countless Americans. I am referring to the alcohol-impaired drivers on our roads. 
Madam President, as part of the Senate's action on the highway bill, we passed an extremely valuable measure that would save many of these precious lives. Through the amendment offered by myself and my colleague from New Jersey, who is on the floor now, we said that if a person's blood contains .08 percent alcohol or higher, that person is not fit to drive. 
This Lautenberg-DeWine amendment, passed this body by a very wide margin. I rise this afternoon because there is a rising tide of disinformation being spread about this .08 legislation. This misinformation campaign is funded in large part by the alcoholic beverage industry. 
I strongly believe that as we move this measure forward through the legislative process, we all must be guided by the facts. The facts are simple: All widely accepted studies indicate that the blood alcohol standard should be set at .08 BAC. `BAC,' of course, stands for `blood alcohol content.' At .08 BAC, individuals simply should not be driving a car. 
The risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each increase in the blood alcohol content level of an individual. But when a driver reaches or exceeds the .08 blood alcohol content level, the risk rises very rapidly. 
At .08 a driver's vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, judgment, and self-control are seriously impaired. Moreover, at .08, critical driving tasks--concentrated attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear changing and lane tracking--are also all negatively affected. 
The alcohol industry, in arguing against the .08 standard, claims that `only' 7 percent of fatal crashes involve drivers with blood alcohol content levels between .08 and .09. Well, let us look at what that really means. If we take their own statistics, if we use the 1995 figures, that means that approximately 1,200 Americans died because of alcohol, drivers impaired at the levels of .08 and .09--1,200 lives were lost. 
Madam President, that obviously is too many. Changing the blood alcohol standard to .08 could have saved these lives. 
Let me talk now about the tragic consequences of .08 alcohol driving for some real Americans. 
State trooper Steven Blue of Toledo, OH, arrested a young woman who was driving at a blood alcohol level of .15. She was convicted and spent the mandatory 3 days under Ohio law in jail. Madam President, 8 months later the same officer arrested the same person again. This time she was driving with a blood alcohol content level of .085. The officer wanted to charge her with impaired driving, driving under the influence, but her defense attorney argued that because the per se standard in Ohio is .10, the charge should be knocked down to reckless operation. 
Now, of course, Madam President, in Ohio, as in most States, if you are below .10 but still seriously impaired, you can be charged with driving under the influence. In fact, the Ohio law reads, as most States do, `appreciably impaired.' So even if you test at .10, technically you can be charged with this offense, but as a practical matter, the standard is .10, pure and simple. 
In this case, regrettably, the prosecutor felt compelled to reduce the charges. If these charges had not been reduced, if they had gone ahead with the original charge of driving under the influence, the young woman would have spent 10 days in jail, and maybe, just maybe, that would have turned her life around and at least warned her off from further alcohol-impaired driving. 
But that did not happen. She then moved to San Diego, and 2 years later Trooper Blue got a call from a law firm asking him for his testimony about his earlier arrests of the same young woman. You see, she had taken up drunk driving again. Driving the wrong way down a one-way street, she killed two people. 
Madam President, the State trooper, Steven Blue, has to deal with the real-life consequences of .08 alcohol driving. So did I when I was a local county prosecutor in Greene County, OH, dealing with mangled bodies and devastated relatives of people who died much too soon. 
But you don't have to be a State trooper or county prosecutor to understand a simple fact: .08 drivers kill people. No amount of propaganda can obscure that fact. That is why in this morning's Washington Post an editorial calls our .08 measure `a most reasonable and effective measure to curb deadly drunk driving.' The Washington Post is not alone in praising this bill. The Austin American-Statesmen from Austin, TX, the Baltimore Sun, Omaha World Herald, Toledo Blade, New York Newsday, and many, many other papers have all endorsed this legislation. 
Madam President, this measure will save lives. That is why I will continue to fight for its enactment all the way through this legislative process. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from New Jersey for an excellent statement and for his long-time dedication to this very important issue. The point he makes he makes very well. We are dealing with real people here. Sometimes when we come to the Senate floor, we don't know the consequences of our actions. But this is a case when we came here and the Senate passed, by a very, very substantial margin, this amendment and put it into the ISTEA bill. We knew what the consequences were. As I said at the time, before the vote, this is one of the few times when you can come to the Senate floor and know that if you cast a yes vote as a Member of the U.S. Senate, that yes vote is going to save lives. You will never 
know whose life will be saved, but you can be assured that hundreds and hundreds of people will live because of that law that is getting ready to be passed that you were voting on. The majority of the Members of the Senate, by a big margin, did in fact agree with that. 
I would like to, as I did a moment ago, focus on individuals and on real stories. I did that a moment ago when I talked about the woman who had been convicted of DUI in the State of Ohio and tested at a high level. The same highway patrol officer arrested her again a few months later. This time, she tested `only' .08. Under Ohio law, the prosecutor did not feel they could go forward with the DUI, so she was ultimately charged with reckless operation. Then, of course, the tragic end to that story, as I related a moment ago, is that it wasn't too long after that when she showed up in San Diego, and this time deaths occurred as a result of her drinking and driving, and the family had to suffer that horrible, horrible tragedy. 
Let me tell another story, and this is true. This happened a couple of weeks ago. Just a couple of weeks ago in Ohio, on March 1, in Montgomery County, OH, a Dodge Ram pickup truck collided with the rear of a stopped Honda Prelude. The Dodge Ram rode up right on top of the Honda and turned over on its side. The Honda was pushed forward into traffic, where it hit a sheriff's cruiser that was stopped in traffic. The sheriff's cruiser was pushed forward, and it hit a Chevrolet C10 van. 
How can one car hit another car--a stopped car--so fast that it rides up on top of it and tips over? The answer is simple: The driver of the Dodge Ram was impaired, in this case, with a blood alcohol level of .76. 
Mr. President, the risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each increase in the blood alcohol level. When a driver reaches or exceeds a .08 blood alcohol level, the risks rise very, very rapidly. They take off at about that point. At .08 a driver's vision, his or her balance, reaction time, hearing, judgment, self-control, are all seriously impaired; critical driving tasks, like concentrated attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear changing, and lane tracking, are also negatively affected. 
That is why the driver of this Dodge Ram piled on top of a stopped car and caused a four-car pileup that led to the summoning of emergency medics. Just another example, another unnecessary casualty, of a blood alcohol limit that is simply too high. 
Let me relate to the Members of the Senate several other true stories. We talked in the last several days to another highway patrolman in Ohio, Barry Call of Gallipolis, OH. He has been a highway patrolman for 6 years and has seen about a dozen cases where the driver was clearly impaired but could not be charged because they tested `only' between .07 and .09 on the breathalyzer. 
Trooper Barry Call, in one case, saw a car pulling left of center a couple of times and pulled over the driver. The driver was clearly impaired, and she should not have been behind the wheel of a car. Her breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol level of .084. 
Another example: Trooper Richard Donley of Wilmington, OH, has seen fatalities in cases where drunk driving was a factor and the blood alcohol level was .06, .07, or .08. Sadly, says Trooper Donley, the courts, as a matter of practice, generally 
will throw out any DUI charge under .10, because the reality is that when you set your level, whether it be .08 or 10, or, as it was many years ago, .15, while the law says that if you hit that level and you test that, under most State laws it is a per se violation in and of itself. That level, at the same time, also really sets the standard. So anything below that, even if the officer observes very erratic driving, even if the person fails the sobriety test--what they call `field test' out on the road--the reality is that those cases are very difficult to win if the driver does not test over that limit. And so that limit really becomes the standard of the State. 
As my colleague from New Jersey pointed out so very well, when we say .08, what we have to understand is that an average male, a male of 165 pounds, would have to consume over four beers in an hour on an empty stomach. I think most of us know from our own experience that if we have four beers in an hour on an empty stomach, we absolutely have no business being behind the wheel of an automobile. We know that--absolutely. 
Another way of looking at it is to ask a question: If you were at a party--maybe some people were at your house--and you observed a friend of yours have four beers in an hour on an empty stomach, and didn't eat anything, would you put your 5-year-old daughter in the car and let him take her out to get an ice cream cone or something? We all know what the answer to that would be. It would be a very foolish and reckless person that would do that. No one would do that. No one in their right mind would do that. 
So we know from our own experience that that person who tested .08 simply should not be behind the wheel of a car. What the Senate did, and what I hope the Congress will do, is set this very minimum national standard so that wherever you drive--if you live in Cincinnati, for example, you might be in Kentucky one minute and in Indiana the next minute. We all move around from State to State. If you live in this area, you might be in Washington, DC, and then Virginia, and then Maryland. We move around. There will be some minimum standard so a driver and passengers can be assured that it will be illegal for a driver who is coming at them or who is on the other side of the road to test over .08, no matter where they are, on what road, anyplace in these great 50 States. 
Let me give some more personal testimonies or examples. We have talked to Ken Betz, whom I have known for a number of years in many capacities. He is now the director of the Coroner's Office in Montgomery County, OH. Of the 36 alcohol-related driving fatalities his office has seen in just the past year, seven of these involved drivers who had a blood alcohol content of .08 or less. I will repeat that. In Montgomery County, OH, there were 36 alcohol-related driving fatalities in the last year. Of those 36, seven of them involved drivers who had a blood alcohol content of .08 or less. 
One driver lost control of his car late at night and was killed. His blood alcohol level was .06. Another driver was killed when he ran into the back end of a stopped construction truck. His blood alcohol level was under .06. Another person was driving a motorcycle and turned left into an oncoming Ford Mustang. He wasn't wearing a helmet. He was killed. His blood alcohol content was .07. Another driver went off the right side of the road, down into a culvert. He and a passenger were both killed. His blood alcohol level was .07. 
These are actual cases from Montgomery OH, in the 
last year. 
Another driver lost control and struck several steel poles before plowing into a stopped car. He was killed. His blood alcohol level was .08. 
Mr. President, people who drive at a .08 blood alcohol level are clearly impaired. There is absolutely no doubt about it. The risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each increase in the blood alcohol level, beginning at .01. But when a driver reaches or exceeds the .08 blood alcohol level, the risk rises very, very rapidly. At .08, a driver's vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, judgment, and self-control are all seriously impaired. 
It is interesting, Mr. President, as this debate continues, and as we read some of the information that is put out by the alcohol industry. They can't really seriously cite or argue that anyone who tests .08 is not appreciably impaired in their reaction time, in their concentration, in their judgment. No one can say that. We all know that for a fact. 
Moreover, at .08, critical driving tasks like concentrated attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear changing, and lane tracking are all affected. 
The Senate overwhelmingly passed our legislation. I hope the whole Congress will pass it. It would help America crack down on these impaired drivers and make our roads safer for our children and for our families. That is why I will continue to fight for this lifesaving measure throughout the legislative process.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Health Care Quality Research Improvement Act. We have been hearing a great deal recently about the quality of health care in this country. Most of the debate, both here in Congress and back home in our States, has been driven, at least in part, by a fear among consumers that efforts to control costs and move people into managed care has compromised quality. This fear has driven legislation such as the bill we passed just last year to provide for 48-hour maternity stays. This year a whole host of health care quality bills have been introduced in the Congress. Even more such legislation has been moving forward at the State level as well. 
As I have learned more and more about the concerns about the quality of health care, I have tried to focus particular attention on children, how their health care is delivered and whether its quality has been compromised. Frankly, I have learned something that I find very interesting. 
While the drive to improve quality and reduce cost has driven a great deal of new research over the past several years, relatively little has been done for children in this area. While we are getting better at measuring quality of health care for adults, we have made little such progress for our children. 
Between 1993 and 1995, only some 5 percent of the health services research study outcomes focused on our children. This is highly alarming because I frankly cannot think of anything more critical to our Nation's future than the quality of our children's health. Clearly we need to correct this serious lack of good health care quality measures. 
I have spoken with experts in the field of pediatric research and they agree with this assessment. They tell me that we have to do more in this field if we expect to improve the care that our children receive. Many times, frankly, we don't know exactly which treatments are cost effective or best improve a child's quality of life. We don't know how to manage children's complicated health problems in ways that will allow them to lead normal lives 
We can answer many of these questions if the patient is an adult, but we have far fewer answers for our children. Here is one example. One study recently found that children have three times greater chance of dying after heart surgery at some hospitals than they have at other hospitals--three times. We must fix this. That means we have to find out why, why one hospital loses three times as many children as another. As both a parent and a grandparent, I can speak from firsthand experience about the stress and the uncertainty that goes along with any childhood illness. To think that a parent's choice of a hospital could actually be harmful to a child is certainly a very scary thought for a parent. 
Another example is asthma. Asthma is the most common chronic health condition in children, affecting 5 million children in this country, and that percentage, tragically, is rising. We are not sure why this has been happening, but we do know that the quality of health care a child receives can dramatically affect the severity of his or her asthma. As a result, the better the quality of health care, the less time that child spends in the hospital, the fewer visits to the emergency room, and the less time a child has to miss from school. If we do not even know what kinds of treatment work best for children or that different treatments work better in different environments, we cannot help. 
We certainly can't begin to debate how to improve quality if we can't even define it or measure it. For that, we need to conduct research in real world settings. 
As a means of getting this research into real world settings and improving the quality of health care that our children receive, I am introducing a bill today entitled the Child Health Care Quality Research Improvement Act. This legislation was developed with the help of leaders in the pediatric community, child advocates, and health services researchers. My bill takes a three-pronged approach to address this issue: One, focusing on training; two, research; and three, data collection for child health outcomes and effectiveness research. 
Let me start with the first one. 
In order for us to make advances in the study of pediatric health outcomes, it is essential that we have researchers who have received training in this field. This bill I am introducing today promotes research training programs in child health services research at the doctoral, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. By bringing professionals into this very important field, we can ensure that issues that affect the lives of children are receiving the attention they deserve. 
The second component of this bill establishes research centers and networks. The goal of the centers and networks will be to foster collaboration among experts in the field of pediatric health care quality and effectiveness. We envision that these centers and networks will bring together pediatric specialists from children's hospitals, physicians in managed care plans, statisticians from schools of public health, and other experts in the field to work together on research projects and to translate these findings into real-world settings where children are receiving health care. 
Third, and finally, this legislation contains a component that adds supplements to existing national health surveys that are today administered by the National Center for Health Statistics and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition to not knowing how to measure health care quality in children, other data, like that measuring children's use of health care systems and health care expenditures, are lacking. Adding supplements to existing surveys is a very sensible measure. This bill does not require yet another survey to be administered. Rather, it simply adds questions to existing surveys, to allow us to collect valuable data on children. This is the type of information that we need if we want to look at trends in children's health and what we can do to improve their health. 
Mr. President, we are all well aware that children have medical conditions and health care needs that are different from those of adults. It doesn't make sense to do health services research for adults and hope that one size fits all--that the things we learn will make sense for children. Federal support for child health quality and effectiveness research is vital to ensure that children are receiving appropriate health care. We owe it to our Nation's children to train health professionals in this important filed, and to support these very important research initiatives.

Mr. DeWINE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, America's poison control centers do important work--and they need our help. The number of centers has been declining over the last several years. Their funding has been unstable--and this has resulted in the closing of many of them. 
Poison control centers manage poisonings over the telephone, direct those that cannot be managed at home to a local hospital for treatment, provide professional and public education and training, and collect data on poisoning exposures. 
Each year, more than 2 million poisonings are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90% of these poisonings happen in the home--and over fifty percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 years of age. 
By providing expert telephone advice to distraught parents, poisoning victims, and health care professionals, poison control centers decrease the severity of illness and prevent deaths. Let me illustrate the value of poison control centers by telling you about two similar poisoning cases that had very different outcomes. 
In the first case, a 3 year old child swallowed several tablets of aspirin. His mother called the poison control center and was told to give the child syrup of Ipecac (pronounced ip-ah-kak) to make the child vomit before taking him to the emergency room. The boy was examined in the emergency room and sent home. 
In the second case, another toddler swallowed several aspirin while visiting her grandmother's house. Her family was unaware that aspirin can be very dangerous for children, and did not think to call the poison control center. Nine hours later, the child started to have a seizure. When she arrived at the hospital, she was severely ill and nearly died. She spent almost two weeks in the pediatric intensive care unit. 
Mr. President, I can tell you that even after eight children, it's often hard to know exactly what to do in these emergencies. In this kind of situation, poison control centers can save lives. 
They are life-saving--and they are truly cost-effective public health services. For every dollar spent on poison control center services, $7 in medical costs are saved. The average cost from a poisoning exposure call is $31.28, while the average cost if other parts of the health care system are used is $932. 
In spite of their obvious value, poison control centers are seriously under-funded, and the funding situation threatens to get worse. These centers have so far been financed through unstable arrangements involving a variety of public and private sources. 
In Ohio, poison control centers are funded primarily by hospitals, with some funds coming from the State. Ohio's poison control centers are working together to coordinate services and consolidate resources, while they continue to look for stable funding sources. 
Currently, the Federal Government provides 5% of poison control center funding, but reaps most of the cost-savings benefits from poison control center services. It is only fair that the Federal Government pay for its share of the cost burden for poison control center services. This legislation provides Federal dollars to stabilize poison control center funding and improve poison control center services. I have tried to write this legislation so that existing private and state dollars can be leveraged, rather than displaced, by Federal funds. 
Over the last two decades, the instability and lack of funding has resulted in a steady decline in the number of poison control centers in the United States. In 1978, there were over 600 poison control centers; now, there are 75. This trend has jeopardized the capacity of poison control centers to provide equitable services to all Americans. As a result, more people may die, more people may be injured and the costs for treating poisonings may increase. 
For example, in 1991, Louisiana closed its poison center and referred all calls to Alabama. After its closing, Louisiana found that `the cost attributable to unnecessary emergency department visits was more than three times the amount allocated to operate the poison control center each year.' Louisiana also found that medically treated poisonings, those treated in emergency rooms or by physicians, increased 42%. It reopened its poison control center. 
My office has consulted with a number of experts on how we can best improve poison control operations on a national scale, and my legislation contains a number of their suggestions. 
Here's what the bill does. 
It establishes a national toll-free number to ensure that all Americans have access to poison control center services. This number is then automatically routed to the center designated to cover the caller's region. This system will improve access to poison control center services for everyone. It will also simplify efforts to educate parents and the public about what to do in the event of a poisoning exposure and how to do it quickly. 
It begins a nationwide media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention, and advertise the new, nationwide toll-free number. I've seen the great work done by some non-profit groups, and how effective their public health campaigns have been. That's what I'd like to see here. 
It establishes a grant program to stabilize the funding mechanism and prevent certified regional poison control centers from closing. This program will support activities to prevent and treat poisonings; develop standard education programs; develop standard patient management protocols for commonly encountered toxic exposures; improve and expand the poison control data collection system; and improve national toxin exposure surveillance. 
Mr. President, I have always been a supporter of the prevention and treatment services provided by poison control centers. As a member of the Congressional Prevention Coalition, I hope to increase awareness of this very important issue. Federal support for poison control centers will help ensure that all Americans continue to have access to quality poison control center services. 
It will reduce the inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other costly health care services. 
And, most importantly, it will save lives.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin today a discussion on a piece of legislation that I have been working on, and others have been working on, for the past 7 months. I believe this legislation is vitally important to the economic well-being of our country--and I hope the full Senate will have an opportunity to debate this bill in the very near future. 
The legislation that I am referring to is S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
I have come to the floor on a number of occasions in the past to stress the immediate need to reform the Federal job training system. This need increases each day the Congress does not act. 
During the numerous oversight hearings held in the Senate over the last 3 years, we have heard that we face in this country a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly focused job training and job-training-related programs, programs administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack coordination, lack a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, and lack the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize these services; namely, those seeking the training and those businesses seeking to hire them. 
Throughout the hearing process, I have heard that reform is needed because the economic future of our country depends on a well-trained work force. Employers at every level are finding it increasingly difficult to locate and attract qualified employees for high-skilled, high-paying jobs, as well as qualified employees for entry-level positions. 
Let me just give, Mr. President, one example. Right outside the Capital, right outside Washington, DC, in Northern Virginia, there are 19,000 high-tech, high-paying jobs that remain unfilled because individuals lack the skills to fill them. However, even with the shortage of skilled workers in Northern Virginia, you will still hear radio ads during morning drive time urging people to move to North Carolina to fill high-tech jobs down there. 
Ohio faces a similar problem. Manpower, Incorporated recently released a poll which indicated that the Dayton area had a bright future in terms of job growth. Forty-two percent of area companies plan on hiring more manufacturing workers. However, while employers plan to hire, the availability of skilled workers to fill those jobs remains low. A Cleveland Growth Association survey recently showed that employers are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality and availability of skilled labor which may impede their future growth plans. 
According to the Manufacturers Alliance's Economic Report published in January, the mismatch between available jobs and available skilled workers is growing. While wages have increased for those who have the skills in demand, many jobs still go unfilled, and the median duration of unemployment for those who 
lack the skills remains at recession levels. 
Nationwide, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs is estimated to be 346,000 people. The increasing labor shortage threatens our Nation's economic growth and our productivity. This, in turn, threatens one of our greatest domestic achievements--the historic welfare reform. 
States and counties under this bill have been given the responsibility of moving people from welfare to work, and this is not an easy task. Many individuals trying to make the transition to work lack the basic skills needed to obtain the available jobs even at the entry level. 
Mr. President, the Senate needs to act. We need to develop a job training system that is flexible, a system that provides individuals who are voluntarily seeking assistance with comprehensive education and training services. 
We need a system that is accountable, assuring that the training provides leads to a meaningful, long-term employment. 
We need a system that provides consumer choice, allowing individuals, not the Government, to choose their education or training provider. 
And, we need a system that is driven at the State and local level, not from Washington, DC. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act that I introduced was approved unanimously--let me repeat, unanimously--by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in September. It represents a belief that we can do better, that we can, in fact, achieve these goals. 
During the committee process, we considered the concerns of various groups who have a stake in this bill--elected officials at the State and local level, the business community, family groups, labor unions, education groups and others. It is my belief that this bill balances all the competing concerns to the best of our ability. 
Today, we are on the verge of replacing the current system of frustration and providing a framework for success. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act embodies the principles that I have just outlined. The programs incorporated in the legislation include job training, vocational education and adult education. Additionally, it provides strong linkages to welfare to work, the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Older Americans Act, Vocational Rehabilitation, veterans programs, Trade Adjustment Assistance, as well as other training-related programs. 
It offers a reborn Federal Jobs Corps program. This reborn Federal Jobs Corps program will linked to local communities for the first time in its 30-year history. 
This bill, in short, is a foundation, a road map to a much better system. 
Mr. President, while separate funding streams will be maintained for each of the activities under this bill, in recognition of their distinct function, States and localities will be empowered with the tools and the flexibility to implement real reform in order to provide comprehensive services to those seeking assistance.

Mr. DeWINE. However, Mr. President, there is opposition to this legislation, opposition that I, frankly, do not understand. For the most part, the opposition is driven by a lack of understanding of this particular piece of legislation and a fear that our schools are going to be turned into `training' facilities that force children into career tracks. 
This is simply not true. This is the last thing--let me repeat, the last thing--that this Member of the U.S. Senate would ever propose, would ever push, would ever write or, frankly, would ever vote for. 
Let me answer now, if I can, the most common questions that have been asked about this bill. 
The first question: Why is vocational education included in the bill? 
Let me try to answer that, and I will. While vocational education mainly serves secondary school students between the 7th and 12th grades, it also provides post-high school vocational services to individuals. Those post-high school services are linked to the training system. The education services provided to 7th and 12th grade students are not linked to the training system. Again, this legislation will not--will not--replace traditional education curricula with job training. 
The reforms that are contained in S. 1186 which affect secondary school students will strengthen vocational education. The students that voluntarily choose to participate in vocational education will receive a strong academic and technical education. The provisions insure that students have the choice, an option, to participate in vocational education. Participation in vocational education under our bill remains voluntary. 
This bill will not set kids on some kind of preordained career track. It just won't happen. 
The next question that has been raised is: Does S. 1186 include national testing? 
Absolutely not, it does not include national testing. This legislation does not authorize national testing. I am opposed to national testing, and I would not introduce legislation that authorizes national testing. 
The next question that has been asked is this: Does this bill, S. 1186, increase the authority of the Federal Government over education? 
Again, the answer is no, absolutely not. S. 1186 eliminates numerous Federal requirements and mandatory set-asides. It gives States and localities the flexibility, the authority and the funding to design their own vocation education systems which provide academic and technological education to secondary and post-secondary students who voluntarily choose to participate.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this month--March 1998--is National Eye Donor Month. The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is simple: It is to alert each and every American family to the terrific opportunity each of us has to make a difference in someone else's life. 
Many Americans don't realize that they have it in their power to give somebody else the ability to see. But it's true. If you declare now that after your passing, you want your eyes to be donated to an eye bank, your eyes can become someone else's gift of sight. 
Mr. President, this is a great opportunity. Indeed, it is a great responsibility--one that all of us should take very, very seriously. 
According to the most recent statistics, over 4,000 Americans are waiting for a corneal transplant--an operation that can restore the gift of sight. These Americans could have this operation today--if only there were enough donated eyes available. 
The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is to remind Americans that we can make those corneas available. Every year, thousands of Americans donate their eyes to eye banks. In 1996, over 87,000 eyes were donated--and over 43,000 transplants were performed. 
Now, these numbers need some explaining. That seems like a pretty substantial disparity. But there's a good reason for it--a very strict screening process that keeps out those who test positive with HIV, those who have hepatitis, and those with unhealthy cells on their corneas. 
Those are just a few of the reasons why many corneas are unsuitable for transplantation. But the corneas from these donors are used. They are used in other very important ways. They are used for research and surgical training, and other medical education. 
It's because of this screening process that I just described that eye transplant operations have such an incredible success rate--over 90 percent. 
This screening process and this rate of success, however, require a greater number of donations. If we could increase the number of eyes donated to eye banks, we could take care of the 4,545 patients who are still waiting for corneal transplants today, as well as the 40,000 people who join their ranks every year. 
Mr. President, as I said, this kind of surgery really works. In the 37 years since the founding of the Eye Bank Association of America, EBBA-member eye banks have made possible over half a million corneal transplants. 
But there simply aren't enough eye donors. The only solution is public education--making the American people aware of what we can do to help out. 
That's what National Eye Donor Month is all about. This month, let's recommit ourselves--as a nation--to giving the gift of sight to our fellow citizens.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, approximately 25 million students are transported to and from school and school-related activities on buses. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has established a series of federal motor vehicle safety standards to assist those responsible for transporting our school children on school buses. 
These features include: clearly distinguishable vehicles with built-in passenger restraint systems; flashing red lights that are activated as students enter and leave the school bus; specially trained drivers; and specially designed routes and schedules to minimize the distance that students need to walk to the bus stop. 
Unfortunately, despite all of these safety features on school buses, more student fatalities and serious injuries occur during the loading and unloading process than occur while students are being transported. 
As my colleagues know, there are mandates relating to school facilities, teacher salaries, computers, and books. However, in most states, there is no mandate that school districts must provide pupils with transportation to and from school. Because of this, many school systems are being forced to seek alternative, cost-effective means of providing transportation services for students, and a growing number of schools are turning to public transit. In 1994 alone, transit buses provided more than 800 million student-related passenger trips and approximately 2 million students rode transit buses to school. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that sending children to school on transit buses is necessarily a bad thing. The fact is that I don't know what this trend means in terms of a child's safety. I do know, however, that students are injured or killed most often when entering or exiting school buses--buses with special safety features designed to prevent such tragedies. Moreover, I know that the US Department of Transportation has conflicting requirements with respect to school transportation. On the one hand, NHTSA requires school buses to meet stringent safety standards and has issued guidelines for covering the operational aspects of pupil transportation safety. On the other hand, the Federal Transit Administration provides funding for transit companies that provide transportation to and from school for students each day on vehicles that do not meet NHTSA's school bus safety standards. 
As more and more schools are forced to decide on cost-saving ways to transport children, schools are forced to make these decisions in a vacuum. We do not know how safe our children are when they board and ride the transit bus to school. After all, we need to know that information when we decide ways for children to get to and from school safely. I've been greatly involved in efforts to improve the safety of school buses--and that effort began with seeking information. I'm proposing that we seek similar information on public transit buses. 
This amendment, would authorize $400,000 for the Secretary of Transportation to study safety issues related to the transportation of school children by various different modes of transportation. I have worked on this amendment with the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and it meets with his approval. I appreciate the assistance of the Senator from Arizona and his staff in this effort. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both sides and I move for its adoption.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, and Senators Warner and Baucus for their work on this transportation reauthorization bill. It is not easy to balance the competing interests in this bill, but I believe the managers of this reauthorization bill have been fair and very accommodating. In short, they have done an excellent job in shepherding this bill through the Senate. 
I would like to bring an issue that is very important to my fellow Ohioans who reside and work in Cuyahoga County to the attention of my friend from Rhode Island. 
In late 1996, the Ohio Department of Transportation submitted a request to the Federal Highway Administration requesting funding approval for the Cuyahoga River Bridge project in Cleveland through the Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality (CMAQ) program. The project would reduce the volume of heavy industrial traffic in Cuyahoga County by nearly one million miles each year, reducing vehicle emissions and removing thousands of vehicles from crowded city streets. Consequently, construction of this bridge is very important to Northeast Ohio's efforts to remain in compliance with air quality standards. By removing large volumes of industrial traffic from city streets, construction of the bridge would also enhance safety and would save significant sums of money by reducing road maintenance costs to municipalities and the State of Ohio. 
Unfortunately, FHWA was not able to approve CMAQ funding for construction of this bridge due to statutory restrictions. In a letter dated February 26, 1997, Jane Garvey, then Acting Administrator of FHWA, stated that, `Because the Cuyahoga River Bridge project involves the construction of a new two-lane bridge that, as proposed, will add capacity for single-occupant vehicles, it does not meet CMAQ criteria for eligibility.' In other words, despite the obvious environmental benefits of having this bridge, CMAQ funds could not be used because it would add capacity for single-occupant vehicles. 
Mr. President, this project is very important to Cleveland, Northeast Ohio, and the State of Ohio. I do not believe that, because it does not fall under a set of strict statutory restrictions, it should be abandoned. Last year, when the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure marked up its ISTEA reauthorization bill, the Committee included language that would allow the Cuyahoga River Bridge to be built using CMAQ funds. This project has broad support and FHWA does not object to the language. 
I see my friend from Rhode Island on the floor and urge my colleague to accept the House language on this issue when this bill goes to Conference.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express some serious concerns about what I believe amounts to a crisis in teacher education in the United States. This year, we will consider the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Therefore, it is appropriate that we not focus on the issue of improving teacher training in the United States. 
We have to look to new ideas and programs--programs that will help restore America as an academic power. I believe that we must act immediately to find solutions for this crisis, because our children are suffering very serious consequences. Today, I will be offering two pieces of legislation that will serve as the first steps in addressing the future of teacher training and teacher certification. 
Before I offer a description of the new legislation, Mr. President, I call my colleagues attention to these alarming statistics: 36% of those now teaching core subjects (English, math, science, social studies, foreign languages) neither majored nor minored in those subjects. A study conducted by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future revealed, and I'm quoting from a summary of the report: 
More than one-quarter of newly hired public school teachers in 1991 lacked the qualifications for their jobs, and nearly one-fourth of all secondary teachers did not even have a minor in their main teaching field. 
The Commission also found that, quote: 
56% percent of high school students taking physical science were being taught by out-of-field teachers, as were 27% of those taking mathematics and 21% of those taking English. The least qualified teachers were most likely to be found in high-poverty and predominantly minority schools and in lower-track classes. In fact, in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students had less than a 50% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who held a license and a degree in the field he or she taught. 
Mr. President, this is a travesty--on a truly national scale. No wonder students are doing so poorly on standardized tests. If the teacher does not understand the subject he or she is teaching, then certainly the students will not learn what they need to know. It is inexcusable that in a country as powerful and wealthy as the United States, that we do not give our children the best academic resources available. The United States will not remain a world leader unless we turn this around, and start preparing our children for the future. 
The process by which we train our teachers needs to be reformed--and I believe that there is a strong bipartisan consensus to support an effort for reform. Recently, I received a memorandum that was signed by members of the Center for Education Reform, Empower America, the Education Leaders Council, Hudson Institute, Progressive Policy Institute, Brookings Institution, and Heritage Foundation that expressed bipartisan interest in strengthening the Federal role in teacher recruitment and preparation. I was impressed that members of each of these diverse groups can all agree that there must be some serious change in the current teacher education system. 
The Progressive Policy Institute has urged: 
 * * * that the President and his advisors remain faithful to the most important achievement in education policy: redefining the goal of school reform as results, not regulation. The Progressive Policy Institute also wrote that instead of spending federal dollars to hire more teachers and support schools of education under the existing system, the Administration should encourage states to open up the teaching profession to talented individuals who can demonstrate mastery of the subject that they intend to teach; implement innovative means of recruiting and training teachers; provide incentives to teach in high-poverty schools; and ensure that institutions, administrators, and teachers are rewarded for high performance and held responsible for failure. 
Mr. President, I could not agree more. Clearly, we must have more accountability and autonomy in the education system. We can no longer tolerate a system that allows unqualified teachers in the classroom. As schools are held more accountable for their results, the schools must have the autonomy to hire and fire whomever they want, and decide how best to compensate their faculty. Unquestionably, we must support all of the hard-working, dedicated teachers we now have in our classrooms. they deserve our utmost support and respect. 
Mr. President, I am encouraged that President Clinton has taken an interest in reforming the education system. I do not, however, believe that merely reducing class size and hiring 100,000 new teachers would be a solution for our academic problems. 
The answer is to only certify quality teachers--and to get quality teachers to teach our neediest kids. All children deserve well-educated teachers, and we need to make that proposition a reality. 
Now you might ask what the Federal role should be in teacher training. Unquestionably, states are, and should remain, the primary actors in public education. Any new Federal programs should be voluntary for states, which should not be 
burdened by new Federal mandates. However, the Federal government can have a role--by helping the states focus on hiring quality teachers. 
The Federal government needs to break the education school monopoly on teacher preparation. Too often, these education schools have weak academic standards--and focus on teaching methods over knowledge of subject matter. The students who enroll in teacher education programs in U.S. colleges tend to have lower scores on SAT and ACT exams than those in virtually all other programs of study. 
Federal funds that are set aside for teacher training should be made available to any program that trains teachers--as long as the program is held accountable for producing students that can demonstrate subject matter competence in the classes that they plan to teach. All teacher-training programs should be held accountable for results: producing teachers who know their subject well and know how to teach it. Their results are what matter, not their intentions or their resources or their requirements, or their accreditation. 
The Federal government can assist the states by forgiving student loans or offering other financial incentives for well-educated people who teach in hard-to staff schools. 
For example, I introduced legislation last year that would provide loan forgiveness to individuals who obtain a college degree in early childhood education who then go on to teach in accredited child-care centers. The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act is a great example of how the Federal government can provide incentives to students to become teachers. All children, from pre-K to 12th grade, deserve the chance to have a qualified teacher that will help them reach their academic potential. 
Today, Mr. President, I am proposing legislation that addresses the need for better teacher training programs. While it is important to stem the tide of unqualified teachers reaching the classroom, we must also focus on helping teachers that are already in the classroom and need assistance in becoming the best teachers that they can be. Today, therefore, I am introducing the Teacher Quality Act of 1998. 
This legislation calls for the creation of teacher training programs across the United States that will help train teachers that are already in the classroom or about to enter the teaching profession. 
This bill is common-sense legislation that will assist school districts in their struggle to maintain the highest possible academic standards for their children. My idea for this legislation developed out of my admiration for the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Mayerson Academy was established in 1992 as a partnership between the Cincinnati business community and its schools. The mission of the Mayerson Academy is to provide the highest quality training and professional development opportunities to the men and women responsible for educating the children of Cincinnati. Its motto is `All Children Can Learn.' 
The doors of the academy are open for business from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm, Monday through Saturday, fifty weeks per year. The non-profit Mayerson Academy has a 10-year contract with Cincinnati Public Schools and also has training agreements with Princeton City Schools, Lakota Local School District, and the Oak Hills School District. The Mayerson Academy has advanced labs on how to learn math. Classes on how to use computers. Socratic discussions on how to organize and manage. Teachers can take advantage of core courses, through which they can earn graduate-level equivalency credits, or take one-time special-topic `action labs.' The Mayerson Academy also utilizes all the latest breakthroughs in technology to get their message out across the country through the use of distance learning instruction. Teachers in Cincinnati Public Schools are eligible for a $750 raise after 100 hours of training--and it counts toward Ohio's mandatory continuing education requirement for a teaching license. 
The Mayerson Academy raised its start-up funds from generous private contributions from local banks, private foundations, and businesses such as Federated Department Stores, General Electric, and Procter and Gamble. Cincinnati's school district pays $1.6 million a year to purchase 66,000 hours of training from Mayerson--and the teachers attend for free. However, the program is such a great success that this school year, the Academy will provide 160,000 hours of staff training, far exceeding the 66,000 hours of annual staff training time called for by the academy's agreement with the district. The Mayerson Academy is separate from the school system, in order to ensure independent evaluation of its results and a consistent base of support. This status also allows it to benefit from the perspectives and experience of the business leadership. 
My legislation will establish a competitive grant program that will ask school districts to form public-private partnerships to establish teacher training programs. I believe that this legislation will assist in establishing teacher training centers like Mayerson--facilities that will help teachers gain subject matter mastery and give our children the best training teachers in the world. 
The second piece of legislation that I am introducing today will expand and improve the supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers. This goal can be accomplished by encouraging and assisting States to develop and implement programs for alternative routes toward alternative certification or licensure. The Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act will give individuals who would like to teach the chance to do so. We're talking about teachers who can serve not just as mentors to these children, but also as role models to show them how a good education can make a huge positive difference in their future. 
Through these programs, individuals who have a sense of what goals they wish to accomplish can bring their knowledge and experience into the classroom--and make a difference in children's lives. 
There are many talented professionals with a high level of subject area competence outside the education profession who may wish to pursue careers in education, but could not meet the current requirements to be certified or licensed as teachers. For example, a former engineer could explain to his students the importance of geometry, algebra, and calculus. A doctor can show his students how hard courses in biology can put young people on the path to saving lives. If students can see that what they are learning in school really does prepare them for the future, they will be more willing to learn and grasp new concepts. 
Mr. President, individuals on both sides of the aisle realize that alternative certification is an effective method to attract more qualified teachers into the classroom. The Progressive Policy Institute has written that `states should be eligible to use federal funds to establish meaningful alternative certification programs that have more than a marginal effect on teacher supply.' There is also a study that shows that individuals who become certified through alternative certification programs are more likely to be minorities, specialize in science and mathematics, and teach in hard-to-staff inner-city districts than traditionally certified teachers. 
Mr. President, both pieces of legislation that I am introducing today are targeted on improving American teaching. The Teacher Quality Act is solid legislation that answers the question, `How do we train teachers that are already in the field?' The Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act answers the question, `How are we going to attract qualified individuals into the teaching field?' I strongly believe that both of these initiatives can serve as the bedrock on which to enact real reforms in the teacher education system in America. 
To conclude, Mr. President, I believe that improving educational opportunities for children has to be a top priority for this Congress. I ask my colleagues in the House and Senate to work together to forge a bipartisan approach that will ensure that our children are being taught by the most qualified teachers in the world. There is no question that we must develop a system that will draw students into the teaching profession. The Federal government and the States need to work together to provide incentives for people to become teachers, and build a sense of pride to this profession. We can no longer tolerate failure if we wish to keep America strong. Now is the time to address this issue--and I ask that members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, and the Senate Labor Committee, work diligently to come up with the best answer for our children.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act of 1998. I am very pleased to be joined by Senators Coats, Collins, Hutchison, and Gordon Smith. 
The purpose of this legislation is to expand and improve the supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers. We would accomplish this goal by encouraging and assisting States to develop and implement programs for alternative routes toward teacher certification or licensure. 
There are many talented professionals with a high level of subject area competence outside the education profession who may wish to pursue careers in education, but could not meet the current requirements to be certified or licensed as teachers. For example, all of us here in Congress attain an unique knowledge of how our government works. Alternative certification and licensure could provide an opportunity for some of us to become teachers so we could share our knowledge and experiences of how government works with young people. The measure of a good teacher after all is how much and how well their students could learn. 
Knowledgeable and eager individuals should be helped--not discouraged--to enter the K-12 classroom as teachers. 
We can achieve this goal by giving States the maximum flexibility and incentives to create alternative certification programs. That's what my bill would do--it would enable the Federal Government to assist States by offering incentives to recruit well-educated people into the teaching profession. This program would be voluntary for the States. States do not need to be burdened by new Federal mandates. 
This bill would allow qualified individuals to fullfil State certification or licensure requirements, giving school systems the chance to take advantage of the expertise of such professionals and improve the pool of qualified individuals available to local educational agencies. These measures would do a great deal to expand and improve the supply of well-qualified teachers. 
The bill would provide $15 million each year to be divided among the States based on a student population formula. States would have to apply to the Secretary in order to be considered for funds. The money could be used to either create new alternative certification programs or to fund pre-existing programs. If a State does not 
apply for funds, then that money is reallocated to those States that most demonstrate the need for the money based on the Secretary of Education's discretion. 
Alternative certification is nothing new. A study by C. Emily Feistritzer entitled `Alternative Teacher Certification: a State-by-State Analysis 1997' reports the following facts: 
41 States and the District of Columbia are now implementing alternative routes for certifying teachers. However, virtually all of the States now offer some type of program other than the traditional approved college teacher education program route for initially licensing teachers. 
23 States and the District of Columbia have designed alternative licensure programs for the explicit purpose of bringing talented individuals who already have at least a bachelor's degree in a field other than education into teaching--up from just 11 such programs in 1991. 
117 programs in the 50 States and the District of Columbia are now available for people who already have a bachelor's degree and want to become licensed to teach. This compares with 91 programs in 1991. 
Interest in alternative teacher certification continues to escalate. 35 states reported that interest from `people wanting to get licensed to teach' has increased in the last five years. 
Mr. President, it's clear that interest in the alternative certification route is on the increase. Among the talented people we can attract into the teaching profession by this means are military personnel who are nearing retirement, people who have been down-sized and are looking for a second career, business leaders who want to share their knowledge with a new generation of children, housewives who are looking for a new career after their children have moved out of the family home, and people who want to leave the private sector so they can use their college major to make a difference in children's lives. 
Teacher training has become a very important issue to this Congress and to the Administration. As of today, there have been no fewer than seven teacher training bills introduced in the House and Senate. In fact, President Clinton has requested $1.1 billion in his latest budget to pay for 37,000 new teachers. It is clear that members on both sides of the aisle understand the importance of having quality teachers in the classroom. 
Therefore, there's clear bipartisan support for programs that encourage and recruit the most knowledgeable individuals to 
teach our children. It is my hope that we can see bipartisan support for programs that give talented individuals an alternative route into the teaching profession. 
In order to find the best possible teachers for our children, we need to support programs that are flexible and creative. We need to encourage the brightest minds in our communities to consider teaching as a career. Teachers who have had a previous career can explain to children the importance of a good education. For example, a former engineer could explain to his students the importance of geometry, algebra, and calculus. A doctor can show his students how hard courses in biology can put young people on the path to saving lives. If students can see that what they are learning in school really does prepare them for the future, they will be more willing to learn and grasp new concepts. 
In this bill, States would be given the flexibility to reach out for new teaching talent and fill specifically hard-to-staff teacher positions. 
Alternative certification and licensure programs give the best and brightest individuals who would like to teach the chance to do so. We're talking about teachers who can serve not just as mentors to these children, but also as role models to show them how a good education is crucial to their futures. Through these programs, individuals who have a sense of what goals they wish to accomplish can bring their knowledge and experience into the classroom. 
Mr. President, Federal support for alternative certification and licensure would help ensure that schools continue to attract quality teachers to the classroom. We owe it to all school children to give them the best resources available. That is why we must encourage all States to hire the most capable, knowledgeable, and experienced teachers that are available.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend and colleague from Kentucky. 
Mr. President, I would like to offer a few thoughts on the pending amendment offered by my good friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. 
I intend to vote for the Senator's amendment. A new approach from the current set-aside is clearly needed--a new approach is needed because the current system, the current law, violates the United States Constitution. 
The United States Supreme Court, in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), ruled that racial classifications are unconstitutional unless narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest. The federal district court in Colorado in the case of Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997)--following the guidelines set by the Supreme Court--found that the current racial set-aside for federal highway contracts is unconstitutional. The district court found that the 10% set-aside for federal highway contracts and the race-based presumptions contained in the implementing regulations were not narrowly tailored--they excluded certain unlisted minority groups who may very well have been socially and economically disadvantaged, while presuming that all minorities in the listed groups were economically disadvantaged, and in some cases, socially disadvantaged. 
Other federal courts, in applying the same strict scrutiny test to other federal, state, and local race-based laws and regulations, have consistently found that these racial preferences are not constitutional. In Ohio, a case is pending before the Ohio Supreme Court (Ritchey Produce Company v. Ohio Department Of Administrative Services, Supreme Court of Ohio, 1998 Ohio LEXIS 495). A Lebanese-American did not fall within the listed minority groups who received preferential treatment under the Ohio set-aside program, so he was denied certification as a minority contractor. Even if the majority of his workforce consisted of the listed minority groups--that company would still not be eligible to receive minority certification under the current standards. 
Thus, given the constitutional guidelines that have been clearly established by the Supreme Court, we in the Congress face a fundamental choice--we can stand aside and watch federal courts dismantle race-based set aside programs one-by-one, or we can exercise leadership and meet the challenge head on--by initiating a new approach that targets our resources to economically disadvantaged individuals in depressed areas who want a shot at the American dream. To his credit, the Senator from Kentucky has shown leadership by offering such an innovative, constitutional approach. His ideas are not totally new. 
In 1980, New York Mayor Ed Koch inaugurated a race-neutral affirmative action program targeted at the economically disadvantaged--providing a 10% set-aside for small firms that did at least 25% of their business in disadvantaged neighborhoods, or employed disadvantaged workers as at least 25% of their workforce. This program has served as a model for other cities nationwide. 
In several respects, the Senator from Kentucky's amendment borrows from the Koch program. His amendment would target opportunity assistance programs toward businesses based not on the owner of the business exclusively, but on who's working for the business and just as important, who the business is serving. Specifically, the McConnell amendment targets assistance toward new businesses located in economically disadvantaged areas, or has a workforce half of which are employees from economically disadvantaged areas. 
This direction--to reach out to the economically disadvantaged, including minorities and women--will do much to promote the interests of minorities and the country as a whole. By reaching out to businesses that employ the disadvantaged or that are located in depressed areas, we are doing more than just helping disadvantaged businesses, we're uplifting entire communities. 
It's more than affirmative action--it's community empowerment. 
I would also like to point out that my friend from Michigan, Senator Abraham, was instrumental in the drafting of this specific provision. I commend him for working with the Senator from Kentucky--it reflects their strong interest and support for innovative 
approaches to community renewal. 
I also commend the Senator from Kentucky for placing a time limit on assistance. Assistance under this program would be offered to firms that have been in existence for less than nine years. That just makes sense. The best business development programs are those that help new, disadvantaged businesses stand on their feet and compete. 
That's exactly what the McConnell amendment would do. Specifically, the McConnell amendment provides a host of services for eligible businesses--services ranging from financial counseling, business management, and technical assistance for eligible businesses seeking contracts under federal transportation programs. 
Taken together, these provisions in the McConnell amendment represent a positive approach that is consistent with the Constitution and with the wisdom and intent of those who first championed the idea of affirmative action--action to provide equality of opportunity for individuals. 
Now Mr. President, let me be candid--if given the opportunity, I would have taken the McConnell amendment one step further. I would have maintained the set-aside program--one that would have been acceptable under our Constitution. I believe we can and should have race-neutral set-aside programs for new, economically disadvantaged businesses. The fundamental problem with the existing program is not the set-aside itself--but who receives it and how they are defined. The current program gives an advantage to those who may not need it--individuals who were given a chance based solely on race or racial goals. That's why the federal courts have found this and other set-aside programs to be unconstitutional. Therefore, I would support a set-aside program that provides time-limited business opportunities to businesses who employ or serve the truly disadvantaged--a program that goes beyond outreach and recruitment, and gives disadvantaged businesses a chance to do business--much like Mayor Koch did in New York a decade ago. 
Unfortunately, such a program is not before us today. We do not have that option. The choice today is between an unconstitutional law or a new constitutional plan that will provide hope and opportunity for the disadvantaged. While the McConnell amendment does not go as far as I would like or as far as I would go, it is clearly constitutional and it is clearly an effective way to help the disadvantaged. It is a significant improvement over the status quo. 
This amendment represents a positive, imaginative step in the right direction--one that is true to our Constitution and to our commitment to equal opportunity. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join Senator Collins today in the introduction of the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. This bill, as my colleague has explained, would repeal section 605 of the Internal Revenue Code, thereby eliminating responsibility of schools to file returns to the IRS on behalf of their students. 
Now, the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education has recommended that the most direct way to minimize the regulatory burden on colleges and universities would be to repeal the sections of law that impose reporting requirements. 
What is the problem? Here is the problem: Current law relating to the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit requires all colleges and universities to comply with very burdensome and costly regulations. Beginning with tax year 1998, schools will be expected to provide the IRS with information regarding its students, including the following: name, address, Social Security number of the students, whether the student was in attendance at least half-time during the academic period, whether the student was enrolled exclusively in a program leading to a graduate-level educational credential, the person to contact at the institution in case there are questions, the amount of qualified tuition and gift aid a student receives--on and on. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that we are amending today contained a provision requiring colleges, universities, and trade schools to begin issuing annual reports to students and to the Internal Revenue Service detailing the students' tuition payments in case they apply for the new education tax credit. Preliminary analysis shows the reporting requirements will cost 6,000 colleges in America more than $125 million to implement and tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain. 
The bill that Senator Collins and I are introducing will free colleges, universities, and trade schools from complying with these very burdensome and costly requirements. Under our bill, taxpayers will now simply claim the new education tax credits on their income tax returns as they do with other tax credits and deductions. 
Now, Mr. President, in my home State of Ohio, I have heard from many colleges. They have told me that the reporting requirement will place a significant financial and human resource burden on colleges and universities that will ultimately lead to an increase in the cost of higher education. 
Ohio institutions such as Cleveland State, Bowling Green State University, Shawnee State University, and North Central Technical College have all written me and told me these requirements place schools in a very difficult position, putting them between students and parents and the IRS, because the schools are required under the current law to collect information that, frankly, they would not otherwise have to collect. While these schools are very supportive of the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit, the burden placed on universities will increase the cost of higher education, which, of course, reduces the benefit of the tax credit to the students. 
The bill that my colleague from Maine and I are introducing is commonsense legislation that will eliminate an unfunded mandate placed upon colleges and universities. In realistic terms, if the new reporting requirement is not lifted off the backs of colleges and universities, those schools will be forced to raise tuition costs to cover this unfunded mandate. In effect, students and families will not benefit from passage of the Hope Scholarship because the money received from the tax credit will be used to pay this higher tuition. 
I support the Hope Scholarship, and I am excited that students will be given a financial boost in their plans to attain a higher education. However, the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit will not be as beneficial if it means that colleges and universities will raise their tuition to cover the costs of this unfunded mandate. Trying to pay for an unfunded mandate shifts a school's focus away from its primary goal, which, of course, is giving the students the best possible education. 
Now, similar legislation to our bill has already been introduced in the House of Representatives. The House bill is supported by a bipartisan coalition of Members of the House. In addition, Mr. President, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, representing 425 of the largest colleges and universities in the country, and also the American Association of Community Colleges, representing 1,200 community colleges, have both endorsed this initiative. 
Mr. President, I conclude today by asking my colleagues to take a closer look at how this legislation will benefit students and families in this country. I invite any of my colleagues to join us today to cosponsor this bill. Passage of the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit was a good beginning, but we must now assure that universities and colleges will not raise tuition costs simply to cover the costs of this unfunded mandate. 
Our bill, then, is simple. It is simple, fair legislation that will greatly benefit any person who wants to obtain a higher education in this country.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his fine work in this area. 
I rise today, Mr. President, to strongly support the amendment. You know, in the past several decades we in this country have made tremendous progress in the war against drunk driving. But we have seen in the last several years a retrenchment in that. Let me cite the statistics that show this. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, alcohol-related traffic fatalities dropped from 24,050 in 1986 to 17,274 in 1995. That was a 28 percent decrease in drunk driving tragedies over a decade. I think we, as a nation, can take a lot of pride in this. But, unfortunately, from 1994 to 1995, alcohol-related fatalities rose 4 percent--the first increase in over a decade. 
I believe we must now act to reverse this disturbing trend by reinforcing our commitment and the statement that we make through our laws that drinking and driving simply will not be tolerated. 
Yesterday, the Senate took the first step in doing just that. We passed an amendment which would make .08 blood alcohol content the law of the land, a law which I believe the statistics clearly show will save between 2,500 and 3,000 lives over the life of the ISTEA reauthorization. 
Today, Mr. President, we can take another step in the right direction. Currently, 22 States allow individuals in a car to 
be drinking while the vehicle is in operation. And even more shockingly--even more shockingly--there are five States where it is perfectly legal for the driver of a car to drink while at the same time operating the motor vehicle. 
Mr. President, common sense should tell us that this is not a good idea. We should be in the business of making it more difficult to drink and drive, not encouraging liquor in cars. 
Mr. President, this amendment speaks to what message we send through our laws. When we pass drunk-driving-related legislation, our goal is not to have more people arrested, our goal is not to have more people pulled over; our goal is to deter conduct. That has been the effect of drunk driving laws. That is why the fatality level has gone down. That is why lives have been saved, because people have been deterred. We sent messages to ourselves, to the rest of the country, the people, through our laws, what is important and what is not important. 
What kind of a message is it when we say it is OK to have open containers of alcohol in a car? In some locations in this country it is OK for a driver to be going down the road, driving with one hand and holding a beer in the other. What kind of a message is that? 
So I think what the Dorgan amendment does and its greatest value is as a deterrent effect. It will help get us back on track. We made progress. We have had steady progress for the last 15 or 20 years in reducing the auto fatalities caused by drinking and driving. It has only been in the last several years that that trend has been reversed. 
Passage of the Dorgan amendment, while it is a relatively simple amendment--and it might not seem that it is a huge deal--I think it is a big deal because it sends the right message. It says, `No, it's not OK to have alcohol in a car. It's not OK to be drinking and driving. And it's not OK to drive down the road with a beer in one hand and your other hand on the wheel of a car.' 
I think there are certain minimum standards that should apply whether you are driving in North Dakota or on a highway in Indiana or Kentucky or wherever you take your family. I think we all have, as parents, the right to think that, when we put our family and our loved ones in a car, no matter where we are going on vacation or where we are traveling, there are some minimum standards that will be followed. 
One of the minimum standards, it seems to me, that is eminently reasonable and infringes on no one's rights, is a minimum standard that simply says, `No, you cannot have open containers of alcohol in a car. And, no, you cannot be driving that car and at the same time drinking alcohol.' It is that simple. 
I urge my colleagues to support this very, very modest and very sensible amendment. 
I yield the floor and thank the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate some of the very eloquent comments that have been made this morning on the Senate floor. I appreciate the comments about States rights. Let me say, though, that there are very few times when we, as Members of the Senate, can come to the floor and cast our votes when we will know that the vote we cast will save lives. That is true in this case. There is absolutely no doubt about it. Lives will be saved and families will be spared the heartache of losing a child or mother or father. 
There are other things I think we clearly know and that are not in dispute. That is one. The second is that no one has come to the floor suggesting that a person who tests .08 has any business being behind the wheel of a car. That is not really in dispute at all. No doctor who has looked at this, no emergency room doctor who has looked at it, no police officer who is involved in testing people, pulling them over and seeing what they test and looking at their reflexes, looking at how they act --everyone who has had that experience agrees--at .08, no one should be behind the wheel. If anyone has a doubt about it, think of it this way: If you were at a party and someone had four beers in an hour and you watched him drink those four beers in an hour, and you observed he didn't have anything to eat, four beers in 1 hour, and he looked over after that time and said, `Let me take your little 5-year-old daughter'--my daughter, a 5-year-old, is named Anna--`Let me take her up to the Tastee-Freez and buy her an ice cream cone; I'll drive her up.' How many of us would put her in that car? We would not do that. There is no doubt about it. So it is absolutely a reasonable standard. 
Does it include social drinkers? We are not talking about one or two beers and a pizza. We are talking about people who have absolutely no business behind the wheel of a car. 
I think Ronald Reagan did say it best. I think he had it right in 1984. He supported a similar type concept, and that concept was that there should be a minimum standard across the country for the drinking age, and it should be 21 no matter where you were in the country. He supported that. The great champion of States rights said in this case a national uniform standard will save lives and makes common sense. This is what Ronald Reagan said in 1984 when he signed the bill: 
This problem is much more than just a State problem. It's a national tragedy. There are some special cases in which overwhelming need can be dealt with by prudent and limited Federal influence. In a case like this I have no misgivings about a judicious use of Federal inducements to save precious lives. 
It is a minimum standard. It is a rational standard. Doesn't it make sense that when you get in your car and put your family in the car and go on a trip--many of us cross two or three State lines every week; every day, some of us--doesn't it make sense there should be some assurance that there is a minimum standard that exists, no matter where you drive your car in this country? Doesn't that make sense? I think it does. 
So, I think it is a question--yes, it is a question of rights. The rights of families, the right to live, the right to have a fair chance on the highway not to have someone come at you who has been drinking and driving. That is what this is all about. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote `yes' on this amendment in the vote that will take place in 20 or 25 minutes. It is a rare opportunity among all the things we debate, all the rhetoric--

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first thank and congratulate my friend and colleague from New Jersey, not just for his very eloquent statement and leadership today, but for his work over the years. His work has made a tremendous difference in saving a number of lives. 
Mr. President, at 10:30 tomorrow morning, Members are going to have the opportunity to do something that we don't always have the chance to do. Many times, we vote on issues and we think we are right, but we don't know what the ultimate effect is going to be. This is one of those times where when we cast our vote, we know what the effect is. Members who come to the floor tomorrow morning at 10:30 to cast their vote on this amendment and vote `yes' will clearly be saving lives. There is absolutely no doubt about it. That is one thing we know. We know it based on statistics and based on history. We know it based on common sense. That is, I think, a great opportunity that we will have tomorrow. This amendment, make no mistake about it, will save lives. 
As we consider legislation to authorize funds for most of our Nation's highways, we cannot avoid the issue of the safety of those highways. Tragically, in the last couple of years we seem to have been losing ground in highway safety. After well over a decade of progress, we are starting slowly to move backward. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, alcohol-related traffic fatalities dropped from 24,050 in 1986 down to 17,274 in 1995. That was a 28 percent decrease in drunk driving tragedies over a decade. We as a nation, Mr. President, can take pride in the progress that we made. 
However, unfortunately, from 1994 to 1995, alcohol-related traffic fatalities rose 4 percent--the first increase in over a decade. In 1995, alcohol-related traffic fatalities increased for the first time in a whole decade. That year, there were 17,274 fatalities from alcohol-related crashes. 
Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to gain back some of the ground that we have lost in the battle against highway fatalities. It would set a national blood alcohol standard--a standard above which the driver is legally under the influence and should not be driving an automobile. 
All widely accepted studies indicate that the blood alcohol standard should be set at .08 BAC, the blood alcohol content. 
Mr. President, at .08 blood content, no one should be driving a car. I don't know any expert, I don't know any police officer, I don't know any scientist who has seriously looked at this issue in the whole country who does not agree with that--who does not agree that at .08 you are under the influence of alcohol, and your judgment, your reflexes, your control of the car, everything is appreciably impaired. There is no doubt about it. 
Mr. President, the facts are that the risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each increase in the blood level content. We know that. NHTSA reports that in single-vehicle crashes the relative fatality risk for drivers with blood alcohol content between .05 and .09 is over 11 times greater than for drivers with a blood alcohol content of zero--11 times. When a driver reaches or exceeds the .08 alcohol level, the risk goes up even more. In fact, it dramatically shoots up even above that high standard. 
Mr. President, at .08, one's vision, one's balance, one's own reaction time, one's hearing, judgment, self-control, all are seriously impaired. Moreover, at .08, the critical driving task, concentration, attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear change, lane tracking are all negatively impacted and affected. 
We have all heard the arguments. The alcohol industry, in arguing against this standard, claims that--get this now--only 7 percent of the fatal crashes involve drivers with blood alcohol content between .08 and .09--only 7 percent. But what does that mean? What that translates into, if you use 1995 figures, it translates into 1,200 people in that year alone dying--1,200 people who are at precisely that level. 
Some of the opponents of this bill would argue, `Oh, it is only 7 percent.' Tell that to the parents who lost a child. Tell that to the brothers who lost a sister, or children who lost siblings or who lost parents. Changing the blood alcohol level content to .08 could have saved many of these lives. 
Where the .08 laws have been tried, they have been proven to reduce crashes and fatalities. A study done at Boston University found that .08 laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol-related fatalities by 16 percent. Moreover, that same study found that .08 laws also reduced fatalities at higher blood alcohol levels by 18 percent. 
So it doesn't just have an impact on the .08 and .09 level; it serves as a deterrent, which affects the entire scale. 
Lowering the blood alcohol limit to .08 makes it possible to convict seriously impaired drivers whose blood alcohol contents are now considered marginal, because they are just at or just over .10. Further, the .08 blood alcohol level is a supremely reasonable standard. 
Let's look at the chart again that my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, showed a moment ago. I think it is important to look at this because there always is in debates such as this some misinformation that is going around. I think you have to get back to the scientific data and to look at this. 
In order for a 170-pound male to reach a blood alcohol content of .08, that male would have to consume four drinks, four beers, four shots, four glasses of wine, four in 1 hour on an empty stomach. Is there anyone in this Chamber, is there anyone in the Senate, who believes that they could sit down, drink four shots in an hour, and then get behind the wheel and drive? You might be able to do it. But would you be able to do it very well? I think the answer is clearly no. 
Maybe a better question we all should ask ourselves is how many of us, knowing a friend of ours, or acquaintance, or neighbor who had four drinks in an hour on an empty stomach, would say to that person, `Why don't you take my daughter, Anna, uptown to McDonald's, put her in your car, and drive her?' It is ludicrous. There isn't a person who would do that. We know that. Yet, that is what it would take to reach the .08 standard. 
A 135-pound female typically would have to consume three 
drinks in the same period of time. 
In other words, Mr. President, the .08 standard is targeted towards those who engage, frankly, in binge drinking--not, let me repeat, social drinking. This bill will not impact social drinkers. 
The opponents of this legislation apparently want the public to believe that our legislation would target for prosecution individuals who have had a beer or two, or had a beer and a pizza. That is the opposite of the truth. 
I think we should ask ourselves the simple question: Should the average person who has consumed four shots of distilled spirits in an hour, four beers, four glasses of wine on an empty stomach, be behind the wheel of a car? We all know what the answer to that is. 
Mr. President, the .08 legislation sets an intelligent national minimal standard, the same kind of commonsense standard that President Reagan pointed to in 1984 when he signed legislation raising the national minimum drinking age to 21. The results are in. The results of that action by this Congress and that President are in. In every year for which the national minimum drinking age was changed, roughly 1,000 lives were saved. 
No one believes in States rights more than Ronald Reagan. No one talked about it more eloquently. And there were those when Ronald Reagan took that position in 1984 who said that is inconsistent, that is wrong. We understand that argument. I think Ronald Reagan had it right, as he did a lot of times. His answer was very eloquent. This is what he said about really the same type issue. I quote from President Reagan:  
This problem is much more than just a State problem. It's a national tragedy. There are some special cases in which overwhelming need can be dealt with by prudent and limited Federal influence. And, in a case like this, I have no misgivings about a judicious use of Federal inducements to save precious lives. 
President Ronald Reagan, 1984, on a very similar issue. 
Mr. President, our purpose here today is really exactly the same as President Reagan's was back in 1984. We are working together in a very bipartisan way to guarantee a fundamental right, because this really is about rights. It is about freedom--the right of freedom to know that when you put your family in a car on a highway and you put your child in a car, there will be an absolute minimum national standard for how sober some other person has to be to drive on that same highway. So, if there is some minimum standard when I am in Cincinnati and leave Ohio and go into Kentucky, and maybe a few minutes later go into Indiana, cross State lines, that there is some national floor, a minimum standard of responsibility. That is about my freedom as a driver. That is about my family's freedom. That is about, I think, responsibility. 
That is the rationale behind the .08 standard embodied in this amendment. Simply put, a person at the .08 blood alcohol level is under the influence. No one disputes that. No one. And that person simply should not be driving a car. Our amendment would make this principle the law of the land, and it would save many, many lives. 
Mr. President, I see that my time is about up. I at this point reserve the remainder of the time. I do not know if anyone--Senator Chafee is on the floor--who wants to speak against the bill at this point wants me to yield time. I see my colleague from Illinois is on the floor. I will reserve the remainder of our time at this point.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague and thank the Chair. 
This amendment has received a great deal of attention from the editorial boards across this country. I would like just to read excerpts from several of them because I think their reasoning is quite good. 
Let me cite first the Austin American Statesman, October 30: 
Let's say it one more time: DWI laws don't have a thing to do with prohibition, partying, or Puritanism. They aren't intended to interfere with anyone's right to drink alcohol socially or antisocially, responsibly or irresponsibly, in vast or moderate quantities. The law just asks drinkers not to operate heavy machinery on the States' roads and highways while under the influence of alcohol. 
The Baltimore Sun:  
You're driving on the beltway. The motorist in the next lane consumed four beers during the past hour. To paraphrase Clint Eastwood, `Do you feel lucky?' Amazingly, that tipsy driver may be within his legal rights. 
And they end up: 
Four drinks in one State makes you no less drunk than four drinks in another State. The abundant evidence justifies a national response. 
The Omaha World-Herald: 
Yes to a national drunk driving law. Congress uses the threat of withheld funds too often, in our opinion, to force its will upon the States. In this case, however, the States would merely be required to set an intoxication standard that reflects research on how alcohol affects driving. 
That is the Omaha World-Herald, October 29. 
The Wall Street Journal said this: 
Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, not the lobby for Hooters and Harrah's. The Lautenberg-DeWine amendment isn't a drive toward prohibition, but an uphill push toward health consensus. 
The Toledo Blade: 
Complaints from the beverage industry that the new limits would target social drinkers and not alcoholics are ridiculous and dangerous. All that matters is whether the person behind the wheel has had too much to drink. Whether he or she is a social drinker is irrelevant. 
Finally, New York Newsday: 
It should be obvious that cracking down on drunk driving is an urgent matter of health and safety. The attack is not against drinking; it's against drinking and driving. 
Mr. President, my colleagues have said it very, very well. My colleague from North Dakota a few moments ago said it well. He says it is not complicated. It is not complicated how you reduce auto fatalities. This is an easy way to save lives. And this is a way that will save lives. 
At 10:30 tomorrow morning we are going to have a chance to do something very simple. We are going to have the chance to come to this floor and cast a yes vote on this amendment. It is one time when we will know the consequences of our act. And the consequence of that act, if we pass this, if it becomes law, will be simply this: Fewer families will have their families shattered, fewer families will have their lives changed forever. That is what the loss of a child or loss of a mother or father to drunk driving does--it changes your life forever. 
We will save some families from that tragedy. We will never know who they are. They will never know. But we can be guaranteed that we will have done that and done that much tomorrow morning. This is a very rational and reasonable proposal. I say that because it sets the standard at .08. 
I will repeat something I said a moment ago--and I am going to continue to state it because I think it is so important --and that is: No one, no expert who has looked at this believes that someone who tests .08 has not had their driving ability appreciably impaired. No one who has looked at this thinks that someone who tests .08 should be behind the wheel of a car. If any of my colleagues who might be listening doubt that, tonight or early tomorrow morning--we all know police officers; we all know people who have been in emergency rooms; we all know people who have seen DUIs and who know who they tested--pick up the phone and call one of your police officers. 
Pick up the phone and call a member of the highway patrol who may have picked up someone, who has picked up probably dozens of people who have been drinking and driving, and ask them if, in their professional opinion, they think someone who tests .08 or above has any business being behind the wheel of a car. I will guarantee you, the answer will be unanimous. 
The fact is, the more someone knows about the subject, the more adamant they will be about that. I became involved in this issue a number of years ago when I was an assistant county prosecuting attorney. One of my jobs was to prosecute DUI--DWI cases we used to call them in those days. 
I can tell you from my own experience, someone who tests .08--and I have seen the videotape, as they say. I have seen the replays. I have seen the tapes that are taken right before the person takes the test. And I have compared those videotapes where you can see the person staggering, you can see the person's speech slurred, you can see their coordination impaired. 
I compared that with the tests. I will tell you from my own experience in observing, a person at .08 absolutely, no doubt about it, should not be behind the wheel. 
Look what other countries have done. Senator Lautenberg showed the chart. Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Austria, all at .08 or below. This is a rational and reasonable thing to do. It is reasonable, as Ronald Reagan said, to have some minimum national standards that assure highway safety. 
We live in a country where we get in a car and we think nothing of crossing one, two, three, four, five State lines, and we do it literally all the time. There ought to be some national standard, some floor, some assurance when you put your child in a car, when you get in the car with your wife and your loved ones, some assurance that whatever State you are in, wherever you are driving, that level is .08. That is a rational floor. It is a rational basis. 
Again, despite all the scientific evidence, despite all the arguments, still there are some who would say this bill is an attack against social drinkers; this amendment will mean if I have two beers and a pizza I will not be able to drive. That is simply not true. All the scientific data, all the tests, all the anecdotal information tells us that is simply not true. 
Let me again go back and repeat what the scientific data shows. It shows that when a male weighing 160 pounds has four drinks in an hour--it takes four drinks on an empty stomach in an hour for that adult male at 160 pounds to reach the .08 level. I don't think anyone believes that person should be behind the wheel, and I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber who will turn their child over to that person. 
Mr. President, again we will have the opportunity tomorrow to save lives. I urge my colleagues to cast a `yes' vote on the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. It will, in fact, save lives. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise as a cosponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act sponsored by my colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, to whom I am grateful for introducing this important legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to make it a crime to transport a child across state lines if this circumvents state law requiring parental involvement or a judicial waiver for a minor to obtain an abortion. 
In a well-publicized case in Pennsylvania, a 12-year-old girl became pregnant after a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old man. As parental consent is required under Pennsylvania law before a minor can receive an abortion, the man's mother took the pregnant girl to New York for an abortion, where there is no such parental involvement law. The baby was aborted. The girl's mother did not consent to her daughter having an abortion; in fact, she did not even know her daughter was pregnant. Unfortunately, parents and guardians have no clear recourse when another adult circumvents the law of the state where the parent and child live by transporting a child to another state. 
Twenty-two states have laws that require either notification or consent of a parent before a minor child receives an abortion. Currently, in my State of Ohio, a parent or guardian must be notified before a child receives an abortion. However, the State Legislature has recently passed a law requiring both parental consent and a face-to-face meeting with the doctor performing the abortion at least twenty-four hours before the procedure. Clearly, the citizens of Ohio have a compelling interest in making sure that parents are involved in a minor's decision to have an abortion, and that women have a full opportunity to consider the medical implications of their decision to abort an unborn child. 
The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding the rights of parents is completely abrogated by the ability of strangers to surreptitiously transport children to another state to obtain a surgical or drug-induced abortion. By introducing this bill, we are sending a clear message that Roe v. Wade does not confer a `right' on strangers to take one's minor daughter across state lines to obtain an abortion when the involvement of a parent or a court is required. In H.L. v. Matheson, the Supreme Court correctly stated, `the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is immature.' 
In my view that strangers should be barred from circumventing the rights of parents to be involved in life and death decisions faced by their children. I believe the vast majority of Americans will never want to relegate the well-being of our children to a situation where life-altering decisions are made without the guidance and support of caring parents.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. 
Although cigarette smoking continues to be a major problem in this country today, I don't think there is anyone who doubts that the Surgeon General using his bully pulpit in 1966 had a profound impact on public opinion and behavior in this country. 
Mr. President, the nomination of Dr. David Satcher poses a difficult problem for those of us who oppose the procedure known as partial-birth abortion. The vast majority of Americans agree that it is a barbaric process and procedure. As our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from New York, has pointed out, it is disturbingly close to infanticide. 
As a matter of conscience, Mr. President, I cannot support a nominee for the position of Surgeon General--in essence, America's chief doctor--who is a defender of this procedure. 
That, Mr. President, is why I will vote no on this nomination. While I suppose it would be unrealistic for any of us to hope this administration would send us a pro-life nominee for Surgeon General, I don't think it's too much to ask that their nominee oppose this particularly brutal procedure of partial-birth abortion. 
But we are now left, Mr. President, with the compellingly serious problem of a three-year vacancy at the post of Surgeon General. The Surgeon General is our number one public health official--the only doctor who can command the national bully pulpit to alert America to public health threats. This is a very important position. As our distinguished colleague, Dr. Frist, has said, and I quote:

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will take a moment this afternoon to say a few words about another truly historic announcement that occurred during the recess. On behalf of the people of the State of Ohio and all of our colleagues in the U.S. Senate, let me say how truly proud we are of our distinguished friend and colleague, Senator John Glenn. By now, everyone in America knows that in October at the age of 77, Senator John Glenn will return to space as a member of the crew of the space shuttle Discovery. 
Mr. President, very few people show the kind of courage shown throughout his lifetime by John Glenn, courage that Senator Glenn showed when he flew 149--149--heroic combat missions as a Marine pilot in World War II and then in the Korean war facing death from enemy fighters and antiaircraft fire. Because of all the enemy fire that John Glenn braved, we are told his buddies called him the `Mig-Mad Marine,' and I guess they had a few other names for him, as well. 
Mr. President, it comes as no surprise to those of us who know him that our friend, John Glenn, is that kind of a rare person. One reporter commented that when he was a young man he was thrilled by then Colonel Glenn's orbits around the Earth and yelled out, `Go, Colonel Glenn, go.' Well, Mr. President, I had pretty much the same experience, as millions of Americans did. My experience occurred when I was in high school, my wife Fran and I were in high school in Yellow Springs High School and the day that John Glenn orbited the Earth and made that historic flight I happened to be in Mr. Ed Wingard's science class in Yellow Springs High School. We all listened on the radio to the progress of this truly historic flight. For those who were not born at that time or cannot remember it, it is hard to describe the atmosphere in this country. It is hard to explain how literally this country came to a stop, when people gathered around TVs and gathered around radios for that period of time as he went around the Earth and made those three orbits. 
In fact, just about anyone around back then can tell you how important that achievement was for the American people, and they can tell you where they were and what they were doing at that moment. We, as a Nation at that time, Mr. President, were shaken, we had been shaken when the Russians beat us into space with the Sputnik, Sputnik satellite, earlier in 1957 and then in April of 1961 they sent Yuri Gagarin into orbit, the first man in space. The same week as that flight the U.S. was rocked by the tragedy and failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. 
In short, Mr. President, America was reeling, and that is one of the reasons why our hearts were lifted so very much by John Glenn's daring exploit. That, Mr. President, was a great day to be an American. I hear a lot of that enthusiasm today after the announcement that Senator Glenn will be going back into space. I think that one of his last public services as a Member of the U.S. Senate may be one of the most valuable achievements of his long and very distinguished career because John Glenn has a rare, truly incredible opportunity to educate the rest of us, to educate the American people about the value of America's adventure in space. 
Who better, Mr. President, than John Glenn to speak to Americans about this great American achievement? Who better to explain to us the importance of NASA, the importance of space exploration? And who among us, except John Glenn, has that historical perspective and can explain it in terms that average Americans can understand? John Glenn has a unique ability to tell this great story. He has that ability because he has lived it. 
Mr. President, I think this space mission is already starting to fire up the imagination of the American people about the wonders of discovery. It can remind us again that we as Americans have a tradition of national greatness and that the pursuit of national greatness remains our continued breathtaking challenge. So, Colonel--Senator--the hearts of all Ohioans and the hearts of your colleagues in the Senate, and indeed all Americans, will be with you on your historic mission. Our hearts will also be with your great family and with your heroic wife Annie. As President Clinton said the other night, godspeed, John Glenn. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to commemorate an important event in the history of my State, the State of Ohio, and also the history of this Congress. Over the just-concluded recess, my good friend, Congressman Lou Stokes, announced he will retire at the end of this Congress. Lou Stokes will retire after 30 years representing the people of his Cleveland area district. 
Mr. President, when I first entered the House of Representatives in 1983, Louis Stokes had already been there for 14 years--14 years building friendships and developing a reputation as a powerful and effective leader. 
Lou Stokes is a leader. Mr. President, he is more than that. Lou Stokes is a good man. One of my own favorite memories of Lou Stokes, and frankly it is one of my memories that I will carry with me all my life and my career in politics, was the very moving speech that Congressman Lou Stokes made when he and I served together on the Iran-Contra Committee. Mr. President, this was a contentious time. Congressman Stokes and I did not always agree on everything about these hearings or about the facts of that series of events that led to the Iran-Contra hearings. But there was a moment during the hearings when Lou Stokes spoke from the heart and he really let us know what kind of a person he is, sort of what makes him tick. We really had an insight into the soul of this very good man. 
In his remarks he expressed heartfelt love of this great country of ours. Let me quote a portion of what Congressman Lou Stokes said at that time: 
I wore the uniform of this country in World War II in a segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you did, even though our Government required black and white solders in the same Army to live, sleep, eat, and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country. 
But because of the rule of law today's servicemen in America suffer no such indignity. . . . My mother, a widow, raised two boys. She had an eighth grade education. She was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son became the first black mayor of a major American city. The other sits here today as chairman of a House Intelligence Committee. Only in America, only in America, Colonel North, only in America. 
Mr. President, Louis Stokes said these words at a time of great tension in our country and in the Congress. In doing so, he gave voice to what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. 
That, Mr. President, is really who Louis Stokes is, a truly honorable man who represents the finest aspects of the American spirit. Congressman Stokes rose from poverty to become a great American statesman. He was Ohio's first African American member of the U.S. Congress. He was the first African American ever named to the House Appropriations Committee. 
First, first, first, again and again and again, Mr. President. Where a path had not been carved out before, Louis Stokes took the lead and blazed a trail by himself. He was chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, he was chairman of the House Ethics Committee, he was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he was chairman of the historic House committee that investigated the assassinations of President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He was chairman and is currently ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on VA-HUD overseeing $87 billion of our Federal budget. 
For the last 5 years he has been the dean of our State's congressional delegation. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have served for so long with this truly great American, here in the Senate for the last 3 years, as well as the 8 years we served together in the U.S. House of Representatives. So today, Mr. President, I join the people of Ohio in thanking Congressman Lou Stokes for all he has done to move our State and our country forward. 
Louis Stokes's hometown newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, says that he is `A man who, through word and deed, created a legacy of exemplary public service. . . . After his long years of distinguished service, Congress won't be the same without him.' 
Mr. President, how true that is. 
So to our friend, Lou Stokes; his wife, Jay; his children, Shelley, Angela, Louis, Lorene; and his grandchildren, who I know he cherishes so much, Brett, Eric, Grant, Kelley, Kimberley, Alexandra, and Nicolette, thank you very much. Thank you for sharing him with us. We wish you, Congressman Stokes, and your children and your grandchildren and the rest of your family all the best for a wonderful future.

Mr. DeWINE. 
Mr. President, on September 17, 1997, as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I introduced S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This legislation represents a tremendous effort to reshape our country's job training system, eliminate its fragmented and ineffective programs, and prepare it for the new demands of the next century. 
Today, in the same spirit, I introduce the reauthorized Rehabilitation Act and am very pleased to be joined by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Wellstone, Harkin, Frist, Collins, Reed, and Chafee. 
The Rehabilitation Act is the country's only Federally funded job training program for individuals with disabilities. If we are to truly reshape the country's job training programs--and begin to create a seamless system--we must bring all the programs, including vocational rehabilitation, in line with each other. We must link their efforts to train and place individuals. And we must ensure cooperation and awareness among their personnel. 
Reauthorizing the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 gives us the perfect opportunity to ensure that the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system does just that. 
It links the VR system to the states' new job training systems under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
It streamlines the VR system, and eliminates unnecessary and wasteful requirements on state agencies. 
It improves the provision of services that lead to more jobs and better jobs for individuals with disabilities. 
And it reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act for 7 years, to mirror the reauthorization schedule of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
Linking the VR system to states' new workforce systems should not be confused with compromising the integrity of the VR system. Under no circumstances, proposed either in this reauthorization or in S. 1186, will funding for VR be jeopardized or diluted. However, no one should underestimate the importance of cooperation and awareness between the two systems, and the strong statutory links that are necessary to ensure such cooperation. 
Mr. President, let me elaborate on some of the links included in this reauthorization. 
First, one member of a state's State Partnership, under S. 1186, would also be a member of a state's State Rehabilitation Council. State Rehabilitation Councils are responsible for advising state VR agencies and helping them develop the state plan for implementing rehabilitation services. Input from a State Partnership will help assure that the programs do not duplicate each other's efforts. 
Second, a state's VR agency is required to develop cooperative agreements with other components of the state's workforce investment system. These agreements should include: Arrangements for interagency staff training; arrangements to share data electronically regarding labor market information and information on specific job vacancies; arrangements to use common intake procedures, forms, and referral procedures; agreements to share client databases; and arrangements for resolving interagency disputes. 
Third, the Rehabilitation Services Agency Commissioner, who is required to submit a report to Congress and the President on the activities carried out under the Rehabilitation Act for a fiscal year, must now include in his report the same information required in the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
Linking the reporting requirements helps assure that VR and the state workforce systems will be evaluated on the same 
results, including statistics on job placement, job retention six and twelve months after placement, and on how many did or did not complete their training. 
Finally, the bill clearly states that its purpose is to `assist states in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is an integral part of a statewide workforce investment system.' 
After establishing significant links between state workforce systems and state vocational rehabilitation systems, my second objective in this bill is to streamline the existing VR system. For example: 
First, the duplicative and wasteful requirements to develop state plans were removed. For example, the entire concept of a `strategic plan' requiring states to develop already existing or required goals and standards elsewhere is eliminated. In addition to saving time for state administrators, this means that states would no longer have to spend 1.5% of their Federal allotment on the `strategic plan.' In Ohio, this means a savings of close to 3 million dollars--savings the state of Ohio could now spend on providing services and getting people jobs. 
Second, eligibility procedures also have been simplified. Under this reauthorization bill, an individual could demonstrate eligibility for VR services based on information attained from another program with either the same or higher eligibility criteria. Therefore, state agencies would not longer have to reinvent the wheel to determine eligibility for individuals who can already demonstrate it. 
Mr. President, in addition to linkages and streamlining, we have vastly improved the VR system in several ways. 
First, all individuals eligible for VR programming would now receive at least basic services. Current law allows states under an `order of selection' to ignore eligible individuals who have come for job assistance if they do not meet the state's definition of `most severely disabled.' Now, even those disabled individuals who would not otherwise be served must receive at least evaluative services, job placement information, and referral services. A state may opt to provide additional services to these individuals, but not everyone will have access to basic assistance and information. 
Second, individuals' roles in developing their own `Individualized Rehabilitation Employment Plans' have been strengthened. Individuals with disabilities, who will always have the opportunity of working as a team with a VR counselor, will also have more choice as to what their plan will provide. 
Third, the dispute resolution process between clients and state agencies has been vastly improved, ensuring real due process for all parties. No longer will a state VR administrator be allowed to review decisions in which the state agency is always a party. Under this reauthorization bill, it is a state's option to have an administrative review of an initial decision, but this review must be conducted by someone not affiliated with the state VR agency. 
If a state does not have such a review, any appeals from an initial hearing proceed directly to civil court. 
Furthermore, assuming both parties agree, mediation is now an option for either the state VR agency or the individual. 
Finally, one of the most positive changes emphasizes the value of self-employment as a possibility for individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities, together with their VR counselors, can develop plans in which their goal is to be self-employed. It is a step that gives VR clients more choice in how they will live their lives and become more independent members of their communities. 
Before I conclude, Mr. President, I would like to point out the broad bipartisan support for this bill and its link to the Workforce Investment Partnership Act enjoys. Members from both sides of the aisle, the Department of Education, and many interest groups worked together in a very open negotiation to produce this legislation--one that will truly improve the lives of millions of people. 
I thank the Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords; the Ranking Member of the Committee, Senator Kennedy; the Ranking Member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator Wellstone, and my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin for all the work they and their staffs put into this process. I also would like to thank my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist and his staff for his contribution not only in the 105th Congress, but also for his contributions to developing links to our previous workforce bill in the 104th Congress. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful the Senate will approve this legislation soon. Passage of this bill will create a system that will improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and provide opportunities for more jobs. This bill would streamline the VR system, making it more efficient and effective, and couple the vocational rehabilitation system's job training efforts with states' workforce systems' efforts to develop a seamless system of job training.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, H.R. 867, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, is an extremely important piece of legislation. Let me begin by thanking Senators Craig, Chafee, Rockefeller, Jeffords, Coats, Grassley, Moynihan, Landrieu, Chairman Roth, and Senator Lott, the majority leader, who has made this bill a priority. I thank all of them and I thank their staffs for all the hard work they have done. I also want to thank our distinguished House colleagues Representatives Dave Camp and Barbara Kennelly, as well as Chairman Shaw, and their staffs, for their hard work in moving the bill through the House of Representatives. 
This is a significant bill for a number of reasons. 
It will require reasonable efforts to be made to find adoptive homes for children. 
It requires concurrent case planning, which will reduce the amount of time that a child has to wait to be adopted. It would do this by permitting States to develop an alternative permanency plan in case a child's reunification with his family doesn't work out. 
The bill shortens the time line for children in foster care. 
And it reduces interstate geographic barriers to adoption. 
But there is one element of this bill that is especially important--a provision I have been working to enact for over 2 years now. This one provision will save the lives of many children--and ensure that many others get to live in safe, loving, and permanent adoptive homes. 
My staff and I have been involved in the discussion, drafting, negotiation, and adoption of just about every provision in this bill. But I have been working for the passage of this one particular provision for a very long time--and I believe it merits extended discussion in detail. 
This provision is a clarification of the so-called reasonable efforts law, that was first passed in 1980. I introduced this provision as S. 1974 in the 104th Congress, and again as S. 178 in the 105th Congress. 
I have given at least nine speeches on the floor discussing the need for this legislation; chaired one hearing on it; and testified at several others. 
Anyone who is seeking to understand the need for this legislation--and our legislative purpose in passing this bill today--would do well to review my remarks in the Record on those occasions. I will detail--in these remarks today--both the dates of these speeches, and their page citations in the Record for easy reference. 
On May 23, 1996, I held my first press conference to call for a change in the reasonable efforts law. 
On June 4, 1996, I discussed this problem here on the Senate floor. That speech will be found in the Record at page S5710. 
On June 27, 1996, I testified before our colleagues over in the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing on how P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act is a barrier to adoption. 
On July 18, 1996, I introduced S. 1974, a bill to clarify what Congress means by reasonable efforts. I offered the bill the very same day as an amendment to the Senate's welfare reform legislation, but withdrew the amendment because it was not germane. Nevertheless, I continued to talk about this problem, in an effort to create momentum to bring this kind of legislation to the floor. 
My remarks on that occasion will be found at page S8142 of the Record. 
On November 20, 1996, we held a hearing in the Labor and Human Resources Subcommittee on improving the well-being of abused and neglected children. 
When the new Congress reconvened in January of this year, I reintroduced my bill to clarify reasonable efforts, as S. 178. It was my very first order of business in the new Congress. 
On January 21, 1997, I spoke about this on the Senate floor. That can be found in the Congressional Record, page S551. 
On February 14, President Clinton endorsed my reasonable efforts bill. 
On February 24, I spoke about this on the Senate floor--page S1431. 
On March 20, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller introduced another bill to help us build momentum. That bill was titled S. 511, the Safe Adoptions and Family Environments Act. 
On April 8, I testified again in the House Ways and Means Committee on this topic. 
On April 30, H.R. 867, the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416 to 5. This bill, sponsored by Representatives Dave Camp and Barbara Kennelly, included my language to clarify reasonable efforts. I talked about that bill, on the same day that it passed in the House, on the floor of the Senate. Those remarks can be found at S3841. 
Mr. President, I addressed this issue again on the Senate floor on May 1. Those remarks can be found at page S3898, and yet again, on May 5, I spoke about the issue, and those remarks can be found at S3947. 
On May 21, I testified on this issue at a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee. 
On October 1, I addressed this issue on the Senate floor again. Those remarks can be found at page S10262. On October 8, I testified yet again in a hearing before the Finance Committee on the Promotion of Adoption, Safety and Support of Abused and Neglected Children Act, the PASS Act, as it is commonly known. 
Finally, on October 24 of this year, I addressed this issue again on the Senate floor, and those remarks can be found on page S11175. 
The legislation that we will take up in a moment and that I hope we pass today is the culmination of that effort. I have taken the time of the Senate today to outline that history, as I stated a moment ago, because I want to make it very clear what the legislative history is and what the intent was behind that provision of the bill. 
Let me turn now to the need for this provision. 
Let me explain why this provision was the focus of so much attention and why we need this provision. 
We need it, Mr. President, because of an unintended consequence of a bill that was passed by this Congress in 1980. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 included a provision saying that for a State to be eligible for Federal funds for foster care spending, that State must have a child welfare services plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and that plan must be in effect. 
The State plan must provide, and I quote now from the 1980 law, it must provide `that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home.' 
Mr. President, over the last 17 years, since this law went into effect and since this provision became part of our Federal law, this law, tragically, has often been seriously misinterpreted by those responsible for administering our foster care system. 
Too often, reasonable efforts, as outlined in the statute, have come to mean unreasonable efforts. It has come to mean efforts to reunite families which are families in name only. I am speaking now of dangerous, abusive adults who represent a threat to the health and safety and even the lives of these children. 
This law has been misinterpreted in such a way that no matter what the particular circumstances of a household may be, it is argued that the State must make reasonable efforts to keep that family together and to put it back together if it falls apart. I have traveled across the State of Ohio, talking with child service representatives, with judges, other social welfare professionals who have told me about this problem. I have held hearings with experts from other parts of the United States, and we have discovered that this is a truly national problem. 
There can be no doubt that this problem did, in fact, arise because of the 1980 law, and it arose because this 1980 law was and has been for 17 years misinterpreted. Clearly, the Congress of the United States in 1980 did not intend that children should be forced back into the custody of adults who are known to be dangerous and known to be abusive. 
My purpose in making these comments today is to make absolutely certain that this legislation that I believe we are about to pass, H.R. 867, is not misinterpreted. My purpose today is to make sure the bill we are about to pass is not misinterpreted. I intend, therefore, to explain in some detail our purpose in passing this legislation. 
Let me begin, if I can, Mr. President, by reading clause A of H.R. 867, and this is the bill we are about to take up. 
Clause A of this bill says:

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help organ transplant recipients maintain access to drugs that they need to prevent their immune systems from rejecting transplanted organs. This bill is the product of many conversations I have had with folks in the organ and tissue transplant community, including many people from Ohio. 
I have worked with people interested in organ and tissue donation for quite some time to increase awareness and education about transplant issues. Organs are very scarce, and we work hard to raise awareness so we can increase donation. Despite our efforts, more than 55,000 Americans are on the organ transplant waiting list--where they wait, and wait, and some of them die. 
Others are lucky--they get one of the precious organs, allowing them to live a healthier, longer life. Because of the wonderful gift these lucky few have been given, it is particularly tragic that some can't afford the drugs--called immunosuppressive drugs--that help ensure that their immune systems won't reject their new organs. 
That is why I am introducing the `Immunosuppressive Drugs Coverage Act of 1997.' This bill makes sure that the 75,000 people that have received an organ transplant covered by Medicare always have access to immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare currently limits coverage for immunosuppressive drugs to 30 months after a transplant. In 1998, the limit will rise to 36 months under current law. 
But then what? After Medicare coverage ends, the transplant recipient must find some other way to pay for these essential drugs. Many transplant recipients may not be able to get other insurance coverage or be able to afford to pay out-of-pocket for the drugs, which average around $5,000 annually and can cost in excess of $10,000. Without a way to pay for them, these patients may be forced to stop taking the immunosuppressive drugs. Others will ration use of the drugs and take them irregularly. In either case, the risk of rejection for the transplant organ is much greater. 
If a transplanted organ is rejected, the recipient may die or may need intensive, life-sustaining medical care, which Medicare often does pay for. And yet, it won't pay for the drugs to prevent these life-threatening episodes. 
For kidney recipients, who make up the vast majority of Medicare transplant recipients, immune rejection means an immediate return to renal dialysis at a cost to Medicare of around $30,000 a year. For some kidney patients and all other Medicare transplant recipients, rejection means a return to the transplant waiting list, and a need for expensive life-sustaining care. If they are lucky, they will get a second transplant, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
My bill simply makes sure that everyone who receives an organ transplant through Medicare will have continued access to immunosuppressive drugs. This bill will help people who cannot pay for life-preserving immunosuppressive drugs and, at the same time, will help Medicare avoid the huge additional costs currently incurred when organs are rejected. 
When working with people to write this bill, I wanted to make sure the cost was as low as possible, while still getting the job done. That is why my bill contains safeguards that say that if any patient has private insurance coverage, it is the private insurance plan--and not Medicare--that pays for the immunosuppressive drugs. 
Someday, immunosuppressive drugs may not be necessary. We are beginning to see some promising research in this area. But today's transplant recipients need help now. They need this bill. 
The miracle of transplantation gives people the `Gift of Life.' It does not make sense to put this gift at risk because the recipient is unable to pay for immunosuppressive drugs. I urge every Senator to consider cosponsoring and supporting this bill.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished colleague from North Carolina. 
I am delighted to join him, as well as Senator Faircloth and Senator Glenn, in introducing a bill to create the Centennial of Flight Commission. 
In the year 2003, the United States and, indeed, the world will celebrate a truly breathtaking anniversary. That date will mark exactly 100 years of the adventure of human flight. For those of us who are from the State of Ohio, it is an especially important anniversary as Senator Helms has so ably described--first and foremost because the Wright brothers, the very first pioneers of powered flight, were from Dayton, OH. It was in Dayton, OH, that they grew up. It was in Dayton, OH, that they had a print shop. It was in Dayton, OH, that they had the bicycle shop that was referred to a moment ago by Senator Helms. 
It was at Huffman Prairie, in Montgomery County, actually what is now enclosed in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, technically in Greene County, that the Wright brothers learned to fly. So, those of us from Ohio are very proud of the Wright brothers, as this whole country is. 
We are also proud in Ohio that ever since the time of the Wright brothers, Ohio has continued to build a proud aviation history. From the Wright brothers to World War I flying ace David Ingalls, to John Glenn who just walked on to the floor of the Senate, the first man, the first American to orbit the Earth, to Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, to the incredible research being done right now at NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, OH, has continually been a part of the great epic of aviation. 
This is, indeed, cause for celebration, and that is what this bill is all about. It would create a commission to coordinate the centennial of flight celebration in the year 2003. The commission will be composed of 21 members: the Secretaries of the Interior, Transportation, and Defense; the Director of the National Air and Space Museum; the Administrator of NASA; two people from North Carolina; the president and chairman of the First Flight Centennial Commission; and two people from the State of Ohio, the Governor and the chairman of the 2003 Committee, and 12 additional Presidential appointees. 
Madam President, this commission will help the United States take a leadership role in planning international celebrations of the centennial of flight, promoting participation and sponsorship by the aerospace industry, the commercial aviation industry, educational institutions, and State and local governments. 
The commission is going to distribute a calendar, a register of national and international programs and projects concerning the flight centennial. 
What I hope most of all is that these celebrations will recognize that the history of flight is not just the story about machines or about the triumph of technology. It is rather a story about people. It is a story of how human creativity overcame one of the most fundamental barriers that humans ever faced. 
For hundreds of thousands of years, human beings could not fly, but in this century, thanks to the freedom and spirit of creativity in this country, the human race broke the bonds of Earth. So, from Dayton to Kitty Hawk and beyond the limits of our solar system, this is a story to truly celebrate. 
Madam President, I see my distinguished senior Senator from the State of Ohio, the honorable John Glenn, is on the floor. I yield to Senator Glenn.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of a bipartisan group of Senators, led by my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, to introduce the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. Passage of this legislation will lift the last remaining veils of secrecy on one of the darkest periods in human history. 
the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act represents what I hope will be the culmination of work begun in the last Congress to release U.S. Government-held records of Nazi war criminals, the Nazi Holocaust, and the trafficking of Nazi-held assets. 
Just 2 years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, and with it, the Nazis' death grip on an entire continent. Since that time, searingly detailed accounts of the Nazi Holocaust have come to our attention. 
We have learned so much. Yet, if the last few years are any indication, we still have so much more to learn. 
After the fall of Communist rule, Russia and several former Soviet-bloc nations opened volumes of secret files on Nazi war crimes. Argentina has cooperated in the public release of its files. British Government records are being declassified and made available for public scrutiny. And over the past year, Swiss banks and the Swiss Government have been under intense international pressure to make a full accounting of unclaimed funds belonging to Holocaust victims, as well as Nazi assets that may have once belonged to Holocaust victims. 
Mr. President, here at home, our own Government has been gradually making records available about what it knew of Nazi-related activities and atrocities. Earlier this year, a Government-conducted study revealed new information about what the U.S. Government knew regarding the transfer and flow of funds held by Nazi officials. This report found that the U.S. Government was aware that the Nazi mint took gold stolen from European central banks and melted it together with gold obtained in horrible fashion--from tooth-fillings, wedding bands and other items seized from death camp victims. Last Sunday's New York Times detailed newly released Government documents that described how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had melted down and recast hundreds of Nazi-held gold bars. According to the released records, the U.S. Government knew that a good portion of this gold had been looted from the Netherlands and Belgium. It is not known if any of these bars contained gold from Holocaust victims, or to what extent the U.S. Government knew it. 
Mr. President, earlier today, at a press conference to announce the introduction of this legislation, I had on display several aerial U.S. intelligence photographs taken in 1944. The pictures were of Auschwitz, with prisoners being led to the gas chambers. These pictures were discovered by photo analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1978. They confirm what we had heard from the Polish underground that a death camp did in fact exist at Auschwitz. They also demonstrated that our Government had photographs of these camps as these atrocities were occurring. 
These pictures tell a grisly story. How many more exist? With our legislation, we intend to answer that question. 
So, the fact is, the dark tragedy of the Nazi Holocaust, which ended more than 60 years ago, has been unfolding long after these tragic events occurred and is still unfolding with each new release of information. 
Both Congress and the President have taken action to promote the release of Government-held records during this tragic era. On April 17, 1995, the President issued an Executive order calling for the release of national security data and information older 
than 25 years. Last year, thanks to the tireless efforts of my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan and Representative Carolyn Maloney and several others, Congress passed a sense-of-the-Congress resolution, which stated that any U.S. Government agencies should make public any records in its possession about individuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes. The President agreed, noting that learning the remaining secrets about the Holocaust are in the clear public interest. 
The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is designed to put the concerns expressed by the last Congress into strong action. What our bill would do is amend the Freedom of Information Act to establish a presumption that Nazi war criminal records are to be made available to the public. This means that all materials would be required to be released in their entirety unless a Federal agency head concludes that the release of all or part of these records would compromise privacy or national security interests. The agency head must notify Congress of any determination to not release records. 
To facilitate this process, the bill would establish the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group. This working group would to the greatest extent possible locate, identify, inventory, declassify, and make available for the public all Nazi war records held by the United States. 
This pro-active search is necessary because a full Government search and inventory has never been completed. For example, some documents that surfaced this spring were found in holdings related to Southeast Asia. 
Our bill would be targeted toward two classes of Nazi-related materials: First, war crimes information regarding Nazi persecutions; and second, any information related to transactions involving assets of Holocaust and other Nazi victims. 
In summary, what we are trying to do with this bill is strike a clear balance between our Government's legitimate privacy and national security interests and the people's desire to know the truth about Nazi atrocities. These records, once released, will be held in a repository at the National Archives. 
This bill is a bipartisan effort to ensure the Federal Government has done all it can to ensure Holocaust victims and their families can obtain the answers they need. 
Again, this bill is the culmination of years of tireless work by a number of leaders. First, I want to pay special tribute to the Senators from New York--both have worked tirelessly on Holocaust related legislation for years. Senator Moynihan has been a leader in the drive to declassify U.S. Government records and a well-respected historian. He championed the release of the so-called VENONA cables that confirmed that the Soviet Union had an active spy network that had penetrated our Government. I am pleased to be working with Senator Moynihan on a similar endeavor--the cataloging and declassification of as many World War II documents on the Holocaust as possible. 
Senator D'Amato has worked to make public scores of Swiss bank records and lost accounts of Holocaust victims. His efforts inspired us to redraft our legislation to ensure the Federal Government releases records related to the trafficking of Nazi-held assets. 
This bill has the support of the chairmen of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees--respectively, my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my friend from Alabama, Senator Shelby. 
Mr. President, I also would be remiss if I did not mention my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, who serves with me on the Antitrust Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee. He has brought insight on this issue that none of us has. 
Together, with this kind of bipartisan support, I am hopeful we can move this legislation quickly through Congress and to the President early next year. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I intend to make this a priority issue--so that people from my State and across our Nation can have access to the most complete inventory of U.S. Government records on the Holocaust. The clock is running, and time is running out for so many victims of the Holocaust. They, and history itself, deserve to know as much as possible about this tragic chapter in the story of humanity.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill I have introduced. That bill is called the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act. I introduced this legislation in the last Congress and again this year. I introduced it along with my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham. A House companion measure has been introduced by our friend, Congressman Porter Goss. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is to deal with the terrible tragedy within the hemophilia community that was brought about by the HIV contamination of the blood supply and blood products during the 1980's. A number of Americans suffered terrible harm because they relied on the Federal Government to protect the blood supply. 
Mr. President, those of us who are backing this legislation believe that the Federal Government has a moral duty to help these Americans. 
Let me first talk about the role of the Government in this tragedy. 
The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1997 recognizes that the Federal Government has a responsibility for protecting the safety of the blood supply in this country and a responsibility for regulating blood products. 
Mr. President, during the 1980's, our Government failed to meet this obligation to the hemophilia community of this country. The Federal Government failed in its obligation. People affected by hemophilia--children, adults, and the family members who cared for them--had a right to expect the Nation's blood supply system to work. 
That system relies upon many organizations, both public and private. It relies on many organizations to collect and process, distribute, monitor, and regulate the blood supply and blood products. 
Unquestionably, the Federal Government bears the greatest and the ultimate responsibility for blood safety through its surveillance, research, and regulation functions. That is why, Mr. President, in 1973 the Assistant Secretary for Health announced the national--national--blood policy which then became, according to a report by the Office of Technology Assessment, `The focal point around which blood banking policy has evolved over the last decade.' 
Mr. President, this is the U.S. Government's national blood policy--the U.S. Government's national blood policy--a policy the U.S. Government undertook, a policy on which the American people should have been able to rely. The very fact that we have a national policy indicates a level of responsibility, a level of importance and involvement that we really don't see in most other areas of consumer protection. This policy is what gives the Federal Government a unique responsibility for the blood supply in this country. 
Mr. President, these functions--surveillance, regulation, and research on blood--are carried out through the Public Health Service. The Centers for Disease Control hold responsibility for surveillance of potential threats to blood safety. The National Institutes of Health are responsible for biomedical research on emerging threats and improved technologies for prevention. Mr. President, these two agencies work in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, which through its regulatory authority and powers of inspection, product recall, guidelines, and fines, holds primary responsibility for the safety of the blood supply and blood products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Together, Mr. President, these agencies form the backbone of our Nation's blood safety system. 
Mr. President, the awful truth is that this system failed. It failed to protect people with hemophilia or their families from deadly disease. That is why we have introduced this bill. Members of the Senate don't have to just take my word for it nor just the word of the families in the hemophilia community. Rather, in 1993, Mr. President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services opened an investigation, an investigation into the events leading to the transmission of HIV to individuals with hemophilia. 
One of the key questions that was asked and that they were asked to address at the time was this: Did the Government provide an adequate and timely response to the warning signs of the 1980's, the warning signs of HIV as it related to the blood supply in this country? 
The Secretary contracted with the Institute of Medicine, IOM, a private nonprofit organization that provides health policy advice under a congressional charter granted to the National Academy of Sciences. Mr. President, after 18 months of investigation, the IOM published its report in 1995. This report was entitled `HIV and the Blood Supply: An Analysis of Crisis Decisionmaking.' Mr. President, the report found inadequacies in the Government's effort. It found `a failure of leadership' that led to the HIV infection of more than one-half of the Nation's hemophilia population. This IOM report and its panel of experts from across the country found that the 
transmission of the HIV virus and AIDS revealed a weakness in the Federal Government's system for ensuring the safety of the Nation's blood supply. 
The Institute of Medicine was specifically not charged with laying blame, but in its final report it was highly critical of the Government agencies responsible for protecting the safety of the blood system in this country. It identified several areas where the Federal Government specifically failed to curtail the impact of HIV. Mr. President, the IOM found that the Government `consistently adopted the least aggressive options for slowing the spread of HIV within the hemophilia community.' Let me repeat: This report, this official report, found that the Government `consistently adopted the least aggressive options for slowing the spread of HIV within the hemophilia community.' 
Time after time when decisions were made in the face of the unfolding HIV crisis, tragically, the wrong decisions were made about the blood supply. When faced with decisions about deferring donors or recalling products or testing for other known diseases, we know now that the Government officials made the wrong decisions. 
Let me talk about these decisions and about what happened. First, the Federal Government failed to take adequate steps to screen blood donors. Knowing that AIDS was transmitted through blood, the Government did not do all it could, did not do all it could have done to screen blood donors. 
In January 1983 experts at the Centers for Disease Control met with representatives from the other Government agencies to consider available data on the spread of HIV and to develop at that time strategies for prevention. Those experts in the Centers for Disease Control concluded that AIDS was transmitted by sexual contact and through blood, and they made recommendations for enhanced screening of blood donors, including the use of a surrogate hepatitis test to screen for potentially HIV-infected blood. 
In other words, Mr. President, in January 1983 the Government knew that AIDS was transmitted through blood. Now, by that time 12 persons with hemophilia had already been diagnosed with HIV and some 10 deaths had already occurred. 
Let's go back now to that specific meeting in January 1983 that I just referenced. At that meeting, experts from the Centers for Disease Control estimated that intensified screening of blood donors would eliminate over 75 percent of AIDS-infected donors from the blood pool, and they estimated that requiring a surrogate blood screening test would detect 90 percent of donors with AIDS. Tragically, however, Mr. President, both of these recommendations were rejected by the other Government officials at this meeting. These two very specific recommendations were rejected again later that year in December 1983, rejected by the Food and Drug Administration's Blood Products Advisory Committee. These recommendations were never implemented. 
Let me talk about the second fact. Second, Mr. President, the Federal Government failed to recall potentially contaminated blood and blood products. In two separate instances, the FDA missed opportunities to get potentially dangerous products off the shelf. In the first instance, knowing that a blood product might have been made with AIDS-tainted blood, the Government failed to automatically recall that product. In January 1983, the FDA decided not to automatically recall hemophilia clotting-factor products linked to donors suspected of having AIDS supposedly because of concerns about the impact on the availability of clotting factor and its cost. 
In July 1983, FDA failed to act. By the following year, 1984, 83 cases of persons with hemophilia were diagnosed with HIV, and 81 deaths had, by that point in time, occurred. 
In the second instance, Mr. President, knowing that there was now a way to make the blood products safe, the Government failed to take the potentially unsafe products off the market until, incredibly, 4 years had passed. 
Mr. President, by 1985, heat-treated product was available--heat-treated product, meaning that the virus was inactivated. 
Back in the late 1970's, the process of heat treatment of clotting factor had been developed in Europe, providing hope that the HIV virus could be inactivated. Now, while FDA moved quickly through 1983 and 1984 to license new manufacturing processes for the heat treatment of clotting factor, by 1985, heat-treated factor had been as effective in inactivating HIV. However, Mr. President, tragically, the FDA did not act to recall the untreated products. It waited until 1989, some 4 years later. 
Meanwhile, those dangerous products were left on the shelf to cycle through the system, and all that time a method of making those products safe was readily available. 
Let me turn to the third essential fact. Third, Mr. President, the Federal Government failed to act quickly to trace and to notify potential recipients of AIDS-contaminated blood and blood products. Knowing that transmission of HIV-infected blood products led to HIV infection, knowing some of the blood was contaminated, and knowing people were using it, the Government failed to immediately notify the people who were at risk. Recipients became infectious immediately, but appeared healthy, of course, for approximately 4 or 5 years, during which time their spouses or sexual partners were at risk of acquiring HIV. If nothing else, Mr. President, once the signals were clear, the Government should have done more to alert people to these risks not just to their own health, but to the health of their loved ones, their spouses, and their children. 
It was in 1988 that President Reagan issued a Presidential directive to formulate Federal policy for tracing the recipients of possibly infected blood products. 
However, tragically, the FDA did not issue recommendations for patient notification until 1991--some 3 years later. Now, by that time, 2,040 persons with hemophilia had been diagnosed with HIV, and more than 1,500 members of the hemophilia community in this country had died of HIV. For the hemophilia community, Government action came too late--much too late. 
Mr. President, these are the reasons why I believe that this country and this Congress has a moral obligation to help these families. Our Ricky Ray bill would authorize the establishment of a trust fund to provide $125,000 in compassionate payment to eligible individuals or families of persons with hemophilia and AIDS. The trust fund would be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and would sunset 5 years after it is funded. 
Mr. President, approximately 7,200 people with hemophilia--nearly half of all persons with hemophilia in the United States--were infected with HIV through the use of blood clotting products. 
These products came from as many as 20,000 donors, sometimes even more. These concentrates expose individuals with inherited bleeding disorders to a high risk of infection by blood-borne viruses, such as hepatitis. 
Because of the hemophilia community's reliance on blood products, the Centers for Disease Control monitors the hemophilia community to aid in the detection of emerging viruses or pathogens that could affect all Americans. Problems in the blood supply tend to show up in the hemophilia community first--so they serve really as a kind of `distant early warning system' for our blood supply. It is a crude but accurate comparison to say that this community is the proverbial `canary in the mine shaft.' They serve in that function for the rest of us. 
During the 1980's, when the Nation's blood supply and blood-derived products became contaminated with the AIDS virus, HIV was detected in three men with hemophilia, providing early evidence that this disease could be transmitted through blood--thus affecting a far broader cross-section of our population. We now know that this was to mean the devastation of the hemophilia community. 
Mr. President, more than 80 percent of people with severe hemophilia and half of all persons with hemophilia were infected with HIV during the 1980's through the use of HIV-contaminated blood products. In some cases, due to a lack of education and outreach, their wives, husbands, children, and partners became infected as well. 
The impact of HIV on the Nation's hemophilia population has been truly devastating. The HIV contamination of the blood supply has caused significant emotional and financial losses to these families. 
Our bill would make a gesture of compassion to these American families. It would also acknowledge that the 
Government played a role in this crisis and, therefore, has incurred some obligation. 
Eligible individuals, or their families, would be required to document the use of blood products between July 1982 when the first cases of persons with hemophilia contracted AIDS were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and December 1987, when the last manufacturer recall of blood products occurred. 
This bill, which has been referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee, already has the bipartisan support of 35 Members of this body. 
In coming to the Senate floor this evening, it is my hope that I will be able to answer some of the questions that have been raised about this bill, and to ask those of our colleagues who have not yet cosponsored this bill to consider doing so after hearing the facts that I will be laying out in a moment. 
Let me talk for a minute about how I came to introduce this bill. In doing that, let me tell you a little bit about the bill's name sake--Ricky Ray. Ricky Ray and his brothers were born with hemophilia. This is a rare genetic condition, impairing the ability of blood to clot effectively. This disorder affects, today, about 20,000 Americans. 
People with hemophilia historically had a short lifespan and typically faced numerous hospital stays and complications. 
Hemophilia was also frequently associated with crippling. Persons with hemophilia would suffer internal bleeding, leading eventually to the destruction of their joints and muscle tissues, because no effective treatment existed. 
But this changed in the 1970's, with the development of clotting factor concentrates, which are derived from blood. It was also changed by the introduction of comprehensive care that allowed many individuals with hemophilia to begin to manage their bleeding episodes at home. 
Clotting factor eliminated the need for frequent and costly hospitalization and ensured that even persons with severe hemophilia would be able to attend school, obtain full-time employment, and enjoy greatly increased life expectancy. Clotting factor changed the lives of persons with hemophilia, especially for children like the Rays, who, unlike their grandfathers and uncle, could now see a future involving a long and healthy life. 
When clotting factor was introduced, it was treated as a miracle drug. People were encouraged to use it not just in case of a life-threatening bleed but also as a part of their daily lives--a preventive measure. It is just a slight exaggeration to say that people were encouraged to treat early and to treat often. 
The great promise of this new treatment, however, proved short lived when, tragically, it was found to be an effective means to transmit the virus known as HIV. Ricky Ray was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1986. He was only 9 years of age. He had contracted HIV through the use of this remarkable new treatment, this clotting factor. His two brothers contracted HIV as well and so did 72 other members of the hemophilia community across this country. 
Ricky Ray and his brothers were kicked out of school. They were kicked out of school because of their HIV status, and then, when their parents won a decision in court to readmit them, arsonists set their house on fire. Instead of giving in to anger, Ricky Ray became a spokesperson promoting understanding about HIV. And he did this until his death in 1992 at the age of 15. 
I personally became involved with the hemophilia community when I met a father from Ohio whose son Christopher had severe hemophilia. John Williams was the primary caregiver for his son. John accompanied Christopher to his doctor's appointments and learned how to infuse his child with the medicine that would 
control his bleeding disorder. John also shared anguish and pain with his 8-year-old little boy when he then later was diagnosed with AIDS. 
John was determined, as all parents would be, to help Christopher survive. John accompanied Christopher to the National Institutes of Health campus every few weeks for the latest in treatment options and breakthrough technologies. 
Throughout this experience, the constant thought in the father's mind was that he had infused his own son with the medicine that would eventually kill him. He often thought that he had been negligent in some way. Had he perhaps missed a crucial piece of information that could have saved Christopher? Had he missed an important news story or warning? Was there anything he could have done to save his son? 
For 5 years, the father, John, shared in his young son's battle. Then in October 1994, Christopher died of complications from AIDS. He had just entered the 10th grade and was contemplating college plans, a dream that, of course, was never fulfilled. 
This legislation is really about people. It is about people and their strength in facing tragedy, the devastation of an entire community of people that today has come to be represented by a courageous boy from Florida by the name of Ricky Ray. 
The concerns that I raise today have been raised repeatedly by the hemophilia community in this country. Unfortunately, the legal system has not been an effective means to address these concerns nor to provide the assistance to infected individuals, and there are several reasons why. 
The first has to do with what's called blood shield laws. Whenever the Federal Government writes product liability laws of any kind, we in the Congress insert a standard exemption for blood and blood products. We, therefore, defer to the States to regulate in this area, and in doing so we affirm the State blood shield laws that are prevalent throughout this country. 
Forty-seven different State jurisdictions have exempted blood and blood products from strict liability or implied warranty claims on the basis that blood and blood products are services, not products. Now, this classification is more than just a question of semantics. It means that plaintiffs must prove negligence rather than simply use of the blood was the proximate cause of the injury they suffered, which is the standard for other products. 
In 1976, blood banks began receiving exemptions from liability even under a negligence standard with the passage of blood shield laws. In 1977, the courts began extending this exemption from liability to blood product manufacturers on similar grounds. They did all of this because the States believed the need for an available blood supply, for surgery and other medical procedures, outweighed the relatively minor risk of hepatitis. The rationale was that blood product manufacturers should be exempt from product liability, since blood products are unavoidably unsafe, because the risk of hepatitis simply could not be eliminated. 
There is a much higher standard of proof for consumers of blood and blood products. The ability of individuals in this community, the hemophilia community, therefore, to seek resolution in the court system has been severely curtailed by these State blood shield laws. 
If that were not enough, there are other legal problems confronting these hemophilia victims and their families. Just a couple of examples. First, collecting evidence for suits against manufacturers is extraordinarily difficult. Most individuals that became infected with HIV had a severe form of hemophilia that meant they were infusing thousands of units of clotting factor on a monthly and sometimes weekly basis. These individuals were understandably unable to determine exactly from which manufactured lot the product that infected them came. 
Second, hemophilia families also face the problem of statute of limitations. All States have them, and they prohibit individuals from prevailing in litigation if the suit was not filed within a few years of the alleged tort. To the hemophilia community, many individuals were diagnosed after the prescribed period in the statute of limitations and were unable to take any action. 
Just as significantly, they are also battling a disease with a long and often symptom-free incubation period. This makes statutes of limitation even less defensible and imposes a much greater burden on this community. 
All this does not mean that the hemophilia community, these people who have suffered so, has not tried. They have. Hundreds of suits have been filed against the manufacturers of clotting factor. In some States the hemophilia community has even been successful in rolling back the statute of limitations. 
Recently, many members of the hemophilia community gave up their right to continue to pursue the manufacturers through the courts, and they did this by agreeing to a class action settlement. 
This settlement brings recognition to the HIV infection of the hemophilia community and provides some relief to the community for their suffering. But this is not to say that the community was holding out until recently for something better. Victims were unable to meet the especially high liability standards established by the blood shield laws. It appears that increasing momentum for the Ricky Ray bills in the House and Senate pushed the negotiations into a final phase. 
Senators may ask about the private settlement proposal as offered by four manufacturers of clotting factor concentrates in 1996, an offer that was made in April 1996. This settlement, which has been approved by the U.S. District Court of Northern Illinois, will provide each person infected with HIV through the use of clotting factor $100,000. The settlement proposal was drafted so the payment would be contingent upon obtaining certain protections for recipients receiving means-tested benefits such as Medicaid. 
So for this reason, when we reintroduced the Ricky Ray bill this year, I included a second title in the bill to protect the eligibility for individuals receiving Medicaid and SSI upon receipt of the settlement claim. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a provision related to the private settlement protecting the eligibility of individuals receiving Medicaid benefits. Unfortunately, no similar protection for SSI eligibility was included. 
I support the settlement between the hemophilia community and the manufacturers of clotting factor and see it as the first step in addressing the ongoing responsibility that the companies have to the community they serve. I do not believe that the victims--in looking for compensation--should be limited to seeking from private companies. This should not be an exclusive remedy. It should not be seen as an exclusive remedy, very bluntly, because the Government shares the blame. And private settlements are inadequate. 
As to the specific figure at which we have arrived--$125,000--I think this is an eminently reasonable compensation, when you consider that the average cost of care for patients with severe hemophilia--per year--is $100,000. 
Let's look at how some other governments have dealt with this problem.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a resolution introduced by the Governor of Ohio, George Voinivich, to commemorate National POW/MIA Day, which took place on September 19, 1997. That day last month and more important, the issue itself, are of great importance to all Americans, especially to those that served our country in military missions abroad. 
As of today 2,116 Americans are classified as either prisoners of war or missing in action (POW/MIA) from the Vietnam war. Thousands more remain missing and unaccounted for from the Korean war and even the Second World War. The families and friends of these soldiers still have to endure the awful uncertainty concerning their fate. Every effort must be made to determine the fate of these soldiers. In the case of Vietnam, I am hopeful that the normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam and the reopening of the American Embassy will encourage the government of Vietnam to fully cooperate with American officials in their search to gain the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's. I strongly encourage the President and the Ambassador to Vietnam to give the POW/MIA issue top priority and insist that the Vietnamese Government disclose all pertinent information on American POW/MIA's. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that last month's POW/MIA Day, and Governor Voinivich's eloquent resolution will serve to heighten American awareness and inform foreign governments of the United States' serious commitment to bringing our soldiers home. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the State of Ohio's POW/MIA Recognition Day resolution be inserted in the Congressional Record.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a story that appeared last week in the Cincinnati Post. This is the story. The headline is: `Woman Torched Nephew, Police Say--Youngster's Burns Untreated for Weeks' 
Mr. President, the article tells the story of the awful abuse of an 8-year-old child in the Cincinnati area. The boy was set on fire--set on fire--with nail polish remover, and then sent to school for 3 weeks with his burns unattended. 
Cincinnati police investigated what happened to this little boy. They have now charged his aunt with child endangering. They charged his aunt with setting him on fire--and also with abusing him with a belt, an extension cord, and shoes. 
Mr. President, this is an obscene crime. After this woman's arrest, it was revealed that she had been charged with a similar crime involving the same little boy 2 years before. Don't we have to ask, Mr. President, what on Earth was that woman doing taking care of that child or any child? Why in the world was that child put back into that same home, put back with that abusive woman? 
Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, I rose on the Senate floor to tell a similar tragic story. That story took place in Washington, DC. It was the story of a little 4-year-old girl named Monica Wheeler who was found dead, beaten to death in the bathroom of a man who was an acquaintance of her mother. Three years ago, one of Monica's siblings, her brother Andre, then aged 2, was also found dead in the same man's bathroom. 
Mr. President, as I have come to the floor and cautioned before, it is up to the police and the courts to find out the truth about these particular cases. And we should not be interested in prosecuting anyone here on the Senate floor, no matter what we think. That certainly is what the courts are for. But I cannot stress enough that these awful crimes point to a responsibility that lies with us here in Congress, the responsibility to make sure we do all we can to stop these crimes from ever happening. 
One thing we know for certain about these two cases--the Cincinnati case and the Washington case, and far too many other cases--is that there are too many children in this country today being returned to the care of people who have already abused and battered them, people who should not be allowed to take care of these children. Children are being returned to homes that are homes in name only and to parents who are parents in name only. 
Every day in this country, three children actually die of abuse or neglect at the hands of a parent or their caretakers. That is approximately 1,200 children a year who die. And almost half of these children, shockingly, Mr. President, are killed after--after--their tragic circumstances have come to the attention of the child welfare agencies. 
At the end of 1996, Mr. President, over 525,000 children were in foster homes across this country. Over a year's time, it is estimated that 650,000 children will be in a foster home for at least a portion of that year. And shockingly, roughly 25 percent of the children in the foster care system at any one time will languish in foster care longer than 4 years. And 10 percent of these children will be in foster care longer than 7 years. 
Mr. President, this problem has been growing for many years. It is at least in part the very unintended consequence of a law passed by Congress in 1980, a law that I have spoken on this floor I suppose at least a dozen times about since I came to the Senate. It is a law that was passed in 1980 that requires that reasonable efforts always be made to reunify families. In practice, Mr. President, this law has resulted in unreasonable efforts, unreasonable efforts being made to reunite families that are families in name only, families that never should be reunited. Children are being sent back to abusive parents, abusive care givers, and many times the result is death. 
Mr. President, I have been working to change this for almost 3 years now. Last month, along with Senators Chafee, Craig, and Rockefeller, and others, I introduced a bill that I hope will represent the culmination of this effort. The PASS Act--the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act--would make a difference. It would save young lives. It would change this 1980 law that I referenced. It would put an end to a tragic policy that has put parents' interests above the health and safety and even the survival of innocent children. 
It would help child welfare agencies move faster to rescue these children. Mr. President, every child deserves a better fate than being shuttled from foster home to foster home for years on end. 
That is why, Mr. President, we are working to pass this very important bill. Let us work together, after we pass the bill, then on the next step, which will be to continue to try to improve the system. 
But the work that is in front of us today, Mr. President, is to pass the PASS Act, a bill that has been worked on extensively, a bill that will in fact benefit children in two ways: One, by moving them quickly through the system once they are in fact in foster care so that they do not languish in foster care for years on end so that they can have what every child needs, which is a caring and loving family; and the second thing the bill would do is save lives. We will never know what child's life will be saved or how many, but I am convinced, after talking with caseworkers throughout the State of Ohio, children service agencies, and after having talked to many people throughout this country, that the 1980 law that our bill will amend will in fact, by amending that law, save lives. 
So I urge my colleagues, when this bill is brought to the floor, as I hope it will be in the next several weeks, to look at this bill, to pass it, and to move on so that we can make a very strong statement and do something very positive for America's children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to draw the attention of my colleagues to a very sad, unnecessary controversy involving the Government of the United States and the Government of China, a controversy which also involves a little 3-year-old girl. 
Mr. President, this is the sad story. A Chinese woman living in Cleveland was diagnosed with schizophrenia. For many reasons, including this diagnosis, it was clear that this woman was not capable of taking care of her daughter. In fact, they had both been evicted from a Salvation Army shelter because of concerns that the mother was mistreating the daughter. Evidence showed that the child had been seriously neglected. So the court stepped in and sent this child into foster care. By the time this little girl was 16 months old, tragically, she has been in four foster homes. 
The natural mother was allowed visiting rights. During one of these visits she abducted the child and took her to the People's Republic of China. In June 1997, Mr. President, the Ohio court permanently terminated the birth mother's rights and awarded legal custody of Mei Mei--this little girl's name--to Mei Mei's foster mother. Since last October, the foster mother, the legal guardian of this child, has been trying, naturally, to get Mei Mei back. She wants to adopt Mei Mei, but her efforts thus far have not been successful. 
Mr. President, I urge President Clinton to raise the issue of this little child with the Chinese President when they meet. There is an adoptive family waiting in Ohio for Mei Mei. They love her and they will be able to take good care of her. I hope this problem can be resolved in a positive and expeditious way. Therefore, I urge the President to raise this at the highest level between our countries. 
A few minutes ago on the floor I circulated a letter--and a number of my colleagues have already signed it--to send to President Clinton urging him to bring the matter up. 
Mr. President, sometimes it is easy, as we debate issues, to lose the personal sense about these horrible cases. Sometimes we hear about statistics and sometimes we hear about stories of bad things occurring, such as I have just related. 
To try to bring it home, though, and put a more personal face on it, let me read just one paragraph that was written by the foster mother who wants to adopt Mei Mei. This is what she writes: 
We have been applauded for our dedication and uninterrupted love for Mei Mei. I can honestly tell you, however, that it was not difficult. When a child enters your life and needs to be held, you hold them. You teach them to laugh, you teach them that you are there, you teach them to be gentle, you teach them that everything in life is beautiful. And then when they start to see that life is not something to be just tolerated but rather to be enjoyed, they develop a sparkle in their eye, which fuels your love further for them. That's what happened with us and with Mei Mei. 
So I urge, again, Mr. President, that our President, President Clinton, bring this matter up with the Chinese. It is a small matter, I suppose. But it is a little girl; it is her life. She has an opportunity for a loving family to raise her. She was snatched away from that opportunity by a woman who has clearly demonstrated that she is unfit to take care of this little girl. So I urge the President, as he discusses issues with the Chinese, to raise the issue of Mei Mei. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and at this point I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to discuss today an important issue involving the FDA. First, let me congratulate my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, for his fine work on the legislation that he has just introduced. This bill that Senator Hutchinson has introduced would prevent the FDA from implementing a proposed rule that is harmful and unnecessary. 
Mr. President, this is the story. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration issued a proposed rule to accelerate the phaseout of metered-dose inhalers that are propelled by chlorofluorocarbon gases, commonly known as `CFC's.' Essentially, Mr. President, the FDA has proposed to ban from the market safe and effective medicines that millions of Americans use to help them breathe. For many patients, these medicines mean, quite literally, the difference between life and death. 
This FDA proposed ban is not based on concerns of safety, but rather the ban on these inhalers was put forward on the grounds that inhalers that use CFCs deplete the Earth's ozone layer. Now, the fact is, Mr. President, that these inhalers have only a minimal effect on ozone depletion. Asthma inhalers account for only a very small part of this problem. It is estimated that asthma inhalers account for less than 1.5 percent of the total problem. 
Perhaps more important, Mr. President, the companies that make these inhalers have already agreed to develop new CFC-free devices by the year 2005--the deadline that was previously set forth in the international Montreal Protocol. These companies are working hard to bring these products to the market quickly and, in fact, they think they will beat the 2005 year deadline. 
So I think, Mr. President, it's clear that the FDA's proposed rule to accelerate the phaseout of these products yields no significant benefit to the global environment. What it will do, however, is take away essential medications from Americans who depend on these inhalers to manage serious respiratory illnesses. 
Mr. President, over 30 million Americans suffer from some type of respiratory disease, including asthma. Many of these patients rely on a combination of inhalers to be able to function normally. The FDA's proposed policy would limit their treatment options and force them to switch from proven treatment regimens that have been carefully adjusted to control their symptoms. 
Mr. President, asthma is a serious national health problem. The morbidity and mortality rates from asthma continue to increase in the United States, particularly among minority and inner-city children. Mr. President, I think we have to question the FDA's judgment in putting forth a proposal that puts these patients at further risk. I hope others will agree with me as well. 
Mr. President, the FDA has already received over 10,000 letters from patients, providers, and health care organizations expressing concern about this issue. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of this country, wrote the following:  
This proposal will adversely impact patient health, while providing negligible environmental benefit. 
Dr. Koop went on to state: 
Any efforts to limit the medications available to asthma patients and their physicians would be a serious mistake that would lead to severe consequences for American asthmatics. 
Mr. President, there is another aspect to this whole issue. Under the proposed guideline, the FDA would remove from the market products that have been tested and labeled for use in children and replace them with CFC-free versions that while containing the same active ingredients have not been tested or approved for use by children. They have not been tested or approved for pediatric use. Mr. President, asthma is the leading cause of chronic illness among children--5 million children suffer from asthma today. How in the world can the FDA remove products from the market which are proven to be safe and effective for children while at the same time the FDA laments the lack of adequately labeled products for children? It just doesn't make sense. 
Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration is charged with protecting the health and well-being of American citizens. It seems incomprehensible to me that it could put forth a proposal that secures really negligible environmental benefits at a potentially steep cost to human lives and health. I urge the FDA to reconsider its proposal. The health of millions of Americans who depend on metered-dose inhalers is too important. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I make the following statement this morning on behalf of the majority leader. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 2:30 this afternoon. At 2:30 the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the ISTEA legislation. As the leader announced before the recess, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session. The leader further hopes the Senate will be able to make progress on this important legislation regarding highway construction and highway safety programs. As Members are aware, the first session of this Congress will be concluding before too long and there is much work left to be done. This week the Senate must act on a continuing resolution as we attempt to pass the remaining appropriations bill and conference reports. As the conferences finish their work, the full Senate awaits these conference reports. The majority leader encourages all Senators to cooperate as we schedule the remaining legislative period. 
The majority leader also reminds colleagues that typically these closing weeks of session are some of the busiest. Senators should be prepared, therefore, for busy sessions with rollcall votes occurring each day unless other notification is given. The majority leader thanks all Senators for their attention. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Mack amendment. I, of course, therefore will oppose the motion to table. This amendment will ensure that fundamental principles of fairness are respected in regard to the cases of some 316,000 immigrants, some of them from Central America. 
In the immigration bill Congress passed last year, we changed the criteria for suspension of deportation. Certain retroactive changes in that bill, at least as they have been interpreted by the INS, had the unintended effect of applying these new criteria to applications of suspension for deportation which were already in the pipeline when the bill was passed. 
The Mack amendment will ensure that those immigrants whose cases were in the pipeline when the 1996 immigration law took 
effect will have their cases decided according to the criteria in effect at the time that the law actually passed. It is only fair that we should not change the rules in midstream for these worried immigrants. 
Let me take us back to the 1980's when we granted these 316,000 Central American immigrants temporary protection from deportation. We knew at that time the terrible consequences of war--the grinding poverty, human rights abuses that had driven these men, women, and, yes, children, to our shores. 
At that time, we told these immigrants that their protection from deportation would be permanent if certain conditions were met--that is what we told them then--7 years of continuous residency, good behavior, proof of extreme hardship awaiting them in their native country. We basically said, `As long as you can prove that, then this will be permanent.' 
When Congress changed the law in 1996, we clearly did not intend to change the rules for these people who already, at that time, were in the pipeline. We, in essence, had made a commitment to them. We, in essence, had made a deal with them, and I don't believe we should go back on that deal today. 
Mr. President, the Mack amendment would keep faith with these individuals. It is not, as my colleagues from Florida have already pointed out, an automatic grant of amnesty, nor is it an automatic grant of permanent residency. Far from it. It is merely a restoration of the original conditions these immigrants have to fulfill if we are going to allow them to remain in this country. 
I had the opportunity this morning to participate in a press conference concerning this issue. I also had the opportunity a few months ago to travel to Nicaragua. I had made several visits to Nicaragua in the 1980's, about a decade ago. For me to go back to Nicaragua a few months ago was a very pleasant experience, and it was pleasant because I had seen where Nicaragua was. I had the opportunity a few months ago to see where Nicaragua is today. Yes, it is still the second-poorest country in this hemisphere and, yes, there is high unemployment and, yes, there are many, many problems. But what we see in Nicaragua today is a fledgling democracy. We see a country that is becoming what we envisioned and had hoped for and worked for in the 1980's, and that is a democracy. 
Today, for the first time in history, all five Central American countries are democratic; all five are working to bring about the reforms that truly are an example of democracy. 
When I traveled to Nicaragua, I had the opportunity to speak with then President-elect, now President Aleman and talked to him about his vision for his country. 
One of the unintended consequences of the bill we passed in 1996, and one of the unintended consequences of the deportation of these 316,000 immigrants would be that we would strike a hard blow against democracy in Nicaragua and El Salvador and the other Central American countries. Anyone who has looked at these countries today understands what an economic impact and political impact it would have if all these citizens, all of these individuals were instantly returned to their native countries. 
The ability to absorb these individuals simply does not exist. It does not exist from an economic point of view. Further, this would take away a major source, frankly, of income to these countries, a major source of help to the economy, not United States foreign aid, but rather the remittances that are sent back by Nicaraguans who are living in the United States. Those remittances are a major contribution to the Nicaraguan economy today. To take that away, I think, would have a very severe and devastating blow to the economy of Nicaragua and the economy of the other Central American countries. 
That is not the principal reason to support the Mack amendment, but it is a fact, and it is a fact of life. 
The central reason to support the Mack amendment is what has been stated on this floor by Senator Mack on several occasions, as well as Senator Graham, and that simply is this is a matter of equity, it is a matter of fairness, it is a matter of keeping our word, and it is a matter of doing what is right. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Mack amendment and, therefore, vote against the motion to table the Mack amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a story on the front page of last Thursday's Washington Post. This article tells the story of the beating death of a little 4-year-old girl, a little girl by the name of Monica Wheeler in Washington, DC. Monica was found dead in the bathroom of a man who was an acquaintance of her mother's. The police have ruled her death a homicide. In addition to being severely battered, Monica was suffering from malnutrition and showed signs of genital bleeding. 
Now, Mr. President, 3 years ago, one of Monica's siblings, her brother, Andre, then age 2, was also found dead--in the same man's bathroom. That earlier death was ruled at that time an accidental drowning, but the police now are reopening that case. 
Mr. President, it is up to the police and the courts to find out the truth about this particular tragedy. But one thing we know for certain is that there are far too many children returned to the care of people who have already abused and battered them, people who should not be allowed to take care of children at all. We know this occurs time and time again across this great country of ours. 
Mr. President, every day in America three children actually die of abuse and neglect at the hands of their parents or their caretakers. That is over 1,200 children every year. 
And almost half of these children are killed after--after--their tragic circumstances have already come to the attention of local child welfare agencies. 
Mr. President, at the end of 1996, over 525,000 children were in foster homes. Over a year's time, it is estimated that over 650,000 children will spend some time in foster homes. Shockingly, 25 percent of the children in the foster care system at any one given point in time will languish in foster care longer than 4 years--25 percent of the kids. Ten percent will be in foster care longer than 7 years. 
This problem has been brewing for many years. It is, at least in part, the unintended consequence of a law passed by this Congress in 1980, a law requiring that reasonable efforts 
be made to reunify families. In practice, this law has resulted in unreasonable efforts, unreasonable efforts, Mr. President, being made to reunite families that are really families in name only, families that simply never should be reunited. 
I have been working to change this for almost 3 years now. About 10 days ago, along with Senator Chafee, Senator Craig and Senator Rockefeller, I introduced a bill that I hope will represent the culmination of this effort. The PASS Act--the acronym we have given to it stands for the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act--would make a difference. It would, Mr. President, save young lives. It would put an end to a tragic policy that has put parents' interests above the health, the safety, and yes, even the survival of innocent children. 
Mr. President, it would help child welfare agencies move faster to rescue these children. Every child deserves a better fate than being shuttled from foster home to foster home for years on end. That is why, Mr. President, we are working to pass this important bill. 
Once this bill is passed, Mr. President, then let's work together on the next step in the continuing battle for our children's right to live in safe, stable, permanent and loving homes. 
Mr. President, the tragedy of this little child who died in Washington, DC, a few day ago, this little 4-year-old girl, Monica Wheeler, should not be repeated. I think we have an obligation in this Congress to move as quickly as possible to change a 1980 law that has done a lot of good but that frankly had an unintended consequence. That unintended consequence is that children, even after there is evidence of abuse, even after there is not just evidence, even after there is overwhelming indication of abuse, children are placed back in homes time and time and time again. One of the reasons that occurs is because of the 1980 law. 
We must act, Mr. President, to clarify that law, to clarify the reasonable efforts requirement of the law, so that the safety of children will always be paramount, and that these tragedies will be eliminated. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of a very valuable community organization in Cincinnati, OH. 
The group--known as Black Career Women, or BCW--has been serving the African-American community in Cincinnati and throughout the United States for 20 years. Back in the early 1980's, BCW provided word processing assistance and office-skill development services to unemployed and underemployed women--to help them get decent jobs with a living wage. 
This nonprofit organization provides an extremely valuable service to corporations and managers who are trying to develop and support successful skills-development strategies for African-American women. Working in partnership with executives, BCW has helped improve the lives of countless women from corporate executives to entrepreneurs. 
Over the last two decades, more than 10,000 women have benefited from the service of Black Career Women. 
Black Career Women has been helping the African-American women in the Cincinnati area and throughout the Nation achieve the goals of self-help and self-determination. They deserve the praise of all people who believe in diversity, economic progress, and independence for working people. 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in extending our warmest congratulations on their 20th anniversary. They are making a big difference for the better in the life of the Cincinnati area and the entire nation.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wish to make some comments about one particular element of this year's FDA reform bill--one that I believe is especially important and valuable. 
I want to thank Chairman Jeffords and my colleagues for including in this bill a revised version of the Better Pharmaceutical for Children Act (S. 713). Senator Dodd and I introduced this bill earlier this year because an overwhelming majority of pharmaceuticals currently on the market have not been tested for safety or effectiveness in children. 
In fact, Mr. President, a shocking 80 percent of the drugs that are on the market today have never been tested for children. 
We need to provide our young people with prescription drugs that have been studied for their effects on children's bodies and appropriately labeled with doses suitable for young ages. Too many children today are taking adult-size drugs because we don't have a comprehensive strategy to test drugs to determine appropriate dosages for children. 
Children deserve better than this. Children deserve he same assurance adults have--that the drugs they take are safe and effective. 
Section 618 of the FDA reform bill includes a modified version of the bill Senator Dodd and I have worked so hard on. It provides an additional 6 months of market exclusivity to drug manufacturers who complete requested or required pediatric studies on drugs that are useful for children. This exclusivity will act as financial incentive for manufacturers to do research on their products for young patients. 
As our legislation with incentives came close to final passage, the FDA proposed a rule to mandate pediatric studies. The rule was proposed last month and would require pediatric studies for most new drugs and for many drugs that are already on the market. 
When the administration released its new regulation, I applauded their decision to join Senator Dodd and myself in trying to fix this problem. I offered to work with them in a bipartisan way to combine the proposals for the benefit of the Nation's children. The legislation before us today does just that, and in essence combines our bill along with the administration's proposal. 
We have adapted the legislation that Senator Dodd and I originally introduced so that it will work with the FDA's regulation. To ensure that we do the best that we can for children, we have combined the two approaches to this problem: the financial incentives from the better pharmaceuticals for children bill and the mandates from the proposed FDA rule. 
We're now moving in the right direction. This combined approach may not yet be perfect, but we can still work on it. I have extended an invitation to all interested parties to continue to work toward a better compromise between now and conference. The most important thing is to get it right. I think this compromise between a market-based approach and mandates goes a long way toward that. 
Time is of the essence in ensuring that children and their doctors have the information they need to safely and effectively use pharmaceuticals. Providing market incentives to manufacturers will help speed this process along. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to again congratulate Chairman Jeffords for the tremendous job that he has done over a long period of time in bringing this bill to the floor. This is a good FDA reform bill. The `Better Pharmaceuticals for Children' section is only one of many creative, practical steps this bill makes and takes in the right direction. 
The reform bill makes commonsense changes that will help patients get access to new medical technologies. At the same time, Mr. President, it maintains assurances that products are safe and that they are effective. 
Again, I applaud Chairman Jeffords for this bill. I look forward to its speedy passage.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment recognizes that there are arts programs, arts projects, that are of national significance and that they should be supported. The amendment does this while at the same time addressing the huge geographic disparity in funding that the NEA elite, the NEA bureaucracy, has consistently and arrogantly refused to address or, for that matter, even to acknowledge. 
This inequality in funding is unconscionable. When you have States such as New York getting $21 million from the NEA, California, $8 million, while States such as Ohio with our 11 million citizens receiving only $1.6 million, clearly something is horribly wrong. 
Ohio comes in 46th in per capita NEA funding. New York gets $1.18 per person; Wyoming, $1.24, Alaska, $1.21. Ohio gets 14 cents per person. 
Again and again, the NEA has failed to address this problem. Let me say this failure on the NEA's part points to broader problems at the NEA. For years now, Congress has been trying to set priorities for the NEA but nothing really has changed. I have grown increasingly frustrated because of the seeming ease with which the NEA flouts congressionally enacted policies. It sometimes seems as if the NEA uses as much, or maybe more, creativity in skirting our guidelines as NEA-funded artists do in creating their works. 
The NEA funds do support a number of worthwhile projects. 
However, I believe that NEA funding should really be targeted for programs for children and for underserved populations. Our scarce Federal dollars should be used to bring the arts to our children and to the poor. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Gorton, for including language in the underlying bill to indicate this priority, and also to Senator Jeffords for including it in the authorizing bill. 
I certainly hope the NEA takes today's debate seriously. If, however, the NEA continues to remain unresponsive to legitimate concerns, concerns voiced by the people who are paying the bills, we can certainly expect even more support for moves to abolish the endowment outright. That, Mr. President, would be a great shame--for everyone who loves the arts, and indeed for all Americans. It would be a shame that the greatest country in the world, with some of the most talented and creative artists in the world, could not intelligently and responsibly run a national arts agency. 
Mr. President, we can--and must--do better.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I have spent the last few years examining our Federal job training programs. During this examination, it has become clear to me as well as many others, that these programs are in dire need of reform. The status quo is just plain unacceptable. 
What we are faced with today is a fragmented and duplicative maze of narrowly focused programs administered by numerous Federal agencies that lack coordination, a coherent strategy to provide training assistance, and the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize these services--those seeking the training, and those businesses seeking to hire them. Despite spending billions of tax dollars each year on job training programs, most Federal agencies do not know how their programs work and if their programs are really helping people find jobs. 
Here is what we do know. Today's job training system is no system at all--it is a complex patchwork of numerous rules, regulations, requirements, and overlapping bureaucratic responsibilities. As a result, programs are largely ineffective. Frustration and confusion is widespread throughout the system--by program administrators and employers, and most important, by those seeking assistance. People have difficulty knowing where to begin to look for training assistance because there are no clear points of entry and no clear paths from one program to another. 
This is frustration at the breaking point. 
Frustration to the point that business community participation, which is absolutely necessary for success, is waning. 
Frustration to the point that community activists, again whose participation is absolutely necessary for success, are becoming disenchanted. 
Frustration to the point that we have begun to question our commitment to job training. 
Fragmentation, duplication, ineffectiveness, and frustration--these are the words that describe the current Federal job training apparatus. That is the status quo. That is unacceptable. That is largely why reform is needed now. 
There are other important reasons why reform is necessary. The economic future of our country depends on a well-trained work force. I have heard from employers at every level who find it increasingly difficult to attract and find qualified employees for high-skilled, high-paying jobs as well as qualified entry level employees. If we are going to remain economically competitive, we must address this growing shortage of workers. 
Reform also is needed if the welfare reform bill Congress passed last year is going to have any chance of succeeding. We need to provide States with the tools necessary to develop a comprehensive system to assist people make work, not welfare, their way of life. 
To achieve all of these goals, job training is the key. 
The bill that I introduce today with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone represents a bipartisan belief that we can do better and we can achieve these goals. We can replace the current system of frustration and provide a framework for success. 
By removing or reforming outdated rules and regulations, we can remove the barriers that have stymied reform in the past. We can empower States to boldly move forward, transforming the current patchwork of programs into a comprehensive system to make it easier for all consumers seeking assistance to receive assistance. 
Just like we did with welfare reform, job training reform is about recognizing the leadership of States that have shown innovation and initiative over the last few years, even in the midst of numerous Federal barriers and obstacles. It is about allowing them and encouraging them to continue with the innovations they have implemented without Federal reform legislation. 
We can establish a framework for a system that provides consumer choice. Individuals seeking assistance should have a say in where, how, and what training they will receive. At the same time, the Federal bureaucracy should not engage in micro-management by mandating vouchers or any other specific local delivery system. This is a decision that belongs to the States and localities. This bill takes the opposite approach--it provides States and localities the flexibility to develop training programs that meet the real needs of those seeking training. It is to the consumer that these programs should be tailored to, not Washington. 
We can establish an accountable system. Training programs must demonstrate their effectiveness to be certified as eligible programs. This means proving that training leads to meaningful, unsubsidized employment--showing how many people were placed, at what cost, and how many people remained employed 6 months to a year later. We owe this to the individuals seeking assistance and to the American taxpayers who pays for these programs. 
We can establish a framework that not only allows for business community involvement, but business community leadership. The private sector must outline their employment needs and assist in the design of training programs. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act incorporates all of these principles. The programs incorporated in the legislation include job training, vocational education, and adult education. Additionally, it provides strong, mandatory linkages to welfare to work, Wagner-Peyser, Job Corps, Older Americans, Vocational Rehabilitation, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, veterans, Trade Adjustment Assistance, as well as other training related programs. 
While separate funding streams will be maintained for each of the activities, in recognition of their function, States and localities will be empowered with the tools and the flexibility to implement real reform in order to provide comprehensive services to those seeking assistance. 
Under this bill, States will have the ability to submit a unified plan for all of the programs incorporated in and linked to this legislation to the appropriate Secretary describing how they will coordinate services in order to avoid duplication. 
Statewide and local partnerships, led by the business community, will be established to assist in the development of such a plan, set policy for training, and generally advise the appropriate elected official overseeing the system. 
At the local level, all services provided must be accessible through a one stop customer service system. Consumers, both employers and job seekers seeking assistance, will be able to receive comprehensive information regarding the availability, eligibility, and quality of the programs. With this kind of system, we can remove the confusion and frustration inherent in the current programs. 
Finally, training will be delivered under a framework of an individual training account which will be used to ensure the principle of consumer choice. The specific nature of the individuals training account will be determined by States and localities. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone, as well as the other members of the Subcommittee of Employment and Training for their cooperation and dedication in developing a piece of legislation that moves us forward. This has been a bipartisan effort from Day One. I believe that level of cooperation and leadership is essential if we are to have a chance to pass real reform. 
There have been a number of orgnizations--both public and private--who have participated in an open and constructive process used to develop this legislation. Their input has been vital. 
Again, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to address and reform the Federal Government's role in providing job training assistance to Americans. For too long, that role has been to foster confusion, frustration and complication. With this bill, we offer a new foundation, and a positive framework for success. Instead of rules that tie the hands of States and localities, this bill provides the tools to empower them to develop comprehensive work force investment systems that address the needs of job seekers and employers. This bill is a road map to a better system, and if we are to achieve the goals we have set--a stronger economy, a better-trained work force, and welfare reform--we need to begin that journey today.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues here today in recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Americans of Hispanic descent are in this country because they, their parents, or grandparents, or great-grandparents, or even more distant ancestors, made a choice. They were decisive, motivated individuals who made an act of faith in America. 
They came here, much as my own great-great-grandfather, Denis DeWine, did back in the 1840's--because they wanted a chance at a brighter future. And in return, they were willing to work hard to build up this country. 
That same spirit lives on in today's U.S. Hispanic community--and we ought to look at that spirit as an inspiration to ensure that America remains the kind of place people would want to come to. 
There's one area of law I'm working on that is especially important in this context. I'm talking about the attempts to change America's immigration law and make it more restrictive. I read one article in which advocates of restriction repeatedly called new Americans `aliens'--not `immigrants' but `aliens,' as if they were a different kind of people from us, who come from someplace as strange as outer space. 
I call these people something else. I call them Americans. 
Now, we all know that there's nothing new about anti-immigrant movements. We've had them again and again, throughout American history. But we have established a proud tradition in this country of overcoming them, of resisting the temptation to turn inward to ourselves--of welcoming new people and new ideas, and choosing hope over fear. 
When Franklin Roosevelt reminded America that even those who came over on the Mayflower were immigrants--when John F. Kennedy wrote a book called `A Nation of Immigrants'--when Ronald Reagan moved the Nation with stories about how the light from Liberty's torch was keeping hope alive for millions of people in oppressed countries--they were expressing something truly fundamental about what it means to be an American. And make no mistake about it--that same spirit is still alive and well in today's America. 
Ohioans of Hispanic ancestry have helped build the Buckeye State into an economic and cultural powerhouse. We are grateful to these fellow Ohioans, because they took the talents they or their ancestors were born with to a foreign land, and chose to bestow their benefits to us. 
In fact, next week the Hispanic Youth Foundation [HYF], an organization that provides financial assistance to undergraduate and graduate students seeking degrees in areas of political science or other fields related to government of public service, will meet in Washington, DC, to distribute scholarships to only seven outstanding students. I am proud to announce that one of the seven students receiving this scholarship award is from the great State of Ohio. 
I join all my fellow citizens in saying thank you--and saluting Ohio's Hispanic community on the occasion of Hispanic Heritage Month.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a project of great importance to me and to the people of the State of Ohio. I am referring to funding for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. This project is currently included in the House version of the bill that we are currently debating. I am very hopeful that it will receive full consideration by the conference committee and be included in the final bill that is reported by the conference committee. 
Madam President, on October 16, 1992, Congress established the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park to commemorate the legacy of two Daytonians, Orville and Wilbur Wright and their significant contribution to human history through their pioneering exploration of flight. 
Madam President, in an effort to create a single coordinated facility recognizing the Wright Brothers' work in Dayton, in 1994 the National Park Service assumed responsibility for the remains of the brothers' bicycle company. And then 2 years later, in 1996, the Park Service obtained the surrounding property which is known locally as the Hoover block. 
Madam President, the Hoover block has been designated as the core site for Federal management of the Dayton Aviation Park and will be the park headquarters and will also be the primary visitor center. 
From 1890 to 1895, this very site served as the location of the brothers' print shop, the print shop called Wright & Wright Job Printers, which, by the way, printed the Tattler, a newspaper founded by the famous Daytonian and Ohioan black poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
Madam President, timely restoration of these sites is critical to ensure the building will be renovated and open to the public by the year 2003 when Ohio and the rest of the Nation and the world will celebrate the centennial of powered flight. 
Trying to meet this deadline, Madam President, I have been working with my colleagues in the Ohio delegation in the House, most notably, Congressman Ralph Regula, Congressman David Hobson, 
and Congressman Tony Hall, working with them to ensure and secure funding for the upcoming fiscal year so that renovations can proceed without delay. 
Madam President, I think that this project has national significance. It has significance for my home community, the Miami Valley in Ohio, and the entire State of Ohio. I grew up about 20 miles from where the Wright Brothers really learned to fly and where they did their pioneer work, where they did their studies, and where they prepared to fly. 
Madam President, I note the presence on the floor of my good friend from Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, who is of course the chairman of the appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior. I already have had several conversations with my friend and colleague regarding this particular project. He knows well of my personal interest in the project. I really wish to express to him my appreciation for his willingness to pursue this matter in the conference committee.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to support an amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. The Senator's amendment calls for a report to identify the best ways to recover organs and tissue from those who have died suddenly so that the lives of others can be saved through organ transplants. 
Today, more than 54,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant; and 10 Americans will die each day before an organ can be found. And the sad fact is that these deaths are preventable. We have the technology to give these people a second chance through transplants--but while we have the technology, we don't have the organs. 
I am convinced that much of this problem can be solved by making people aware of this problem and educating them about the need for organ donation. And I have been working on that for some time. 
However, just as important is looking at the system we have in place for organ procurement--to see if there are structural hurdles that we can help remove. The law today requires hospitals to have a protocol in place for organ procurement. Not all do. Those that do don't necessarily work with the organ procurement organizations [OPO's] in their local areas. These are the hurdles that Senator Durbin's amendment tries to address. The study that this amendment requires is an important one. I hope that it will provide us all with information about how best to identify appropriate organ donors and then, how best to approach their families. I would hope that this study would take into account the fact that these best practices may well be different in different parts of the country. To the extent the Secretary can identify these differences in her report, I think it would be meaningful to the hospitals and their respective OPO's. 
When we fail to identify a potential donor or bungle our communication with a potential donor's family, we compound an already tragic situation. Already someone's family member--a mother, brother, or sister--has died. The second tragedy is that--despite that person's willingness to donate and save another's life--that wish is ignored or the request to the family is handled poorly, raising unnecessary doubts about donation. 
I'd like to thank Senator Durbin--I appreciate his thoughtful efforts toward increasing organ donation and improving organ procurement. I also want to thank him for accommodating my concerns in his amendment. I look forward to working with him in the future on this issue that is so important to both of us.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator Specter and the members of the Labor, Education, HHS appropriations subcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor. 
This bill contains a much needed funding increase for the National Institutes of Health. Earlier this year I joined with 97 of my colleagues in this Senate body in voting for a sense-of-the-Senate amendment calling for a doubling of NIH funding over the next 5 years. The bill that we have in front of us today represents a substantial step forward. It increases funding for NIH from $12.7 to $13.69 billion. This funding, simply, Mr. President, will save lives. 
There are two measures in this bill that I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues, and that I believe deserve special mention. Earlier this year I introduced, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Bond, a bill which would establish a pediatric research initiative within the Office of the Director of NIH. Senator Kennedy and I and Senator Bond, along with many sponsors of that bill, have worked hard to develop a proposal that we feel helps place appropriate emphasis on pediatric research while at the same time supporting the scientific judgment so important to the success of NIH. 
The value of this initiative really is without question. Research breakthroughs to treat pediatric illnesses have been enormously effective both in reducing costs and, more important, in freeing young children from a lifetime of illness and disability. From vaccines to treat polio to surfactant replacement to prevent respiratory distress syndrome, research has saved hundreds of millions of dollars and improved the lives of millions of children. 
Recently, the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of the Labor and Human Resources Committee held a hearing on NIH reauthorization. During the hearing, a distinguished panel of pediatric researchers from NIH and also from the private sector described some of the enormous opportunities that now exist for scientific progress in combating and in preventing diseases affecting children. Their testimony dramatically underscored the critical need for additional emphasis and increased support for pediatric research. 
Last year, the Labor, Education, and HHS appropriations subcommittee, chaired by Senator Specter, allocated $5 million as an initial downpayment toward the pediatric research initiative. This year the appropriations subcommittee has allocated $20 million toward this initiative. I personally thank Chairman Specter and the members of his subcommittee for their continued commitment to pediatric research. By recognizing the critical need to encourage and promote pediatric research, the committee has really helped ensure the next generation of Americans grows up to be healthy, productive members of our society. 
Mr. President, the second provision I would like to talk about in this bill is the funding for substance abuse and mental health services. Without the provision contained in this bill, some States would have faced massive cuts in the funding for their programs to help people with substance abuse and/or mental health problems. My own State of Ohio would have faced a devastating funding cut of more than 20 percent, our neighboring State to the north, Michigan, would have received a cut of 19 percent, and other States would have also been seriously hurt. Among the important programs threatened by these cuts would have been the agencies promoting early intervention with young people to help them find alternatives to getting involved with drugs and crime. I have long believed that the problem of at-risk youth in this country is one for which an ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure. The sooner we can reach these young people, the better off we will be in our efforts to help them avoid the tragedy of lifetime addiction. 
The SAMHSA provision contained in this bill averts the awful consequences of the proposed funding cuts. It is a good measure and deserves strong support of the entire U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Roth, for the fantastic job that he has done. I congratulate also our majority leader, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, as well as the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, John Kasich, and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer--all of the people who have been involved in this really historic piece of legislation. I rise today in strong support of this conference report, the Taxpayer Relief Act. This historic budget agreement is an important step forward for fiscal responsibility, fiscal responsibility that will balance the budget for the first time in 30 years. And it will provide much-needed tax relief for working families. 
When we implement this budget agreement, the result will be the first balanced budget since 1969. That is great news for the U.S. economy as well as for the working families who will see a decline in the interest payments they have to carry. This bill will give working families some long-needed, much-needed, much-deserved tax relief--$90 billion of tax relief over the next 5 years. Today, the working families of Ohio and the rest of America are paying record-high taxes. All across America, total taxes eat up 38 percent of the typical family's budget--38 percent. That is more than the typical family spends on food, clothing and shelter combined. On these family necessities they only spend 28 percent of their income. 
The people who are particularly helped by this are the lower middle class, the middle class, the working American. A family of four, two children, two adults, with an income of $30,000, will see tax savings of 53 percent--53 percent. A family with a $40,000 income, that same family, would receive a 30 percent tax savings. That same family, at $50,000, would still receive a 21-percent tax savings. That is real money. That is very, very significant. 
The education tax incentives will also help the next generation. It will help Ohio families, it will help American families. We all know education is getting more and more important as we move to a skill-based economy. We also know it is very expensive. This tax relief bill will help Ohio's families save and pay for their children's education. It will expand the IRA's available for education and create tax-free prepaid tuition plans. It makes interest on student loans deductible from Federal taxes. It also encourages employers to invest in the education of their workers by giving them a tax deduction for employee training and employee education. 
This historic tax bill will help families make ends meet over the short term, and will help them educate their children over the long term. In my view, this is a modest bill, but it is a very important bill. It is a historic bill. It is important because it helps America as a nation reverse course. Mr. President, 50 years ago Americans paid 2 cents out of every dollar they earned to the Federal Government. Today they are sending 25 cents to Washington alone, and that is not counting all the other State and local taxes. That's going in the wrong direction. What we do with this bill is change course and begin to go in the right direction. The $500 per child tax credit, in particular, will help ease the burden of working families who need to hold down two or more jobs to make ends meet. 
The tax relief in the agreement will also do a great deal for small business men and women. The capital gains cuts and the lowering of the estate tax will help promote economic growth and help preserve family owned and operated businesses. All of these policy changes in my view are extremely positive. They represent substantial progress over where we are today. 
I hope that we soon will address the long-term problem, though, of runaway entitlement spending. We begin to make progress with this bill. Clearly we have to go further. To balance the budget by the year 2002, as the budget agreement would in fact do, is very, very important. In fact, it's a prerequisite for any other progress we intend to make in economic policy. However, while it is essential, it is only a first step. We need to view what we are doing today, really, as just that, a first step. Our next necessary step is to prepare the Federal budget for the fiscal tidal wave that will occur when the baby boomers start to retire and become eligible for Social Security and for Medicare. In my view, we have to start reforming the entitlements in a responsible and bipartisan way. Congress has been talking about this for years. It is essential that we make it happen and we make it happen as soon as possible. 
But, for today, this bill and its companion measure are an excellent step forward, a first step. I am proud to vote yes on both of these historic conference reports. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to note the passing, today, of an Ohio legend. Early this morning, an Ohio legend died. Here is how Lee Leonard, the dean of the Ohio statehouse press corps, began his report in this morning's Columbus dispatch: 
Vernal G. Riffe, Jr., who rose from a Scioto County insurance salesman to become one of the most powerful figures in Ohio's political history, died today at 1:30 a.m. He was 72.' 
Vern Riffe served a record-breaking 20 years as Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, from 1975 to 1995. From the first day that he was elected Speaker, he was `The Speaker' and will always be, Mr. President, `The Speaker.' He came to the Ohio House in 1959, spent 16 years learning the skills that would make him the most effective as well as the longest-serving speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. 
He studied the approaches of legislative veterans. He learned a lot. He learned that, in a legislative body, you get a lot further by helping your colleagues move their own legislation forward than you do by grandstanding. As a result, Vern Riffe quickly became the person both Republican and Democratic Governors turned to to make things happen. Vern Riffe was a pragmatic, results-oriented Speaker. He was a partisan, but his greatest victories came from his willingness to work with Republican Ohio Governors to get things done for the people of Ohio. 
When Vern Riffe retired from the Speakership, he said this: 
If I was 20 years younger, I might be in the mood for forming my own party, called the Moderate Democrats or the Middle of the Road Democrats. 
That was Vern Riffe. 
These are the lessons of Vern Riffe: Hard work, learn the details, build consensus, and put the interests of Ohio ahead of the interests of your political party. 
Vern Riffe grew up in politics. his family was highly political, and from an early age he loved the nuts and bolts of making government work. He used to say, `I love being Speaker.' 
Political scientist Samuel C. Patterson of the Ohio State University summed up Riffe's style:. 
Riffe loved working with his members, doing favors for them, helping them get reelected, and assisting them in fulfilling their own ambitions and their own objectives as legislators. As a political leader, he was supportive, and his success depended on his reliability and trust. Riffe's friendliness and his southern Ohio, small town, 'down home' demeanor, endeared him to his supporters and disarmed most of his opponents. He was not stridently partisan, a quality underscored by the fact that the two prominent Republicans, former long-time Governor James A. Rhodes and former house Republican leader Corwin Nixon, are among his closest personal friends. 
That is the Vern Riffe that I remember. He used to spend time at the Galleria across the street from the Statehouse, meeting with members of the house and senate in a very informal way, reaching agreement on literally countless issues. When he retired from the house a couple of years ago, this is what one State representative said: 
Vern Riffe is the Woody Hayes of Ohio politics. Without his strong leadership, not just the Ohio House, but all of State government will be fundamentally different. 
I think that is right. Vern Riffe was a legend, a man who cared about using the power he had to help the people of Ohio. 
In conclusion, Vern Riffe never lost sight of the values he learned from his closest political adviser, and, as he told me, his closest friend. That was his dad, Vernal G. Riffe, Sr., who was a former railroader who served as mayor of the town of New Boston. Vern Riffe's dad used to tell him: `Son, if you're going to be a leader, you've got to lead.' Mr. President, Vern Riffe always led. 
Another Ohio legend, John Mahaney, president of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, put it best. He said about Vern Riffe: `It's like you get in the Hall of Fame by batting .300, 15 out of 20 years. It's longevity and consistency. And (Vern Riffe) passes both tests.' 
Mr. President, we will miss him a great deal. In March of this year, he and his wife Thelma began their 50th year of marriage. On behalf of the people of Ohio, I express my condolences to Thelma and to their children--Cathy Skiver, Verna Kay Riffe, Mary Beth Hewitt, and Vernal G. Riffe III, and to their seven grandchildren. 
Mr. President, he was a good man. 
I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.

Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate your leadership on this important issue, and believe that you have improved this important law. However, the attorney general of Ohio has raised an issue shared by a majority of States that I am compelled to address. 
Current law under the Jacob Wetterling Act requires that States create a special State board. This board must be composed of experts in the field on the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders, victims' rights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement to determine when someone is a sexually violent predator. Currently, according to the Department of Justice, 37 States would not meet this requirement.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is also my understanding the Senator from New Hampshire is working with the Department of Justice to assure that your proposed language in the bill before us would provide a waiver for impacted States, such as Ohio, who for differing reasons, may not specifically meet the requirements of having a special State board. My State, as well as many others, however, have alternative methods that fairly, efficiently, and scientifically make the determination when someone is a sexual predator. Is that correct?

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend the chairman of the Appropriate Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator Shelby, for the work he has done on this bill. It is not easy to balance the competing interests in any appropriations bill, but I think it is even more difficult on transportation appropriations. I would also like to call attention to one area of the Senate's bill which is very different than the House version. 
The Federal Automated Surface Observing System [ASOS] program, which began in the late 1980's, is sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], the National Weather Service [NWS], and the Department of Defense [DOD] and currently includes approximately 860 ASOS units. For its part, the FAA has completed procurement of its 539 baseline ASOS network. Of these units, 476 were installed, yet only 129 systems had been commissioned as of December 21, 1996. 
Specifically, the Senate bill would provide $24.85 million for the Automated Surface Observing System [ASOS]. This amount is $10 million more than the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] requested. According to the committee report, $14.85 million is to be used to commission systems that have already been purchased. 
The $14.85 million requested by the administration would pay for getting these systems on-line, providing essential weather services to airports that now have them. The House language on this system is similar. I think it makes sense to do this. After all, the Federal Government purchase these units. They might as well be used. 
Where the House and Senate language differ is in the use of the funds that the administration did not request. The House bill would provide $7.5 million for procurement of additional weather observing systems and direct the FAA to compare costs and capabilities of similar systems and to purchase new systems only after full and open competition between all qualified vendors. 
In contrast, the Senate report provides FAA with an additional $10 million to purchase 50 new ASOS units. If the past is an accurate indicator, these units will sit idle until FAA finds the funds to get them running. In essence, what we are doing is purchasing technology with great potential but fraught with high maintenance costs and unusable for a number of years for every airport that needs a weather observation system, when many airports can use off-the-shelf technology that can be used immediately. 
In 1995, the General Accounting Office [GAO] released a report on ASOS. I would like to highlight some of their findings. First, GAO found that six of the eight sensors in the ASOS system do not meet key performance specifications. Second, ASOS shortfalls are caused by contractor failure to deliver products that meet specifications and Government failure to furnish sufficient equipment. Third, the NWS does not have adequate personnel or integrated information systems for it to isolate and correct ASOS failures at FAA sites. Fourth, ASOS does not satisfy the weather observational needs of many users. And, finally ASOS users state that incorrect ASOS observations could risk aviation efficiently and safety. I don't believe that Congress should force the FAA to purchase more ASOS units until the problems with the ones they already have can be worked out. 
For this reason, I believe the House language on weather observation systems is a better option for airports. I hope my friend from Alabama will examine carefully the House approach on this issue and I urge him to opt for the House's approach to maximize airport safety.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment excludes Haitians from the U.S. who have been involved in extrajudicial and political killings in Haiti. Specifically, it does this by denying funds for the issuance of visas to these persons. 
There have been numerous cases of politically-motivated assassinations in Haiti. Some of these extrajudicial killings occurred while former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in exile. Many others took place after he returned to power. Unfortunately, these killings have continued after Mr. Aristide left office and Rene Preval became President. 
The Haitian Government has assigned over eighty extrajudicial and political killing cases to the Special Investigative Unit. The Haitian Government claims that they have fired several government employees who are suspects in these killings. 
But the sad fact remains that to date, no one has been convicted for any of these assassinations. Simply stated, there has been no substantial progress in these investigations. 
We need to encourage the Haitians to bring these killers to justice. We need to let them know that these killings cannot be tolerated. 
My amendment denies funding for the issuance of visas to those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, materially assisted, or sought to conceal these extrajudicial and political killings. The amendment exempts persons for medical reasons, or if they have cooperated fully with the investigation of these political murders. 
The legislation also includes a reporting requirement. The Administration would be directed to submit, to the appropriate congressional committees, (1) a list of those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered or carried out the extrajudicial and political killings; (2) a list of those refused entry to the United States as a result of this provision; and (3) a report on this matter, to be submitted once each year, until such time as the Government of Haiti has completed the investigation of these extrajudicial and political killings and has prosecuted those implicated in these murders. 
It is an unfortunate reality that political violence has been a way of life in Haiti. Too many Haitians have died due to acts of political violence. The adoption of this amendment will not solve their problems overnight. But it can help. I believe this legislation sends a strong signal that violence must not be used as a political tool in Haiti. It also sends a message to the Haitians that we will vigorously support those who want to end political violence and create a lasting society of peace and prosperity in Haiti. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment is simple and to the point. It urges the U.S. Agency for International Development to maintain the same level of resources for orphan feeding programs in Haiti in fiscal year 1998 as it provided in fiscal year 1997. 
The total funding level for Public Law 480 title II food programs is projected to stay the same for fiscal year 1998 as was appropriated for fiscal year 1997. Therefore, I believe that keeping the same level of such resources for this particular program should not be contentious, especially when my colleagues understand who the beneficiaries of this program are. 
Mr. President, many facilities in Haiti have to care for a truly vast number of orphans--and also for an increasing number of abandoned and neglected children. In the Port-au-Prince area alone, Christian Relief Services provides Public Law 480 title II food assistance to 70 orphanages. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also supports some 46 orphanages in the southern rural areas. Simply stated, there are numerous orphanages throughout this country which take care of thousands upon thousands of orphaned 
and abandoned children. 
I have traveled to Haiti four times in the last few years and have visited many orphanages. I can give you a first-hand account of some of their heart-breaking stories. The flow of desperate children into these orphanages is constant--and these institutions face an increasing challenge in accommodating all of these needy children. 
Take the case of Notre Dame de Victoires, an orphanage run by Sister Veronique. She will not turn down a single child that is dropped off at her facility. She also makes frequent visits to the local hospitals where babies, after being born, are abandoned. This particular orphanage takes care of the sickest of the sick. They get no means of support other than the food administered to them through CRS, which in turn receives its resources through AID. 
Mr. President, let me make it clear what this amendment does. The current program guarantees one meal a day to these orphans. My amendment would ensure that these meals keep coming. I am not talking about medical assistance, clothing, or anything else. Just one meal. These orphanages still have to find sources of support for the other meals and other necessary assistance for these children. 
According to AID, $238,000 worth of food went indirectly to orphanages in fiscal year 1996. If this figure is accurate, this is less than 1 percent of the total food resources allocated by AID for Haiti. Specifically, in fiscal year 1996 only 506 metric tonnes of food--out of a total of 50,000 metric tonnes provided by AID--went toward feeding children in orphanages. This is just a drop in the bucket of AID resources. 
Now, I have urged AID to maintain the current level of resources allocated for feeding orphans in fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 1998. AID officials assured me that they will do just that. In fact, they spoke to the relevant relief agencies about the situation and confirmed that this could be done. 
My original intent was to earmark this program, requiring AID to implement what has been promised. After numerous conversations between my staff and AID, and after their repeated assurances, the amendment I am offering states that AID simply should honor its commitment. This amendment would make AID's commitment not a personal assurance to me, but a commitment to the U.S. Senate. And if this language is kept in conference and signed into law, the commitment will be thus extended to the entire U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, I am not asking for any more money than the orphanages are currently receiving from AID. This is essential for the survival of many thousands of Haitian children living in overcrowded orphanages. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me take just 1 minute to explain this amendment. 
This amendment is a very simple one. A `yes' vote means that we continue the current law. A `yes' vote on the amendment would continue in force the current prohibition on the taxpayer subsidy of abortions for Federal workers. It would permit Federal employee health plans to cover abortion only in the cases of rape, incest and threats to the life of the mother. 
This has been the law for most of the last 14 years, from 1984 to 1993, and from 1995 until the present. A `yes' vote continues current law. 
Mr. President, in 1996 the Federal Government paid an average of 74 percent of the cost of a Federal employee's health premium. That is taxpayer money. And the Senate has twice voted to be sure tax dollars were not used to fund abortions. 
In 1995, this body endorsed this policy by a vote of 50 to 44. In 1996, we approved it again by a vote of 53 to 45. It is good policy. It ought to remain in force, consistent with the well-being of the American people. 
I urge a `yes' vote.  
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss several other projects that currently are funded in the House version. I am hopeful these will get full consideration by the conference committee, and be included in the final bill. 
 Mr. President, I believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that Federal research and its subsequent data is shared, whenever possible, with the taxpayers who fund these research programs. To this end, I would like to state my support for the $5.8 million provided in the House bill to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's [NASA] Commercial Technology Program. These funds would be used to support existing successful program goals, as well as new initiatives to link businesses from distressed communities to NASA commercial technologies. 
It is critical to the competitiveness of our economy that we promote the shared use of research material between Federal agencies such as NASA and the private sector. Support for this program is an important step in that direction. The program will allow highly successful outreach efforts such as the NASA Lewis Business and Industry Summit to be carried forward and will help to ensure NASA Lewis' long-term viability as an economic force in northeastern Ohio. 
 Mr. President, I also believe it is our responsibility to use the success of Federal investments in technology to improve, whenever feasible, our education system. Therefore I hope the conferees will agree with the House Appropriation Committee's decision to increase NASA's Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy [SEMAA] and Mobile Aeronautics Education Laboratory [MAEL] programs $3.3 million. This increase would enable the NASA Lewis Research Center and Cuyahoga Community College to expand their already successful programs to the Cuyahoga Community College's western campus. In addition, the workstations included in the Mobile Aeronautics Education Laboratory can be replicated in Cleveland area schools. 
 Mr. President, as we are all too well aware, flooding disasters tragically struck the Midwest this past spring. While there is little we can do to prevent natural disasters, we must take every step possible to respond to these disasters in order to minimize potential loss of life and property. I sincerely hope the conferees will agree with the House Appropriations Committee's decision to provide $5 million to support the replacement and upgrading of outdated Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] emergency response equipment. Upgraded, functional equipment is critical to protecting our citizens from unfortunate natural disasters and I strongly believe safety issues such as the support of this equipment should be a priority in our budget discussions. I specifically believe the mobile emergency response support and mobile air transportable telecommunications deserve particular attention. 
 Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my good friend from Missouri, Senator Bond, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD. I would hope that he, and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, will give serious consideration to the programs I described.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I see my friend from Missouri, the chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, on the floor and would like to call to his attention an important project in Ohio that I believe is deserving of funding under the Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program. Specifically, I am interested in the economic development initiative funding for various community development projects. A number were listed by the committee in its report on the bill. I am very interested in a community-wide effort in Lorain, OH, to convert a soon-to-be-closed hospital into a community resource center. This is an area that is economically depressed, and in addition to the economic losses associated with the closure of the hospital, the community recently discovered that the local Ford production plant will soon be closing its doors. Would the Senator from Missouri agree that an initiative which attempted to convert the hospital space into a community resource and training center be a worthy candidate for funding under the committee's EDI provision?

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his comments. Were it not for the fact that the hospital is scheduled to close at the end of the year, I would be content to seek funding for this project through traditional funding channels. However, the hospital is set to close in just a few months. Therefore, I have little choice but to request that the chairman of the subcommittee take a very close look at this project as he proceeds to conference with the House on the final version of this appropriations bill. Specifically, what I am seeking is consideration for support of funds to allow for renovation and conversion of this space. What I am trying to avoid is seeing this hospital close and having this wonderful facility stand empty. Should this happen, I am concerned that it stands vulnerable to deterioration, and even vandalism, to a point that the only option left for the community is to tear down the structure.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk now, a bill on behalf of myself and Senator Wellstone. 
Mr. President, this bill is the Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act and it is intended to, at least in part, deal with a very serious problem in this country. That problem simply is that more and more children, more and more of our children, are every day in child care. There is a real concern about the quality of child care. This bill does not solve every problem in regard to child care, but I think it is a start and I think it would make a significant impact. 
Today, more than 70 percent of mothers are in the labor force. Almost 75 percent of married couples with children have both spouses working. All of these working parents, plus parents moving from welfare to work, have to find someone to care for their children if they are going to go out and support their families. Yet today, child care is often very hard to find and quality child care is even harder to find. In just 20 years, the last 20 years, the percentage of children enrolled in some form, in some manner, of child care has gone from 30 percent to 70 percent. 
Quality child care is a concern to virtually every family in this country. More and more parents are working. More and more children are in child care. I think the very least we can do is to try to assure those families that, while they are at work, their children will be taken care of by qualified and by competent individuals. This, unfortunately, is not always taking place today. There are many qualified people in child care. There are very many dedicated people in child care. But I think we can do better. This is what this bill intends to address. 
Scientists tell us that the largest indicator of a child's intelligence is the mother's education level. While a mother is at work, then it becomes the education level of the child care provider that the child deals with for, sometimes, an extended period of time during the day. With all the new research that we see on the brain and early childhood development, I think we have to reemphasize this particular aspect of child care. We need well-educated, well-trained child care providers. One of the ways we can achieve this, one of the things that we can do to raise the quality of child care, is to say to individuals who are inclined to go into the child care profession that we will in fact help them if they want to make this a profession. 
We have to let people know, if they are going to earn a degree to take care of our children, we will help them. Our bill, the bill introduced today by Senator Wellstone and myself, will do this. Our bill would help repay the student loans of an individual who earns an early childhood degree and would help repay the loan of that person who goes to work in a licensed child care facility. The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act would pay off a student loan at the rate of 15 percent a year for people who earn an early childhood degree and who work in a licensed child care facility. 
This bill will help bring more qualified individuals to the child care profession. It would also help to decrease the high turnover levels caused, many times, by very low wages. 
Let me conclude. The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act is an important way to improve the quality of child care. American parents need it for their peace of mind, and American children need it for their mind development.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be voting on Senator Hutchinson's amendment with regard to most-favored-nation status with China. 
I intend tomorrow to vote for the amendment offered by my friend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. I would like to emphasize, however, first and foremost, that this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is not binding. It does not in any way alter or reverse the President's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading status with China. As we all know, the House of Representatives already has voted against a resolution revoking China's MFN status. 
So, Mr. President, this amendment is more a chance to make a statement--frankly, for me, a chance to express my frustration with certain activities taken by the Chinese Government. 
Let there be no misunderstanding. I believe that China needs to reassess its actions in a number of areas because I believe Congress--certainly this Senator--is losing patience. 
Let me be a bit more specific. I am very concerned first about China's weapons proliferation activities particularly in the Middle East. In the past 2 years, it has been reported in the media that China has supplied Pakistan with key components to develop its own nuclear weapons program as well as ballistic missiles to deliver such weapons. China also has been the source for Iran's growing cruise missile capability, which poses a clear threat to our military personnel and commercial shippers in the Persian Gulf. 
Further, I am concerned about Chinese state-owned companies knowingly supplying assault weapons to criminal gangs in California. Representatives of these companies were arrested in a sting operation just last year and are now awaiting trial in California. I am very concerned about repeated human rights violations throughout China as well as religious persecution and religious repression. 
I am very concerned about the hideous practices of forced abortions and sterilization in China. I am concerned about the possible reversal of various political liberties such as free speech and assembly in Hong Kong. 
These are all very serious issues, and I believe that we need to take action to try to address each one. My vote tomorrow in favor of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will be an expression of these concerns. However, I believe there are far more effective ways to demonstrate our commitment to these issues than just the sense of the Senate before us. I suggest if we truly want to address all these issues constructively, we should bring before the Senate legislation that is targeted for its clear solutions. 
For example, the Senate recently passed legislation offered by my colleague who just spoke a moment ago, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, which calls on our President to enforce our Nation's nonproliferation laws against China for its efforts to supply Iran with cruise missiles. I was a cosponsor of this legislation, which, by the way, passed the Senate unanimously. 
We can do more. We could and we should bring before the Senate the legislation that was introduced by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, legislation which would impose penalties on countries guilty of supporting or tolerating religious persecution, and I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. 
We should bring before the Senate the legislation introduced by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, which would impose targeted sanctions against China in cases of religious persecution and against Chinese companies for illegal weapons transfers into the United States. 
This bill would also increase United States support for human rights and democracy-building initiatives in China, including Radio Free Asia and the National Endowment for Democracy. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation as well. 
If we truly want to take strong, constructive action in regard to China, the options are clearly before us. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution before us is not the best way to address all of the issues of concern we have with China, but it is, I believe, helpful to send a signal to the Government of China that the people of the United States are genuinely concerned about the direction China has taken in a number of areas. Again, it is just a signal. But we should use the opportunity to make this signal strong and very clear. 
I believe, as I have stated, that we can do much more, more that is constructive and more that I believe can make a real and positive difference for the people of China. I hope in the weeks and months ahead we will take these actions.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment is an attempt to strengthen our aid program to the troubled republic island of Haiti. It would help make sure that United States assistance is properly targeted, so it can be more readily effective in areas vital to United States interests. 
Mr. President, my amendment does three things. No. 1, it provides up to $250,000 for a program to assist Haitian children currently in orphanages. Today, Mr. President, Catholic Relief Services [CRS], and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency [ADRA] support thousands of Haitian children. They basically administer AID Food. There are thousands of children who are receiving one meal a day because of AID assistance that is administered through both CRS and the ADRA. It is vitally important that this assistance continue. 
Mr. President, my amendment does not deal directly with this food. What it does deal with is the bigger problem of the orphanages of Haiti. I have had the opportunity to visit at least 12 of these orphanages in Haiti over the last few months. There are at least 70 such orphanages just in the Port-au-Prince area alone, containing thousands of children. It is something to see and something to behold to see the work that is being done. These orphanages would break a person's heart, and does, when you see the children who are there. This amendment sets aside a relatively small amount of money to look at this problem from the long range. 
Frankly, Mr. President, due to lack of resources the orphanages in Haiti cannot take in many of the needy children. This amendment would provide much-needed resources to help alleviate the demand on these orphanages, by helping take care of the children in other ways. 
Clearly, what these children need, in the final analysis, is not just temporary shelter, but permanent placement in safe, stable homes where they can count on food and clothing. The funds provided by this amendment would help make that permanent home a reality for more of Haiti's children. It would do this by bringing about some coordination among the orphanages and coordination with respect to our AID mission. 
Mr. President, the second part of our amendment would specify that no less than $500,000 be made available, and made available only for the Special Investigation Unit, the SIU, of the Haitian national police. 
Mr. President, in my visits to Haiti I have talked with members of the SIU, and I talked with the American contract officer who is down there assisting the SIU unit. One of the things that we have observed and that this country has promoted in emerging democracies is the belief that if a country is to emerge as a democracy, whether it be Haiti, whether it be Bosnia, wherever in the world, that the country has to turn its back on its past and has to stop tolerating political murders, political killings, political crimes, whether they occur from the left or from the right. The SIU unit has a very specific task. Its task is to target these political murderers, to bring them to justice, and to see that they are successfully tried. By doing that, and only by doing that, Mr. President, can we effectively see justice in these emerging democracies. And only by doing this can the people of the country understand that democracy not only means free elections, but democracy also means justice, and these days of political killings must be over. 
It is important, Mr. President, that support for the SIU investigations continue as investigators build compelling cases against those who have used brutal force to achieve, in the past, political goals. 
Mr. President, over 80 extrajudicial and political killing cases have been assigned to the SIU by the Government of Haiti. The Government has requested that close to two dozen of those cases be investigated on a `priority basis.' However, sadly, not enough progress has been made on these high-profile political murder cases. In fact, to date, none of the cases have been successfully prosecuted. 
Mr. President, the SIU is being integrated slowly into the newly formed judicial police and is receiving more and more political support, and support from the Haitian people. The people of Haiti want to turn the corner on their long history of political violence. Continued assistance and targeted assistance to the SIU would strengthen Haiti and strengthen United States-Haiti relations as well. 
No. 3, and probably most important. This amendment would limit assistance to Haiti, unless four conditions are met: 
Funds are made available if the President reports to Congress that the Government of Haiti, No. 1, is conducting thorough investigations of extrajudicial and political killings; No. 2, is cooperating with the United States authorities on this matter; No. 3, has made progress in privatizing major Government-owned enterprises, including progress toward the material and legal transfer of ownership of these enterprises; finally, No. 4, that the government is taking action to remove from the Haitian national police, and from related agencies, individuals who are alleged, credibly alleged, to have engaged in or conspired to conceal gross human rights violations. 
Now, Mr. President, in essence, my amendment is designed to make clear that Congress does not intend United States assistance to Haiti to be viewed as unconditional. In fact, the first two conditions that I have just mentioned were already imposed by Congress in the form of an amendment sponsored by our distinguished colleague, former majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Senator Bob Dole. By adding the new third and fourth conditions, this amendment strengthens the Dole amendment that currently governs our policy toward Haiti. 
Now, the limitations I propose will not apply to the provision of humanitarian, electoral, counternarcotics, or developmental assistance, and it does, as the Dole amendment does, contain a `national interest' presidential waiver. 
Mr. President, the amendment currently in force which limits assistance to Haiti, the Dole amendment, has been waived four times over the last two years by this administration. 
I believe the conclusion is clear. To make sure United States interests in Haiti are protected, that amendment needs to be strengthened. That is the purpose of this amendment that I am offering today. 
Mr. President, Haiti is now in the midst of a political crisis. The resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth on June 9 has laid bare a very serious problem of leadership. For a number of reasons, which include the political prominence of former President Aristide, the current President, President Preval--despite some truly heroic efforts--has not yet been able to effectively promote economic reform. 
Mr. President, if this crisis is not met successfully, it could pose a real threat to United States policy interests and to the overall investment the United States has made in Haiti since our deployment of troops beginning in September 1994. In my view, Mr. President, if President Preval is given the space to govern, there is no reason to believe he will not make the necessary reforms--as he did previously in promoting fiscal austerity over the last 16 months. 
Mr. President, we want to help President Preval find that space to govern. That is one major purpose of the amendment that I am proposing. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, we as a nation cannot afford to wash our hands of a country in which we have made such a sizable investment. The amendment I am proposing today would make our aid more effective and would help the forces in Haiti that are fighting the uphill battle for genuine reform. 
Mr. President, I request a voice vote.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the child survival and disease program fund. I understand that the House Committee on Appropriations, as a part of its foreign operations, export financing, and related programs bill, has recommended that $650 million be allocated to the fund's programs for fiscal year 1998. On the House side, the subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead, as my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Tony Hall, has also in protecting these child survival programs. I commend him for his leadership on this issue. 
The Clinton administration, however, has not specifically designated any direct funding for the child survival programs. Mr. President, in order to preserve the benefits of these important programs for children worldwide, I believe that the Senate should accept, when we go to conference, the House language that was agreed to in committee for this fund. It is, I believe, Mr. President, a tragedy, that millions of children die each year through disease, malnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both preventable and treatable. The programs in the child survival fund, which are intended to reduce infant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of children, address the various problems of young people struggling to survive in developing countries. 
Mr. President, this fund places a priority on the needs of more than 100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or who have become orphans. The fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of communicable diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, in the underdeveloped world, eradicating polio, as well as preventing and controlling the spread of HIV and AIDS. 
Mr. President, aside from the addressing issues of health, the fund also supports basic education programs. Investment in education yields one of the highest social and economic rates of return because it gives children the necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each additional year of primary and secondary education results in a 10-to-20 percent wage increase, and a 25-percent net increase in income. 
Mr. President, the programs supported by the child survival fund are effective, and they are effective because they save three million lives each year through immunization, vitamin supplementation, oral rehydration therapy, and also through the treatment of childhood respiratory infections which are the second largest killer of children on Earth. 
Mr. President, eliminating the symptoms and the causes of this problem is not only the humane thing to do. It is also a necessary prerequisite for global stability and for global prosperity. 
In my view, Mr. President, Congress needs to maintain its support for these very valuable programs. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee will, when we go to conference, accept the House language. 
The child survival and disease programs are effective, they are important, and they should, Mr. President, be continued. 
Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on the floor, and my colleague from the State of Kentucky. I wonder if he has any comment about this.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the proposed technical amendment I have offered to section 1070 of S. 936, the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization bill. Specifically, section 1070 would grant the Secretary of the Air Force the authority to convey to the Planes of Fame Museum in Chino, CA, a B-17 aircraft known as the `Picadilly Lilly.' It is my understanding that the aircraft is in need of repairs, and the museum would be willing to do the necessary work on the B-17 provided the museum had clear title to the aircraft. 
Technically, it is my understanding that the aircraft is historical property under the administration of the U.S. Air Force Museum, which is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH. It is also my understanding that the Air Force Museum has been attempting to work out an agreement with the Planes of Fame Museum that would allow for the latter facility to take the B-17 in exchange for other historical property. I am told the Air Force Museum is prepared to continue to work in good faith with the Planes of Fame Museum to arrive at an exchange that is mutually beneficial. 
The technical change I am offering simply is designed to ensure that if the Secretary of the Air Force exercises the discretion provided in section 1070, the Secretary determine appropriate compensation in exchange for the B-17. The provision, as amended, now would provide the Secretary with the authority to convey the aircraft, after determining an appropriate level of compensation, and securing other conditions of conveyance. I certainly hope that the Secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force Museum will work together with the Planes of Fame Museum to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of all parties. 
Mr. President, let me close by thanking my distinguished friend from Virginia, Mr. Warner; the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond; and their staffs for their assistance with this amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Joel Klein as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. 
Mr. President, the head of the Antitrust Division, obviously, plays a critical role in assuring that our antitrust laws are enforced wisely and vigorously. The importance of that role really cannot be overstated. Strong enforcement of antitrust laws is necessary to foster and to protect competition. As we all know, competition is good business, it gives businesses increased incentives to innovate, either by creating new products and services, finding ways to improve existing products, or by lowering costs. That type of innovation is good for both business and for consumers. 
Maintaining the competitive foundation of the American economy has always been a difficult task. And as our economy grows and changes, it's only getting more difficult. We often discuss globalization of the economy as allowing more and more American companies the opportunity to compete in the international marketplace and, because of that, they have flourished in this international environment. In order to build on this success, it is essential that we apply the antitrust laws in order to protect our companies from unfair, anticompetitive actions on the part of foreign businesses and foreign governments. 
In my view, Mr. President, Joel Klein is qualified to lead our efforts toward that stronger, more efficient antitrust enforcement. Mr. Klein is a superbly qualified attorney, with a great deal of substantive knowledge regarding both the jurisprudence and the enforcement of the antitrust laws. He has shown his abilities over the last few months in his capacity as 
the Acting Assistant Attorney General. He has shown this by leading the Antitrust Division through a series of very complex, difficult analyses, particularly in the area of telecommunications. 
As we all know, telecommunications issues have become very important and, many times, quite controversial. Now, some have expressed concerns regarding Mr. Klein's interpretation of section 271 of the Telecommunications Act in a way that some believe will make it too easy for the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or the RBOC's, to enter the long distance market. However, Mr. President, in both instances where the Antitrust Division has been called upon to evaluate an RBOC application to enter the long distance market, the Antitrust Division has recommended against the RBOC. In other words, Mr. President, some people believe that Mr. Klein has been too hard on The RBOC's. The ironic thing about this debate is that when you really analyze it, you will see that Mr. Klein has received criticism from both sides of these issues. 
Now, Mr. President, these decisions involve complex factual, complex legal, and complex economic analyses. Yes, each decision has angered some of the parties involved, but I believe Mr. Klein has done his job in a responsible and principled way. I may not agree with every decision made by the Antitrust Division, but what is important, I believe, is whether or not the nominee has interpreted the law responsibly and fairly. Interpreting a complex matter, such as the Telecommunications Act, is certainly not easy. I expect Mr. Klein's decisions will not please everyone. They certainly will not please everyone, given that it seems everyone has their own interpretation of this law. In fact, I think he should be praised for his willingness to take on these important and controversial issues. Rather than skirt controversy, Mr. Klein has done his job as best he can. I believe it is time that the U.S. Senate does its job. I believe that we need to discuss Mr. Klein's qualifications and the merits of this particular matter, and then I believe we need to vote on this confirmation. 
Mr. President, we cannot continue to move forward in this area of antitrust enforcement without the sort of calm, principled leadership that Joel Klein will provide. America will need an Assistant Attorney General with a strong understanding of antitrust doctrine and the willingness and ability to enforce the laws in an aggressive but evenhanded manner. I believe, Mr. President, that it is vitally important that the competitive foundation of our economy be maintained, and that the antitrust laws must be enforced and must be enforced fairly. Joel Klein, I believe, shares these goals, and I believe that he has proven he has the expertise and the ability to put those goals into practice. I believe, therefore, Mr. President, we should confirm his nomination without further delay. 
Mr. President, as we have already heard on this floor, there is going to be a vigorous debate about this nominee. Each Senator has to exercise his or her constitutional obligations. Each one of us has to decide whether we will vote `yes' or vote `no.' I merely ask, however, that we do vote, that after a good, thorough, and vigorous debate, we bring this matter to a close. Quite frankly, this administration has had some problems, for whatever reason, in filling some of the key positions at Justice. They are slowly beginning to take care of that matter. I believe that in the Senate we have an obligation--now that we have the nomination in front of us--to proceed, and to proceed without unnecessary and undue delay. 
Frankly, it is not helpful to have a vacancy in one of the key positions. Mr. Klein has, for some months, been the acting head of the Antitrust Division. I believe that he has carried out his duties well, as I have already said, in that particular job. 
But it is not helpful and it is not good for this nomination to continue to be pending, and it is not good for him to continue to be in the position of the acting head of the Antitrust Division. 
So, as we have this debate--and it will be a good debate; I am sure it will go on for some time--I merely urge my colleagues to bring this matter at some point to a vote in the near future so that we can move on with the business of antitrust in this country. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this past Tuesday night, the eyes of the Nation and a good part of the world were focused on Cleveland and the playing of the All Star Game. This was an All Star Game that had, I think, particular significance. This, of course, is the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's entrance into major league baseball, when the so-called color line was actually finally broken. 
It was appropriate that the honorary captain of the American League was Larry Doby. It was also appropriate that the other honorary captain was Frank Robinson. Frank Robinson, of course, who played when I was a young boy for the Cincinnati Reds, played very well, and then went on later to be the first African American manager in the American League for Cleveland. 
Mr. President, on July 5, 1947--50 years ago--Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in the American League. Earlier that year, of course, Jackie Robinson was the first person to be signed and to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers--the first African American to play in the major leagues--and Larry Doby was the first African American to play in the American League. 
Earlier this year, we as a nation paid tribute to Jackie Robinson for the courage and for the integrity showed in breaking baseball's color barrier. 
I think it is only right, Mr. President, to hail today on the Senate floor the quiet courage of a man who did the same thing just 3 months later in the American League. Bill Veeck of the Cleveland Indians saw that Larry Doby was leading the Negro National League with a .458 batting average and 13 home runs. Veeck and Doby then made a historic decision, a decision that amounted to an act of faith in America's future. They decided that the opposition to Jackie Robinson's entry into the Major Leagues was a throwback, a vestige of the past, and that racial tolerance was the wave of the future. It was a brave choice and a tough choice, but, of course, it was the right choice. Larry Doby said later that Bill Veeck `didn't see color. To me, he was in every sense colorblind, and I always knew he was there for me.' 
Mr. President, that was a very characteristically generous and gracious statement by Larry Doby because it was Larry Doby himself, after all, who had to be brave out on the playing field. Larry Doby had to be brave in a time of segregation and other terrible indignities inflicted on African-Americans. He showed the courage that was needed 50 years ago, and all Americans today ought to be grateful for his example. 
Again, here is another quote from Larry Doby. `Kids are our future, and we hope baseball has given them some idea of what it is to live together and how we can get along, whether you be black or white.' 
Mr. President, the accomplishments of Larry Doby on the baseball diamond are well known. In 1948, his first full season in the Major Leagues, he led the Indians to victory in the World Series, batting .318 and hitting a game-winning home run. He was named to the All Star team every single year from 1949 to 
1955. In 1952, Larry Doby led the American League in home runs and in runs scored. Two years later, in 1954, he led the league in home runs and in RBI's. He left the Indians in 1956 to play for the Chicago White Sox and later for the Detroit Tigers. Larry Doby retired in 1959 but returned to baseball in 1978 to manage the White Sox, becoming only the second African-American manager in the history of the major leagues. The first, as I stated, of course, as we know, was the great Frank Robinson, who managed the Cleveland Indians from 1975 to 1977. 
Mr. President, as I have said, Larry Doby's contribution to baseball is well known. That is why he was chosen to serve as honorary captain of this year's American League team at the All Star Game this past Tuesday night. But when everyone at Jacobs Field rose Tuesday night at the All Star Game to honor this great American, we thanked him even more for his message of reconciliation and racial brotherhood. 
I have a copy of the Cleveland Plain Dealer article from July 6, 1947. This article described Larry Doby's first game as a Cleveland Indian. The headline reads, `Doby Shows Strong Arm as He Works at Second Base.' 
I submit, Mr. President, that Larry Doby showed a lot more than that on that now distant July day. Larry Doby showed what America could and what America should be. So on behalf of people of the State of Ohio and on behalf of all Americans, I rise today in the Senate to say thank you to Larry Doby and to pay tribute to this very fine gentleman. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by my colleague and friend from New Jersey. It is an amendment that would disclose the total intelligence budget. 
Mr. President, intelligence budgets and programs are kept secret for a good reason: to keep our enemies--and, yes, we still do have enemies--from knowing how much we are spending on intelligence and, of course, on what programs. Mr. President, disclosure of the total budget might well be the first step leading to a demand to disclose individual agency budgets, as my colleague from Arizona has just stated, and inevitably to disclose specific programs. 
Mr. President, the reality is that a single budget figure with no additional detail or disclosure of capabilities does not, in my view, provide a sufficient basis for a meaningful public debate. Therefore, I think there would be pressure to disclose more. But such a disclosure would only help our enemies. It would provide them with vital information on our Nation's resource allocations. It would undermine our commitment to early warning for our policymakers, as well as our ability to provide our military the intelligence information that is essential to making them the best in the world. 
President Clinton--as the chairman of the committee has already pointed out--has the authority to disclose the total budget on his own. However, he has not done so. President Clinton joins every President since Harry Truman in making that same policy decision--that it is not in the best interest of this country to disclose this dollar figure. 
Mr. President, the practice of keeping the budget secret is fully consistent with the Constitution, and it carries forward a tradition of secret expenditures dating back more than 200 years. The Supreme Court observed in U.S. versus Richardson that `historical analysis of clause 7 suggests that it was intended to permit secrecy in operations.' It is clear, Mr. President, the Constitution provides for this secrecy. 
This intelligence figure is available to all Senators, as is the entire classified schedule of authorizations and classified annex to the Intelligence Authorization Act. Members of the Intelligence Committee, members of the Armed Services Committee, members of the Appropriations Committees in both the House and the Senate do provide vigorous oversight of the intelligence community and of its budget. There is full scrutiny through the people's elected representatives, while at the same time providing protection for intelligence operations. 
Mr. President, to disclose the budget would break with tradition. I believe it would help our enemies and it would not provide the public with any meaningful information. For these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this amendment. 
I believe that little can be gained, but much can be lost over time by this type of disclosure. 
I thank the Chair and my colleague from Alabama.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for the great work he has done as the subcommittee chairman. Let me also compliment my colleague from New Mexico, as well as my colleague from Missouri, for the great work that they have done to call the attention of the Senate to an issue that is certainly on the minds of the American people, and that is the issue of juvenile crime. 
We always have the question, as my colleague from New Mexico has pointed out, of what is the proper role of the Federal Government in what has historically been a matter that has been dealt with by the States. I think there is a role. I think what is important, as we look at Senate bill 10, which is currently in the Judiciary Committee, awaiting markup--as we look at that draft, it's important for us, with the finite amount of money that we do have to spend, that we spend that money wisely, and that we spend it with an understanding that the criminal justice system, particularly the juvenile justice system, is inherently a local system. So what we need to do in Congress is to do those things that matter, to do those things that maybe only the Federal Government can do to try to give assistance to the local communities. So we need to sit back, I think, and think about what that is, what can be our unique contribution. 
I want to talk this morning about one particular area that we have been able to get in the draft of the bill, which the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Sessions, has been very much supportive of. It is an area that I have worked on for a number of years, going back to the time when I was a county prosecutor, and that is the sorry state--if I can use that term--of our criminal records system in this country. I have worked long and hard to try to improve that system. It is an area where the Federal Government can be of assistance because the reality is that what happens in Ohio affects what happens in New Mexico and what happens in Alabama, as far as the keeping of criminal records. If Ohio doesn't put our records in the system and someone from Ohio goes to New Mexico and commits a crime, then New Mexico is the loser because the local law enforcement does not have that information. So this is an area where we have a national system, administered by the FBI--a criminal records system for adults, administered by the FBI. But if we don't get the local input and information, then it doesn't do any good. 
That same principle applies to juveniles. The only difference is, historically, we have not shared records of juvenile offenders. We have proceeded under the assumption that a person who commits a crime in Ohio before the age of 18 is a juvenile. Their records are sealed. They are not available to anyone. In fact, they may not even be available outside the county in which the individual committed the crime, or with the individual in Ohio, where that person resides. That is where the records are kept. 
I think we now understand that, with violent crime increasing among 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, even 13- and 14-year-olds, it makes absolutely no sense and is very counterproductive and dangerous for us to continue that old mindset that says we are going to protect the record of this juvenile, even if this juvenile has committed murder, even if this juvenile has 
committed rape, or a whole series of what would be felonies if committed by an adult. 
What this bill does is it says enough is enough. We have to change the policy in this country that says we protect these records, and we have to make these records available to law enforcement for legitimate law enforcement purposes--which means prosecutors, police, sheriff departments--so that when a 16-year-old commits a crime in Greene County, OH, and they show up a year later in New Mexico and commit another crime, there is a national database, and that there has been information put in that database so the officials in New Mexico know that this is not a first-time offender, that this person has a bad track record, and they have committed whatever they have committed in the State of Ohio. 
We live in a very mobile society. We live in a society where families are broken down, which means, tragically, young children move from community to community. For our own self-protection, it is vitally important that this information follow that individual. This is what this bill addresses. We will have the opportunity on the floor later to talk in much greater detail about what this does. 
I want to use a real life example, if I could, which I think illustrates the need for this type of tracking and for the money that this bill provides for the local communities to have this kind of tracking. 
Let me tell the story about `Jack.' That is not his real name. What he did was very, very real. When Jack was 12 years old, he was arrested for vandalizing a neighbor's house, wrecking the furniture and drowning the neighbor's pet bird in the bathtub. When Jack was 14, he was burglarizing another apartment. The elderly man who owned the apartment came home and found Jack there and confronted him. Jack and the elderly man struggled, as a result of which the elderly man broke his hip, and, tragically, this man then died a few days later of pneumonia. Jack was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 
Let's go forward, Mr. President, 5 more years. Jack is now 19. He breaks into a house and severely beats a 45-year-old woman who lives there. Jack is arrested for this. It is his first adult crime because now he is 19. A Cleveland judge has to sentence Jack, and because all his juvenile offenses aren't available to the court, the judge is dealing with a person who he thinks is a first-time offender. Jack got probation. This is a true story. Two months later, he burglarized another home and killed the 81-year-old man who lived there. The judge had to make a crucial decision in this particular case where we are talking about Jack, a decision vitally affecting the public safety of the judge's community. But he had to make that decision, which turned out to be a decision which cost someone their life; he had to make it in a state of legally enforced mandatory ignorance. It wasn't the judge's fault, it was the system's fault. 
What we intend to do by this legislation is to help change that culture, change that system, so that a judge who is faced with making a life-or-death decision will know whether or not this person is a first offender or whether, as in the case of Jack, he had a long record of not just scrapes with the law but a long record of violence. If a judge knew that, the judge's decision would be very different than if he did not know that fact. 
I see that my time is about up. Again, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Alabama for the great work he has done on this piece of legislation. I have taken a few minutes to talk about just one of the aspects of the legislation. There are many other parts that have been discussed. I look forward to working with him and the other Members of the Senate as we bring this bill to the floor this year, as we pass it, as we send it on to the President.

Mr. DeWINE. I will do this very briefly in the time we have. When I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I was in charge of the seven different agencies in our administration that had anything to do with law enforcement. One of the things that we tried to do is to improve our criminal records. This was, as I said, a longstanding interest of mine that went back to the time when I was a county prosecutor. When I first started looking at this as Lieutenant Governor, I was shocked by what I found. What I found is that the accuracy of the adult criminal records system in Ohio left a lot to be desired, and that is a nice way of saying it. 
I was even further shocked when I found that Ohio was pretty typical. It is pretty much the same as we find in most other States. 
When I first started looking at it, I asked the question to our State employees: How accurate are criminal records? I got something back like, `Well, we think they are about 40 percent accurate.' Six months later, after they really look into this, they found they were about 12 percent totally accurate. 
What happens is, as people are arrested it goes into the system but you don't get the final disposition going in. You don't get the information, if the person is convicted, or, in some cases, if the person is acquitted. So you try to determine how totally accurate the records are. 
What we find in most States is that clearly less than 50 percent of the criminal records are accurate. That is the adult system. But what we are dealing with here is the juvenile system. And in most States we are just barely beginning to establish the juvenile recordkeeping system. 
The money in this bill will help the States establish that system, help put it online, and help make it accurate.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing the Drug Free Communities Act to the floor today. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation--and I urge all my colleagues to support it today. 
We face an epidemic of drug abuse in this country--particularly among children. Substance abuse by young people has more than doubled during the past 5 years, and children are beginning to use drugs at younger ages. This trend has major implications for public health, which include the dangers of long-term addiction and disease. There also are costs to society as a whole in the form of poorer educational achievement, lost productivity, increased health care costs, and higher levels of crime. The most important cost, however, is the tragic loss of the potential and aspirations of many of our young people. 
During America's long fight against substance abuse, community-based coalitions have offered a way to turn this situation around. These coalitions have consistently shown that grassroots efforts to educate young people about the dangers of drug abuse do work. It is clear that a Federal drug abuse strategy must complement and enhance community actions wherever possible. 
Recognizing the success of community-based programs, the Drug Free Communities Act will enhance programs that work by providing matching grants to community coalitions with proven track records. This is a sensible approach, because it builds on the hard-won, practical experience of people who have been in the forefront of the fight against substance abuse. 
America's children are our most important resource, and substance abuse places them at great risk. The Drug Free Communities Act will enhance the ability of communities across the country to protect the health of their young people. This proposal has great potential for success and deserves our wholehearted support.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware and I thank Senator Dodd for this effective amendment. It is consistent with what we are trying to do and trying to say and are saying in the DeWine amendment. That simply is that the United States should not allow people who have committed political murders in the country of Haiti into the United States and whether these are from the left or the right, whether these occurred after Aristide or before Aristide, we should be consistent. 
So I support the amendment and urge its adoption.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment really is a very simple amendment. The amendment that Senator Graham and I have offered would deny entry into the United States to anyone who has been credibly alleged to have ordered or carried out extrajudicial and political killings in the country of Haiti. 
Mr. President, to an extent almost unimaginable to us who live in the United States, the history of Haiti has been a sad chronicle of brutal and repeated acts of political violence. Some of these extrajudicial killings occurred while former President Aristide was in exile. Some of these killings occurred after he returned to power. And tragically they have continued to occur after Mr. Aristide left office and President Preval became President. 
During Mr. Aristide's exile, the victims included Mr. Aristide's financial support, Antoine Izmery, who was killed on September 11, 1993; Guy Malary, Mr. Aristide's Minister of Justice, who was killed on October 14, 1993, and Father Jean-Marie Vincent, an Aristide supporter who was killed on August 28, 1992. 
Mr. President, after President Aristide regained power, it was the other side's turn. 
On March 28, 1995, a leader of the opposition to Mr. Aristide, attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, was gunned down in her car. One of her clients, Eugene Baillergeau, was also killed in the shooting. 
On May 22, 1995, Michel Gonzalez was killed in a drive-by shooting--after alleged attempts by Mr. Aristide to acquire his property. 
Three former top army officers were assassinated: Col. Max Mayard, killed on October 3, 1995. Col. Michelange Hermann, killed on May 24, 1995. And Brig. Gen. Romulus Dumarsais, killed on June 27, 1995. 
Since the inauguration of President Preval, further killings have taken place. 
On March 6, 1996, police and ministerial security guards killed at least six men during a raid in Cite Soleil in Port-au-Prince. 
On August 20, 1996, two opposition politicians--Jacques Fleurival and Pastor Antoine Leroy--were gunned down outside Mr. Fleurival's home. 
And the death toll goes on and on: Claude Yves Marie. Mario Beaubrun. Leslie Grimar. Joseph Chilove. Jean-Hurbert Feuille. 
The Haitian Government has assigned over 80 extrajudicial and political killing cases to the so-called Special Investigative Unit, the SIU. The Haitian Government says that they have fired several government employees who are suspects in these killings. But the sad fact remains that there has been no substantial progress made in these investigations. With the exception of one case that did go to trial where there was an acquittal, no one else has been tried. No one else has been convicted and no one has been punished for any of these assassinations. 
Clearly, Mr. President, we need to do everything in our power to encourage the Haitians to bring the killers to justice. We as a nation have made a substantial investment in the building of Haitian democracy. And the plight of Haitian boat people demonstrates very clearly and dramatically that moving Haiti into some level of stability is clearly in our national interest. 
But peace, democracy, and stability will not set down firm roots in Haiti unless and until the Haitian people themselves finally believe that power in their country can no longer be won at gunpoint. 
The days when political murders can be carried out with impunity must be brought to an end. This amendment that my colleague, Senator Graham, and I are now offering tells the Haitian people that political murder is no longer business as usual as far as the U.S. Government is concerned. In our view, it is time to stop adding names to the death toll of Haitian politics. 
The premise behind this amendment is that visiting the United States is a privilege, one that should not be taken for granted. By not allowing these Haitian political murderers into our country, we send a strong message to them and to all people that political violence in Haiti will not be ignored by the United States. 
This amendment does exempt persons on a case-by-case basis for medical reasons and cases in which the person has cooperated fully with the investigation of these political murders. This amendment also includes a reporting requirement. Our administration would be directed to submit to the appropriate congressional committees:) a list of those who have been credibly alleged to have ordered or carried out the extrajudicial and political killings;) a list of those who have been refused entry to the United States as a result of this provision; and a report on this matter to be submitted once each year until such time as the Government of Haiti has completed the investigation of the extrajudicial and political killings and has prosecuted those implicated in the killings. 
This amendment really is a very practical expression of our solidarity with the Haitian people, our solidarity with the Haitian people, as they aspire to real and true democracy and as they aspire to a peaceful civil society based on the rule of law instead of brutal violence. 
For too long, for tragically too long, violence, political violence has been the way of life in Haiti. Whether the government is led by General Cedras or President Aristide or President Preval, one sad truth remains: Too many Haitians die, too many Haitians die due to political violence. 
In past remarks on this Senate floor, I have outlined some of the measures the United States has taken and is taking to help the Haitian people break the cycle of violence. We are helping to train and provide resources for the SIU detectives who I talked about a moment ago, and we have sent experienced U.S. police officers to help mentor the young civilian police. 
As I have said on this floor on several occasions, one of most heartening things as I have visited Haiti now four times in the last several years is to see the young American, big-city police officers, Creole-speaking, Haitian born but United States citizens who are down there, trying to make a difference with this young police force. So there are things that are happening. Progress is being made. There is some good news. Haitians are making progress in a very tough, uphill battle. 
The adoption of this amendment will not solve their problems. It certainly will not solve their problems overnight, but I believe it will help. It will tell the Haitian people that we in the United States are on the side of everyone in that country who wants to create jobs, who wants to create hope; we are on the side of everyone in Haiti who wants a peaceful life, and we are on the side of everyone in Haiti who wants justice. 
When a country tries to move to democracy, we always look to see whether there is peaceful transition of power. We look to see whether or not there are elections and whether they are free and fair elections. We sometimes forget that that is not the only indicator of democracy and certainly is not the only indicator of whether or not that country will be able to preserve a fragile democracy. 
The other thing we have to look at is whether or not people feel they can have redress in the courts and whether or not, if someone, tragically, is murdered, or someone is injured, they have the opportunity or there will be the opportunity for their assailants to be brought to justice. This amendment deals with that and I believe will help the Government of Haiti and help the people of Haiti continue to progress towards the democracy that we want them to have and that they want. And the understanding must be that democracy is not just about elections, however important they are, but it is also about redress in courts. It is also about justice. It is also about a judicial system in which the general population can have confidence and faith. The solving of some of these high-profile political murders will go a long way to bringing about that type of confidence for the people of Haiti and will go a long way to creating the climate that we know must exist in Haiti if democracy is, in fact, to flourish and to survive.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his eloquent statement and comments about the need for S. 4. I also thank my friend and colleague from Missouri for the great work he has been doing to bring not only to the attention of the Senate but to the American people exactly what is at stake in regard to this bill. 
Mr. President, I am proud, again, to be on the floor to speak in favor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This bill is a truly necessary and forward-looking response to the major changes that have already taken place in the U.S. work force in the last few years. 
Mr. President, today's working men and working women feel battered between the conflicting demands of work and family. They feel there has to be a better way. I think they are right. 
Mr. President, the bill we are here to talk about on the floor today represents that better way--a better way for workers to balance the needs of family and the needs of the workplace. This bill gives working people the flexibility that they know would make a huge difference for the better in their lives. 
Mr. President, according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau, the top concern of working women is flexible scheduling in the workplace--flexible scheduling, which will allow them to balance their responsibilities at work with the needs of their children and the needs of their spouses. A stunning 66 percent of working women with children reported that their primary concern was the difficulty that they were having in balancing work and family. 
According to another recent poll conducted, 88 percent of all workers want more flexibility, either through scheduling flexibility or choice of compensatory time in lieu of traditional overtime pay. In that same poll, Mr. President, 75 percent--three-fourths--favored a change in the law that would permit hourly workers such a choice. 
These poll results tally with what most of us know intuitively, what we know from talking to our own constituents. As both the economy and American family life grow more and more complex, the men and women in America's work force want greater flexibility to be able to cope with all of these changes. 
The legislation known as S. 4 would do that. It does not propose doing something untried, something unheard of, something never used before. On the contrary, this is not revolutionary. We have a history of its use in the public sector, and we have a history of its use among employers who are not hourly but are salaried employees. All this bill does is give workers and their employers in the private sector the same kind of workplace flexibility that their counterparts have had for years in the public sector. 
Mr. President, I don't think it is outrageous to say that workers in the private sector should have the benefit of the same kind of flexibility Government workers have today. In fact, all it is is a fair shake. It is only equity and equality; it is only fairness. 
Mr. President, American society has changed a great deal over the last few decades. The stereotypical role of management and labor, male and female workers, simply does not exist anymore today. In 1938, when the original underlying legislation was passed, less than 16 percent of married women worked outside of the home. Today, more than 60 percent of married women work outside of the home. And 75 percent of mothers with school age children work outside the home today. 
The world has gone around many times in those years and the world has changed. The American society has changed. The squeeze on these workers, between family and job, is so great that workers themselves believe that action is absolutely imperative. That is why we are trying to change the outdated Fair Labor Standards Act. Mr. President, this would be a real, positive and necessary change for real American working families. 
A few weeks ago, I was on the floor and I talked about the Morris family, an Ohio family. Clayton Morris, a father and a husband, is a public employee. That means he has the option of choosing compensatory time over traditional monetary overtime pay. He is free to spend important extra time, because of this, with his 2 1/2 -year-old son, Domenic. 
However, Clayton's wife Ann is a sales assistant for a Cleveland area business form company. That means she can't take time off to be with Domenic in lieu of overtime pay. The Federal Government today prohibits her from doing that. Ann has said, `He'--referring to husband Clayton--`has the ability, if he works overtime, to store those hours. He can use the stored comptime to be at home where he is needed. However, when I need to be able to leave work, I end up having to take sick time or vacation time to do the very same thing. It would be really nice if I had a flexible schedule.' 
Mr. President, American workers and their employers want and are demanding this flexibility. Seemingly, countless studies and surveys have pointed out, time and time again, Americans' overwhelming need, desire, and support of a more flexible workplace schedule and the changes the Family Friendly Workplace Act would provide. 
Mr. President, if you look at a family like the Morrises, you can see one major reason for the broad public support for this bill. People in the private sector see their friends and family members who are in the public sector; they see how much this type of flexibility helps them and helps their families. They see it and know it works. 
Mr. President, I regret that thus far in the U.S. Senate, some Members of the Senate have chosen to stand in the way of the perfectly legitimate desire on the part of American workers and employers for a truly flexible, family-friendly workplace.

Mr. DeWINE. In conclusion, Mr. President, let me stress that it is not too late for this Senate to work toward an intelligent bipartisan resolution of this issue. 
I say to my friends: Let's put politics aside. Let's try to see how far we can move toward giving America's workers what they want, what they need, and what they deserve. This is one case where thus far the American people are far ahead of this Congress--far ahead of this Congress in the very real sense that they know this law needs to be changed. They know that we need to have this flexibility. They not only want it. They are demanding it. 
I am confident that in the days ahead and weeks ahead we will be able to bring about this change that the American workers--people who work by the hour, who are out there every day trying to make a difference, every day who are trying to balance their family obligations with their obligations in the workplace--need. They need this type flexibility that S. 4 will give them. 
I again commend my colleague from Georgia for the great work that he has done on this bill, and my colleague from Missouri for bringing this matter to the floor. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for the great job he has done. 
In survey after survey, the American people endorse the ideas and the basic principles of this bill. More flexibility in the workplace, letting workers choose how they want to be compensated for overtime, letting workers decide what they need most--time with their family, time to study, time to relax; or time-and-a-half overtime pay to meet their financial obligations. 
Madam President, an article in the Cincinnati Enquirer, I think, summarized it very well. `A little flexibility would be a godsend to good workers who also want to be good parents.' The article went on to say, `It could benefit employers, too, who'd find it easier to recruit and retain productive workers.' 
President Clinton has stated, `We should pass a flextime law that allows employees to take overtime pay in money or in time off, depending on what is better for their family.' 
Clearly, what we have here are the makings of a national consensus. I believe it would be a terrible shame if we let this popular and this necessary legislation fall victim to partisan wrangling here on the Senate floor. 
Madam President, this is a proworker bill. The bill requires that all participation be voluntary. Let me say it again--voluntary. All participation under this bill must be voluntary. If a worker does not want it, he or she can just say no. No punishment, no retribution, no consequence. Under no circumstances will participation be a condition of employment. 
Further, Madam President, the bill has powerful anticoercion provisions in very strong penalty language for any employer who violates those provisions. I believe, Madam President, we have already established some level of cooperation in this bill. For example, during the markup, Senators Kennedy and Wellstone were very concerned about the status of unused accrued comptime hours in the event of a bankruptcy--a legitimate concern. They wanted to create stronger protections for employees. In the spirit of compromise, I asked our distinguished colleague Senator Grassley, whose Judiciary subcommittee has the proper jurisdiction and expertise on this issue, to draft legislation to deal with these concerns. Yesterday, Senator Grassley came to the floor and offered his amendment to improve this bill. Unfortunately, regrettably, we have not yet been able to vote on Senator Grassley's amendment. 
Madam President, we should build on this bipartisan spirit of cooperation, the bipartisan spirit of that amendment, and work toward passage of this bill. I believe, Madam President, we need to put the focus on the needs of those workers. We should look at this issue from the perspective of the working people who are going to be directly affected. Let us pass a bipartisan response to their very legitimate concerns.

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Bond's resolution, the sense of the Senate regarding the protection of children's health. While I believe that our children will be best served by a balanced budget, we also must ensure that this agreement sends a strong message that we must preserve the access of low-income children to quality health care. 
May children's hospitals are designated as disproportionate share hospitals or DSH hospitals because they serve a 
disproportionate share of low-income children. DSH payments make a vital difference in the ability of hospitals to serve this population. They are a critical part of the health care safety net for vulnerable children. 
For example, two of the largest children's hospitals in Ohio have informed me that approximately 40 percent of the children they serve are covered by Medicaid. Without the additional DSH payments, the ability of these hospitals to serve low-income children would be seriously impaired. 
DSH payments are even more important to independent children's teaching hospitals that do not receive Medicare support for graduate medical education, known as DSH dollars. In fact, I'm working on a letter to the Finance Committee about this GME inequity now. 
But my point here is that if DSH funds are cut from children's hospitals--that already are not receiving dsh funds--then these hospitals will find it very difficult to provide quality care for poor children. Although we must balance the Federal budget, we also want this balanced budget to make children's health and well-being a top priority. 
Senator Bond's resolution is consistent with that message. It recognizes how important a balanced budget is, and it recognizes that some changes in DSH payments may well be necessary. But, it also recognizes how important--within such a budget--DSH is to children's health. I strongly support the Bond resolution.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Mack's amendment to double the research budget of the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years and to add $2 billion to NIH funding now for fiscal year 1998. I want to thank the Senator for bringing this amendment to the floor today and this issue to the attention of our colleagues. 
This level of funding is critical. It's clearly needed if we're going to tackle the serious medical problems that America faces--including cancer, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, AIDS, and the need for additional information about the special medical needs of children. 
Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has a proven track record that has touched the lives of many Americans. The broad scope of its achievements is truly impressive. It includes the development of new treatments for disease; identification of genetic mutations for a varied set of diseases; identification of genetic mutations for a varied set of diseases; and contributions to the development of new scanning technologies. These spectacular advances in health could not have been achieved but for the commitment of Federal dollars we make to the NIH. 
And let us be clear on this. The returns on the public investment in biomedical research have been impressive. Not only have we won Nobel prizes and built on decades of basic research, we have contributed to our national economic growth. Our investments have given life to America's biotechnology industry. Some have estimated that revenues in this industry will approach $50 billion annually by the year 2000 and create as many as 500,000 new jobs. 
I am supporting this effort because I believe it reflects a commitment to substantially strengthen our priorities toward biomedical research. We cannot rest on our laurels. We must work to improve the health of our citizens. I also want to make a personal commitment to work with my colleagues there in Congress and with the NIH to make advantage of the important opportunity this amendment presents to advance research that benefits all of us--and especially, all of our children. 
Let me highlight just one example of the type of activity that additional NIH research could support. Children under the age of 21 represent 30 percent of the population--and yet the NIH devotes only somewhere between 5 and 14 percent of its budget to their needs. Just as there has been a recognition in recent years that women and minorities have been neglected in research efforts nationwide, there's a growing consensus that children deserve more attention than they are getting. 
Children are not small adults. They go through different developmental stages, they metabolize drugs differently, and they respond to illnesses and treatments differently. Children's health needs are not only different--they're often ignored by the private sector. 
Federal funding for research--especially medical research--is a fundamental responsibility of Government. Today, the Senate must acknowledge that responsibility and act to enhance the ability of NIH to improve the health of all Americans.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, not only for bringing this bill to the floor, for working on it for so many months, but also for that very eloquent statement about the tragedy that occurred in his family. 
I think his statement was the statement about the value of life and how precious human life really is. Each one of us, at different times in our lives, are reminded of the value of life, and sometimes how brief that life can be. As I look around the Chamber of the Senate this evening, I see three of my colleagues who have lost children, three of us who have lost children, who understand maybe more than we did before how precious human life is. 
Really, that is what this debate is about tonight, what it has been about today. One of the things that we do in this Senate, as we have the luxury, if you want to use the term, of unlimited debate, is to thoroughly discuss issues. And as we do that, this tradition that is over 200 years in this body, as we do that, many times we do, in fact, educate ourselves and understand things better. Maybe, as we try to educate ourselves, we help educate the American people. 
We have been at this debate for a long time because we had this debate last session of Congress. I would like, tonight, to talk about some of the things we have learned. I entered this Chamber, as my colleague from Texas, Phil Gramm, said earlier this evening, entered the Chamber a few months ago--I say now over a year ago--with not a whole lot of knowledge about partial-birth abortion. I think we all have become educated, not just from the debate here on the floor, but also we have been educated by the hearings. We have learned what partial-birth abortion is. 
I think the most telling description was given by Brenda Pratt Shafer, of Franklin, OH, when she testified in front of the Judiciary Committee. Let me, if I could, share with my colleagues in part what she said: 
Mr. Chairman and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, I am Brenda Pratt Shafer. I am a registered nurse, licensed in the State of Ohio, with 13 years of experience. In 1993, I was employed by Kimberly Quality Care, a nursing agency in Dayton, OH. In September 1993, Kimberly Quality Care asked me to accept an assignment at the Women's Medical Center, which is operated by Dr. Martin Haskell. I readily accepted this assignment because I was at that time very pro-choice. 
She continues:  
So, because of the strong pro-choice views I held at that time, I thought this assignment would be no problem for me. 
But I was wrong. I stood at the doctor's side as he performed the partial-birth abortion procedure--and what I saw is branded on my mind forever. 
I worked as an assistant nurse at Dr. Haskell's clinic for 3 days--September 28, 29, 30, 1993. 
She continues: 
On the third day, Dr. Haskell asked me to observe as he performed several of these procedures that are the subject of this hearing. Although I was in the clinic on the assignment of the agency, Dr. Haskell was interested in hiring me full-time, and I was being oriented in the entire range of procedures provided by that facility. 
I was present for three of these partial-birth procedures. It is the first one that I will describe to you in detail. 
The mother was 6 months pregnant, 26 1/2 weeks. A doctor told her that the baby had Down Syndrome, and she had to have an abortion. She decided to have this abortion. She came in the first 2 days and have the laminaria inserted and changed, and she cried the whole time she was there. On the third day, she came in to have the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so that he could see the baby. On the ultrasound screen, I could see the heart beat. As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on the ultrasound screen, the baby's heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen. 
Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body and arms--everything but the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. 
Senators this is a baby that was a little bit smaller than the baby that I actually saw that day. 
She held something up. 
This is a mechanical model of a baby. 
The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall. 
The doctor opened up the scissors, and stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp. 
I was really completely unprepared for what I was seeing. I almost threw up as I watched Dr. Haskell doing these things. 
Next, Dr. Haskell delivered the baby's head. He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used. I saw the baby move in the pan. I asked another nurse, and she said it was just reflexes. 
I have been a nurse for a long time, and I have seen a lot of death--people maimed in auto accidents, gunshot wounds, you name it. I have seen surgical procedures of every sort. But in all my professional years, I had never witnessed anything like this. 
The woman wanted to see her baby, so they cleaned up the baby and put it into a blanket and handed it to her. She cried the whole time. She kept saying, `I am so sorry, please forgive me.' I was crying, too. I couldn't take it. That baby boy had the most perfect angelic face I think I have ever seen in my life. 
I was present in the room during two more such procedures that day, but I was really in shock. I tried to pretend I was somewhere else, to not think about what was happening. I just couldn't wait to get out of there. After I left that day, I never went back. The last two procedures, by the way, involved healthy mothers with healthy babies. 
That was the testimony of the nurse, testimony that has never been controverted. In fact, I will not take the Senate's time to read this in its entirety, but this is the actual paper that Dr. Haskell prepared that has been quoted before in this procedure. It is a paper delivered by Martin Haskell, presented at the National Abortion Federation, Risk Management Seminar, September 13, 1992. You can track in Dr. Haskell's own words exactly what nurse Shafer said. 
The doctor uses medical terminology. Part of this has already been read today by Dr. Frist, Senator Frist, when he gave his very eloquent comments in opposing the Daschle amendment. I will point out one thing that is very evident when you look at this description by Dr. Haskell of what this partial-birth abortion procedure is, that it takes 3 days, day 1, day 2, day 3. That was confirmed by what Nurse Shafer said. The dilation occurs in the first 2 days. They go in, go back home or go to a motel, and then come back the third day for the procedure itself. But actually the whole procedure takes 3 days. 
We have also learned not only what the procedure is, we have learned a lot about why it is done. 
Again, maybe the best evidence is to listen to the people who perform the abortions. 
Dr. McMahon has told us, he has said that a number of these were done for nothing more serious than cleft palates. Seven, eight, possibly nine, for cleft palates, the life was snuffed out. 
Dr. Haskell has told us that 80 percent--80 percent--of the abortions he performs are elective. The evidence is overwhelming of why these are done and under what circumstances. 
Mr. President, during the just concluded debate, a number of my colleagues spoke of how this issue has deeply divided this country. One even said that nothing really has divided this country as much as the abortion debate has since the debate over slavery prior to and leading up to and including the Civil War. 
I think that is correct. Few issues in our whole country's history have been so divisive. I would argue, Mr. President, this debate over abortion has been so protracted and intense because in a sense in a government of `we the people,' we are still trying to figure out who `we'--what that means, who is included. 
I say, Mr. President, that the vulnerable babies that we have heard about are us. And whether or not we are willing to speak out, whether or not we are willing to say enough is enough, not only will determine whether some of these babies will live or die, but it also will determine what kind of a people we are, what kind of a society we want to live in, who we really are, who we are as a people, what do we value and what do we not value, what do we become indignant about, and what do we walk away from. 
How bad do things have to be before we speak up and say enough is enough? This is something we simply, even in 1997, this is something we will not tolerate. It is wrong. We will not put up with it. We will not allow it to occur in a civilized society. So, in a sense, not only is this a debate about the babies, not only a debate about who will live, it is also a debate about who all of us are and what kind of a country we have, what kind of a country we want. 
I think we have an obligation to speak up. I think that many times the sins that we commit as a people, as individuals, are sins of omission, what we do not do when we do not speak up. 
I would like to quote from my friend, Henry Hyde, from a book that he wrote that I think summarizes what I believe. This is what Congressman Henry Hyde said: 
I believe . . . that when the final judgment comes--as it will surely--when that moment comes that you face Almighty God--the individual judgment, the particular judgment--I believe that a terror will grip your soul like none other than you can imagine. The sins of omission will be what weigh you down; not the things you've done wrong, the chances you've taken, but the things you failed to do, the times that you stepped back, the times you didn't speak out. 
Not only for every idle word but for every idle silence must man render an account. I think that you will be overwhelmed with remorse for the things you failed to do. 
Mr. President, let us move to pass this bill. Let us speak out for what is right. And let us hope that the power of the arguments that have been heard on the floor--no, rather the facts that have been clearly disclosed on the floor--will then persuade the President of the United States to rectify a mistake that he made last year when he vetoed this bill. We know more today. Many of the statements that were made by the President in his veto message are clearly, clearly not true. It was clear to many of us at the time they were not true, but now that we have had the opportunity for more debate, more evidence, it is clear that the reasons he gave, the rationales he gave, are simply not there. 
So let us pass this bill. Let us send it again to the President. And let us pray that the power of the facts will convince our President to sign the bill. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in reluctance, but very strong opposition, to this amendment. I join with the comments that my friend, Senator Santorum, has made about our colleague, the distinguished minority leader. I think he has made a very honest attempt to deal with this issue. But I would like to explain over the next few minutes why I believe that this attempt has failed and why I believe that this amendment, however well intentioned I know it is, is a gutting amendment and how this amendment strips really everything away. 
It is really not the Senator's fault. I do not know if it is anyone's fault. But the reality is, we have to live with previous Court decisions and we have to live with a whole body of law. Legislation that we write has to take that into consideration, how words have in fact been defined. 
The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear in the Bolton case how broad the language of `health' is, and when there is a health exception what that really does, and that everything is taken into consideration. 
I understand the Senator has tried to craft this legislation maybe to deal with that. I do not think it can be done. I do not think, in light of those cases, that that really can be done at all. 
But let us walk through, for a moment, what has to take place. The word `certification' is important because what this amendment says is--you have several issues, but they are all decisions, let us keep in mind, that are made by the attending physician, by the person performing the abortion. 
You start with the issue of viability. Now, the reality is --you cannot change the reality--the vast majority of these occur before viability. And the vast majority of them--according to Dr. Haskell 80 percent--are elective abortions. That is a fact. Those are the facts. We cannot change those facts, which means that this amendment does not deal with that. It does not deal with all those abortions at all. 
But let us go beyond that, because what this amendment says is the doctor has to certify. But even before he gets to the certification process, he makes a determination about viability. If he says `not viable' then that is it; it ends the debate. Only if he or she then says this child is viable, the fetus is viable, then the language kicks in. It says the doctor must certify. 
I would submit that once the certification takes place, that is it. And, again, it is solely within the discretion of the doctor whether certification takes place or does not take place. The operative act is not an objective standard; it is the certification in and of itself. That ends the discussion. That is it. 
Let me, if I could, Mr. President, recap where we are and what I think we have learned in the last few days. But before that, of course, with testimony in the Judiciary Committee on several different occasions, the other floor debates that we have had, I think we have established certain things, that certain things are uncontroverted. 
We have all seen the graphic descriptions of what happens in this procedure. There is no dispute about that. There is no dispute about the horror. There is no dispute about the tragedy. 
I believe it has been established and recognized from the AMA to Dr. C. Everett Koop that this procedure is never the only procedure that will save the life, or the health, of the mother. 
I think we have established that even when the baby, for medical reasons, must be separated from the mother, there is no reason to kill the baby. The termination of pregnancy is not the same as an abortion. 
I think the evidence is clear that the real reason this procedure is done is because it is easier for the abortionists. We have heard what Dr. Martin Haskell, the abortionist from Dayton, OH, has to say. I read his quote yesterday. This is what he says in part: `The goal of your work is to complete an abortion.' To complete an abortion. That is the goal. 
So we know, Mr. President, why these babies are killed--not for health reasons, not because the mother needs it, not because the baby cannot be delivered and may be saved, but because an abortionist does not want the baby to survive. 
That is the object. That is what Dr. Haskell says in his quote. 
The amendment that is before the Senate purports to deal with the issue of health. The amendment would ban postviability abortions unless `the physician certifies'--the operative language--`that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her health.' 
As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, I believe it is clear this amendment--and the Court cases show--this amendment would do nothing to stop partial-birth abortion. To the contrary, it would allow any abortion, any abortion, Mr. President, to be performed. 
Roe versus Wade provides, as we all know, that in the third trimester there is a legitimate State interest in prohibiting abortions after fetal viability. This amendment would add a health exception to the underlying bill. That sounds good on its face, it looks good, but when you look at the Court decisions and when you look at the reality of how this would work in the real world, we find that exception expands in practice. 
There are no health circumstances, the evidence has clearly shown, that require a pregnancy be terminated by administering this particularly horrible procedure. Yesterday, I quoted Dr. Nancy Romer, chairman of ob-gyn and a professor at Wright State University Medical School in Ohio. Dr. Romer said,  
This procedure is currently not an accepted medical procedure. A search of medical literature reveals no mention of this procedure, and there is no critically evaluated or peer review journal that describes this procedure. There is currently no peer review or accountability in this procedure. It is currently being performed by physicians with no obstetric training in an outpatient facility behind closed doors and with no peer review. 
Dr. Romer goes on to say, 
There is no medical evidence that the partial-birth abortion procedure is safer or necessary to provide comprehensive health care to women. 
So, Mr. President, it is clear there are no medical circumstances that would require this procedure. Well, then you could argue, if that is true, Senator DeWine, why, then, what is wrong with putting a health exception in? What harm would that do? If there are no such circumstances, why not add a health exception anyway? The answer is, this health exception is so broad that it would, in fact, swallow up the rule. It is so broad that, literally, any abortion would be permitted. 
How do we know that? When the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe versus Wade, it also handed a decision entitled `Doe versus Bolton.' Bolton held that a State statute that forbade abortions based on a life exception had to be interpreted to mean that `the medical judgment' to provide abortion for health reasons `may be exercised in the light of all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient.' 
It is clear from other cases how that is interpreted. That is interpreted, basically, to mean that it cannot be enforced in any way, that health exception consumes everything. 
If we pass the Daschle amendment and require this concept of physician certification, that the pregnancy would risk grievous injury, I believe that clearly would render this bill meaningless. The courts, in interpreting the meaning of the word `health,' were accorded the broad interpretation that the Supreme Court has consistently applied. 
My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, has already read the quote from Dr. Warren Hern, but it is appropriate to hear it again because it is directly on point to this issue. Dr. Warren Hern, a Colorado abortionist who has performed hundreds of late-term abortions, has already stated that he will certify that any pregnant woman can meet the standard of the Daschle amendment. `I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life 
and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.' Any pregnant woman. 
So, Mr. President, there we have it. Under this exception, any abortion would be permitted. When we have the testimony of America's most respected doctor, Dr. C. Everett Koop, backed by the American Medical Association in support of the assertion that there is never a medical necessity for this procedure, it is clear what the health exception is. 
Mr. President, unfortunately, tragically, that purported exception is a hoax, it is a sham, it is a smokescreen, however well-intentioned the authors are. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, when you come down to it, I think it is a moral dodge. I think it puts us to sleep. It is a way we can try to convince ourselves that it is OK, this amendment is OK, even though, in effect, we are tolerating something very, very bad. 
Mr. President, we are not OK. We know what is going on behind the curtain and we cannot wish that knowledge away, however much we would like to. We have to face it and we have to do what is right. That means passing this bill to ban this barbaric, inhuman, unconscionable practice. 
Again, with respect to my distinguished colleague, the minority leader, it also means we must vote this amendment down. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, why do we argue with the Daschle amendment that sounds, on its face, reasonable? Why do we argue to say that it is a gutting amendment? Let me give my colleagues, very quickly, four reasons. 
When you look at the language of the Daschle amendment, you find that it creates a subjective standard. The underlying bill has an objective standard. 
The amendment says `would threaten the mother's life,' or `risk grievous injury to her physical health.' `Risk' is the key word. 
We have quoted Dr. Hern in Colorado who said, `I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health'--`could cause.' We cited this. But, frankly, I don't believe anyone, if you look just at the language, would disagree with what the doctor said. The reality is that any pregnancy has a risk. We are dealing with subjective language. 
Second, it is doctor self-certified. The operative language, the key language, is certification. No way you can look beyond and behind that certification. Once the certification is made, that is it. 
Third, the issue of viability: Before you even get to the question of certification, you have the issue of viability. All the doctor has to say is `not viable.' Who is going to look behind that? 
Senator Nickles has pointed out very well in citing the Supreme Court case that says when we are dealing with the issue of viability it is left up to the discretion of the physician. We look to the physician. My friends on the other side of the aisle can say, `Well, who else would you look at?' That is fine. But the reality is, you can't then tell me it is an objective standard. It is a subjective standard. It is self-certification, self-decided by the person who is performing the abortion. 
Finally, the fourth reason: The courts have historically given a very liberal interpretation to the whole issue of health as it pertains to a bill having to do with abortions. 
Four reasons, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, why this very good-sounding amendment is a gutting amendment which really destroys the underlying bill.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise once again to support the ban on the procedure known as partial-birth abortions. 
Mr. President, we have heard a lot in the last year or two about this procedure. We have heard the graphic details, the details which are certainly not very pleasant. But we know that they are true. They are indisputable. We know exactly what this `procedure' consists of. Senator Santorum earlier this afternoon very graphically described it. It is unconscionable. 
Mr President, the public reaction to disclosure about this `procedure'--the disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really is--has been loud and convincing. There is a good reason for this. Yes, this procedure is barbaric. There is simply no other way to describe it. 
Many people have asked the question. Why? Why does it take place? Why is it done? Why do they do this procedure? Is it really necessary?' Then the question is, `Why do we as a people allow this to happen?' 
The opponents of this measure argue that it is medically necessary. Mr. President, this is simply not true. This is not a valid argument, when you have probably the single most respected physician in this country, Dr. C. Everett Koop, who says exactly the opposite. Dr. Koop in an interview with the American Medical News on March 3 of this year says: `In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described . . . partial birth, and then destruction of an unborn child before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the mother.' 
Mr. President, America's most respected physician is not alone in this view. 
Dr. Nancy Romer, chairman of OB-GYN and professor at Wright State University Medical School in Ohio says: `This procedure is currently not an accepted medical procedure. A search of medical literature reveals no mention of this procedure, and there is no critically evaluated or peer review journal that describes this procedure. There is currently no peer review or accountability of this procedure. It is currently being performed by a physician with no obstetric training in an outpatient facility behind closed doors and no peer review.' 
Dr. Romer also says, Mr. President: `There is no medical evidence that a partial-birth abortion procedure is safer or necessary to provide comprehensive health care to women.' 
Let me stress, Mr. President, what the doctor said, `no medical evidence'; none. 
Just this week the American Medical Association also endorsed this view. This is what they say. They said there were no situations in which partial-birth abortion `is the only appropriate procedure'; no circumstances, Mr. President, where partial-birth abortion `is the only appropriate procedure.' 
I think it is often instructive to look at what those who perform the abortions have to say. One of the most famous or infamous abortionists is Martin Haskell. He has admitted--this is uncontroverted; no one disputes this--Dr. Haskell, who has performed hundreds of thousands of these probably, admits that at least 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he performed are elective. And the late Dr. James McMahon, a person who performed many abortions, says he performed nine of these partial-birth abortions because the baby had a cleft lip. 
Let me repeat that. Nine were performed, according to Dr. James McMahon, for no other reason than the baby had a cleft lip. 
Medical necessity, Mr. President? Medical necessity? So much for medical necessity. 
Why then is this procedure performed? Is it because some of these fetuses are deformed? 
Betty Friedan, in a televised debate, called such little babies `monsters'; `monsters.' She said it not once but twice. 
Are we now in the business of killing people for being defective, Mr. President? My colleague from Pennsylvania has pointed out very eloquently the irony of this argument, the fact that today--we tried earlier this week to protect people with handicaps, protect them in school to make sure they had a full education, but at the same time abortions are being performed, partial-birth abortions are being performed not for medical necessity but rather this child is somehow not `perfect,' at least as we see perfection. 
Are we now, Mr. President, in the business of killing people for being defective? I would submit that the world has gone down that path once already in this blood-soaked 20th century. Are we really willing to go down that road again? Are we willing to go down that road again in this country that is based on the sanctity of human life, the sanctity of human rights? I hope not. 
Mr. President, when the child which is subject to a partial-birth abortion exits the birth canal, once he or she is out, the child, of course, is protected by the U.S. Constitution. If the doctor performing the abortion slips, sneezes, something happens, and as a result the child's head exits the mother's body, then that doctor cannot legally kill 
that child. 
Mr. President, do we as a nation really believe that those few inches between being inside the mother and being outside the mother, do we really believe that defines the difference between a legitimate medical procedure and barbaric murder? I hope and believe that we are better than that, that even our jaded, contemporary public morality would rebel in calling this a legitimate medical procedure. 
Mr. President, the defenders of this procedure used to try to change the subject. They used to say that it rarely happens, so we shouldn't get all worked up about it. 
Well, it is funny. You do not hear much of that argument anymore. The reason we do not hear that argument much anymore is because of the shocking confession made by a leader in the abortion rights movement. Ron Fitzsimmons is the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. In 1995, when the Senate was considering the partial-birth abortion bill, he was helping lead the fight against this very bill. He went on `Nightline' to argue that the procedure ought to remain legal. At that time, he said the procedure was rare and was primarily performed to save the lives or the fertility of the mothers. 
You know, a funny thing happened after that. Apparently his conscience starting gnawing at him. He says now that he felt physically ill about the lies he had told. He said to his wife the very next day, `I can't do this again.' 
Meanwhile, President Clinton was using Mr. Fitzsimmons' false statements to buttress his case for vetoing the partial-birth abortion bill that this Senate passed. 
But a couple of months ago Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that, in his own words, he `lied through his teeth.' The facts, as he now publicly acknowledges them, are clear. Partial-birth abortion is not a rare procedure. It happens tragically all the time. And it is not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in danger. It is performed on healthy women, it is performed on healthy babies--all the time. 
Remember Dr. Haskell's quote that 80 percent of the abortions he performed are elective. 
Mr. President, it is true that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But people are not entitled to their own facts. 
Ruth Padawer of the Record newspaper in Bergen, NJ, reported last September 15 that 1,500 of these partial-birth abortions happened in one local clinic in 1 year. 
Once you confront the reality of what partial-birth abortion really is, you realize that from a moral perspective one of these atrocities is as bad as 1,500, but let nobody say this procedure is somehow de minimis, that it does not happen often enough to deserve legal notice. 
Let me now describe briefly some of the proposed amendments to this legislation. I know we will have the opportunity later during this debate to talk about this at length. Let me just for a moment talk about several of the amendments at least as I now understand them. 
Under the Boxer-Feinstein amendment, the exceptions swallow the rule. It is the old trick. Make it sound good, but then put an exception in there that, in reality, the way it really works as interpreted already by courts, the exception swallows up the entire rule and really makes the bill, in this case the amendment, meaningless. Under the Bolton precedent, the Bolton case, the `health' language clearly has unlimited meaning. So once the term `health' is in there, as interpreted by the Court, it swallows up the entire amendment and makes it useless. It is determined by the existence of health circumstances as decided by the very same doctor who performs the abortion. That is who does the decision. That is who makes the decision about the health under the Boxer-Feinstein amendment. Clearly that exception renders the bill meaningless. 
Furthermore, if this really is about maternal health, then why do we have to kill the baby? Senator Santorum very eloquently talked about this a few minutes ago. No doctor, no witness, no Senator has yet offered any evidence that tells us why, when the health of the mother is in danger, you have to kill the baby. Why? Why can't we, if it is threatening the mother's health, deliver the baby and, if possible, save it? Why does this child have to be killed? 
Senator Santorum earlier read in part from this letter, the letter from the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth. I want to read one of the paragraphs because it addresses this very issue, and this is what the doctors said:  
As specialists in the care and management of high-risk pregnancies complicated by maternal or fetal illness, we have all treated women who during their pregnancies have faced the conditions cited by Senator Daschle. We are gravely concerned that the remarks by Senator Daschle and those who support the continued use of partial-birth abortion may lead such women to believe that they have no other choice but to abort their children because of their conditions. While it may become necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, abortion is not required--i.e., it is never medically necessary, in order to preserve the woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death. What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator Daschle is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of the child. 
Why then can't we as a society, if the child is threatening the mother's health, deliver the child and, if possible, to try to save it? Why does that child have to be killed? There is no medical answer for that, there is no medical reason. But let me submit a reason that I think is critically clear from the debate and, more importantly, from the evidence and, more importantly, from the words of the doctors who perform these abortions. Why is it done? Why does the child have to be killed? The child has to be killed because that is the goal. That is the goal. That is what the doctor wants to do. 
Now, Dr. Haskell, who has performed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these, has said as much. In an interview with the American Medical News, he said: 
You could dilate further and deliver the baby alive, but that's really not the point. The point is you are attempting to do an abortion. And that's the goal of your work, is to complete an abortion. Not to see how do I manipulate the situation so that I get a live birth instead. 
Dr. Haskell admits it. He admits what the goal is. He admits why it is done. Why can't we on the Senate floor? 
An abortion is legal in this country. I happen to be pro-life. But nothing says we have to allow this procedure simply because it allows the doctor to speed up the procedure and move on to the next one. These are done for the doctor's convenience. 
Let me specifically go back to the issue of the Daschle amendment, and again we will have the exact language in the Chamber, I am sure, and we will have the opportunity to more thoroughly debate this. Let me address the third trimester ban that is proposed by this amendment. The reality is that the exceptions are simply too numerous and the way they will be applied it will again swallow up the amendment. 
The facts are that the vast majority of these partial-birth abortions occur in the fifth and sixth months. All the abortionist has to do under this amendment is to certify that either the baby is not viable, just certify it, or that the abortion is medically necessary. The conditions are spelled out 
apparently in the amendment. In practice, this means there will be no limit on the will of the abortionist. The same person who will be certifying is the person such as Dr. Haskell who has described why he performs this procedure. In practice, there will be no limit to what the abortionist does. Our colleague, my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, has compared it--he does it better than anybody I have heard--to passing an assault weapons ban and then entrusting gun dealers to decide what constitutes an assault weapon. Would anybody propose to do that? I think not. 
Viability has also been proposed as a standard. I fail to see what viability has to do with whether this procedure should really be permitted. Whether it should be permitted is a question of humaneness or arguably a question of health. If one can show that the fetus threatens maternal health and that abortion is the only way to save the mother's health, the opponents of the ban are still confronted with the insufferable difficulty of proving this specific procedure, partial-birth abortion, is the only way to accomplish that goal. 
As Dr. Koop and Dr. Romer have testified, there is absolutely no way the partial-birth supporters can meet that test because this procedure is never medically necessary. The proponents of partial-birth cannot hide behind a false claim of medical necessity. There is no medical necessity. The evidence is abundantly clear. 
Let us again, because I think it is so instructive, hear what Dr. Martin Haskell says, the abortionist who has performed so many of these abortions and who, frankly, has been so very candid about what he does and why he does it. Let us hear Dr. Haskell describe this procedure, again a procedure that is not medically necessary. This is what he says, not Mike DeWine, not Senator Santorum, not Senator Boxer. This is what Dr. Martin Haskell, who performs these abortions, has to say.  
I just kept on doing D&Es because that is what I was comfortable with up until 24 weeks. But they were very tough. Sometimes it was a 45-minute operation. I noticed that some of the later D&Es were very easy so I asked myself why can't they all happen this way. You see the easy ones would have a foot-length presentation, you'd reach up and grab the foot of the fetus, pull the fetus down and the head would hang up and then you would collapse the head and take it out. It was easy. 
It was easy, Mr. President, it was easy for Dr. Haskell. Dr. Haskell does not say it was easy for the mother. I suspect that he really does not care. His goal is to perform abortions. 
Under these proposed amendments, is Dr. Martin Haskell, a man who has said--you have heard what he had to say--is he the person we are going to trust to decide whether abortions are necessary? He has a production line going. Nothing is going to stop him from meeting his quota. 
Dr. Haskell concludes, again quoting: 
I would reach around trying to identify a lower extremity blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd get it right about 30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, `Well, gee, if I just put the ultrasound up there I could see it all and I wouldn't have to feel around for it.' I did that and, sure enough, I found it 99 percent of the time. Kind of serendipity. 
Kind of serendipity, Mr. President. 
Let me conclude. I believe we need to ask ourselves, what does our toleration of this procedure as a country, as a people, say about us? What kind of a people are we? What kind of a nation are we? I think you judge a country not just by what it is for. I think you also judge a country and a people by what we are against, and we judge a country and the people by what we tolerate. We tolerate a lot in this country, unfortunately. This is one thing that we should not have to tolerate. Where do we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, oh, I really don't like this, but it doesn't really matter to me so I will put up with it? It really doesn't affect me so I will put up with it. 
At what point do we say, unless we stop this from happening, we cannot justly call ourselves a civilized nation. I think it is very clear what justice demands. That is why I strongly support this ban. That is why I strongly support this bill to ban a truly barbaric procedure. 
I look forward to the opportunity as this debate continues to debate the various amendments and talking about this bill further. At this point I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, as has been pointed out by my colleague, Senator Wellstone, we had the opportunity to have hearings. We had the opportunity to thoroughly discuss this bill in not only the subcommittee but the committee. We listened to the criticism. We listened to the constructive comments that were made. I believe that the committee substitute that has been brought forward today addresses the legitimate concerns that were, in fact, raised by many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think this committee substitute is a fine work product. I am pleased to be able to discuss today some of the details. 
First, the collective bargaining process. 
When we drafted this bill, we wanted to give nonunion employees the ability to select flexible work options through individualized agreements with their employers--and to give union members the ability to select these options collectively. We wanted all unionized employees to use the collective bargaining process to select these options. During the markup, however, it was pointed out by Senator Kennedy that the bill actually limited the scope of coverage to unions who are recognized representatives of the employees under section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act [NLRA]. It's true that a great many unions are recognized under section 9(a)--but that provision does not, in fact, cover all union members. 
Under the committee substitute before us today, all employees who are members of unions will obtain their flexible work options through the collective bargaining process. The new language says, and I quote, `where a valid collective bargaining agreement exists between an employee and a labor organization that has been certified or recognized as the representative of the employees of employer under applicable law,' end of quote, the employee may obtain flexible work options through collective bargaining. 
I would like to point out, Mr. President, that notwithstanding this amendment, it has always been our intention to ensure that employees participate in S. 4's flexible options through agreements with their employer. Under no circumstances can an employer provide flexible options to an employee without either a written agreement from a non-union employee or collective bargaining agreement on behalf of a union employee. 
This measure, along with the bill's anti-coercion measures, was intended and designed to protect employees from being forced to participate in any of the options available under S. 4. Today we simply strengthen that policy. 
Senator Wellstone expressed concerns about the tenuous and short-lived nature of certain types of jobs in certain industries--questioning the ability of some workers to use and benefit from the flexible work options provided by S. 4. To address this concern, Senator Wellstone offered an amendment in markup which would have exempted part-time, seasonal, temporary, and garment-industry workers from the comptime provisions of the bill. 
Even though we found Senator Wellstone's concerns legitimate, the majority of the Committee disagreed with the proposed solution--the exemption of whole industries and classes of workers as well as giving the Secretary of Labor broad authority to determine the eligibility of other industries. 
We believe that workers should be protected from potentially abusive situations and that employees and employers that enter into any agreements have a stable relationship. However, we believe that it would be unfair to exempt whole industries and classes of workers--eliminating even the possibility of participating in a flexible work option, even if they have worked with the same employer for many years. 
The solution provided by the committee substitute states that before an employee is eligible for a flexible work option, or before an employer can offer a flexible work option, the employee must work for the employer for 12 months and 1,250 hours within 1 year--ensuring that a stable relationship exists between the employer and the employee. 
This solution may sound familiar. 
That's because it's the same basic requirement that exists under the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
This requirement effectively creates the exception Senator Wellstone suggested. Employees whose duration is too short-lived or tenuous to take advantage of S. 4's options are excluded. However, employees who are not so situated have an opportunity to develop a stable trusting relationship with their employer. 
In addition to satisfying Senator Wellstone's concerns, this change will allow long-term employees an opportunity to determine whether their employer is the type to respect the parameters of S. 4's flexible options and to determine if they want to participate or not. 
The purpose of this provision--as of the bill in its entirety--is to increase the freedom and flexibility of the workers. 
Mr. President, let me now turn to a third change we propose in the bill. We propose aligning the potential damages available for violations of S. 4's bi-weekly and flexible credit hour provisions. Some of our colleagues appear to believe that it's impossible to modify the Fair Labor Standards Act and still provide adequate protection to working men and women. 
If my friends believe this, they are wrong. The purpose of our bill is worker protection. There are severe penalties for employers who violate the workers' rights.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like at this point to turn to a topic that I began the discussion about this morning. That is the topic of Haiti. 
I said this morning, Mr. President, that the situation in Haiti is at another critical point. President Clinton will meet tomorrow with the President of Haiti, President Preval. In that discussion, what will take place, I think, is very, very important. 
I talked earlier today about my recent trip to Haiti, which was the fourth trip that I have taken to Haiti in the last 2 years. 
I talked about what I considered to be some of the imperatives, some of the things that absolutely have to take place if this fledgling democracy in Haiti is to survive. 
They have to have privatization. They have a schedule now for privatization. It is laid out with a timetable. Everyone who I talked to in Haiti, all Government officials, assured me that they would follow this timetable. But, as I expressed to them, no one, frankly, in this country is going to take that seriously until we actually see privatization take place. 
So it is important that, as we approach the date of the first privatization in July, it actually takes place. It is important because that democracy cannot survive just on elections. People have to have hope. People will only have hope if there is food to feed their children and if there is hope and opportunity for their future and the future of their children. That will only occur if some of the state-controlled industries that have really strangled the economy in Haiti for so long can be freed up, if they can be privatized, and if the economy can then begin to grow. 
Privatization is also important because by privatizing these industries, that will send a sign to the international community that the leadership in Haiti, from President Preval down, is in fact serious about doing the things to create a market-oriented economy that will in fact allow Haiti's economy to begin to grow. 
That is No. 1. 
No. 2 is Haiti must make progress in regard to these high-profile political murders. Based on my own investigation when I went to Haiti, I believe they have the capability of doing this. I believe that some of these cases can in fact be solved--the case for example, of Reverend Leroy. I believe that case can be solved. But it can only be solved if there is political leadership. It can only be solved if there is leadership from the top, from President Preval down saying it is a priority that we bring these people who committed this act to justice. 
I would like to turn now, Mr. President, to a third area; that is, the agricultural situation in Haiti. 
Seventy percent of Haiti's people live in rural areas. That is about 4 million out of a total population of 7 million. Eighty percent, it is estimated, of these rural Haitians farm on hillsides. But Haiti's agriculture clearly is troubled, to say the least. Haiti loses about 36 million metric tons of topsoil every year to erosion. That is enough to cover, they tell me, about 15,000 acres. About half a million people in the northwest part of Haiti are facing today a very serious drought. 
Mr. President, 30 years or so ago Haiti produced most of its own food. Today it imports two-thirds of its food. Haiti is having trouble feeding itself, and a number of causes have been assigned to that. I will mention just a few. 
The environment in Haiti is certainly fragile. Seventy percent is hillside land. Intensive cropping of 60 percent of the land-surface businesses have been decapitalized--less capital. Effective loss of capital has been magnified by the 1991-1994 embargo. Land plots are sometimes too small. There is a lack of land security under the land tenure system, and, as a result of the country's weak infrastructure, farmers are many times isolated from their markets. 
The USAID has instituted two programs to address these programs. The Agriculturally Sustainable Systems for Environmental Transformation, or ASSET, as it is called, is a $45 million program to improve hillside farming to help poor urban neighborhoods, improve water supply and waste management, and strengthen the Haitian Government's agricultural food security and environmental policy. 
Mr. President, the Program for the Recovery of the Economy in Transition, or PRET, is an $8 million program aimed at strengthening the Haitian private sector's role in national economic and business policymaking, providing innovative sources of credit, and helping key industries export the domestic market potential. 
Mr. President, under ASSET's coffee project, USAID has helped over 20,000 coffee farmers produce a premium coffee that is now marketed under the trademark of `Haitian Blue.' 
Since 1990, farmers have exported almost 200,000 pounds of this coffee. USAID has implemented a program of tree planting to reverse the impact of almost 30 million trees being cut each year. USAID plans to expand the ASSET program to assist the Haitian Government in establishing an agricultural data collection system, disseminate technology, and provide environmental management. 
There is currently not a single--this is amazing--not a single source of information on agricultural production in Haiti, no central collection of this data, even though agricultural production affects the lives of approximately 70 percent of the people who live in Haiti. 
The USAID Agribusiness Loan Guarantee Fund provides incentives for financial institutions to extend credit to midsized agribusinesses. By financing these businesses such lending institutions also help small farmers from whom the middlemen buy their goods. In the first 18 months of its operation, the fund had resulted in 1,300 permanent jobs and 10,000 seasonal jobs. 
While our program has shown some success, I think it is important to point out to my colleagues in the Senate that United States assistance in the agricultural area still only reaches approximately 1 out of 7 Haitian farmers. Clearly the goal of our policy is and always must be self-sufficiency for Haiti. 
The outlines of the bipartisan United States policy toward Haiti I think are clear. The United States should help Haiti become self-sufficient in food. We should help them build a system of law and order. After all, United States law enforcement is the best in the world and the Haitians can benefit greatly from our expertise. We should help the Haitians attract the kind of private investment that is the cornerstone of long-term economic growth. 
I cannot stress enough that our good intentions cannot succeed, will not succeed in and of themselves. No matter how much we want to help Haiti, there is a limit to what we can do. There is a limit to what we will do. Ultimately, the democracy that is slowly growing in Haiti can only be preserved by Haitians themselves. Haiti has to have the will, Haiti has to have the perseverance to carry through with the real reforms that we have talked about today. And that is what I believe President Clinton must underscore in the conversation that he will have tomorrow with Haitian President Preval. Our message to President Preval and to the Haitian people must be very simply this: We can help you, we will help you, but the destiny of your country really lies in your own hands.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this afternoon I honor the memory of a truly great figure in the history of Ohio, Charles D. `Chuck' Shipley, who died on April 5 of this year at the young age of 54. 
Chuck Shipley leaves Ohio a better place than he found it. Chuck dedicated his whole life to public service, to improving the lives of his fellow Ohioans. He first spent 16 years in the Ohio State Highway Patrol. Chuck was later director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety and served under Gov. George Voinovich in that position from 1991 to 1997. He served as the director of the department of public safety for the entire 4 years that I served as Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio. While he served in that capacity, he was in charge of several agencies including the highway patrol, and he was in charge in general of highway safety for the 11 million people who live in our great State. 
Chuck and I both had experiences in law enforcement that dramatically shaped our attitudes toward highway safety. I had been a local county prosecutor and in that capacity I dealt with the shattered lives of families who had lost loved ones who had been killed in auto fatalities, sometimes by drunk drivers. 
When I was in the State senate, a little 7-year-old boy in my home county, a little boy by the name of Justin Beason was struck and killed by a driver who had been driving and drinking. Little Justin was killed as he was getting off his school bus. In response to this tragedy, with the help of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, we succeeded in 1983 in writing a tough new drunk driving law in the State of Ohio. 
While I was working on safety issues as a prosecutor and as 
a State senator, Chuck Shipley was on the front lines as a highway patrolman. He saw much more often than I ever did the devastation that is brought by highway fatalities. It was Chuck who was often the one to notify the parents of a child who had been killed in a highway accident. 
Chuck told me about that experience, and as he told me about it I could see it had left an unbelievable impression on him. He told me it was the toughest thing he ever had to do in his life, and tragically he had to do that more than once. That kind of experience, as Chuck told me, leaves a deep impression on a person. It certainly left an impact on Chuck. 
Chuck Shipley became a committed, dedicated fighter in the cause of highway safety. When I was Lieutenant Governor and he was director of the public safety department, I was, frankly, very grateful time and time again for the passion that Chuck brought to his work. It was contagious. His energy and enthusiasm helped him change attitudes. It helped him win converts who had worked to make Ohio safer. 
Chuck and I spent a great deal of time together traveling the State, many times on holidays because that is when you always try to put the emphasis on highway safety--Memorial Day, Labor Day, or some other holiday. We spent a lot of time talking and a lot of time traveling the State to promote antidrunk-driver campaigns or designated-driver campaigns and just overall highway safety. Chuck helped us implement, among other things, administrative license suspensions, to help crack down on drunk drivers, and he took many, many other actions in his official capacity to save lives in Ohio. He was a worker, a hard worker in a good cause, and Chuck got results. I can truly say something about Chuck Shipley that any of us would be incredibly proud to have said about ourselves: There are people alive today who would not be alive but for Chuck Shipley. 
I join all Ohioans in being grateful for the life he dedicated to our State but even more I am grateful for our friendship. He was a wonderful human being, a person who would not get upset even in the most difficult circumstance. I do not ever recall, all the hours I spent with Chuck, him ever getting upset. He always had a smile. He was always calm. He always went about his business. I am very proud to have known Chuck Shipley, and I want to express my condolences to Chuck's family, express to all of them my greatest sympathy for the loss of Chuck, to his wife Jana, their children David and Carli, and their family. Their loss is great, and so is Ohio's.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I turn at this point to a matter that was brought up a little while ago by my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd. He spoke very eloquently about the piece of legislation that he and I are introducing, a piece of legislation that we believe will dramatically improve health care available to America's children. 
We as a nation need to do a better job making sure our children get the pharmaceuticals that are appropriate for them. This is a matter I have been concerned about for some time, and it is a matter that as the father of eight children is near and dear to my heart. 
We are introducing the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. This legislation will provide an incentive in the form of 6 months of market exclusivity to encourage pharmaceutical companies to conduct the necessary clinical trials for FDA approval of their products for children. These studies would take away the guesswork that too many physicians and parents go through in trying to treat their sick children. These studies would do away with this guesswork by giving an incentive to the drug companies, by giving them a 6-months extension on their patent exclusivity so as to give them the incentive to do the trials and do the studies that would give parents and give physicians better information. 
This is not a new product. Let me give several examples to show my colleagues what the problem is. The first example goes back to 1960. There was a drug called chloramphenicol that was approved for use in adults to control bacterial infections. This drug was widely used with adults and it was successful, but when it was used on children the results were devastating. It shut down their liver. Many children got sick and, tragically, a number of them died. This came to be known as the gray baby syndrome. 
Let me give another example of the problem that our bill attempts to address. There was a little 4-year old leukemia patient named Stewart Baxter who had to scream through a spinal tap, had to go through immense pain because the doctors were advised they could not give him an anesthetic. The anesthetic was thought to be harmful to young patients. However, later they found that was not true. A few weeks later he was allowed to undergo the same procedure--this time, however, under the anesthetic. Better information earlier would have prevented that child's agony and would have made it possible for the parents not to have had to undergo that trauma as well in watching their child go through that pain. 
Let me give you another example. Dr. Ralph Kaufman, representing the American Academy of Pediatrics, testified in the House of Representatives about a 1-month-old infant that he treated. He was treating it for a life-threatening infection, the kind of infection that was resistant to all available antibiotics except one. That one antibiotic was not labeled for children. They had not done the testing. And it certainly was not labeled for a 1-month-old infant. But Dr. Kaufman took the chance, combining his knowledge with the physiology of the 1-month-old child with how the instructions said the antibiotic should be used for adults. In this case Dr. Kaufman said the gamble paid off. 
But sometimes the outcome is not so favorable. Physicians have to gamble, due to a lack of information. Sometimes physicians do not take the chance and they lose the availability of a very useful drug. Other times they do take the chance and maybe the results are not what they had expected. By passing this bill, we will change that. As a result, children can be treated for diseases with greater safety and with greater confidence. 
The problem this bill addresses is a very serious one. About 80 percent of the drugs on the market today have not been approved by the FDA for use in at least one pediatric age group--80 percent. As a consequence, the drugs do not carry labeling information explaining how they should be taken by children. This is because clinical trials are expensive. It is a dollars-and-cents issue, and often there is little market incentive for pharmaceutical companies to conduct these tests. The result is that drugs are usually prescribed for children on the basis of adult trials and the pediatrician's own experience. Children are not just small adults, and therefore this is a somewhat risky business. Physicians deserve better information and children deserve, as well as their parents, better information. 
I had experience in my own family. Senator Dodd alluded to this a moment ago. He just heard me talk about it. When you have children, you have a lot of medical experiences. But a number of years ago, my daughter Becky, who was very young, had developed asthma. As is the experience, sadly, of many parents who have children with asthma, we ended up spending many evenings and sometimes the middle of the night in emergency rooms when Becky would have an attack. 
Finally, the physician who was treating Becky said: Look, we need to do something about this. I don't think we should allow this to continue. There is something that is on the market today. We have information about its use by adults. I think we should go ahead and try it and I think we should see if it will work with Becky. 
He prescribed to her an inhaler that looks similar to the one that I am carrying right now, and gave it to Becky. She was able to use that. I was able to help her, and it lessened the trips to the emergency room for asthma attacks. She was able to get through childhood without anymore serious, horrible trauma, going to the emergency rooms because of asthma attacks. 
So I think this is an experience that many people have had. It is important, I think, to make the change in the law to give the drug companies the incentive so they can go out and do these tests. There are many drugs that are in this category, including those used to treat AIDS, as well as, as I mentioned, those to ease asthma attacks, drugs to alleviate pain, drugs even to treat other illnesses. Too often, physicians and parents are forced to guess about dosages or possible side effects. They should not have to play this kind of Russian roulette with their sick children. 
This problem has been around for a long time. In the last session of Congress this bill was passed by the Labor Committee, but unfortunately it did not reach the floor. 
We have had extensive discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, pediatric community, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of generic drugs. I am confident that we have come up with a practical way to remedy this problem. This bill is supported by health providers, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. 
I intend and hope to work with the FDA to solve this problem and find the best approaches, both legislatively as well as administratively. I look forward to continuing our dialog with the FDA. But I am not going to and Senator Dodd is not going to wait around for a proposal that they might make. This is our proposal. It is a legislative proposal. I believe it will do the job. I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate. 
Mr. President, we all want to see better labeling for drugs used to treat our sick children. Today, I believe, with this bill, we are taking the first step to resolve a very serious national health problem. Senator Dodd and I are serious about seeing this legislation pass both Houses of Congress this session. This project is a very high priority and we will do all we can to make it happen. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the legislation and encourage their help and assistance when the bill reaches the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise this morning to note the passing of a friend and former colleague. Russell A. Bradley died yesterday morning. It was to me rather ironic that as I heard the news, I was preparing to go to a Judiciary Committee hearing to talk about the crime problem in this country because Sheriff Bradley, Russell Bradley, was my home county sheriff for 30 years. Russell Bradley was a dedicated public servant, a great politician, and was my friend. Russell Bradley served as Greene County Sheriff from 1957 to 1987. For 30 years, Russ Bradley was the sheriff. Elected eight times, he built the Greene County sheriff's office into the professional organization that it is today and that today we, frankly, take for granted. It was not so when he became sheriff in January 1957. 
I first met Russ Bradley when I was a young boy growing up in the village of Yellow Springs. Russ Bradley at that time was the chief of police. Russ Bradley was a person whom you would go to if you had a problem in the community. I remember talking with him, being with him, fishing with him when I was a very, very young boy. In 1956, when I was 9, Russ Bradley was elected county sheriff. He ran in the Republican primary and beat the incumbent, a shock to everyone across the county. Frankly, it was a shock to most of us who were his friends because we did not think he could win. That was the first of eight victories he won running for the office of sheriff in Greene County. 
He remained sheriff long enough so that a 9-year-old boy who knew him when he was first elected had an opportunity to grow up, go away to college, go to law school, come back home and become assistant county prosecutor and then have the opportunity to work on a professional basis with Sheriff Bradley. I had a chance for a little over 2 years to serve as assistant county prosecutor, then to serve as the elected county prosecutor for 4 more years. I had the opportunity then to see this man whom I had known as a young boy, to see him up close and personal and work with him literally on a daily basis as we dealt with crime problems in our county. 
Russ Bradley really taught a whole generation, really two generations of Greene County and Ohio public servants and politicians how to win elections. He was the person we watched, we copied, we emulated, we stole ideas from. He was literally the master and we were the students. He taught us how to campaign door to door and the significance of that, the tenacity to continue to do that night after night. He taught us how to work the county fair. He even taught us things such as how to go out and put your signs along the road to make sure the signs were positioned in exactly the right position so that the headlights of the car would strike that sign just as you came around the corner. He had it all, he did it all, and he taught us very well. 
The most important thing that he taught politicians and people in public office in our area was how to be a public servant. He taught us the essential lesson of politics, that public service is good politics and good politics is public service, and that the way to ensure being elected, the way to ensure being successful is always remember where you came from and always remember who you serve. 
Russ Bradley was a person who was dedicated to service. He delivered service every single day. I remember talking to him when I was county prosecutor. He would say: Mike, you are worried about this and you are worried about that. The only thing you really have to worry about is giving people service. Give them what they are paying you to do. When anybody comes in here with a problem, you try to help them solve that problem. And even if you cannot solve it, if you try to help them solve the problem, that is what you should be doing. 
That is a lesson I certainly have never forgotten. 
Russ Bradley was a great investigator. I have been involved and seen an awful lot of people in law enforcement over my now quarter-of-a-century career. I have never seen anyone as good as 
Russ Bradley at heading up an investigation. The tougher the case, the better he was. 
I remember many days going into his office as he assembled his team at 8 o'clock in the morning, his detectives and his road men. You have to keep in mind this was not a huge department. Our county is only 130,000, 135,000. But we would have, unfortunately, our share of murders, our share of very difficult cases. I remember him bringing people together every day, and he orchestrated how his men and women were to go out that day and continue to follow every lead they could come up with. 
Russ Bradley knew what all people in law enforcement know. This is not a glamorous job. It is a tough job. It is hard work. It is grunt work, really, and following leads and being lucky if 1 out of 100 turns into anything. And if you are lucky, that 1 out of 100 turns into something else and you can keep trying to unravel the crime and try to put the puzzle together to solve the crime. 
He was an expert at what, for want of a better word, I would call the drive-by shooting, the roadside murder where, when the police get there, the sheriff gets there, the only thing they can find is the body. There is just no other evidence at all. I have seen him take cases like that and reconstruct those cases and slowly build them week after week after week and ultimately lead to a conviction of the person who committed the murder. 
Russ Bradley was the best I have known at getting a confession, and he managed to operate in the pre-Miranda days and in the post-Miranda days, which is quite an accomplishment. As Russ said, if anyone could get a confession, I could. If I couldn't get them, nobody could. He would laugh with people. He would cry with them. He would pray with them, whatever it took, but he would get that person's confidence and he would ultimately get that person to tell him what the facts were. He was a master at that. 
Sheriff Bradley was also a great judge of people. 
When I would go into a case, the first thing, of course, you do in a case, as a prosecutor, you begin the process of selecting the jury. That is a judgment call of who you want to serve on that jury. I always wanted Russ Bradley right by my side to eyeball that jury and tell me who he thought would be a good juror, who he thought might not be such a good juror. He was able to do this, not only because he knew about everybody in the county or knew their sister or brother or cousin or somebody, but also because he was a consummate judge of human nature. He knew people very well and could size a person up, his or her character, what kind of people they were--he could do that probably better than just about anybody that I know or ever met. 
This is a time to recall Sheriff Bradley, though it is not a time to be sad. I do not think anyone who knew Russ Bradley could think of Russ Bradley without smiling. He was someone who was a great practical jokester, someone who loved to laugh, someone who loved to hunt, someone who loved to fish, someone who loved to have a good time. 
He was a tremendous coon hunter. I remember many mornings coming in and, as we were about to start a trial at 9 o'clock, in Judge Aultman's court or Judge Weber's court, the sheriff would come rolling in. I would meet him at the courtroom. I would look over and say, `Russ, you been out coon hunting?' 
He would say, `Oh, no, just a little bit last night.' 
Then it would come out from one of his deputies he had been up to 4 a.m., gone home, taken a shower, a little catnap, and was able to come into court raring to go. He was able to do that night after night. 
Russ Bradley was once interviewed about his prowess as a coon hunter. He said: `A coon hunter has got to be tough. There's a lot of them who can walk faster than I can, but not many who can walk longer than I can.' 
Russ Bradley, a great coon hunter, a great fisherman, someone who liked to have a good time as well as someone who was a great politician and a great public servant. I pause at this point to remember my friend, Russ Bradley. There will never be another like him. He is someone who taught me a great deal over the years. He is someone whom we should honor. It was an honor for me to actually serve with him on a daily basis for 4 years when I was county prosecutor, but it was also, frankly, a lot of fun to serve with him as well. For the rest of my life I will have great memories of him, what kind of person he was and the fun that we had with him, all the time he continued to do an excellent job as our county sheriff.

Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me at this point turn to another topic, which I believe is very timely. It has to do with a meeting that President Clinton is having tomorrow. 
Madam President, President Clinton will be meeting tomorrow with President Preval of Haiti. This is a very important meeting. It is important because Haiti is at a crossroads and the United States needs to provide all the leadership it can to help Haiti choose the right path. In view of this important meeting, I think it is important to review Haiti's situation. I have visited the country of Haiti four times in the last 2 years, most recently just this past month. I have done so to examine the conditions there and to find out about the progress being made by U.S. policies in regard to that country. 
Let me begin, if I could, by talking about the economy. The economy is today, as it has been for many years, to put it bluntly, in a shambles. Unemployment--no one knows how high the unemployment is, but it is said to be running at about a 65 percent rate. Privatization has yet to occur, but it is essential. It must occur if Haiti is to recover. While it has not occurred yet, the good news is the Haitian Government has announced a calendar for privatization, something we had not seen before the last several months. There is a calendar, there is a schedule. Everyone from President Preval, through the president of Haiti's central bank, to members of the legislature, all personally assured me that this privatization calendar will be maintained, it will be met. Privatization will, in fact, occur, they tell me, and guaranteed to me, while I was there, that this would happen. 
Let me say, for the good of the people of that country, this privatization simply must begin to take place. The people of Haiti have to have jobs. They need hope. They are not going to have jobs, they are not going to have hope unless privatization begins, because it is only with privatization that they will be able to get the economy moving again. It is only by privatization that the climate will be created and the right signals will be sent to the world so the world community will begin to invest in Haiti. Promises will not create jobs. The people of Haiti have been fed on promises for two centuries. Only action will create jobs and only action will start to break this cycle of despair. 
This privatization is important for basic economic reasons, but it is also essential for the preservation of democracy, a goal for which this country risked American lives and has already spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. For democracy to survive in Haiti, people need to see real improvement in the lives of their families, of their children, of their loved ones. Real improvement in their lives will only come with privatization. If democracy is to survive, it is not enough to have elections. People have to have something to eat as well. Elections are just not enough and people know that. The turnout in the recent legislative elections in Haiti was less than 10 percent. I believe we have to view that as a vote of no confidence in the progress being made by the Haitian Government. Clearly Haiti needs to turn it around. They need, if I can use the term--they need some victories. All politicians need victories. The Government of Haiti has to have some victories. They need to take the kind of action that will inspire confidence in their common future, the kind of confidence that is a prerequisite for economic success. The way to do this is to send the right message to the rest of the world. That message is that Haiti is serious about participating in the global economy. Only by doing this, by doing what is necessary to participate in the rising tide of international growth, can Haiti hope to spark a real economic upturn. 
The first privatization is scheduled for this July. They first start with cement factories and the flour mills. The schedule further calls for, in November, the Haitian Popular Bank to privatize; in December, the National Port Authority; in January, the airport and the National Bank of Credit; finally, in February, 
the telephones and in March the electric company. When I was in Haiti last month I stressed to my hosts that they must act on this plan. Frankly, no one in Congress was going to believe what they said or be convinced that they were serious until, actually, some action took place. 
I have also spoken to President Clinton about this matter, and I have asked the President, when he meets with President Preval tomorrow, to stress the importance of this privatization, to make sure the President of Haiti understands our very legitimate concern that this privatization really take place. 
Madam President, another key area in which Haiti needs to follow through is the investigation of the political murders. Palace security forces are alleged to have killed two prominent opposition politicians, Mr. Fleurival and Reverend Leroy. In response to these murders, the Government of Haiti suspended the chief of palace security, they suspended his deputy and seven Presidential Security Unit guards who were allegedly at the scene. 
The Haitian Government needs to send the strongest possible message that this kind of subversion of democracy, murder of political opponents, will simply not be tolerated. There is a reasonable chance the Leroy case will be solved, but only if there is adequate leadership from the top of the Haitian political system. In my view, this is a test case of the rule of law, one that President Clinton must take up with President Preval at their meeting tomorrow. 
In other areas, Haiti is making real and measurable progress. One such area is the civilian police. In my visit to Haiti, I met again with United States police officers who are helping retrain the Haitian police. These are Haitian-born, Creole-speaking United States citizens on leave from their jobs as city police officers in this country. They come from cities such as Boston--I see Senator Kennedy on the floor. I met with a number of those police officers from Boston. They come from New York. They come from Miami. They are veterans, and they are mentoring these inexperienced, young Haitian police recruits. 
Madam President, nobody expected miracles from this training program, but they are making slow but solid progress. This is a program that works. I am glad the State Department has responded positively to my urging that the number of United States advisers be doubled. That has taken place, and we are now up to the number of 49. Frankly, I believe it is in our national interest to again significantly increase the number of these dedicated United States police officers who are serving in Haiti. I met with these advisers during my recent visit. I was gratified by what I saw. They are doing an excellent job and they need our continuing support. These advisers, I believe, are America's signal to the Haitian people that we will help them in the difficult process of building the rule of law in their country. 
I, later today, will continue to discuss the situation in Haiti. At that time I intend to talk about the agricultural situation and several other suggestions that I have that I believe will help the situation there. 
I believe, in conclusion for now, the meeting the President of the United States is having tomorrow with President Preval is a crucial meeting. I believe Haiti is at a crossroads. I believe it is important for our country to continue to work internally in this country to develop a bipartisan foreign policy in regard to Haiti. But, ultimately, it is abundantly clear that, no matter what we do, the important players are really the Haitian politicians, Haitian Government officials, and the Haitian people. Our message to President Preval and to the Haitian people must simply be this: We can and we will help you, but the destiny of your country really lies in your own hands. 
Madam President, I will turn to this later in the day. I also will have the opportunity, later, to discuss the comptime and flextime bill. 
I do see my colleague from Massachusetts on the floor, so at this time I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is always a real treat to be on the Senate floor when my friend and colleague and neighbor from West Virginia speaks. That was a very moving and eloquent statement about Mother's Day, but, of course, also about his own natural mother and also about the mother who raised him.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have been this morning, now this afternoon, talking about the issue of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I would like to spend just a few more minutes talking about this issue. 
We are proud, once again, to bring before the Senate this piece of legislation that we believe will help bring the American workplace into the 21st century. The Family Friendly Workplace Act will make our Nation's working environments more flexible, more productive and more hospitable to the changing needs of the American family. 
Last week, in my opening comments about this bill, I described what we discovered in the hearings, and I use the term `discover' rather loosely because, really, I think we all knew what we saw in those hearings, what we heard in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The testimony was very clear that the American workplace today is a dramatically different place than it was when the underlying bill was enacted 60 years ago. 
The facts are that the stereotypical roles of management and labor and of male and female workers really no longer apply. The testimony in front of our committee was that individual workers are too often faced with a brutal squeeze today, a squeeze between their duties at work, their obligations, and what they want to do with their families. 
This worker squeeze is so great that I believe it calls for immediate action. And this bill is that action. 
The static and outdated Fair Labor Standards Act that was enacted over 60 years ago must be modified, must be changed. It must be changed to allow American workers today the flexibility that they demand, the flexibility that they want. 
The facts are fairly clear. When the underlying legislation, the underlying bill was enacted in 1938, less than 16 percent of married women worked outside the home. Today, more than 60 percent of married women work outside the home. And 75 percent of mothers with school-aged children today work outside the home. And according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor, Women's Bureau, the top concern--top concern--of working women is flexible scheduling in the workplace, flexible scheduling which will allow them to balance their responsibilities at work with the needs of their children and the needs of their families. 
The chart that is behind me depicts the pattern of change the American workplace has undergone over the last 25 years. `The Changing Labor Force Trends of Families, 1940-1995.' 
Look at the complete contrast between the family structure today and the family structure as it existed in 1940--1940--only 2 years after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
In 1940, Mr. President, 67 percent of all families had a working husband and a wife who stayed at home, what we considered in those days, the typical family. At the same time, only 9 percent of families had two working spouses. And in 1940 only 5 percent of the families were actually headed by women. 
Clearly, this is no longer the case. 
By 1995, only 17 percent of families had a working husband and a wife who stayed at home. And 43 percent of American families had two working spouses. And 12 percent were actually families headed by women. 
Society, Mr. President, has changed. But the workplace, at least the laws governing the workplace, has not kept pace. I believe that Americans are crying out for relief. They are demanding of this Congress that we change the law, that we change the law to reflect the way people really live today. 
Take for example, the Morris family. Clayton Morris--father, husband--is a public employee. As a public employee he has the option of choosing compensatory time over traditional monetary overtime pay. He gets a choice which way he wants it. He is free to spend important extra time with his 2 1/2 -year-old son Domenic, while his wife Ann, a sales assistant for a Cleveland area business form company, cannot. She is prohibited by law from having that option. 
This is what Ann has said: 
He [referring to her husband Clayton] has the ability if he works overtime to store [up] those hours . . . [he] can use the stored comp time to be at home where he is needed. [However, when] I need to be able to leave work, I end up having to take sick time or vacation time to do that. [That's what I have to do.] It would be really nice if I had a flexible schedule [also]. 
Mr. President, seemingly countless studies and surveys have pointed out time and time again that Americans overwhelmingly need, desire, want, and support a more flexible workplace schedule and the changes the Family Friendly Workplace Act would bring about. 
Let me take the opportunity now to highlight what this bill will do, S. 4, and explain briefly the different provisions of the bill. 
The first option of the bill we refer to as comptime. This allows workers to voluntarily--voluntarily--choose to take their overtime pay as time off instead of taking their overtime pay in money. They get the time off as opposed to taking the money. But it is the worker's choice. 
Under this bill, compensation in the form of compensatory time off is paid out at the same rate as an employee's normal rate of overtime pay. That is, one-half hour of compensatory time off for every hour of overtime worked. 
Mr. President, under this option employers and employees must agree to provide and receive, respectively, compensatory time in lieu of monetary overtime pay. It is an agreement, a voluntary agreement entered into by both the employer and the employee, an agreement that does not take place under this bill or situation that does not take place unless both sides voluntarily say, `That's what I want to do.' 
Union employees do this through the collective bargaining process. Nonunion employees must do so by agreement prior to the performance of the overtime worked. The employee must enter this agreement--this is from the bill--`knowingly and voluntarily.' A nonunion employee's decision to participate in a compensatory time off program must be in writing or must be otherwise verifiable and kept by the employer, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act's recordkeeping provision. 
An employer may withdraw from his decision to provide a compensatory time off program by providing 30-day written notice to the participating employees. On the other hand, nonunion 
employees may withdraw by providing written notice to their employer. The terms of a union employee's withdrawal would be reflected in the collective bargaining agreement. 
Mr. President, upon an employer's discontinuance of this compensatory time off policy, or on the occasion of an employee's withdrawal, the resignation or termination, an employee is then entitled to the cash equivalent of any unused comptime hours. An employee under this bill may accrue up to 240 hours of compensatory time during a 12-month period. If after the 12-month period an employee has not used his accrued time, the employer has 31 days, under the bill, to remit the cash equivalent of those hours. 
An employee must be allowed to use any accrued comptime within a reasonable period, a reasonable period of time after the request is made provided that it does not duly disrupt the workplace. 
Under a compensatory time-off program, an employee enjoys the preexisting protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These are not impacted. The underlying bill is still there. And the underlying protections are still there. 
These protections include prohibitions against violation of section 7, the FLSA discrimination provision, as well as S. 4's anticoercion provision. No employee may be coerced, intimidated, or threatened to accept or deny participation in any of the bill's flexible workplace options. 
To be absolutely perfectly clear, let me spell out what the penalties under this bill will be. 
First, S. 4, as an amendment to section 7(r), will enjoy the already established penalties provided in the Fair Labor Standards Act. This will obviously include the new amending provision in S. 4. 
The penalties are: 
First, the availability of criminal penalties in the event of a willful violation; 
Next, civil penalties in the event of repeated or willful violations; 
They will include the remittance of unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages; 
It will also include appropriate legal or equitable relief and liquidating damages for any retaliation by the employer against an employee who complains of or testifies about an employer's conduct, as well as attorney fees and costs to the employee who sues for retaliation. 
Additionally, the Secretary of Labor may take action to acquire the employee's unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages. 
As stated, in addition to the penalties already provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act for a violation of section 7(r), S. 4 provides additional penalties for direct and indirect intimidation, threats, and coercion. Furthermore, S. 4 dictates penalties for any violation of this anticoercion language. 
Further, this bill provides for unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages or injunctive relief should the Secretary be required to bring a cause of action against the employer. 
Mr. President, behind me is a picture, headlined `Akron Beacon Journal,' and `A Juggling Act.' It is a picture of a real family, the Morris family of Ohio, and a description that I think, in the story, tells the importance of this bill. I think this family demonstrates why we need to have this bill. Here is what it says:  
Ann Morris of Akron has to use vacation or sick days when two-year-old Domenic is sick, while her husband Clayton has the option of using comp time. 
That is what this bill is about, Mr. President. This bill is about some equity and equality in the workplace. Does it make any sense to have a law today, as we do, that says to an hourly worker, who doesn't work for the Government, the Federal Government is going to prohibit you and your employer from entering into agreements that are flexible and allow you to spend more time with your family? That is what current law says today. 
Current law discriminates against the person who works by the hour, and it says that in a business or in a shop, if there is a worker who works by the hour and right next to him or her is a worker who is paid salary, the person who is paid salary may have comp time or flextime, but the person who works by the hour is denied that. Does that make any sense? 
In the case of this family, the discrimination exists right in that family. The husband has these benefits, has these 
rights; yet, the Federal law says that the wife, the mother, can't have them. What this bill does is change that and eliminates that discrimination. It says to all American workers that whether you work for the Federal Government or don't, whether you work by the hour or are salaried, as long as the employer and employee both agree, voluntarily, you can do many different things in regard to flextime and comptime and making your life easier, making it better, accommodating the workplace rules to the way people have to live today. 
Mr. President, I began a few minutes ago, a discussion of the four principal parts of this bill. I talked about the comptime section. I now want to move to the second section of biweekly work schedules. 
Mr. President, let me turn to the biweekly work schedules. The second option this bill provides is the biweekly work schedules. Under this option, an employee may choose to work 80 hours over 2 weeks, in any combination that that employee works out with the employer. For example, a worker may choose to work 9 hour days but, every other Friday, get the whole Friday off. Maybe that worker wants to spend time with his or her children. Maybe they want to go hunting or fishing, or maybe they don't want to do anything. They have the right to make that agreement and have that long weekend. Biweekly work schedule programs are simply another way to ensure workplace flexibility. Biweekly work schedules enable employees to craft schedules that coordinate their work obligations to go along with their personal obligations. 
Mr. President, here is how it would work in practice. If an employer chooses to offer a biweekly schedule option, and if the employee elects to participate--it is purely voluntary--prior to each 2-week work period, the employer and employee will arrange a schedule for the 2-week period. Regardless of how the hours are divided, the employee will be paid overtime for working over 80 hours during the 2-week period. Again, the decision is to be made together, mutually, voluntarily. 
Additionally, employees would be entitled to overtime for all hours worked that are outside that predetermined biweekly work schedule. For example, if an employee agrees to work 45 hours during the first week, 35 hours during the second week, any hours worked above 45 in the first week would, of course, be overtime, and any hours worked over 35 during the second week would also be overtime, because that is what they had agreed on. Simply, Mr. President, if an employee is required to work any additional hours above the agreed-to schedule, he gets overtime. 
Let me turn to the third provision of this bill, flexible credit hours. The third option that this bill provides that is not provided under current law, Mr. President, is flexible credit hours. Under this option, an employee may choose to work additional hours. That is more than 40 hours, 
more than 40 hours a workweek in order to use these extra hours to shorten another week at a later date. 
Biweekly schedules and flexible credit hours provide flexibility to employees who may not traditionally work a great deal of overtime. The flexible credit hour program would give more employees a greater ability to balance work with family. A flexible credit hour program would allow an employee to bank--`to bank'--up to 50 hours over his or her regularly scheduled hours. The employee under this bill may use those banked hours at any future date to reduce the workday or a workweek. 
Mr. President, when used, the flexible credit hours represent time off from work at the employee's regular rate of pay. An employee must be allowed to use accrued credit hours within a reasonable period of time following his or her request, so long as doing so will not unduly disrupt the workplace. 
As is true with comptime and biweekly programs, an employer has the initial decision of whether to offer the flexible credit hour program at all. Then participation in a flexible credit hour program is, of course, voluntary on the employer's part and on the employee's part. An interested employee must elect to participate. If he or she does not, then the status quo under current law would be in effect. 
Mr. President, union employees can do this in accordance with their collective bargaining agreements. Nonunion employees must submit a written or otherwise verifiable statement acknowledging his or her participation in the program. The anticoercion remedy sanctions provision which we talked about before are applicable to the comptime and biweekly schedules and are also applicable to this flexible credit program as well. 
Mr. President, let me turn now to the fourth major provision of the bill clarifying Federal law. 
I have talked about the three chief options provided by the bill. 
Let me also point out in the interest of completeness that S. 4 also makes important clarifications in the regulations delineating the salary basis test. The bill makes it clear that the fact that a particular employee is subject to a deduction in pay for absence of less than a full workday or less than a full workweek may not be considered in determining whether that employee enjoys exempt status. Only actual reductions in pay may be considered. 
Mr. President, for more than five decades the `subject to' language generated little or no controversy. However, in recent years courts have begun to reinterpret the salary basis test. Seizing on the phrase `subject to' in the regulations, large groups of employees have won multimillion-dollar judgments. These awards have been given in spite of the fact that many of the plaintiff employees have never actually experienced a pay reduction of any kind and have never expected to receive overtime pay in addition to their executive, administrative, or professional salaries. 
Mr. President, included in this bill--in part to stop the large number of cases that are being brought against State and local governments--it is true that the Department of Labor attempted to solve this problem through regulations as they applied to State and local employees in 1992. This legislation in no way preempts those regulations. 
The legislation also clarifies that employers may give bonuses and may give overtime payments to salaried employees without destroying their exemption from FLSA. 
In summary, Mr. President, let me talk again briefly about the four provisions. 
Comptime, first of all, allows workers to voluntarily choose to take their overtime pay as time off instead of as overtime pay. 
Biweekly schedules, the second provision, allows workers to choose to work their 80 hours for 2 weeks in any combination that they so elect and if they agree with their employer. 
Flexible credit hours, the third provision, allows workers to choose to work additional hours and to bank these hours for use as time off at some point in the future. 
All of these flexible workplace options are designed to expand the choices available to working families. They are, Mr. President, completely voluntary. No employee can be forced to participate in a flexible workplace option. No employer can be forced to offer one. If any employer directly or indirectly coerces employees to participate in a particular option, the employer can be punished under the Fair Labor Standards Act, be forced to pay back wages, and maybe even face imprisonment. 
Mr. President, that is what the bill would accomplish. 
This bill would accomplish a real change for the betterment of the lives of working families, and the American people absolutely agree with this. A national poll conducted in September 1995 shows that the American work force endorses flexible work options. When asked, Mr. President, about a proposal to allow hourly employees the choice of time and a half in wages or time off with pay, 75 percent of the workers agree with that proposal; 65 percent said they favored more flexible work schedules. 
Mr. President, according to a poll recently taken, 88 
percent of all workers want more flexibility, either through scheduling flexibility or choice of compensatory time in lieu of traditional overtime pay. In that same poll, 75 percent of the workers favored changes in the law that would permit hourly workers such a choice. The evidence is overwhelming about what the American workers want. 
I think these poll results square with what most of us know, frankly, intuitively. As both the economy and the American family and life grow more and more complex, the men and women in America's work force want greater flexibility to be able to cope with all of the changes that we have in life today. I think that this consensus presents us, this Senate, with a remarkable opportunity. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues as we work on what should be a bipartisan approach to this bill. 
Mr. President, this bill is about equity. It is about equality. It is about families such as this that are pictured behind us. Families want options. They want flexibility. This is what this bill gives them.

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator Warner. First let me say that I believe that the appropriators have done an excellent job of providing much-needed relief for those States who have been devestated by floods and bad weather, including Ohio. I plan to support this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. However, I do have concerns about the way the supplemental Federal aid highway funds are appropriated. 
I appreciate the fact that the Appropriations Committee has provided highway obligational authority to States that had their fiscal year 1996 or 1997 limitations reduced as a result of an error by the Treasury Department in recording highway trust fund receipts in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. Ohio was affected by this, and I appreciate the fact that Ohio will be made whole by this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I believe that the Committee has done the fair thing in this regard. 
I also am not opposed to the $475 million in additional authority that the committee has added in emergency transportation funds for this year. In Ohio, transportation funding seems to be an emergency need every single year. My concern is the fact that the Appropriations Committee has rewritten funding formulas contained in ISTEA in distributing this authority. 
When ISTEA was debated and passed, it was decided that in fiscal year 1997, States would receive a 90-percent return on the amount of Federal gas taxes paid by the State in the prior year. At the time, everyone knew that this would require so-called `donee' states to receive less Federal aid highway authority in fiscal year 1997 than they received in fiscal year 1996. ISTEA was approved this way for a reason. The appropriations process is not the time to change laws that don't suit our particular needs. If it were, donor States would have attempted to do this for the past 5 years. 
This year, Congress will once again debate Federal highway funding. The old formulas, hopefully, will be revised to treat States more fairly. As we debate that reauthorization bill in the Senate, we will all have a chance to make changes to current law that we feel are unfair. We should let that debate take its course. For the time being, the Senate should not circumvent current law. 
The Warner amendment provides the best way to distribute the additional authority included in this emergency supplemental--by formulas included under current law. It allows all States, not just donee States, to receive their proper share of the additional authority. It is the right thing to do, and that is why I support this amendment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 1997 supplemental appropriations bill. This bill does many good things, including the provision of an adequate level of support to our troops as they disengage from Bosnia. 
The bill also provides for a much-needed parking facility at the Wade Park VA Hospital in Cleveland. Representative Louis Stokes and I have believed for years now that this is an absolutely necessary improvement, and we are glad that we have finally been able to see it to this point in both the authorization and appropriation process. 
But on behalf of the people of Ohio, let me say that we appreciate most specifically some of the provisions that will help us cope with the consequences of the terrible flooding that took place in our State last month. 
The southern part of Ohio was ravaged by the worst flooding we have experienced in 33 years. Today, the flood waters have receded, but life is far from back to normal. In some towns, people still do not have permanent places to live. They are staying with relatives, or in RV's. Some have had their homes condemned--some have lost nearly everything and have to start again from scratch. 
When you drive through these towns, as I did, you see piles of people's belongings--like water damaged carpets--piled up outside their homes to dry, as they endeavor to rebuild their homes and their lives. 
Townships, villages, and counties all over southern Ohio are struggling to rebuild the roads and bridges that were damaged in the flooding. Some of the bridges dated back to the turn of the century. 
In Brown County, for example, they lost one covered bridge outright, and sustained serious damage to another one. 
In Clermont County, I saw Bear Creek Road that was completely washed away. They have been able to fix it temporarily, but school buses and garbage trucks can't use it. A permanent repair has to wait until money is available from the Natural Resource Conservation Service--or NRCS. 
Our hearts go out to all the people who are suffering the consequences of this flood, especially those who have lost family members and friends. We will do our best to help you carry on. 
We have already seen a wonderful outpouring of humanitarian assistance in response to this tragedy, the American Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard--along with many other concerned public and private organizations--have offered a desperately needed helping hand to some families who are having a really tough time. 
This legislation will help continue that process. It includes a $77 million appropriation for the Emergency Conservation Program, which provides cost-sharing assistance to the farmers whose land was damaged by the floods. 
It includes $161 million for the NRCS Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, which are designed to open the dangerously restricted channels and waterways, repair diversions and levees, and assist in erosion control on steep slopes. 
The people of southern Ohio have shown an incredible spirit in working together to get through this crisis. This bill will help them move forward in that same spirit. 
I thank the members of the Committee for the fine job they have done in crafting this legislation, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from New York and Rhode Island, Senator D'Amato and Senator Chafee, in offering this amendment to extend Supplemental Security Income [SSI] coverage to disabled, legal immigrants until the end of the fiscal year. This amendment is consistent with the recent agreement between the congressional leadership and President Clinton to allow disabled, legal immigrants to continue receiving SSI and Medicaid benefits. 
First, let me commend my friends from New York and Rhode Island, Senator D'Amato and Senator Chafee, for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of legal immigrants. It is safe to say that the bipartisan agreement to restore SSI and Medicaid benefits to disabled, legal immigrants would not have been made without their leadership. 
Plain and simple, this is an issue of fairness--fairness to those who played by the rules to become legal immigrants, only to see those rules changed to their detriment. 
While the budget agreement provides hope to legal immigrants, a temporary measure is needed to protect those immigrants who would stand to benefit from the budget agreement. That's the purpose of the amendment we are offering today. As my colleagues know, the 1996 welfare law bans legal immigrants from receiving SSI benefits beginning August 22, 1997--1 year after the day the law was signed. This 1-year transition period was designed to give legal immigrants time to obtain citizenship without losing eligibility, and to provide State and local governments time to adjust to increased demand for general assistance. 
The Social Security Administration estimates that roughly 525,000 legal immigrants currently receiving SSI could lose benefits under current law. Of that number, roughly 3,000 are from Ohio--and more than half of those immigrants, roughly 1,700 reside in Cuyahoga County. Many of these immigrants will seek and obtain citizenship and thus, can still receive SSI. However, many disabled immigrants currently receiving Federal support may not be able to become citizens. It is this population that stands to lose the most if current law is not changed. 
The Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland brought to my attention several families that would be affected if the law is not changed. Lev and Ada Vaynshtock, ages 64 and 60 respectively, came to this country from Moldova in 1991. They reside in Cleveland. 
Ada has passed her citizenship exam and is eagerly waiting to become a U.S. citizen. Lev's memory is getting worse and worse after open-heart surgery, and may never become a citizen. Both currently are eligible for SSI. Ada certainly will be able to retain her SSI eligibility when she gains citizenship, but Lev stands to lose this eligibility. If he outlives Ada, he will have no benefits at all--unless we act to change the law. 
They are just one of many elderly Russian families--families that because of mental or physical disability, stand to lose their SSI benefits later this summer. It is for them, and for countless others, that compelled a bipartisan group of Senators to seek changes in the law to protect elderly people. 
Let me emphasize to my colleagues that our efforts on behalf of disabled legal immigrants does not alter the key policy changes made in last year's welfare and immigration reform bills. Our efforts do not alter the basic policy change made last year that sponsors of legal immigrants need to take more financial responsibility for legal immigrants. Newly arrived immigrants still will have to abide by the 1996 welfare and immigration laws. 
Again, we're here to help those already here, those already disabled immigrants who played by the rules. Although Congress and the President have made a commitment to help this population, it may not be until the beginning of the fiscal year before that relief is provided. We cannot hold disabled, legal immigrants hostage to the legislative process, especially when they stand to lose benefits in a few short months. 
Again, our efforts have been bipartisan. I want to commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Roth, and of course our majority leader, Senator Lott, for working to place a temporary measure in the existing bill. The amendment we offer today simply expands that effort, to ensure that all immigrants who stand to retain their benefits because of the budget agreement are not denied benefits while the details of this agreement are worked out. What this amendment offers is certainty--the certainty that these immigrants will continue to receive benefits for an additional 6 weeks. 
In short, the budget agreement reflects our long-term commitment to fairness. By passing this amendment, we can take a short-term first step to realize that long-term goal.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of everyone in the Senate to a very important article that appeared in yesterday's Washington Post Magazine. The article profiles a woman by the name of Diane Hendel. Diane Hendel was the foster mother of twins who had been abandoned by their natural mother. In telling Diane Hendel's story, this article paints a devastating portrait of the foster care system, the foster care system not just in the District of Columbia, but the foster care system across this country. 
It is Diane Hendel's story, and it is told from her point of view. But much more important, it is really the story of these two children, these twins, and what our foster care system did and is doing to them. It tells the story of these two children who were abandoned with serious physical problems, and it tells the story of the foster mother, Diane Hendel, who for 2 1/2 years nurtured them, loved them, kept them going, became their mother. 
Then this article tells the story of a foster care system bent on family reunification, that when these little children were 3 1/2 years of age, that system decided the natural mother, who had abandoned them, was now the person that they should go to. It tells the horrifying and sad story of these little 3 1/2 -year-old children being taken away from the only mother that they ever really knew, to their new mother. All in the name of family reunification. All in the name of protecting the rights of the natural mother, without, in my opinion, any consideration for the rights not of the foster mother, but for the rights of those two little girls. 
Mr. President, there are 450,000 children in foster care across this country today. These children are spending far too great a portion of their lives in a legal limbo. Early childhood years are a crucial time in the development of any child. Indeed, there was a recent White House conference devoted to this very subject. It seems to me that as we pay more and more attention to what we all intuitively know--and that is how important the early years are in a child's development, and there was a whole magazine, in Newsweek, this past week, a special issue devoted to early childhood development. We realize, more and more, how precious and important those first few months, those first few years are, to the development of the child and who we become, and what we are is shaped in the first year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years. 
Is it not time that we reexamined in society how cavalier we are about having children who have been taken away from their parents, then sit in sort of a legal limbo, for a year, 2 years, 3 years or 4 years, all the while we, in society, we adults, try to reunify these families? But all the while, all the while, these children are growing up. 
Mr. President, children do not have a second opportunity to have their childhood. You never have a second chance to be 2, 3, or 4. What is happening across this country in too many cases is that children are taken, put in a foster home--sometimes multiple foster homes--all the while we, as a society, wait until that magical time when the parents have been fixed--the natural parents. They have been cured, they no longer snort cocaine, they no longer drink alcohol all the time, they no longer abuse their children, and some day we hopefully will put them back, put these children who have been removed, back with these natural parents. I think, Mr. President, that we have to start worrying about the children's rights and less about the rights of the natural parents. 
Every piece of new evidence shows us, Mr. President, that the system, the foster care system, is keeping children in foster care for too long. I think this should spur us to action. If any of the Members of the Senate want to become horrified, want to see what is wrong with our foster care system, let them read this story. I think it would shock any American to read it. 
The Washington Post article that I just referred to outlines how the principle of making reasonable efforts to reunify troubled families is too often misinterpreted to mean reunifying families at all costs--even abusive families that are really families in name only. Abusive parents, abusive birth parents, are, today, Mr. President, given a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance, a fifth chance, and on and on, to get their lives back together so then they can welcome their children back home. All the while, while they are trying to get their act together, their lives together, their poor little children are shuttled from foster home to foster home, spending their most formative years deprived of what all children should have--a safe, stable, loving, and permanent home.  
The article that I just talked about describes a case where two children, twins, were abandoned by their natural mother, a natural mother who had serious substance abuse problems. These children were then placed in foster care for 3 1/2 years while efforts were made to fix the mother, efforts were made to reunify that family. These particular children happened to be fortunate. They are probably the exception, because they spent the majority of that time with one person, Diane Hendel, who wanted to adopt them, Diane Hendel who nursed them back to health, who helped them get through some very, very tough times. 
But now, Mr. President, the system says they cannot stay with the only person that they have known as their mother. They have to go back to their natural mother, the person who abandoned them in the first place. Mr. President, does that really sound like a good idea? I do not think so. 
The article quotes child psychiatrist Marilyn Benoit of the Devereux Children's Center in Washington, DC:  
Three and a half years? And then the biological mother gets the children back? You have now disrupted the emotional development of those children. You, the court, have created a new abandonment. You have deliberately interjected separation and loss into their lives. What we know that does is disrupt development. You have depression. You have regression. You undermine a sense of trust. You introduce a sense of powerlessness. Children that age, what they want to develop is a sense of mastery, and you have done everything to thwart that, and you have really compromised that child's ability to move on. 
Mr. President, I think that comment by a child psychiatrist confirms what all of us know, any of us who know anything about children. Children need a stable and permanent home, a permanent home where they will learn the skills of love, the skills of friendship and survival. 
Mr. President, I think that Sister Josephine Murphy, who runs a home of severely abused children in Hyattsville, MD, is also exactly right. She is quoted in the article as saying the following: 
I know what they say, blood is thicker than water, and it is, but we're adults, and at some point we have to have the guts to say, `This is it. No more.' 
No more, Mr. President. Enough is enough. Who benefits from the current bias toward reunifying abusive families? Certainly not the children. Whose interests were taken into account when the decision was made to rip these two children away from the only mother that they ever knew? Was it the children's? I don't know any rational person who would say that was in the best interest of the child. In conclusion, Mr. President, let me quote from this article. There is a portion of the article on page 10 that describes the scene when these children were taken away from their foster mother. 
. . . Off they go. Goodbye to the toys. Goodbye to their drawings. Goodbye to their bedroom. Goodbye to the house. Goodbye to everything. Just like that. And then, goodbye to Diane. Who leaves the children, as ordered, so they can say hello a moment later to their new mother, who is the woman who conceived them and abandoned them and was charged with neglecting them and now, 3 1/2 years after they were born and 2 1/2 years after Diane took them in with the hope of adopting them, has been declared legally fit to take them with her to a new place, a strange place, their true home. 
Just like that. 
Goodbye. 
Hello. 
Mr. President, we have before us in this Congress several bills, one that just passed the House, the Camp-Kennelly bill, one that has been introduced in the Senate, which I am a cosponsor of, the Chafee-Rockefeller bill. Both of these bills, while they will not solve this problem, I think will help because they say quite simply what we all know deep in our hearts the fact should be, which is, yes, whenever possible, whenever reasonable, we should try to reunify families; but while we do that, we should not forget what our ultimate goal should be, which is to be concerned about the safety and welfare of the children. 
I think, Mr. President, if we focus on the child and focus on what is in the best interest of the child, we will have fewer crazy, ludicrous decisions, such as the one we have seen recounted in the Washington Post story of this past Sunday. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues from Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaha, to congratulate Ambassador Charlene Barshesfsky and her team at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for the efforts they have taken in their case against the European Union [EU] banana regime, which is pending before the World Trade Organization [WTO]. I know this is an issue of interest not just for the three of us, but also my Ohio colleague, Senator Glenn, my distinguished friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, and the majority leader, Senator Lott. Last week, the six of us joined together in a letter to Ambassador Barshefsky, expressing our appreciation for her office's great work to date. 
The case in question was brought before the WTO by the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador. Last March, a panel of the WTO made public an interim report, which found the EU banana regime to be in violation of more than 20 WTO principles. As the senior Senator from Hawaii pointed out, this one case has produced more violations than any other in the history of the WTO dispute settlement process. 
I am sure one could ask why a Senator from Ohio would be interested in a trade dispute involving bananas. It's easy to answer: I am a Senator who represents a large number of farmers in Ohio. Ohio farmers produce agricultural goods for both domestic and international markets. Indeed, if American agriculture is to remain a growth industry, we need to increase our presence in world markets. It's that simple. 
The hard fact for many farmers is that free and fair trade on the world stage hasn't always been simple, particularly when they have to go up against the EU. It is our job in Washington to achieve and advance trade agreements that protect and advance our agricultural interests. That can be easier said than done. It took years of negotiations before Congress finally ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and supported the creation of the WTO. Despite this progress in our trade laws and agreements, I still hear from farmers who believe that international trade agreements don't do the job, or express a lack of confidence in the WTO system. 
That's why I followed with great interest the case against the EU banana regime. The ultimate outcome of this case stands to shape both the real and perceived effectiveness of our U.S. trade team, and the WTO as a means to achieve those goals. 
Last month's interim report represents the most significant and hopeful sign that our Nation's interests can be voiced effectively in the WTO. It's important to emphasize the interim report is a first step. The report still must be adopted by the WTO and the EU be compelled to achieve full conformity with its findings. If the WTO adopts the report, it will be the first time the United States has won a case brought against the EU in the WTO. If adopted, U.S. agricultural trade policy will stand at a vital crossroads. America's farmers have battled the EU's tough and predatory trade practices for decades. Now, it appears that the WTO is in a position to shift the balance toward fairness and respect for U.S. agricultural interests in two ways: First, by offering an impartial forum to hear and resolve trade disputes; and second, by serving notice to the EU that its past practices will not be tolerated. 
Again, I congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and her team for their persistent efforts to stand up for America's farmers before the WTO. I urge my colleagues to express their support as well. I hope we will see continued success as this report proceeds through the adoption process, and as other cases are brought before the WTO.

Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the kind comments. I am sorry he is leaving, but he has an important mission on the Budget Committee. I have debated this issue on a number of different occasions in committee. But I must say that he is particularly eloquent today, because I do not even recognize this bill after he finished describing it. It is an entirely different bill than the bill I thought we passed out of committee. And I am sure many of the points that he raised today are going to be points of contention as this debate continues over the next few weeks. 
Mr. President, let me first congratulate Senator Ashcroft and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for the great work that they have done to bring this bill to the floor today. In the House, my colleague from Ohio, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, has done tremendous work on this bill. 
This is a bill that I am particularly proud to have been involved in to help bring to the floor today, because I think it will help bring the American workplace into the 21st century and, more importantly, bring the underlying labor law into the 21st century and make both more conducive, more understanding, to the changing nature of American society and of the American workplace, particularly of the American family and how people really live today. 
In the hearings that we held in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on this bill several months ago, we heard facts that substantiate the monumental changes that have taken place in American society in this century, particularly in the last 20 to 25 years, changes that make it absolutely essential that we pass this legislation. 
Mr. President, today more than 60 percent of married women work outside their home; 75 percent of married women with school-aged children work outside the home; 75 percent of married couples with children have both spouses working. 
We compare these statistics, Mr. President, to the situation in 1950: 11 percent in 1950--11 percent--of married mothers with children under the age of 6 worked outside the home. Today, almost 50 percent do--47 percent. 
In less than half a century--in my lifetime--we have gone from around 10 percent of these mothers working outside the home to nearly half of them. This is truly a historic social change. I believe the sponsors of this bill in both the House and the Senate believe that it would be a good idea for the dynamics of the American workplace to finally catch up with the dynamics of our society. 
It would be a good idea, Mr. President, for our laws to reflect the reality of how people live today. Put simply, Mr. President, there are more single parents and dual income families in our work force today than ever before, and their numbers are growing. In today's society, employees are faced with a difficult task of balancing their obligations to family, to spouse, to children, to work, school, other important things. 
Mr. President, it is significant--it is significant--that for many years Federal, State, and local governments have enjoyed the statutory ability to offer their employees a flexible work schedule, thus allowing them an opportunity to spend more time with their families or more time to continue their education. 
Mr. President, as our colleagues consider this bill, I ask them to consider how many times they have had a Federal employee, when they have been back to their State, come up to them and say, `I don't like this. I don't like the comptime. I don't like the flexibility that the law gives me today.' They have had this, Federal workers have, for several decades. State employees have. 
I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio for 4 years. I do not recall one State employee ever coming up to me and saying, `I don't like the flexibility that we have.' In fact, just the contrary. Everyone who has ever talked to me about it has said, `I enjoy it. I like it. It helps my family.' 
Mr. President, there are actually antiquated Federal laws which are still on the books that are preventing some of the necessary changes in the non-Government workplace. This is what this bill does. It sweeps away some of these old laws that prohibit workers from doing what they want to do. 
Let us say, for example, a mother wants to take her daughter to a doctor's appointment. She wants to make up the working hours she missed by stacking them into other work days. Today, Federal law, written by Congress in 1938, says the employer cannot do that. The employer has to say to her, `No. I am prohibited by law from doing this. I want to do it. You want to do it. We are prohibited by law from doing it.' 
Mr. President, that simply does not make sense as we approach the next century. Workers in this country need more flexibility. 
Mr. President, earlier this month the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee passed this bill, a bill that would reduce some of the stress on America's working families by making the American workplace more family friendly. 
As chairman of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, I handled this bill and we held several hearings. The hearings strengthened my conviction that this bill is long overdue. 
Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, was on the floor a few minutes ago and talked about Christine Korzendorfer, a woman, a mother of several children, who works at TRW. This is what she said, and I quote. She is talking about overtime pay. `Pay is important to me.' That is important. `However, the time with my family is more important. If I had the choice,'--if I had the choice--`there are times when I would prefer to take comp time in lieu of overtime. What makes this idea appealing is that I would be able to choose what option best suits my situation.' 
Mr. President, that pretty well sums it up. Individual choice is really what this is all about. It is the Christine Korzendorfers of this country, the hard-working Americans, who know best what kind of work schedule fits their needs. Giving these workers the freedom of choice is the purpose of this legislation. The bill before us today, S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, will amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to finally provide employers and employees in the private sector with the same benefits public-sector employees have enjoyed for many, many years. 
The bill contains three options for making the workplace more flexible--compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime pay, biweekly work schedules, and flexible credit hours. 
Participation, Mr. President, is voluntary. Let me stress this again and again. You are going to hear this word from me throughout this debate. It is voluntary. No one has to do it. If the employee does not want to do it, the status quo prevails. The employer has to want to do it, the employee has to want to do it before this law really even kicks in. 
Mr. President, I think that most people would be shocked if they knew that current law prohibits, absolutely prohibits, employees and employers from making the types of arrangements and agreements that people in the public sector can do today. 
If that law was not in effect today, if that law did not prohibit that type of arrangement, do you think, Mr. President, Members of the Senate, that anyone would come to the Senate floor and offer a bill to do that? Would anyone come to the Senate floor and offer a bill that said the Federal Government is going to step 
in and tell employees and tell workers in this country that, if you want to make an arrangement with the employer that allows you more flexibility in your life, that allows you to better decide when you are going to work, how you are going to work--does anybody think that bill would pass? 
Does anybody think that the Federal Government, if it did not have that law in effect today, that we would want to put that law into effect? The answer obviously is no. I think it tells us something when we look at that answer and look at the question in that way. Such a bill obviously would never pass. 
Mr. President, the Fair Labor Standards Act and its underlying regulations simply do not allow private-sector employers to meet the demands of their employees for more flexibility in various forms of compensation. As a result, working families are faced with tremendously difficult decisions. 
For example, will a mother sacrifice hard-earned vacation time off to take her child to the doctor or to the hospital? 
Should she forgo the compensation to make sure her sick child is properly cared for? Should she try to run home for an hour here or 20 minutes there? Can a single parent afford to leave work early to attend a teacher conference, to help chaperone a class trip? Will a single parent ever find the time to pursue greatly needed continued education? These are the options that this bill will give. 
I see, Mr. President, my colleague from Texas is on the floor. She has worked long and hard to bring this bill to the floor. I congratulate her for her great work. I yield to the Senator from Texas.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from Texas for not only an excellent statement but for the tremendous work she has done, not just on this bill, but on many pieces of legislation that really reflect how American families live today. 
Government, many times, has a hard time keeping up with 
changes in society. She has worked, for example, on the homemaker IRA bill, another bill that, again, tracks the changes in society and gives families flexibility to allow them to make adjustments in their life, to live their lives the way they want to live them. I congratulate her for her great work and look forward to working on this bill and continuing this debate in the future. 
Mr. President, I think one of the points that my colleague from Texas made very well is that this bill--the current law discriminates against hourly workers. We have a situation today where two people can be working together, one is a salaried employee, the other is an hourly employee, and the hourly employee, really because of the way the law is written, because of a quirk of history, legislative history, the hourly employee does not have the same flexibility today that a salaried employee does. The salaried employee can make an arrangement with the employer to shift time, to be gone a Friday afternoon, to work extra some other time, that flexibility is not available to the hourly employee. That is discrimination. That is wrong. That is what this bill is aimed at rectifying. 
Mr. President, it is also discrimination to say if you work for the Federal Government or if you work for local government, you have to follow one set of rules and you have many options as far as the time you work. But if you work in the private sector, the Federal Government says, `Oh, no, you do not have that flexibility.' That is discrimination. Again, that is what this bill is designed to rectify, change, and stop that discrimination.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Missouri for the excellent statement and explanation about his bill and also congratulate him for bringing this bill to the floor. As he stated, we knew as we began the debate today that we would only just get started and that, because of concerns about the budget and other scheduling matters on the floor, we would have to ask to have this bill pulled down temporarily. We will be back on this bill. It is a very important bill to American workers. It is a question of fairness. It is a question of equity. It is a question of really trying to bring our laws up to date to reflect the reality of how people live their lives today, the reality of the American workplace. 
It is a bill about eliminating discrimination. The current law, frankly, as we talked about it, does in fact discriminate against hourly workers who are in the private sector who do not have the benefit of working for the Federal Government. 
So, at this point I do ask unanimous consent to withdraw the motion to proceed.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I think our friends in the House of Representatives deserve a great deal of praise for what they did yesterday. They passed a bill that would save the lives of many gravely threatened young people in this country. I am referring, of course, to the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, the Camp-Kennelly legislation, which passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 5. 
For the children in foster care in this country, the average time they spend in foster care is almost 2 years. That is just the average time. These 2 years are often the most important time in that child's development. We need to do everything we can to get these children in safe, stable, permanent, loving adoptive homes. 
Why are these children being kept in foster care for so long? I said the average time was 2 years. Sometimes it is 3, 4, 5 years. Sometimes the most important years of their lives are spent in foster care, and sometimes they move from foster home to foster home to foster home. Why do they get shoved from one home to another? Why do they spend so many years in foster care? One reason is that, in some of these cases, the child protective services feel hemmed in by a misinterpretation of a Federal law, a well-intentioned Federal law that this Congress passed in 1980, a law that has done a great deal of good, but a law that contains one provision that I believe has caused a great deal of harm and has caused a great deal of confusion. 
Under this 1980 law, the Federal Child Welfare Act, for a State to be eligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, that State must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services approved by the Secretary of HHS. The State plan must provide, that in each case, reasonable efforts will be made, first, prior to the placement of a child in foster care to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of a child from his home and, second, to make it possible for the child to return to his home. 
In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular circumstances of a household may be, the State must make reasonable efforts to keep that household, that family together, and then to put it back together if it falls apart. 
There is very strong evidence, evidence that I have seen firsthand as I have traveled the State of Ohio and talked to people who are professionals in this field, talked to judges, talked to child services workers, very strong evidence that reasonable efforts have, in some cases, become extraordinary efforts, efforts to keep families together at all costs, efforts to keep families together that are families really in name only. This has resulted in children being put back in abusive homes, put back in situations where no child should have to exist or live. 
Every day in this country, three children die of abuse or neglect. Children who are being abused by their parents should simply not be reunified with those parents. That is common sense. The legislation passed yesterday by the House of Representatives makes it clear, by an overwhelming vote, that this is what the House thinks. 
Now is the time for the Senate to take action. We have a very good piece of legislation, the Chafee-Rockefeller bill, of which I am honored to be a cosponsor, that has been introduced in this body. It is a piece of legislation that contains many good provisions. One of the provisions it contains is identical language to what the House passed yesterday to simply say what we all know in our heart was intended by the 1980 act, and that is, yes, we should make reasonable efforts to put families back together, we should try to help them, but--but--when those decisions are made at the local, county level or city level, the people who make those decisions must always put safety and the welfare of that child first. The safety of the child must always be paramount. That is good common sense; it is good legislation. 
We are halfway there. Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to complete the action and send that bill on to the President. The President has already said that he supports this language, that he supports this concept, that there is, in fact, a problem. The Senate should act very quickly and move on this legislation and really plug this loophole, which has caused a great deal of pain and many problems for our young people in this country today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, last Saturday's Washington Post told the story of a devastating, but avoidable, tragedy. It is the story of a little 5-year-old boy in Montgomery County, MD, who was locked in his bedroom for 22 hours a day, tied to his bed with a cat leash. This little boy's mouth was taped shut, his hands and his feet were bound together. Little Richard Holmes suffered the kind of abuse that no child in this country, or anywhere, ought to suffer. 
That there are 3 million reports of child abuse in America every year is a tragedy, but there is an even deeper tragedy in cases like that of Richard Holmes. It is the tragedy of a system that tries too hard to keep some families together when they are families in name only. 
According to the story in the Washington Post, Richard's grandmother and his aunt complained to Montgomery County child protection services that Richard was being abused. They made this complaint last year, describing to county officials how Richard was returning home from visits to his father famished and with bite marks--bite marks--on his arms. Their complaints were ignored. In fact, they were accused of being troublemakers. Richard's father and his girlfriend are now in 
prison on child abuse charges. This is not new territory for Richard's father, who was sentenced to 2 years probation back in 1992 after his neglect of Richard came to the court's attention the first time. 
Mr. President, what on Earth was this little child, this little boy, doing back in his father's custody? It is easy to fault the child protection services to say that they should have done more, and they should have. What I would like to stress today is that those of us in the U.S. Senate should do more. 
As I have discussed on this floor on numerous occasions, too often child protective services feel themselves hemmed in by a misinterpretation of a law that was passed by this Congress in 1980. Under the Federal Child Welfare Act, for a State to be eligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, the State must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services approved by the Secretary of HHS. The State plan must provide `that in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home.' 
In other words, no matter what the particular circumstances of a household may be, the State must make reasonable efforts to keep that family together and to put it back together after it falls apart. 
There is strong evidence to suggest that in practice, throughout the 50 States, reasonable efforts have become extraordinary efforts, efforts to keep families together sometimes at all costs and sometimes to the detriment of these children. 
I believe that the sad story of Richard Holmes is a very eloquent case in point. So is the story of a little Ohio girl named Jenny Lynn. She is only 3 years old, and she has already been in eight foster homes. Let me repeat that, 3 years old and this poor child has already been in eight foster homes. One set of foster parents after another have given her up because they are not likely to ever be awarded permanent custody, not likely ever to be able to adopt her. She now reacts with panic, understandably, whenever she sees trash bags. You see, every time she is moved, her clothes, her possessions are moved in trash bags. Now when she sees trash bags, she is afraid that she is being moved once again. 
Why, Mr. President, is she being moved? Why is this little 3-year-old being moved time and time again? Because the county, Mr. President, is still trying to reunify her family in this case, still trying to reunify her with her parents. The problem is, nobody knows where her parents are. Meanwhile, she will continue--I guess until they are found--to be shuttled back and forth, back and forth, from foster home to foster home. 
This child, this little 3-year-old, is being deprived of what all children deserve: Stability, love, loving parents, a home. She is being deprived of her childhood. 
Mr. President, you do not need to be an expert on child development to know that that kind of childhood will not help Jenny Lynn grow up to be a happy adult. Frankly, the whole situation is absurd. And I believe we need to do everything we can to make this kind of nightmare occur less frequently in this country. 
Today, our friends in the House of Representatives passed legislation--the Camp-Kennelly bill--that will help us avoid this kind of tragedy. Mr. President, the Senate should do likewise. I have been working on similar legislation here in the Senate, legislation sponsored by Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, and other Members of this body, legislation to make it plain that the health and safety of children is and ought to be the primary concern of child protective services. 
Mr. President, we are building a bipartisan consensus in support of this idea. The case of Richard Holmes ought to remind us that there are a lot of kids out there who need our help. We should not delay any longer. 
Again, Mr. President, the action of the House of Representatives today is great news. I look forward to moving our bill on the Senate floor, the Chafee-Rockefeller bill, which among other provisions contains this `reasonable efforts' language to clarify what we all really know and what we all believe and what I am sure Congress meant in 1980, and that is, while we should always try to reunify families, the best interests of the child, the safety of the child, the welfare of the child always--always--must be of paramount concern. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will vote today to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). I do so without any illusions. I have concluded that it will be of marginal benefit, but that its benefits do outweigh the risks. Clearly, no chemical weapons treaty can be 100% verifiable. Inside the CWC, there is at least a better chance of catching violators than if we remain outside the treaty. 
I commend the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, as well as Senator Kyl, and others who have worked so hard to improve this treaty. As a result of their efforts, for example, we retain the right for our troops to use tear gas in hostage rescue operations; we require search warrants in cases where consent is not granted to protect 4th amendment rights; and we restrict U.S. assistance to rogue nations under Article X to medical antidotes and humanitarian assistance. 
This is a historic agreement bringing together 74 countries that have ratified the treaty in a comprehensive, worldwide fight, to ban chemical weapons. The treaty requires all nations to follow America's lead to destroy all chemical stockpiles by 2007. The CWC also provides for sanctions against those who trade in chemical agents with non-parties to the treaty. These provisions will help to ensure that on a future battlefield our troops will be less likely to face chemical agents. 
Passage of this treaty should not bring a false sense of security. A treaty alone will not protect our troops and citizens from chemical weapons. We should continue to devote attention and resources to improving our chemical weapons defenses. We should provide our troops with the equipment and training they need in combat situations. The parties to this treaty must also take action against violators who resort to using chemical weapons. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I will work to ensure that the goals of this treaty are not lost in its implementation.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Primary Care Promotion Act of 1997. This bill would restore full Federal funding under Medicare for graduate medical education for physicians specializing in approved combined primary care residency training programs. This legislation is needed to refocus the recently issued HCFA regulations that reduce the level of Federal funding to graduate medical education paid by the Medicare program. 
While HCFA's goals--reducing Medicare spending and placing sensible limitations on the number of new specialists trained in this country--are praiseworthy, we must not lose sight of the fact that we face a shortage of primary care physicians, and particularly those who treat children. 
The Federal Government has used Medicare dollars effectively to support physicians who specialize in care for our seniors. Now, in my view, we must make a similar commitment to ensure that medical professionals are prepared to meet the health needs of our children. Despite what the bulk of our health policy would suggest, the health needs of our children are very different from those of their parents and grandparents. Children aren't miniature adults, and they need care that is tailored to their special needs. 
This legislation would greatly benefit children, because it would enable physicians to complete advanced training in combined specialties such as internal medicine and pediatrics or emergency medicine and pediatrics. A recent survey by the American Boards of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics demonstrates the wisdom of this investment: over 70 percent of the physicians who were trained in the combined specialties of internal medicine and pediatrics between 1980 and 1995 currently work as primary care providers. Because the health needs of children are so varied and so different from those of adults, they often require care by physicians who have received specialized training. 
The Primary Care Promotion Act is supported by a wide variety of professional medical associations, including pediatricians, specialists in internal medicine, children's hospitals, and medical educators. This legislation has received bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, where it has been introduced by Representative Louise Slaughter, and we expect similar support in the Senate.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. I rise to challenge all of us to take actions that will eliminate the chronic shortage of organs available for transplant in the United States. 
Mr. President, this Nation faces a severe organ shortage. I have talked about this issue several times on the Senate floor. Last year at this time when I talked about it, at least eight people in America every day were dying while waiting for organ transplants. One year later, tragically, the figures are even worse. Today, 10 people now die every day while waiting for organs. 
Mr. President, these numbers are certainly very distressing. They are devastating because the technology to save these men, women, and children is available. It is there. If you ask our expert on this issue, and the Senate's expert, Dr. Frist from Tennessee, he will tell us that these people can be saved. These 10 people who die every day could have been saved. The technology is there. Medical science has advanced that far. But they die because there are simply not enough available organs. That is a tragedy, Mr. President, 
In January 1996, there were almost 44,000 patients in this country waiting for an organ transplant. One year later, the figure is up to 51,000 individuals who are today waiting--up 7,000 from just a year ago. 
The need for transplantable organs has increased in all categories. These aren't just statistics, not just numbers, not just longer and longer lists. These are people. These are children, friends, and families that love them, and that pray every day that there will be a chance for that loved one to live--that there will be an organ that is available for that child, that parent, that husband, or that mother. 
I think that we have to ask ourselves what we can do about this. What can we do about this as individuals and as elected officials? 
As private citizens, when we go to get our driver's license for the first time, or when we go to get it renewed, we are asked sometimes very quickly, `Do you want to donate your organs in case of an accident, in the case of your death?' We all need to say yes when that question is asked. We can also, and should, encourage our relatives and friends to do the same thing. As Americans, we need to talk about this issue. As families we need to talk about this issue before tragedy strikes. 
This is not a subject that anyone of us likes to discuss. But it is very important that we do so because our willingness to discuss it now, our willingness as a people to be open and to organize a donation is really a matter of life and death. 
My wife, Fran, and I faced this issue when our daughter, Becky, was killed almost 4 years ago. This was not something that we had thought about really. It was not something that we had talked about as a family. When we were asked the question whether we would do this or not, my wife, Fran, turned to me, and said, `You know that is what Becky would have wanted us to do.' So we did it. 
I think, Mr. President, that most people would want their loved ones to do the same thing. Too often the survivors--people who are faced with life's most horrible tragedy--just do not want to do it. They do not know that the loved one would 
have wanted them to do it. 
So I think by talking about this we will increase the number of organs that are available, and we will, in fact, save lives. 
I think too often that the No. 1 obstacle to life-saving organ donation is simply that lack of awareness. People simply aren't aware of the huge difference--the life-saving difference that they can make in someone else's life. They don't think about it. They don't talk about it. And that is natural. But that is why the decision to donate the organs of a loved one sometimes is a very difficult decision. But I think when people talk about it that it will be made much easier. 
As elected officials, we in this Chamber have another responsibility. I believe that we must take this message to the American people. Educational efforts have, of course, already begun. 
Thanks to the leadership of our colleague, Senator Dorgan, information about organ donations is being enclosed with Federal income tax refunds that are going out this year. It is estimated that 70 million individuals will receive these refunds. So information contained in those envelopes is going out. 
Further, today I sent a letter to Postmaster General Runyon asking him to approve a `Gift of Life' postage stamp as soon as possible. Mr. President, I have been talking to the Postmaster General's office for more than a year now about this issue because I am firmly convinced that this stamp will remind people of the vital importance of organ donation. It will save lives. It will bring about more awareness. Mr. President, anything that we can do to encourage families to discuss this issue will, in fact, better prepare them to make this life-saving decision. 
Further, Mr. President, as you and other Members of the Chamber may know, Senator Kennedy and Representative Moakley held a field hearing in Massachusetts on this very issue. I will hold a similar field hearing in Ohio this fall, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same in their home States, to bring this issue closer to home. 
Recently, there has been a lot of publicity about organ donation--publicity specifically about controversial protocols that have been considered to enhance the viability of transplanted organs. I support an informed public dialog on this, or any other medical issue. As this debate continues, however, Mr. President, we have to make sure that we keep our eye on the ball, that we stay focused, and not lose sight of the fact that organ donations save many thousands of lives each year in this country, and that thousands of other Americans are still waiting for this precious gift of life. 
Mr. President, together we can build a national consensus to increase the rate of organ donations. Seriously ill Americans who are on these waiting lists should not have to wait so long for a second chance. They should have a second chance. And I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate and with people across this country to achieve this goal in the months ahead. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join the Senator from Iowa in being an original cosponsor of the drug-free communities legislation. 
In the last 5 years, substance abuse by America's young people has more than doubled. Even more troubling, it is taking place at younger and younger ages. 
We need to turn this around. And this is a challenge that requires the involvement of the whole community--young people, their parents, schools, businesspeople, the media, law enforcement, religious organizations, civic and fraternal groups, as well as professionals in the area of drug abuse treatment. 
Community-based antidrug coalitions have proven their worth in the fight against drug abuse. I'm thinking of groups like the Madison County Prevention Assistance Coalition Team--or PACT--in Madison County, OH. PACT was established in a rural area in central Ohio in 1991, and rapidly inspired over 50 local substance abuse prevention initiatives. 
What PACT did was mobilize the community. Middle school students acted as mentors and role models for third graders. Teachers in Head Start taught their students about drug abuse prevention. A local church held a father-son retreat. 
A research team from Miami University found that Madison County's alcohol-related crime dropped by 50 percent. And students are reporting a decline in the use and availability of alcohol and other drugs. 
The key is mobilizing the community. The bill we're introducing today will help tap into this resource--by redirecting Federal funding to community coalitions that have developed comprehensive programs to educate children about the dangers of drugs. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Representatives Portman, Hastert, Rangel, and Levin. 
This bill will channel funds from the fiscal year 1998 drug control budget--in the form of matching grants--to community coalitions with proven track records. It will enhance programs that work, without allocating new funds. 
I think this is exactly the type of legislation we need. It's a sensible and cost-effective approach to solving a major problem. And I will join my colleague from Iowa in working for its enactment.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mexico resolution. 
I think it offers a constructive solution to the bilateral problem we are facing. It gives the President of the United States an opportunity to discuss with President Zedillo of Mexico the various concerns many of us have about the progress our two countries are making in the drug war. And it does so without provoking unnecessary and counterproductive tensions between our countries. 
The problems in Mexico's drug enforcement are well known. You can hardly open a newspaper without learning about even more instances of corruption and incompetence at all levels of government and law enforcement. 
It's a sad chronicle that makes for truly depressing reading. It's understandable why so many concerned Members of Congress are raising serious questions about the effectiveness of Mexico's antidrug effort. 
But it's important that we in Congress stay focused on doing what's in our own national interest--not on symbolic gestures that fail to accomplish that interest. 
The problems we face are real. 
There are 12.8 million Americans who use illegal drugs, including 1.5 million cocaine users and 600,000 heroin addicts. 
More than 1 out of every 10 children between 12 and 17 years of age use illegal drugs. One out of every four claims to have been offered illegal drugs in the past year. 
The American people recognize that these are important problems--and that we have to take serious action. But let me point out, Mr. President, that there are many, many people in Mexico who support our goals. To succeed, we need that support. 
Without their support, it would not have been possible for Mexico to make even today's limited progress against the drug traffickers. 
That progress is limited, but it is nonetheless real. 
Over the last year, in spite of the well-known cases of corruption, the Mexican Government has posted increases in drug seizures and crop eradications. That includes a 15-percent increase in marijuana seizures, a 6.3-percent increase in cocaine seizures, and an almost 80-percent increase in heroin seizures. 
In 1996, Mexican authorities reported an increase of nearly 14 percent in the number of people arrested on drug trafficking and related offenses, including 28 high-level members of drug trafficking organizations. This year, as has been widely reported, Mexican authorities arrested General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo--who had been in charge of the National Institute to Combat Drugs--for supporting the activities of the Juarez cartel. 
We didn't catch him, Mr. President. The Mexicans themselves did. 
Should we expect further improvements in law enforcement operations? Absolutely. We need to monitor the full enforcement of the law--in other words, keep close watch on how many of these arrests lead to prosecution and jail time. 
In 1996, the Mexican Congress passed tough laws to address the problems of money laundering, chemical diversion, and organized crime. Now we should insist on full enforcement of those new laws. 
This year, we have seen improved cooperation in the areas of money laundering and extradition. Mexico and the United States established a high level contact group on narcotics control to explore joint solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate bilateral efforts. We should now expect this increased cooperation to yield clear, positive results. 
But one thing is clear: Both Governments need to dedicate greater resources to stop trafficking along our border. Senator Hutchison informed the Foreign Relations Committee last week of the enormous difficulties faced by her fellow Texans along the border. Specifically, ranchers with property along the border are being bribed, coerced, or having their lives threatened by traffickers seeking to use private property as a back door into our Nation. These ranchers have been told by Federal officials that it would be years before enough new border agents could be assigned to better secure their property. 
Listen to some of the stories these ranchers tell--stories about the gunfights they have fought with drug gangs, and having to carry guns whenever they leave the house. It sounds like a John Ford movie about the Old West. 
That has got to change. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by making a broader point about Mexico's future. In my view, with this resolution, we create the opportunity for a new round of cooperation between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is not only a neighbor with whom we share a 2,000-mile border, it is also this country's third largest trading partner. If we are to be successful in our anti-drug efforts, Mexico must be our ally. 
Yes, the Government of Mexico needs to do more within its borders, and with us, to combat drug trafficking. The real question before us is how can we improve on that partnership. 
We all know what the problems are. We all agree that they are very, very serious. But we should also recognize that this is a crucial moment in Mexico's history--and they need our support if they are going to continue in the right direction. 
What the Mexican people are trying to do is make the transition from a one-party state, in which corruption and excessive government mandates stifle the hope for widespread prosperity, to a multiparty state that creates jobs and rewards job creators. 
President Zedillo appears to be trying to free up Mexican society and reform the political process--changes that will make Mexico a more stable neighbor for the United States. He is opposed by powerful elements in his ruling party, and make no mistake, the outcome is still in doubt. 
Now more than ever, the people of Mexico need to know that we want them to be our partners. Our national interest is served by a prosperous and democratic Mexico--a Mexico that offers hope and opportunity for its citizens. 
The drug war is one area where we must continue to work together. We should redouble our efforts to look for constructive solutions--to reduce trafficking, to crack down on money laundering, and most important of all, to reduce the demand for drugs. 
Our countries must be united in a very important partnership. In the anti-drug effort, as in so many other areas, we have a major common challenge, and we can only prevail if we face it together. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I just returned from spending 3 days in flood-ravaged southern Ohio. I had the opportunity to visit with some of the victims in Clermont County, Adams County, Brown County, Scioto County, Jackson County, Lawrence, Gallia, and Meigs counties. When you see the damage up close, it is even more terrifying than it is when you see it on the nightly news, or see it on CNN. 
As I visited with the victims, I saw something that was very heartening. I saw something that simply makes you feel good. It certainly made me feel good. That was the number of people who were pulling together in a spirit of community, reaching out to each other to reassure each other, to help each other, to be with their friends, to be with their neighbors. I can't tell you how many different times I saw people who were volunteering to help someone else. 
I walked into one home and talked to a woman. I said, `How did your home get cleaned up?' She was an elderly lady. She said, `I had 30 people come in here, 30 of my friends. They came in. They cleaned it up.' They cleaned it up in a very short period of time. 
This weekend I visited Jackson, OH, in Jackson County. We were walking down a street that had been very heavily damaged. The homes had been heavily damaged by flood water. We came across what looked like 30, 40, or 45 Boy Scouts in Boy Scout uniforms. I asked the leader what they were doing. He said, `Well, we were supposed to be camping out this weekend.' These were scouts from four, five, or six different counties. `But we decided to come in here to Jackson.' And they literally just started volunteering to clean up people's homes. 
So I watched these Boy Scouts for a while as they went about their business moving the debris from that street, going into people's homes and helping them scrub down their floors and get the mud out. It was absolutely an unbelievable thing to see. 
That same day I saw the same spirit in New Boston. The Jaycee group was in New Boston. Again, as I was walking down the street and talking to some of the victims of the flood, I saw a bunch of Jaycees. They were out doing the same thing. They were drawn from all over the State of Ohio. They just volunteered to come in that day and were doing that type of cleanup work. 
On Sunday morning, yesterday morning, I participated in a church service in the village of Vinton, OH, a small village in Gallia County. Just about every family in that church had experienced some devastation from the flood. Yet, I heard words of hope from the pulpit. I heard words of hope from the members of the congregation. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I was reminded of what I saw in Xenia, OH, in 1974 when Xenia went through that tornado. Then, several days later, people still went to Sunday church services. There were people who said, `Why in the world do they do that?' Again, it was, I think, a reaffirmation of faith, people's devotion to each other, devotion to God, and really a showing of spirit of coming together. 
The Ohio National Guard has done a fantastic job. The Watercraft Division of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources literally came in and saved life after life--rescued people from the top of homes. The Ohio Department of Transportation is doing a phenomenal job, the Red Cross. I could go on and on. An absolutely tremendous amount of work is being done in the communities to really make a difference in the communities. 
My wife, Fran, had the opportunity to work in Ohio several days last week. She worked with the Salvation Army. She worked with the Red Cross and is working with one group of Southern Baptists who are all geared up whenever there is a disaster. They come from all over the State of Ohio and from other States into an area and cook and prepare food for people. They really made a difference. She was very inspired by what she saw them doing. And as she has told me about it, I have certainly been inspired as well. 
So these are just a few examples of what we are seeing in the State of Ohio. We are seeing people who are out there making a difference, people who are working with their neighbors, and people are just hanging in there. 
I happened to talk to one man in New Boston. His home was flooded in a very quick flash flood. He literally had to knock a hole in the ceiling. As the water was rising inside his house, he had to knock a hole in the ceiling and put his four little children up into the attic. He and his wife then crawled up into the attic. He knocked a hole in the roof, and they were rescued from the top of their house. Yet, when I came across this man, the mayor of New Boston told me that he had been one of the chief volunteers over the last few days. This man who had lost virtually everything in his home, who went through that unbelievable experience, was out leading the cleanup, volunteering for other people. So that is the type of thing we see. 
Let me also compliment the FEMA personnel who are on the scene. These are good folks who are out doing their job every day and who are really making a difference. 
So the report from Ohio, Mr. President, is that there is a tremendous amount of damage. We think it is $150 million, maybe $200 million. We really will not know until the entire flood has receded and we see what damage has been done. But the good news is people are fighting back. Human spirit is strong and people are helping each other. Again, I think that is the good news that I have to report for the last 3 days I spent in the State of Ohio. 
Mr. President, I will at this point yield the floor and yield back my time.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 17,274 alcohol-related traffic fatalities in 1995. Each year, 1 million people are injured in alcohol-related traffic crashes. Alcohol is the single greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths and injuries. 
It is estimated that alcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 billion every year, when you count up items like emergency and acute health care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and judicial services, insurance, disability and workers' compensation, lost productivity, and social services for those who cannot return to work and support their families. Just one alcohol-related fatality is estimated to cost society $950,000. The cost of each alcohol-related injury averages $20,000.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we speak, the flooding continues in Ohio and Kentucky and Indiana and West Virginia. Our hearts and prayers go out to all of those who are suffering and all those who are fighting back, trying to put their lives back in order. 
I see on the floor my colleague from Ohio and my colleague from Kentucky and my colleague from West Virginia. All are States, as well as Indiana, that have been hit very hard. 
The most heartening thing to see during a tragedy such as this is how people react. We have many organizations that are involved, but probably the biggest organization involved is not an organization at all, it is just Ohioans and Kentuckians and Hoosiers and people from West Virginia who are out there, helping their neighbors and helping their friends, and sometimes just helping people they do not know at all. 
It is the American spirit and is something that is a wonderful thing to behold.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to talk about an issue that I have been looking at for some time. I rise today to discuss U.S. policy in regard to one of our most troubled neighbors in this hemisphere. Over the last several years, in my capacity as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I traveled to Haiti on three separate occasions to investigate the problems of that country and to assess the efforts of the United States to help the Haitians cope with these problems and to help them as they try to secure the solid legal and economic infrastructure that has, frankly, eluded them now for centuries. 
I did this because I believe Congress and the administration must undertake a candid, realistic look at U.S. policy, what is working, what is not working, and where we go from here. The American taxpayers have already invested a great deal in Haiti, contributing at least $2 billion to the country's recovery, risking the lives of American service personnel in the 1994 invasion, and leaving hundreds of them there today to help keep an uneasy peace. 
While Haiti is not of great strategic importance to the United States, we do have a serious interest in what happens in this, the poorest country in our hemisphere. These interests stem from geography and are amply proven by history. I do not think most of us need to be reminded, for example, about the Haitian boat people. It is clear the only thing preventing yet another explosion of refugees into the southern part of this country is a wise, multinational investment in the stability of Haiti. 
Fortunately, recent history has given us some good guidelines, some good advice, if you will, on how to help secure such stability. One of the great principles of the Reagan administration was that America's national interest was best served by having neighbors that practiced democratic and free-market principles. In Latin America, the Reagan doctrine certainly has worked. 
As free elections and economic liberalization has taken place in country after country, the countries of South and Central America have become better neighbors for the United States. I believe these same principles apply to our national strategy in regard to Haiti. 
Mr. President, we need to apply these principles to Haiti so that over the long term, Haiti can move out of the category of `problem country' and into a fuller economic and political participation in regional progress. The challenge for us, the challenge for Congress, the challenge for the administration is to provide assistance that actually works, a do-good approach, not a feel-good approach. This means working with the Haitian people to determine the real roadblocks to democracy and to free enterprise and determine what form of United States assistance will help overcome these obstacles. 
Two years after the United States invasion, Haiti still is struggling by any reasonable measure. But a closer examination reveals several seeds of progress struggling to take root. 
First, Let's start, Mr. President, with the justice system. For democracy to survive, it is not enough that Haitians have the power to effect change at the ballot box. They also must have a working judicial system. Frankly, Haiti has never had a functioning judiciary, certainly not the way we understand it. There are sitting judges today who can't read or write. Others are just incompetent. 
Understandably, the Haitian people are demanding change. Specifically, they want to know if President Preval is committed to building an independent and a competent judiciary. Since President Aristide's return, there has been a series of commando-style killings of political opponents. The numbers have dropped off since the inauguration of President Preval, but, disturbingly, too many people in Haiti still think they can commit political murders with impunity. 
Mr. President, there are two things you always need if you want to solve high-profile crimes. First, you have to have the expertise, good solid police work, good professional police investigation. And Second, you also have to have the political will from the top so that everyone in the country, everyone in the judicial system, everyone in law enforcement understands the priority. 
The good news is that the Haitian national police have established a special investigations unit, SIU, to investigate human rights crimes. The bad news is that while I was there in November, my most recent visit, the SIU consisted of one experienced United States police officer and roughly 36 inexperienced Haitians. This has changed somewhat since my visit, since two more U.S. police officers have been added to the force. 
This is one area in which American expertise can make a big difference. Indeed, with some extra United States help, Haiti could succeed in convicting some of the worst defenders, like the murderers of Mireille Bertin and Guy Malary. Mireille Bertin was an anti-Aristide lawyer. Guy Malary was Aristide's justice minister. To prosecute and convict the killers in those kinds of cases would send an unmistakable message to Haitian society: Your chance of getting justice does not depend on what side you are on. 
Mr. President, these reforms will not happen without leadership from the President of Haiti. President Preval needs to push judicial reform and make clear that the period of impunity from the left and from the right is now over. 
These reforms will not take place either, Mr. President, without expertise and without assistance from the United States. The SIU needs the kind of know-how that U.S. law enforcement officials can provide; indeed, they can provide it better than anyone else in the world. 
After my recent visit, I wrote to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and told him that additional U.S. expertise is needed in this area. I am pleased to report that I have received a letter back from Secretary Talbott. He wrote me that two additional Creole-speaking U.S. citizens, U.S. police officers, have been added to the SIU since my last visit, and further, that the FBI has agreed to provide a medical examiner to perform autopsies. Furthermore, he told me that the FBI will visit Haiti with a view toward possibly helping to develop an investigation plan for the SIU.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is my view that this would be a big step forward for the progress of restoring civil society in Haiti. It would help bring high-profile killers to justice and send a powerful message to the people of Haiti that they can count on law and order becoming a reality in the future of their country. 
Let me discuss a broader topic--topic No. 2--the ordinary day-to-day operation of the Haitian police as it deals with run-of-the-mill, nonpolitical crimes, the crimes that most people face the threat of each day. 
The United States has already helped to train 5,000 young recruits as a civilian police force to replace the discredited Haitian military. This task was and remains daunting. Try to imagine, Mr. President, the Washington, DC police force fired 
one day, everyone fired en masse and replaced by kids fresh out of the police academy who are then asked to patrol the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. Or think of any other big city in this country. 
As one would expect, there have been some pretty serious problems with this police force. They are alleged to have killed innocent people. In fact, even Pierre Denize, director general of the Haitian national police has acknowledged these problems. He has a letter in Time magazine that reached the newsstands earlier this week, in which he writes the following:  
I take responsibility for the actions of my subordinates and acknowledge that some HNP members have committed human rights abuses, but the majority of these offenses have been identified through the investigative efforts of HNP officials. The HNP does not condone these acts. In addition, the Haitian Government is working to ensure HNP officers face criminal charges when warranted. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix, as the problems did not originate with the creation of HNP in 1996 but have developed over decades. 
Mr. President, one major problem is that these Haitian recruits lack experience, and they also lack the midlevel support that is essential to successful police work. I personally met with 10 of these United States police officers who are mentoring these young Haitian recruits. These Americans are veterans of big city police departments. They were born in Haiti and speak Creole. They are United States citizens. They have worked in some of the biggest, toughest cities and have great police experience. I found them to be enthusiastic and doing a great job. I was very proud of them. 
But, frankly, Haiti must have more of them. In his letter that I mentioned earlier, Secretary Talbott wrote me that in response to interest on the part of the Haitian Government, there are now 10 more United States officers there, for a total of 32. 
The expectation of law and order is always a prerequisite for a working society, but it is also a prerequisite for a working economy. Therefore, let me turn now to the third major issue I would like to discuss, the state of Haiti's economy, and I have mixed news to report. 
After a decade and a half of negative growth, the Haitian economy is finally beginning to grow, very slowly. But if the Haitians do not move forward, if the Government does not move forward immediately on privatizing their State industries, growth is going to stop. People need to see real economic progress if they are going to support the free market over the long run. 
If Haiti pays lip service to the free market while continuing its dead-or-dying state-run businesses, the prosperity will not be there for the Haitian people, and support for market reforms and support for democracy will erode very quickly. 
The Haitian Parliament has taken a meaningful first step by passing privatization legislation. But legislation is only a first step. To make a difference in national prosperity, privatization has to be real. It has to actually happen. President Preval must move forward quickly and forcefully on privatization. 
Mr. President, another thing that absolutely must happen in Haiti is the fundamental reform of Haiti's corrupt and inefficient ports. And this brings me to my fourth topic. 
My wife Fran and I visited an orphanage in Haiti, at which a nun approached us and told us that her orphanage had been expecting a vitally important x-ray machine. Where was it? She told us it was sitting on the docks for months. Then it was finally stolen. A second replacement x-ray machine, estimated to be worth a great deal of money, sat on the docks for months and months awaiting the payment of a 30-percent tax. 
Mr. President, a few weeks after returning to the United States, I met with Joe Busken in Cincinnati, a private citizen. Mr. Busken has been involved for years with a different orphanage in Haiti. He outfitted a bakery for them and taught them to make highly nutritious bread. I found, in talking to Mr. Busken, that last July--last July--he had shipped flour to that bakery, only to find that flour was also stuck on the docks since July. This was in November when I was talking to him. Once my office became involved, and with the help of the U.S. Embassy and the USAID, the flour and the other orphanage's x-ray machine were finally liberated, but that was 7 months later. 
Mr. President, Haiti is an island. It is therefore very vulnerable to the poor functioning of its ports. On an island such as Haiti, a badly run and corrupt port can become a major chokepoint for imports and also exports. A vibrant assembly sector, for example, cannot hope to grow as long as the port authority exacts a $750-per-container export fee. 
The Inter-American Development Bank, Mr. President, is to spend literally hundreds of millions of dollars to build roads in Haiti. The main purpose of these roads is to allow farmers and others to get goods to the ports for export. But those roads will not do any good if Haiti cannot even get things in or out of the port to begin with. 
Humanitarian aid, Mr. President, is just as vulnerable as are ordinary commercial imports and exports. Because economic reform remains a long-term goal, continued humanitarian aid remains an immediate need that must be met. Many concerned American volunteer groups are sending food and other emergency aid to Haiti. But huge tariff or port entry fees are keeping aid sitting on the docks for months. Food shipments are simply left to rot, discouraging many from even trying. 
Mr. President, here is an example of where American know-how can help. I am glad to report we have made some progress in making the humanitarian-aid train run on schedule. United States Ambassador William Swing has informed me that the Haitian Government has agreed to let assistance from private voluntary organizations, PVO's, who are affiliated with the United States Government enter Haiti without having to pay the 4-percent so-called verification fee. Shipments of food, pharmaceuticals and scholastic materials will be exempt from that verification fee for all PVO's, as well as United States Government agencies shipping aid to Haiti. That, Mr. President, is certainly a step in the right direction. 
Let me now turn to a related humanitarian matter, the current U.S. food-aid policy. That policy is shifting from a general feeding program to one targeted to women and infants. That is a wise step. But, Mr. President, I believe it should be modified so that the children in orphanages and the elderly in institutional care continue to receive this food until there is an alternative feeding program in place. 
In Port-au-Prince, my wife Fran visited an orphanage run by a nun who goes to hospitals to gather as many children as her orphanage will hold. These children who have been abandoned as babies are simply left at the hospital. She now takes care of 50 babies and children, many of whom came to the orphanage horribly malnourished. My wife had the opportunity to see some of these children, and it was a very pitiful sight. 
Mr. President, if the proposed U.S. food-aid policy is left unchanged, it would harm the neediest and most vulnerable patients, such as these babies. USAID is evaluating this policy now. I would urge them to reformulate the policy so that the most vulnerable people, children in orphanages and the elderly in institutions, are not left out. 
Mr. President, there is another topic that I do not intend to address today. That is the issue of Haitian agriculture. Haiti cannot recover--true progress cannot be made--without a viable agricultural sector. But Haitian agriculture has been devastated. Haiti needs to do what it can to help themselves in this particular area. I intend to return to the floor at some future date, Mr. President, to discuss this issue in greater detail than time would permit today. 
Let me conclude by underlying the central fact about today's Haiti. It is an extremely troubled country. The road ahead is uphill, and it is very steep. Turning around two centuries of poverty and misrule is not a task that can be accomplished by Haitians overnight. 
That is why, Mr. President, it is important for Congress and the administration to work out a realistic bipartisan consensus on Haiti. The United States cannot make Haiti an island paradise. Only the people of Haiti can determine their own destiny. But we can help the Haitian people transform their country into one that works, one that exports goods and services, one where the people will come together to escape from their past rather than escaping from their homeland. That is their only hope for a viable future. That is a goal worthy of America's support. 
Mr. President, I will continue to work with the administration, with Members of both parties here in Congress to make sure this goal gets the attention that it needs.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me start by expressing on this floor, as I did this past Monday, my sympathy for the families who have lost loved ones in the last week due to tornadoes, due to flooding and other natural disasters. This has been a very, very tough week. In my home State of Ohio, we are experiencing a flood 
of once in the last 30 or 40 years magnitude--we have not experienced anything like this since the 1960's. Not only is my home State of Ohio experiencing this, but, of course, Kentucky and Indiana is as well. Vice President Gore is, as I speak, in Ohio, having the opportunity to view firsthand the damage. We appreciate his visit. We welcome it. 
We also appreciate the prompt action by President Clinton in designating 14 Ohio counties, to make them eligible for disaster assistance. Governor Voinovich has now made an additional request to the President to add two additional counties, Hamilton County, Cincinnati, as well as Clermont County. Both these counties have been hit exceedingly hard by the flooding. In fact, we have yet to see the high-water mark, which should not occur for a few more hours in Cincinnati and Clermont County, the Richland area--that part of our State. 
We really have an area in Ohio from Monroe County, up river, all the way down to Hamilton County. What we have seen is what we always see during tragedies such as this. We see Americans responding. And, in the midst of the tragedy, the suffering, what we see is neighbors helping neighbors and people out there just making a difference. We have Red Cross volunteers. We have emergency department volunteers. We have fire department volunteers. The National Guard is actively involved. But most of all, we have people who are just volunteers, who are just out there making a difference, who do not necessarily belong to any group except they are Ohioans or Kentuckians or Hoosiers from Indiana, and they are out there making a difference in their local communities. 
So let me pay tribute to them. 
The work that we have at hand is going to continue. Once the spotlight of CNN and the network news goes off Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana and goes off the river communities, the work is going to have to continue. We will have to be hanging in there and doing what we can. 
I appreciate the prompt response of FEMA and the Federal officials who were in Ohio yesterday, traveling with Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister. I appreciate their prompt response and prompt recommendations to the President. I look forward to working with them, as well as working with the local communities, in the weeks and, frankly, months ahead. 
We are seeing not only a tremendous amount of damage, in the millions of dollars, to homes, trailers, people having to be relocated, but we are also seeing an immense damage to the infrastructure of the southern part of the State of Ohio. I don't think any of us know what this is going to amount to. We won't know until the river goes back and things begin to get back to normal before we can assess the full damage. When you look at some of the counties in southern Ohio, there is not a one of them that has the capacity to respond, as far as dollars are concerned. This is something that cannot be budgeted. We, of course, will be looking forward to working with FEMA and other agencies to get assistance in there to those counties.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I had intended to come to the floor today and talk about Haiti, a long way from Ohio. I have had the opportunity to visit Haiti three times in the last 18 months. I have had the opportunity to meet with our Ambassador, to meet with President Preval in Haiti, to meet with our members of the Armed Forces that we still have in Haiti, doing an absolutely fantastic job. One of the nice things about having the opportunity to travel to other countries and to see what is going on is the opportunity to see U.S. troops and to see the tremendous job that they do. It is just one more inspiring thing a Member of Congress can do. 
As I said, I intended to come to the floor today and talk about what I think is important in regard to Haiti. We have invested $2 billion. We have risked U.S. servicemen's lives. We still have United States service men and women in Haiti. Haiti is our neighbor. What happens in Haiti will impact us. Haiti is not of strategic importance to the United States, but Haiti, because of geography, because of historical ties, will continue to have an impact on the United States. 
If we want to search for examples to prove this theory, we don't have to think back too far in recent history when we had thousands of Haitian boat people coming across the sea, and we were faced with the horrible decision of what we do with them--people who were seeking freedom, people who were seeking the opportunity to simply provide food for their families, and we had to deal with that. 
So Haiti, because of its geography, is very important to the United States, will continue to be important, and I intend to come to the floor sometime within the next week to detail what I found on the trips I have made to Haiti and some of the specific recommendations I have. But because of the constraints of time, and I know there are other Members who have expressed a desire to speak, I will, Mr. President, yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the last time we had a balanced budget in this country, as my colleague from Maine has pointed out, was 1969. I happened to be at that time a senior in college. I turned 50 this year. It has been a long time. A lot of things have happened since 1969. The one thing that has not happened is for this Congress and the President to balance the budget. 
It is, frankly, time that we stopped spending our children's money. It is time we stopped spending our grandchildren's money and great-grandchildren's money. We need to balance the budget. Within the next 2 hours, I intend to cast a `yea' vote for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of the people of Ohio, to express our deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have suffered injury and loss of life in this weekend's tornadoes, flooding, and other natural disasters. Our hearts certainly go out to everyone who has suffered, at this time of their need. 
I personally experienced the Xenia tornado of 1974, and I know how awful such devastation can be. When I saw the pictures over the weekend of the homes totally torn apart in Arkansas, I was reminded of what I saw in 1974 in Xenia, OH. I was assistant prosecuting attorney at the time. We heard the tornado was coming and got down in the basement. After the tornado had passed over, I literally crawled out of the basement of the building, what was left of it, and looked at Xenia and saw the unbelievable devastation. So I have some understanding of what the people of Arkansas and the people of other States are going through with regard to these natural disasters. 
Let me talk for a moment about the terrible tragedy that took place in my home State of Ohio this weekend, and what we possibly can do to give assistance. The southern part of our State was ravaged by the worst flooding we have experienced in at least 33 years. At least four people have died so far, and 14 counties are now in a state of emergency. Bridges have been wiped out; houses and cars have been swept away. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families of those who have lost their lives, and to all those who have been evacuated from their homes and all those who face this disaster. 
Along with Senator Glenn and my colleagues from Ohio in the House of Representatives, I will be working with the administration to make sure the Federal Government helps these Ohioans get back to their homes. I am encouraged by President Clinton's swift response with Federal aid for Arkansas, and I encourage him to help Ohioans as well. We will be working to make sure everyone gets home safely as soon as possible. 
Let me also talk about the tremendous job the American Red Cross, the Ohio National Guard, local volunteer groups, local fire departments, and rescue squads are doing in my home State. They have been working this weekend, they are working right now, as we speak. My hat is off to them. I send my congratulations and thanks for the tremendous amount of work they are doing. They are offering a desperately needed helping hand to some families who are having a very, very difficult time. 
My wife Fran and I extend our prayers to all who have been touched in any way by this tragedy. To those who have lost their lives and those who have been forced from their homes, and to their families, I stand ready to work with all Ohioans to help their communities return to normal just as soon as possible.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, at this point let me turn to something I have talked about on this floor on many occasions in the past 2 years, the issue of the banning of partial-birth abortion. 
When the President of the United States justified his veto of the partial-birth abortion bill last year, this is what he said. I will quote now from President Clinton as he vetoed our bill: 
There are a few hundred women every year who have personally agonizing situations where their children are born or about to be born with terrible deformities, which will cause them to die either just before, during or just after childbirth. And these women, among other things, cannot preserve the ability to have further children. . . .' 
That was a quote from the President, when he vetoed the partial-birth abortion bill. 
In light of those remarks by President Clinton, I hope all Americans heard the media reports last week about the shocking confession of a leader in the abortion rights movement. It turns out that in every material detail the President's comments that I have just quoted, the comments he made in defense of his veto, are false. And the confession of this leader in the abortion rights movement, the confession he made last week which I am going to talk about in more detail in just a moment, that confession shows the comments made by our President were simply not true because the fact is, President Clinton based his veto on information that was not true. 
For the last 2 years, a number of us here in the Senate have been trying to ban this horrible practice of partial-birth abortion, a practice in which a baby is partially removed from the mother, partially delivered, and then killed. I believe the horror of this practice is so clear, so heinous, it should truly offer some common ground for those of us who oppose abortion and those who do, in fact, support abortion rights. In my view, one does not have to join the pro-life side in order to oppose this practice. In fact, if you look to some of the Members of the House, for example, who voted with us on this issue, who voted to ban the partial-birth abortion, many of them by their own definition would be classified as pro-choice. 
So, this should be an area where pro-choice and pro-life come together. The sad fact is though, Mr. President, we were not, last year, able to get our bill banning partial-birth abortion past President Clinton's veto pen, in large measure because of the rationale used by the President, which was simply wrong. The American people were assured that partial-birth abortion was an extremely rare procedure--one that occurs only a few hundred times a year--and is only used to save mothers whose lives are in extreme danger or where the child has been malformed. 
Thomas Jefferson had a good phrase for arguments like this. He called them, `false facts.' Because these very impressive sounding arguments, as many of us suspected, turn out to be wrong. 
For those of my colleagues--and there can't be very many by now--who have not heard about the startling revelations by Ron Fitzsimmons, let me talk for a moment about them. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons is the national director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. In 1995, when the Senate was considering the partial-birth abortion bill, he was helping lead the fight against it. In fact, he went on `Nightline' to argue that the procedure ought to remain legal. 
At that time, Mr. Fitzsimmons said that the procedure was rare and was primarily performed to save the lives or the fertility of the mothers. 
Now, as we found out last week, because of Mr. Fitzsimmons' own comments, own revelations, own confession, his conscience started gnawing him almost immediately after he had appeared on `Nightline.' He says now that he felt physically ill at the lies that he had told. He said to his wife the very next day, according to him, `I can't do this again. I can't do this again.' 
Meanwhile, President Clinton was using Mr. Fitzsimmons' false statements to buttress his case for vetoing the partial-birth abortion bill. And, as I said last week, Mr. Fitzsimmons at long last came in from the cold. He admitted that, to use his own words, he `lied through his teeth.'

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I introduce, along with my distinguished colleague Senator Bob Graham, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1997. This legislation will serve as the counterpart to similar legislation that will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Porter Goss. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to offer some measure of relief to families that have suffered serious medical and financial setbacks because of their reliance on the Federal Government's protection of the blood supply. 
In 1995, the Institute of Medicine released the findings of a major investigation into how America's hemophilia community came to be decimated by the HIV virus. 
According to that report, the Federal agencies responsible for blood safety did not show the appropriate level of diligence in screening the blood supply. 
The Federal agencies did not move as quickly as they should have to approve blood products that were potentially safer. 
And the Federal Government did not warn the hemophilia community, when the Government knew--or should have known--that there were legitimate concerns that the blood supply might not be safe. 
The Government's failure caused serious harm to real people--people who were counting on the Government to meet its responsibilities. 
Mr. President, this legislation is about trust. A substantial number of citizens trusted the Government to exercise due vigilance, and the Government let them down. It's only right that the Government try to offer them some measure of relief. 
Mr. President, I recognize the budgetary realities we have to confront. As we move through the process, we will have to address the issue of compensation. I think it's absolutely essential that we begin this process--now.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I wish to announce that today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 1:30 p.m., with the time equally divided between the two leaders. 
At 1:30 today, the Senate will resume consideration of House Joint Resolution 36 regarding U.N. population funding. Following 2 hours of debate on that resolution, the resolution will be temporarily set aside and the Senate will then resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional balanced budget amendment. 
From 3:30 today to 5:30 today, the Senate will debate Senator Byrd's amendment relating to section 6 of the balanced budget amendment. All Senators should be reminded that at 5:30 this afternoon there will be a rollcall vote in relation to the pending Byrd amendment. 
Following that vote this afternoon, Senator Reid will be recognized to offer his amendment regarding Social Security. The Senate will continue debating that amendment tomorrow morning and afternoon, with a vote occurring on or in relation to that amendment at 6 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Also, I remind our colleagues that we will be voting on the U.N. population funding resolution at 2:15 on Tuesday afternoon immediately following the weekly policy conferences. Following the vote on Senator Reid's amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 1, Senator Feinstein will offer an amendment. We will debate that amendment from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Wednesday, with the vote occurring at 11 a.m. on that amendment. 
The majority leader thanks his colleagues for their cooperation in allowing the Senate to move forward on both of these matters. 
I further remind all Senators that the leadership hopes to complete action on the balanced budget amendment as soon as possible, and the leader will continue to update all of us as we make progress on this issue. 
Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a very important milestone in the history of the State of Ohio and in the history of this body on this, the first day the Senate has met since my colleague Senator John Glenn announced that he was retiring from this body. On behalf of the people of Ohio and on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I have the privilege of paying respects to Senator Glenn, to pay respects to my senior Senator, our friend and our colleague, on the occasion of the announcement of his retirement from the U.S. Senate. Senator Glenn has served Ohio and the Senate for a longer consecutive period than any other individual in the history of our State. When he leaves office 2 years from now, he will have served in this body for 24 consecutive years. Over this almost quarter of a century of service, Senator Glenn has established a reputation as a man who knows the importance of details. Senator Glenn realizes that the most important work done in this Chamber is not the sound bites, not the press conferences, but the nitty-gritty of making this complicated legislative process work for the people who sent us here. 
Despite the fact that I have only been in the Senate for a little over 2 years, in many ways I feel I know Senator Glenn better than many who have served with him for a lot longer period of time. This is true, in part at least, I suspect, because he and I fought a very tough campaign against each other in 1992. It was a tough, hard-fought campaign. Let no one doubt--I can say this from personal experience--let no one doubt that behind John Glenn's kind, grandfatherly exterior beats the heart of a true marine, a man who is willing to fight very hard for what he believes is right. That has been something that has really been the hallmark of John Glenn's life of service to this country, from his service in World War II and Korea to his service in the military to his work in the space program to this very day, as he continues his service to this country in the U.S. Senate. 
Two years after that campaign, I was elected to the Senate, and it became important, then, for Senator Glenn and me to build a relationship, to build a relationship to benefit all Ohioans. I think we have done that. In the 2 years since then, I have found that Senator Glenn's attitude to the work of the Senate really should serve as a model for all the rest of us. In a campaign, you fight hard, but when you are in the Senate, when you are one of the 100 Members of the U.S. Senate drawn from all over this country, there is a different kind of work to be done. I have worked with Senator Glenn on the floor, worked with him on different issues, and he has unfailingly put the interests of Ohio and the interests of this country first. 
I am sure we will continue to disagree on some issues, but our disagreements are buried whenever we have a chance to accomplish something for Ohioans by working together. Some may say that Senator Glenn's style of leadership is too bipartisan for modern politics, too bipartisan for this day and age, too bipartisan for this town. If that is true, it is a shame, because the dedication to bipartisanship exemplified by John Glenn, through his service in the Senate, I think should serve as an example for all of us. 
It was significant that Senator Glenn chose the 35th anniversary of his three orbits around the Earth to make his announcement that he was leaving the Senate. 
I think as an Ohioan, it was also significant to see where he made that announcement. He went back home to Muskingum College, New Concord, OH, a town where he had been raised, where he grew up, a town where there is now a high school named after him, the John Glenn High School. He went home to make this announcement to the people of the State of Ohio. 
I think it was also significant that he made the announcement in front of an audience of primarily young people. John Glenn has always been someone who has thought about the future. How many times have we heard him come to the floor and talk about young people, talk about investment in young people, talk about what we have to do to prepare them and us for the next century? So it was significant that he went home to make this speech and significant that he was talking to young people when he did it. 
I was reminded, as I think many Americans were, when I heard the official news that John Glenn was going to retire, where I was 35 years ago--at least those of us who are old enough to remember--when he made that historic flight. My future wife and I were freshmen at Yellow Springs High School, Yellow Springs, OH. On the particular moment that he took off, I happened to be in Ed Wingard's science class and remember listening on the radio, and watching on TV later in the day, as we followed his progress for the next few hours. John Glenn, on that date, captured the hearts of Americans, and he guaranteed his place in the history of this country and the history of this world. 
We took a great deal of pride, those of us from Ohio, in what our native son was doing on that date. It was clear that NASA had selected the right person to make the trip, not just because of his nerves of steel, not just because of his technical ability, but it was also clear why they picked John Glenn when he came back. It was clear that this was a person who young people across the country could look up to, that this was someone who should be considered a national hero and a national treasure. 
We should not talk today as if John Glenn will not be with us. John Glenn is going to be with us for 2 more years in this body. We are going to argue about some things, agree on some things, but John Glenn will continue for the next 2 years to do what he has done throughout his lifetime, and that is serve the people of the State of Ohio and serve this great country that he loves so very much. 
So let me, on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio, again say thank you to John Glenn for his service to his country, for his service to the State of Ohio, and thank him for being a role model for all of us 35 years ago and for continuing to be a role model today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank President Clinton for lending his voice to one of the most important efforts underway in this Congress. On February 14, the President unveiled a proposal that would help provide children with safe homes and loving families, something that every child deserves. This is a victory for America's children, and I believe a victory for good common sense. It recognizes that the safety of our children must always be our most important consideration. 
Mr. President, let no one doubt how important this issue is and why action by this Congress is so necessary. On a number of occasions over the last year, I have come to the floor of the Senate to discuss a provision in Federal law, that has tragedy in it, which has proven dangerous to the safety of America's children. I have on those occasions discussed the fact that too many children are spending their most important, most formative years in a legal limbo, a legal limbo that denies them their chance to be adopted, that denies them what all children should have: the chance to be loved and cared for by parents. 
Mr. President, we are sending too many children back to dangerous and abusive homes. We are sending them back to the custody of people who have already abused them, already tortured them, and we do it, tragically, knowing that that has already taken place. 
The statistics are frightening. Every day in this country, three children actually die of abuse and neglect at the hands of their own parents or caretakers. That is over 1,200 children per year. Almost half of these children--almost half of them--are killed after their tragic circumstances have already come to the attention of local authorities. 
That means 600 children die every year in cases where we, as a society, already know that they have been abused, already know that they may have been tortured, already know that they really should never go back into that home again. 
Mr. President, some of the tragedies in the child welfare system are the unintended consequence of a small part of a law passed by the U.S. Congress in 1980--basically, Mr. President, a good law. Under the Federal Child Welfare Act--the law I am referring to--for a State to be eligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, the State must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services approved by the Secretary of HHS. The State plan must provide--here I quote from statute--`that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home.' 
In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular circumstances of a household may be, a State must make reasonable efforts to keep it together, and to put it back together if it has fallen apart. 
There is strong evidence, Mr. President, strong evidence to suggest that, in practice, reasonable efforts have become extraordinary efforts, efforts to keep families together at all costs, efforts, I might add, to keep families together that are families in name only and to put children back in homes that are homes in name only. 
As a result of this, Mr. President, children have died. That law simply has to be changed. One of my first legislative acts of the Congress was to introduce a bill that would accomplish this. 
My bill would change the law to make it absolutely clear that the best interests of the child have to come first. Pretty basic, pretty simple--best interests of the child, safety of a child. You would not think we would have to clarify that. 
I tell you, Mr. President, based on my experience in talking to judges, prosecutors, in talking to children service advocates, children service caseworkers across the State of Ohio, and from talking to some of my colleagues from other States, and from hearing testimony in our committee, it is abundantly clear to me that we have to spell this out, that it is being misinterpreted, that reasonable efforts to put families back together many times take precedence over the best interests of the child and the safety of the child. 
As I said, Mr. President, my bill would change the law to make it clear that the best interests of the child must come first. We do this by enacting the following simple, straightforward amendment to the Child Welfare Act. And this is what language I would add, not taking anything away, just add this: 
In determining reasonable efforts, the best interests of the child, including the child's health and safety, shall be of primary concern. 
Pretty simple, Mr. President, pretty straightforward, pretty basic, but darn important. 
In November, Mr. President, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on this issue. I assembled 
some of America's chief experts on child welfare. And I was encouraged by what they had to say. 
Peter Digre, the director of Los Angeles County's Department of Children and Family Services--an unbelievably huge department, and a man who has to deal with gut-wrenching problems and decisions every single day of his life--this is what Peter Digre said. He said that `we should emphasize child safety as our first priority.' 
Dr. Digre's department has about 73,000 children under its protection--73,000. He sees the real-life consequence of unreasonable attempts to reunite families that are families in name only. 
But, Mr. President, I believe our most eloquent testimony that day came from Sharon Aulton, a grandmother in Annapolis, MD. Sharon Aulton had warned the local children services that her daughter was neglecting her children, her grandchildren, but the officials failed to intervene. Sharon Aulton's daughter ended up blockading her children in a room and setting the room on fire. Both these beautiful young children died. 
Mr. President, this happens too often in this country. Last August a 4-year-old girl named Nadine was found starved to death in her mother's apartment in New York. The mother had kept Nadine in a crib covered by a blanket so she did not have to see her. She did not feed the child regularly for the year preceding her death. In the last few months before the child's death, she did not seek medical help despite the fact that the child could not walk, could not stand, could not even sit up. 
Apparently, Mr. President, city social workers had visited the apartment in May 1995 after an anonymous complaint about the little girl's treatment. The commissioner of the Administration for Children Services was unable to provide any information as to the conditions found in the apartment or what action was taken at that time by the city. However, the commissioner did say the city investigators found enough credible evidence of neglect to open an investigation after they visited the apartment, but yet the case was closed 5 months later. Nadine only weighed 15 pounds at the time of her death--a week before her 5th birthday. 
Mr. President, I have a daughter who is almost 5, my daughter Anna. Those of us who have children, those of us who care about kids, have to be heartsick and shocked by the recounting of this poor little child's death. According to the ambulance workers, Mr. President, Nadine was found in the crib, dirty, with arms as thin as a half-dollar, her eyes sunken, her hair in patches, her ribs protruding. Her mother at that time, when the emergency folks responded, was sitting on a bed near the crib eating a hot dog. That is how they found the mother when the medics arrived at the home. 
The New York Daily News obtained secret documents which indicate how city child welfare workers and public school officials repeatedly ignored warning signals in Nadine's case. That is from the New York Daily News. 
School officials never turned in Nadine's mother for not showing up for school, nor did anyone report the fact she did not show up for medical appointments. Officials did not notify the State child abuse hotline when Nadine's siblings were out of school for long periods of time. 
In May 1995, the anonymous caller I mentioned earlier reported to the State child abuse hotline that Nadine was, in fact, starving. 
Mr. President, tragically, Nadine is far from alone in falling through the cracks in our system. In December, a 10-month-old girl named Delores died after savagely being beaten by her mother's boyfriend; ten weeks earlier, child welfare officials had been warned that she and her siblings were in danger. 
Mr. President, let me be very clear--I cannot stress enough that I am not trying to lay the blame on children's services officials in these cases. I worked with children services officials for many years, going back in time to when I was an assistant county prosecutor in 1973. These are good people, people who try to do their job. They generally are overworked and have too many cases and have many challenges to face. 
I think it is clear as we look at these cases of abuse, as we recount the fact that we lose at least three kids every day to child abuse in this country--and those are just the kids who die, let alone the other ones who are savagely beaten or abused--I think it is clear that there is one part of this problem that Congress can fix. We cannot fix it all by passing legislation. We can try. But one part of the problem can be fixed, and that is to move forward in fixing, in clarifying the 1980 law that I refer to, to make it clear that we want these professionals, children's service workers, to have the flexibility to do what we all want done, and what they want to do, and that is to save the kids first, save the children, to set as a priority the best interests of the child and the safety of the child, and that priority has to take precedence over everything else. 
These case workers work very hard to meet, many times, conflicting mandates. We should make their job a little easier and say to them that Federal law from now on will be abundantly clear, that the primary mission should always be to save the children.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying once again how pleased I am that the President has joined our efforts. I am confident that his proposal will help us speed up the adoption process in this country and bring us closer to the day when every child in America will be cared for by a loving family. Mr. President, I will continue to come to the floor and talk about this issue until we make that change in Federal law. It is a change that is urgently needed. 
I simply conclude by saying what I have said many times on this floor, and that is that it was never, I am sure, the intent of the authors of the 1980 law--which has done a great deal of good in this country--it was never their intention to in any way tell case workers who are making life and death decisions every day in this country that anything other than the best interests of the child, anything other than the safety of children should be their primary concern. But it is also abundantly clear to me, I have traveled through Ohio and talked to people from other States, that this law is being misinterpreted day after day after day. We should clarify it. We should make the job of a case worker simpler, and by doing that, I believe we will save some children.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor, on a very special occasion, one of the most important figures in the history of education in the State of Ohio. This year, Dr. Phillip R. Shriver will celebrate the 50th anniversary of his career as a teacher. 
Dr. Shriver was born in Cleveland in 1922. When he was 6 years old, his grandfather gave him an Indian spear point, and thus began his lifelong interest in Ohio history. 
He graduated from Yale in 1943, graduating early so he could go and make some history himself as a Navy lieutenant in World War II. 
When Dr. Shriver got back to the United States, he set his sights on his work of a lifetime. Armed with an M.A. from Harvard in 1946, and his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1954, he began teaching history to generation after generation of Ohio students. 
In 1947, Dr. Shriver joined the faculty at Kent State University. In 1965, he became the president of Miami University, greeting in his first incoming class a freshman, myself, and my future wife, Frances Struewing. 
He served as Miami's president for 16 years--all the while continuing to teach. He has also served as president of the Ohio College Association, and as chairman of the Council of Presidents of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. 
Even after his retirement from the presidency of Miami, he continues his mission in the classroom. Dr. Shriver continues to teach. 
It has been said that the past is prologue. Well, I think of the enthusiasm of Dr. Phillip Shriver, as he has made Ohio's past a living reality for countless young men and women, I cannot help thinking that he has done much to shape the future of our State and the lives of its people. 
Mr. President, I join all of his family and friends in congratulating him on a truly historic milestone. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I introduced yesterday legislation to honor the late Carl Stokes. 
Carl Stokes was born on the east side of Cleveland in 1927. He lost his father at the age of 2. When he was young, his family was so poor that Carl, his mother, and his brother Louis--now our distinguished colleague in the House of Representatives--had to sleep in the same bed. 
In 1962, Carl Stokes was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives--the first African-American to serve as a Democrat in our State legislature. 
In 1967, he was elected mayor of Cleveland--the first African-American ever to be elected mayor of a major U.S. city. 
He served two terms as mayor, and in his second term, he became the first African-American to serve as an officer of the National League of Cities. 
Carl Stokes later became a television news anchor in New York City, and a municipal judge in Cleveland. In 1994, President Clinton named him United States Ambassador to the Seychelles. 
The Honorable Carl Stokes had a long and distinguished career before his untimely passing in April of last year. In his eulogy for Mayor Stokes, the Reverend Jesse Jackson called him `a dream maker and an odds buster.' 
That's exactly right. Carl Stokes was a man who made a difference. The people of Ohio will always remember him as a man of great courage and personal character. 
For this reason, I am introducing legislation today to name the new Federal courthouse in Cleveland after this truly honorable man.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I offer my support to the President's nomination of the Honorable John F. Maisto to serve as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Venezuela. Mr. President, it has been my pleasure to know Ambassador Maisto and I have known him as the United States Ambassador to Nicaragua. He has served with great distinction as our United States Ambassador to Nicaragua for the last 4 years, helping that country make its very historic transition to full democracy. 
In fact, Mr. President, I had occasion to be in Nicaragua this past November, and it just happened to be the week that the Ambassador and his wife were leaving after 4 years. I had the opportunity to talk to Nicaraguans clear across the political spectrum. I had the opportunity to talk to Nicaraguans with all kinds of background, Nicaraguans who had many different political beliefs. 
But I found that it was unanimous that our Ambassador had done a fantastic job--a fantastic job of representing our country in a time in Nicaragua's history that was crucial for not only democracy to continue to develop in Nicaragua, but also crucial for our continuing relationship with this country, which we have had such a long relationship with in the past. 
It was very clear to me, after talking to the many Nicaraguans that I saw, that our Ambassador was very well respected and that he had represented us exceedingly well. 
Mr. President, before his posting to Managua, Ambassador Maisto had served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. He also served as Deputy U.S. Representative to the Organization of American States, and Deputy Chief of Mission in the United States Embassy in Panama. 
Mr. President, this is a man whose hands-on experience with Latin America will serve us very well. It has served us in the past and will continue to serve us. Mr. President, the Ambassador will be an outstanding Ambassador to Venezuela, and I urge that his nomination be confirmed. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Wyoming. 
I rise today also to support the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. There is no doubt about the need for a balanced budget. We all agree on the huge benefits that will accrue to America if we put our fiscal house in order. 
To begin with, it would stave off a horrible catastrophe. Mr. President, if we do not establish a balanced budget and if we choose instead to continue on our present course, by the year 2012, the whole budget is going to be eaten up by entitlements and by interest on the national debt. There will be absolutely no money in the domestic discretionary budget for investment in the future of our children--no money, zero. No money for Pell grants, no money for student loans, no money for National Institutes of Health research, none of the things that really are an investment in our children, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren. This alone is good enough reason to balance the budget--to avoid a social and fiscal disaster. 
Mr. President, there will also be a huge positive benefit from a balanced budget. According to the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, a permanently balanced budget could make our country 25 percent richer by the year 2030. That is outstanding news. That's why so many Americans are very happy to see the signals coming out of the budget process that we may be getting close to an agreement on a balanced budget. That would mean a better future for America. It's that simple. We all agree on this. 
But the question we have to ask ourselves now is: Do we need to write this practice of budget balancing into the Constitution of the United States? Some might contend that our recent success at reducing the deficit proves that a constitutional amendment is unnecessary. Some may say and may tell us that if it's not broken, we don't need to fix it. 
Mr. President, that may seem to make sense on the surface, but that argument flies in the face of history. It doesn't make sense when we consider the fact that it has taken the Congress 27 years to make the limited progress we are seeing today--27 years. It took 27 years, Mr. President. The last time the Federal budget was balanced was in 1969. My wife Fran and I were graduating from Miami University in Ohio in 1969. 
So of all the arguments against the constitutional amendment, the argument that it's easy enough to balance the budget is certainly one of the weakest. No, Mr. President, our decision on the balanced budget amendment has to be based on a much more fundamental criteria. Indeed, on a matter of conscience. 
The question all of us have to ask ourselves is simply this: How important is a balanced budget? Does it rise to the level of a constitutional principle? In other words, is it a fundamental component of what we want to be as a nation? This is a question we all have to answer for ourselves, reflecting on our own deepest values, as well as those of the people who sent us here to make the decisions. 
My decision is based on the America I want my children and my grandchildren to inherit a nation bound by its fundamental law to pay its bills on time, to avoid pulverizing future generations with a towering national debt; in simple terms, Mr. President, an America that says no longer are we going to borrow from our children and grandchildren so we can live better today. 
In my view, Mr. President, that is as close to a bedrock principle as we can find in political life. I believe it must be in the Constitution. I believe history tells us that it has to be in the Constitution. That is why I believe, for my family, for the people of the State of Ohio and future generations, as well as the present generation, we must pass the constitutional amendment and send it out to the States. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, there are two truly fundamental issues we need to address in the area of crime. First, what is the proper role of the Federal Government in fighting crime in this country? Second, despite all the rhetoric, what really works in law enforcement? 
What matters? What doesn't matter? 
Today, I would like to discuss one issue that I believe really matters: How do we go about protecting America from armed career criminals? 
I am talking about repeat violent criminals who use a gun while committing a crime. 
In this area, too, we need to be asking: What works? And what level of Government should do it? 
In the area of gun crimes, we have a pretty good answer. 
We all know that there is some controversy over whether general restrictions on gun ownership would help to reduce crime. But there is no controversy over whether taking guns away from felons would reduce crime. 
There is legitimate disagreement over whether the Brady bill would reduce crime. Similarly, reasonable people can disagree on the question of whether a ban on assault weapons would reduce crime. I happen to support both those measures--but I recognize that some people think they are not effective. 
But what I am talking about today is something on which there is absolutely no controversy. There's simply no question that taking the guns away from armed career criminals will reduce crime. 
No question, Mr. President. When it comes to felons, unilateral disarmament of the thugs is the best policy. Let's disarm the people who hurt people. 
We have actually tried it--and we know it works. One of the most successful crime-fighting initiatives of recent years was known as Project Triggerlock. This project was wildly successful precisely because it addresses a problem squarely--and places the resources where they are most needed. 
Let me tell you a little about project Triggerlock. The U.S. Justice Department began Project Triggerlock in May 1991. The program targeted for prosecution--in Federal court--armed and violent repeat offenders. 
Under Triggerlock, U.S. Attorneys throughout the country said to State and local prosecutors: If you catch a felon with a gun, and if you want us to, we--the Federal prosecutors--will take over the prosecution. 
We will prosecute him. We will convict him. We will hit him with a stiff Federal mandatory sentence. And we will lock him up in a Federal prison at no cost to the State or local community. 
That's what Triggerlock did. Triggerlock was an assault on the very worst criminals in America. And it worked. 
This program took 15,000 criminals off the streets in an 18-month period. 
Incredibly, the Clinton Justice Department abandoned Project Triggerlock. It was the most effective Federal program in recent history for targeting and removing armed career criminals. But the Justice Department stopped Triggerlock dead in its tracks. 
What I am proposing in this bill is that we resurrect Project Triggerlock. 
My bill requires the U.S. attorneys in every jurisdiction in this country to make a montly report to the Attorney General in Washington on the number of arrests, prosecutions, and convictions they have gotten on gun-related offenses. The Attorney General should then report, semi-annually, to the Congress on the work of these prosecutors. 
Like all prosecutors, U.S. attorneys have limited resources. So--like all prosecutors--U.S. attorneys have to exercise discretion about whom to prosecute. We all recognize the Congress can't dictate to prosecutors whom they should prosecute--but it's clear that we should go on record with the following proposition: There's nothing more important than getting armed career criminals off the streets. 
Mr. President, I think Project Triggerlock is a very important way to keep the focus on the prosecution of gun crimes. Getting gun criminals off the streets is a major national priority--and we ought to behave accordingly.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I believe that, to stop crime, we have to do more. That doesn't mean another rhetorical assault on crime--or even a flashy ten-point program. Rather, we have to do more of the little things that--when you put them all together--make a big difference. 
The most important of these is giving law enforcement officials the tools they need to do their jobs. Today, I am introducing legislation that will help us do that. 
The bill I am introducing today would simply rectify an imbalance in current Federal law which makes it more difficult for law enforcement officials to fight drug trafficking. Today, drug traffickers have taken advantage of technological advances to advance their own criminal interests. 
Drug traffickers--on a regular basis--use digital display paging devices, better known as beepers--in transacting their business. They do this because it gives them the freedom to run their criminal enterprise out of any available phone booth, and to avoid police surveillance. If law enforcement officials knew from whom they were receiving the calls to their beepers it would certainly aid efforts in tracking down drug traffickers. 
The technology now exists to allow law enforcement to receive the digital display message, without intercepting the content of any conversation or message. It is called a `clone pager.' This clone pager is programmed identically to the suspect's pager and allows law enforcement to receive the digital displays at the same time as the suspect. 
This device functions identically to a pen register. Mr. President, as you may know, a pen register is a device which law enforcement attaches to a phone line to decode the numbers which have called a specific telephone. Like a clone pager, the pen register only intercepts phone numbers, not the content of any conversation or message. 
Since both devices serve the same purpose, a reasonable person would conclude that both the system for receiving authorization to use these devices, and the procedures mandated by the courts once the authorization was granted would be the same. However, in both cases it is not. 
Under current law, the requirements for obtaining authorization to use a clone pager are much more stringent than they are for using a pen register. I would like to briefly outline the differences. 
In order to obtain authorization to use a pen register, a Federal prosecutor must certify to a district court judge the phone number to which the pen register will be attached, the phone company that delivers service to that number, and that the pen register serves a legitimate law enforcement purpose. In other words, the prosecutor must show only that the use of the pen register is based on an ongoing investigation. The district court judge may then grant the authorization on a mere finding that the prosecutor has made the required certification. The pen register can then be used for a period of 60 days--with no requirement that law enforcement report pen register activity to the court. 
In contrast, the U.S. Attorney for a particular district must sign off on a request for clone pager authorization. Once this occurs, a prosecutor may then go before a district court judge where he must show that there is probable cause to suspect an individual has committed a crime--a much higher standard than what is required for a pen register authorization. He must also detail what other investigative techniques have been used, why they have not been successful, and why they will continue to be unsuccessful. Moreover, the prosecutor must disclose other available investigative techniques and why they are unlikely to be successful. Only after all of this is done can authorization to use a clone pager be granted. 
But these are not the only differences in treatment. After the authorization is granted, it can only be used for 30 days. During that 30 days, the prosecutor must report activity from the clone pager to the issuing judge at least once every 2 weeks. 
I do not believe that the authorization disparity in authorization for these two devices is warranted. 
The legislation that I am introducing today would simply amend the Federal code to end this disparity. This bill would give law enforcement agents ready access, with warranted limitations, to the tools they need to do their jobs. This bill will bring Federal law enforcement into the 21st century. The drug traffickers are already there. It's time for law and order to catch up with them.

Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will give law enforcement officers a tool they need to their jobs--protecting American families. It would establish, for the first time in the Federal Criminal Code, a general attempt provision. Thankfully, criminals to not succeed every time they set out to commit a crime. We need to take advantage of these failed crimes to get criminals off the streets. 
Mr. President, under current Federal law, there is no general attempt provision applicable to all Federal offenses. This has forced Congress to enact separate legislation to cover specific circumstances. This approach to the law has led to a patchwork of attempt statutes--leaving gaps in coverage, and failing to adequately define exactly what constitutes an attempt in all circumstances. 
Some statutes include attempt language within the substantive offense, but don't bother to define exactly what an attempt is. Others define, as a separate crime, conduct which is only a step toward commission of a more serious offense. Moreover, there is no offense of attempt for still other serious crimes, such as disclosing classified information to an unauthorized person. 
This ad hoc approach to attempt statutes is causing problems for law enforcement officials. At what point is it OK for law enforcement officials to step in to prevent the completion of a crime? If someone is seriously dedicated to committing a crime, law enforcement must be able to intervene and prevent it--without having to worry whether doing so would cause a criminal to walk. In the absence of a statutory definition of an attempt, the courts have been called upon to decide whether specific actions fit within existing statutory language. 
When a criminal is attempting to commit a crime where attempt is not an offense, then law enforcement must wait until the crime is completed, or find some other charge to fit the criminal's actions. Law enforcement should never be placed in either of these positions. 
The bill that I am introducing today will solve these problems in the current law. As I mentioned earlier, this legislation will add a general attempt provision to the U.S. Criminal Code. It provides congressional direction in defining what constitutes an attempt in all circumstances. And, it will serve to fill in the irrational gaps in attempt coverage. 
In my view, it's time for the American people--acting through the Congress--to clarify their intention when it comes to this area of the law. 
Millions of Americans work hard every day to make ends meet and raise their families and provide a better life for their children. 
But, there are some people who choose a different approach to life--a life of crime. We as Americans need to leave no doubt where we stand on that choice. If you even try to commit a crime, we're going to prosecute you and convict you. This bill will make it easier for our law enforcement officers to protect our families and our communities.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, there are shortcomings in the Code of Military Law that have terrible repercussions in the streets of civilian America. These failures of the military judicial system too often result in military criminals being pushed out of the service and into our civilian streets--where these criminals continue to behave as lawless predators. This bill closes two such gaps in the Military Code and ensures that the enlisted criminal is not pushed out to prey on decent citizens. This bill protects civilians from military personnel who have committed crimes, just as the Military protects itself from those same people. 
My bill addresses an important gap in the law. Under current law, many illegal acts committed abroad by U.S. soldiers or accompanying civilians go unpunished by the military courts. The prosecution of these crimes is left to the discretion of a military court, which either chooses to do no more than hand down a dishonorable discharge or lacks jurisdiction over the civilian defendant. This should not be the case. 
This bill guarantees that a soldier or accompanying civilian abroad, committing an illegal act punishable under the United States Code by more than a year's imprisonment, will be handed over to civilian authorities for prosecution under the United States Code. 
There is another aspect of this bill intended to protect civilian Americans from the actions of those who commit crimes while in the military. This bill also mandates that when an enlisted criminal is discharged from the service, the military Secretary will turn over to the FBI all the criminal records of that soldier for inclusion in the FBI criminal records system. Again, Mr. President, this is another way to protect the tax-paying, law-abiding American from dishonorably discharged criminals. Under current law, the criminal histories of these military personnel do not become part of the National Crime Information Center database. This bill will ensure that they do.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Private Security Officer Assurance Act of 1997. This bill establishes an expedited procedure for State regulators or private security officers to obtain criminal records background checks through the FBI prior to issuing state permits to security officers. Currently, it frequently takes between 6 to 18 months to complete such checks. 
My bill would authorize the Attorney General to designate an association of employers of security officers to collect signature cards from applicants and forward them to the FBI for a comparison against the Federal criminal history records on file. The records would then be forwarded to the appropriate State regulators who would decide the qualification of the applicants for permits based on State laws. Under this bill, the applicant would pay fees to compensate for the cost of the background checks. No criminal history information would go to the employer. 
I would note that Congress has established similar procedures for banks, the parimutuel industry and the financial securities industry. The process that I described takes about 3 weeks for these industries. 
Mr. President, I believe this bill will help improve public safety by ensuring the integrity of those hired as security officers.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will designate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield, Fort Meigs, and Fort Miamis as National Historic Sites. 
Mr. President, the people of northwest Ohio are committed to preserving the historic heritage of the United States and the State of Ohio, as well as that of their own community. 
The truly national significance of the Battle of Fallen Timbers and Fort Meigs have been acknowledged already. In 1960, Fallen Timbers was designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1969, Fort Meigs received this designation. 
The Battle of Fallen Timbers is acknowledged by the National Park Service as a culminating event in the history of the struggle for dominance in the old Northwest Territory. 
Fort Meigs is recognized by the National Park Service as `the zenith of the British advance in the west as well as the maximum effort by Native forces under the Shawnee, Tecumseh, during the War of 1812.' 
Fort Miamis, which was attacked twice without success by British troops, led by General Henry Proctor, in the spring of 1813, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Recently, the National Park Service completed a special resource study examining the proposed National Historic Site designation and the suitability of these sites for inclusion in the National Park System. 
The Park Service concluded that these sites were suitable for inclusion in the National Park System--with non-Federal management and National Park Service assistance. The bill I am introducing today would act on that recommendation. 
My legislation will accomplish the following: 
Recognize and preserve the 185-acre Fallen Timbers Battlefield site; 
Formalize the linkage between the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Monument to Fort Meigs and Fort Miamis; 
Preserve and interpret U.S. military history and Native American culture during the period from 1794 through 1813; and, 
Provide technical assistance to the State of Ohio as well as interested community and historical groups in the development and implementation of programming and interpretation of the three sites. 
However, my legislation will not require the Federal Government to provide direct funding to these three sites. That responsibility remains with--and is welcomed by--the many individuals, community groups, elected officials, and others who deserve recognition for their many hours of hard work dedicated to this issue. 
Mr. President, we have entered an era where the responsibility and the drive behind the management, programming, and--in many cases--the funding for historic preservation is the responsibility of local community groups, local elected officials, and local business communities. 
This legislation to designate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield, Fort Meigs, and Fort Miamis as National Historic Sites represents just such an effort. In my opinion, it is long overdue. 
Mr. President, it is time to grant these truly historic areas the measure of respect and recognition they deserve. I agree with the National Park Service--and the people of Ohio--on this issue. That is why I am proposing this important legislation today.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in 1980, Congress passed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, known as CWA. The 1980 Act has done a great deal of good. It increased the resources available to struggling families. It increased the supervision of children in the foster care system. And it gave financial support to people to encourage them to adopt children with special needs. 
But while the law has done a great deal of good, many experts are coming to believe that this law has actually had some bad unintended consequences. 
Under the 1980 Act, for a state to be eligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, the state must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services approved by the Secretary of HHS and this State plan must provide, and I quote: that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home. 
In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular circumstances of a household may be the state must make reasonable efforts to keep it together, and to put it back together if it falls apart. 
What constitutes reasonable efforts? How far does the State have to go? 
This has not been defined by Congress. Nor has it been defined by HHS. 
This failure to define what constitutes `reasonable efforts' has had a very important--and very damaging--practical result. There is strong evidence to suggest that in the absence of a definition, reasonable efforts have become in some cases extraordinary efforts. Efforts to keep families together at all costs. 
Mr. President, during the past year, I have traveled throughout the state of Ohio, talking to social work professionals. In these discussions I have found that there is great disparity in how the law is being interpreted by judges and social workers. 
Let me give you an example. I posed this hypothetical to representatives of children's services in both rural and urban counties. 
Mary is a 28-year-old crack-addicted mother who has seven children. Steve, the 29-year-old father of the children, is an abusive alcoholic, and all seven of the children have been taken away--permanently--by the county. 
Now, Mary gives birth to an eighth child, little Peggy. The newborn Peggy tests positive for crack. Therefore, it is obvious that her mother is still addicted to crack. Steve, the father, is still an alcoholic. 
Pretend for a moment that you work for the county children's services department. Does the law allow you to get the new baby out of the household? And if you do, should you file for permanent custody so that the baby can be adopted? 
The answer will surprise you. In fact, I was surprised at the response I got when I asked a number of Ohio social work professionals that very same question. The answer varied from county to county, but I heard too much `no' in the answers I got. Some officials said they could apply for emergency custody of the baby and take her away on a temporary basis, but they would have to make a continued effort to send the baby back to her mother! 
Other social workers said that if they went to court to get custody of the baby, they probably wouldn't be able to get even temporary custody of her. In one county, I was told it would be two years before the baby could be made available for adoption. Another county said it would be five years. 
One social worker--just one, out of all the ones I asked--told me that her department would move immediately for permanent custody of the baby. But she said that their success would still depend on the judge assigned to the case. 
Should our Federal law really push the envelope, so that extraordinary efforts are made to keep that family together--efforts that any of us would not consider reasonable? 
It is clear after 17 years of experience with this law that there is a great deal of confusion as to how the act applies. 
My legislation would clarify, once and for all, the intent of Congress in the 1980 Act. My legislation would amend that language in the following way: `In determining reasonable efforts, the best interests of the child, including the child's health and safety, shall be of primary concern.' 
The 1980 Act was a good bill. There are some families that need a little help if they are going to stay together, and it's right for us to help them. That's what the Child Welfare Act did. 
But by now it should be equally clear that the framers of the 1980 Act did not intend for extraordinary efforts to be made to reunite children with their abusers. As Peter Digre, the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, testified at a hearing last year before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources: `[W]e cannot ignore the fact that at least 22% of the time infants who are reunified with their families are subjected to new episodes of abuse, neglect, or endangerment.' 
That was not the intention of Congress in the 1980 law. But too often, that law is being misinterpreted in a way that is trapping these children in abusive households. 
I believe we should leave no doubt about the will of the American people on this issue affecting the lives of America's children. The legislation I am proposing today would put the children first.
