 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the beginning of the 105th congressional session, a close friend of mine, Gene Callahan, retired and moved back to our home state of Illinois. Prior to Gene's retirement, he served as the director of government relations for Major League Baseball here in Washington, DC. Many of you may remember Gene as former U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon's (IL) chief of staff. Gene and I have been in politics for many years beginning with the Illinois Democratic Party and working with my predecessor here in the Senate, former U.S. Senator Paul Simon when Senator Simon was the Illinois Lt. Governor, some thirty years ago. 
Gene loves the game of baseball so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to wish my dear friends, Gene and Ann Callahan, the best. I thought it fitting that the Callahans return to the great state of Illinois during this exciting baseball season and the home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. In fact, Gene and Ann's son, Dan, is the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. I know firsthand, that Gene will stay involved with baseball, and rest assured, I will call on him for political advice from time to time. 
As the baseball season draws to a close with the World Series, I want to thank everyone connected with Major League Baseball for a great summer. The home run chase with McGwire and Sosa was a baseball fan's dream. It brought a sense of what's good about America to the forefront. America can't wait for spring training!

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the distinguished Senator from Michigan for all of his hard work on the H1B visa program. I voted against passage of this measure in the Senate in the spring but today am happy to have it included in the omnibus. This is due to the incredible efforts of Senator Abraham. This is a well-balanced measure that addresses the needs of the business community while protecting the well-being of American workers. One of the most impressive accomplishments in this proposal is that it attempts to meet a short-term labor shortfall while instituting a program to ensure a long-term labor supply. The bill creates a new program of grants to provide technical skills training for workers. 
This bill contains provisions to ensure that Americans will not be harmed by this legislation. A $500 fee paid by businesses wishing to participate in the H1B program will raise approximately $75 million annually to be split between a scholarship program for underprivileged high school students studying mathematics, computer science, or engineering and funding for job training programs which focus on information technology. 
One project that I hope would be supported under this new program is the DePaul University High-Tech Workforce Pilot Program in Chicago. It was developed in conjunction with Chicago companies and local government with the goal of preparing America's workforce to compete in the dynamic high-tech industry. It has also been developed to be a model that can be replicated by other universities and cities. I believe that DePaul's training, retraining and education program will expand America's skilled labor force. 
Let me again congratulate, Senator Abraham for his success and hard work.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address this piece of legislation which is being talked about on the floor. Millions of people come to Washington, DC, every year to see the sights of Washington. One of the most impressive is a trip to the Archives. Go to the Archives and see the glass cases. In those cases you will find the Constitution of the United States in its original form and the Declaration of Independence. Schoolchildren remember that for a lifetime. They have seen a document that is historic. 
I might say to my colleagues in the Senate, I have just seen a document that is historic. Not 50 feet away from where I stand, in room 224, sits a document of 4,000 pages; some 25 pounds of paper that comprise this omnibus legislation we are talking about, a measure rarely seen by anyone. 
Is it important? A third of the Federal budget is in that document in that room, and most of the Members of the Senate, aside from a glance walking through, will not see anything else in the document. If we are quizzed as to what is in the measure, we are hoping that our staff or someone else has read it because, frankly, we have not. 
How did we get in this predicament? How are we here, on October 20, at the tail end of a misspent life, wondering why this Senate and this Congress were so unproductive during the 105th Congress? Some want to blame the President. But I remind those who do to take a look at the Constitution, because the Constitution has established three branches of Government, each with a responsibility. In this case, our responsibility was, on April 15, to pass a budget resolution, a resolution which was to be basically a blueprint for all spending by the Appropriations Committee. 
I see the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, here. I have served on the House Appropriations Committee, and I know that budget resolution is your guide, your roadmap, for determining how much each department can be given in money. Does the President write the budget resolution? No. It is passed by the House, then the Senate. It is enacted by them as a resolution and not a law. The President doesn't even sign it. 
What happened this year? We never passed a budget resolution. For the first time in 25 years we failed to pass a budget resolution. Was it the President's fault? Not at all. It was the fault of the House and the Senate. You see, the Senate passed its version of the budget resolution. When it went over to the House, they said, `We think the surplus is so invigorating we want to give away $800 billion in tax cuts.' Luckily, some Republican Senators--Democrats as well--said that is irresponsible and stopped it in its tracks, and that was the end of the discussion. 
Then everything started piling up. We did not pass a budget resolution. We did not pass seven appropriations bills. In fact, you would need a bloodhound and a flashlight to find anything that we have done in the past year that we have been in session--with the exception of renaming Washington National Airport after President Reagan. 
Here we are, 3 weeks into this new fiscal year, without a budget resolution trying to play catchup. We are fearful of another Government shutdown, because Congress has failed to meet its responsibility, and we are moving to try, in one vote in the House today and the Senate tomorrow, to correct the mistakes of a year with one bill: 4,000 pages, 25 pounds of documentation. 
This Congress has failed to pass campaign finance reform, a bipartisan measure supported by the President--killed on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This Congress has failed to pass any effort to stop the tobacco companies from luring our children into addiction--another bipartisan effort, killed on the floor of the Senate. This Congress has failed to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, reform of managed care so that all of us as patients have some rights to quality care when we go to see a doctor or to a hospital--killed on the floor of the Senate. We have failed to do anything to preserve the Social Security system beyond the year 2030, even though we have the wherewithal in this surplus to start speaking in specific terms about doing that. We have failed to pass the legislation proposed by my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, to invest in 5,000 new and repaired schools across America to try to address the onslaught of children who will be coming into school, increasing the school population of our Nation and making certain that current schools have the technology to be able to teach our children as they should. We did not address that, either. 
Literally in the closing days of negotiations, President Clinton came to the negotiators, to the Republican leaders, and said: This Congress will not leave town without doing at least one thing, one thing for education, but an important thing--reducing, on a nationwide basis, class size in grades kindergarten through 3 to no more than 18 students in a classroom. That is what the 100,000 teachers are about, so we have enough teachers so kids have the kind of attention they need at the earliest time in their educational development. 
I happen to think that is one of the most important things we could do in our Nation. My wife and I raised three children. We are watching a little grandson grow up right now. You come to realize what early childhood development means. The biggest growth industry in America today is the construction of prisons. How many of those prisoners might have had a different life if they got off to a better start? 
That better start could have been a better classroom experience, a better education. 
When I asked the warden of a prison in Illinois recently about how many of the inmates there came to prison even close to any level of competency in education, he said fewer than half. Most people who show up in prison have little or no educational skills. It is part of their frustration. I won't make that as an excuse for committing a crime, but certainly you can understand the frustration and waste involved when we don't use education well. 
President Clinton said to the negotiators, `You won't leave town, you won't put together this bill unless and until you include at least one initiative for education in America.' He pushed hard for it. He achieved it. 
I am happy there is more money for Head Start. That is an excellent investment. 
There is more money as well for the National Institutes of Health. On a bipartisan basis, we are increasing medical research by 14 percent--a smart thing to do. 
The health insurance deduction for the self-employed is accelerated so they can be treated fairly, so small businesses and farmers get a fair share. 
And there is agriculture relief which, to those of us in the Midwest, means a lot. In Illinois, the Dakotas, Minnesota, all across the Midwest, we face a crisis. Luckily, with the President's leadership, we increase the money in this bill to take care of it. 
There are other things as well--food safety initiatives, which I support, and funding the IMF. 
But there are things we failed to do. Can you believe we are still in a deadbeat status, the United States of America, when it comes to paying our United Nations dues? We were a few million dollars away from being disqualified in voting in the Security Council because we continue to stiff the United Nations year after year after year, an agency which we turn to, as President Bush did with the Persian Gulf war, as we do on a frequent basis, to try to promote peace in the world and to promote the goals of our foreign policy. 
This Congress refuses to pay our dues. It is an embarrassment. We are a nation which calls on the world to meet its moral responsibilities, and yet we don't meet our moral responsibility in paying these dues. That is a disgrace, as far as I am concerned. 
There are going to be things in this 4,000-page bill--I just learned of one. My friend, Senator Barbara Boxer, got on the floor with me--and Senator Wellstone remembers the debate --and we talked about all the oil companies drilling for oil on publicly owned land, land owned by the taxpayers, and refusing to pay us a fair rental based on the cost of the oil. 
We basically said to the Department of the Interior: Adjust that rate; make sure the taxpayers don't get cheated on this oil. 
Guess what? A provision in this 4,000-page bill will cost the taxpayers 60 million bucks a year so these oil companies can continue to drill on our land that we own as a nation and refuse to pay a fair amount for drilling for that oil. Sound like welfare to anybody? Sounds like welfare to me, and it is in this bill. It is corporate welfare for a handful of the biggest oil companies, and it is shameful. 
There are people who take the television stage and go on the shows and talk about, Where is the sense of outrage in America? Good question. They want to address that question as to one person. I want to address it as to one bill of 4,000 pages. There should be a sense of outrage that this bill was promulgated in darkness, behind closed doors that literally no one has read, that includes gifts like the $60-million-a-year gift to the oil industry, and God knows what else. And here we are. 
I said to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, `If we don't need a budget resolution, why do we need a Budget Committee?' Maybe we can start by saving money in the 106th Congress by eliminating the Budget Committee. We didn't need it this year because whatever we did certainly wasn't useful. It didn't produce a budget resolution which was so important for all of us. 
There are provisions in here as well that touch people where they live: the whole question, for example, of home health care interim payments. There is a lot of concern, because so many seniors and disabled people rely on home health care. The current system needs to be changed. I will tell you, the so-called `fix' in this bill is no fix at all. We will have to revisit it. It is another failure of the 105th Congress, and that is troublesome to me and, I hope, to a lot of others. 
Then, of course, we have this doomsday scenario in the bill which cuts off the spending for the Commerce Department, the State Department, the Justice Department and the judicial branch of Government as of June 15 of next year. So even with the 4,000-page bill, we are not appropriating enough money to fund those agencies for a year. 
We are postponing, again, facing the reality of what needs to be done in this Nation. All of us who are elected to the House and Senate are entrusted with the responsibility to enforce and live by the Constitution and to meet the obligations of this country. This 105th Congress has failed to do that. The fact that we are even here on October 20, the fact that we are considering this mystery bill of 4,000 pages, still unread by most, the fact that we don't know what is included, we don't know what favors have been given to special interest groups or individuals and the fact that we are going to vote on this almost blindly within the next 24 hours is testimony to the fact that this Congress has accomplished little or nothing. 
When the American people are asked, What did this Congress do this year, what did it achieve? they are at a loss for words.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset to my friend from North Dakota, whom I served with in the House of Representatives, he has been not only our floor manager of debate during the course of this 105th Congress, but he has also been an active leader for his State. The leadership he showed along with Senator Conrad, as well as Senators Daschle and 
Johnson of South Dakota, during the crisis that faced their States earlier when they dealt with floods and fires--it seems like all the furies at once--was the type of leadership that is extraordinary, and I thank him for that. 
I know we are going to have even more discussion in the days ahead about the current agricultural crisis in his State. I see his colleague, Senator Conrad, on the floor and I know that they are going to carefully monitor the debate going on now about an omnibus spending bill to try to do their best to help struggling farmers in their State--and, I add, in my State of Illinois, which has its own share of difficulties. 
I have brought to the floor here a volume, which those of us in the Senate know very well, and perhaps those in the gallery may recognize, and those at home may find new. It is `The History of the U.S. Senate' compiled by one of our colleagues here, Senator Robert Byrd. He is the preeminent Senate historian. He has written this history to try to capture what the Senate means and what it has meant to the United States. I have seen it several times, and I have read portions of it. I am determined that I am going to finish it from cover to cover soon. I looked through it to try to remember if there was another Senate that you could point to that was parallel to what we are seeing here today. 
This is the conclusion of my first 2 years in the U.S. Senate, representing my home State of Illinois. Prior to that, I served for 14 years in the House of Representatives. I am no stranger to Capitol Hill, but I am a newcomer to this body. I am surprised that I stand here today on October 12, some 12 days into the new fiscal year, and say that we are still here. We were supposed to be gone, supposed to have finished our work and gone home. Unfortunately, we have not. 
As the Senator from North Dakota indicated, there is a great deal still being debated. The size and scope of this debate is mind-boggling--that we would be talking at this moment about still having unresolved questions concerning about a third to a half of the Federal budget that we appropriate. 
How can we be in on October 12 still talking about these things? It is because several things have occurred, which are not historic and not in a positive way. This Congress, this House and this Senate, under Republican leadership, failed to pass a budget resolution for the first time in 24 years. So what? Well, the budget resolution is supposed to be the game plan--not the President's game plan, but Congress' game plan--of how we will spend money and reach certain budgetary goals, as well as policy goals. 
I can recall, in the 16 years I have been on the Hill, that there were long and arduous and heated debates about our goals. We would get them out of the way and pass the budget resolution, usually around the date it was due, which is April 15. Does that date ring a bell with people in the gallery? We all meet our obligation to pay our taxes on April 15. Congress was supposed to meet its obligation to pass a budget resolution by April 15, but it failed. It has now failed for almost 6 months. 
A great deal of blame has been assigned to the President for this mess that we are in today in the 105th Congress. But any honest appraisal suggests that the President had nothing to do with the budget resolution. That was Congress' responsibility. The President doesn't even sign it. It is a resolution, not a law. The House passes it, the Senate passes another, they come to conference and agree, and then set out to spend the money. And they never could agree. The Republican House and the Republican Senate could not reach an agreement between them, and here we are today. That is unfortunate. Eight to ten of our appropriations bills have not been passed. 
We are still working on theories and concepts when we should be wrapping things up and going home. We are going to pass stopgap spending measures to try to keep the Government going while we reach an agreement that should have started back on April 15. 
I would like to address a couple of specific issues which this 105th Congress has failed to address as well, not just the budget but other issues equally important. 
Earlier this afternoon, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts spoke to education issues, as did Senator Gramm of Texas, and, to no one's surprise, there is a big difference of opinion about what we should do, if anything, about education. I, frankly, think that we have a responsibility at the Federal level. Certainly, the vast resources invested in education come from State and local sources, but we invest some 6 to 7 percent at the Federal level for programs like title I. If your child is falling behind in the classroom, specialized tutoring is available through that Federal program and programs that are designed for disabled children. If you have a child who has a learning disability, a physical disability, some mental handicap, they may have a chance to come to a regular school and a classroom because of the Federal program. Vocational education, a critically important element, is one that I think we all understand is important for a lot of students who will never need to get a college degree but need a good job. 
Federal expenditures--college loans, I wouldn't be standing here today without one. Frankly, I think that it is a good investment for all Americans. Yet, there are those who question whether or not there should even be a Department of Education. 
In the senate debate in Illinois, the Republican candidate has said that he can't find the word `education' in the Constitution. He uses that for an argument that perhaps the Federal Government shouldn't be involved in it. I see it differently. I think the preamble to the Constitution about promoting the general welfare of America necessarily includes looking at education. 
Think about the turn of the last century, from the 19th century to the 20th. And think about this for a moment. Between 1890 and 1910, in that 20-year period of time, on average in America we built one new high school every day for 20 years. What was going on? Was it a building by a Federal program? No. But it was a decision by States and localities that they were going to democratize education. So at the turn of the century, 10 percent of kids graduated from high school. By the 1930s, it was 30 percent. And now it is up over 90 percent. We have democratized education. What do we have to show for it? 
Think about the comments of the Senator from North Dakota. Think about the dramatic progress we have made. Think about Orville and Wilbur Wright, and Neil Armstrong, to the return of John Glenn from space. Incidentally, this is his desk right here--a man who serves in the Senate now, and on October 29 he will be launched into space again. We are all so excited about that prospect. But the fact that there is a space program and that we have come so far has a lot to do with education. 
What will we do in the next century in terms of our investment in education? Will we step back and hope things will work out for the best, or will we show initiative? 
President Clinton in his State of the Union Address in January of this year suggested an initiative that I think is a sensible one--100,000 new teachers. Can it make a difference? You bet it can. And 100,000 new cops across America has made a difference in communities from Cairo to Chicago in my home State of Illinois. And 100,000 new teachers would mean reducing class size until we can say that in K through 3, your child in the classroom will have no more than 17 classmates in the room. Ask any schoolteacher what the difference is between having 18 first graders and 30 first graders. It is dramatic. 
A teacher spoke the other day here in the Capitol and said, `There are days in my classroom of 30 kids when I don't get a chance to speak to each individual child in the course of the day.' She says, `I go home at night saddened because I have never really believed that you can educate a child unless you can connect personally.' 
President Clinton says 100,000 new teachers. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have not honored that. Now it is a subject of debate. 
The President suggested in his State of the Union Address reducing class sizes for the lower grades. I honestly believe that if we want to graduate quality high school graduates, quality college graduates, you have to start at the beginning--childhood development, K through 3, the basics, reading and writing and spelling so that kids get a good start. 
That is the President's program. That is one of the things we are debating. It is one of the things that has been seriously overlooked by this Congress. In fact, the Republicans in Congress have cut the title I program, specialized tutoring, for kids who might fall back a grade. They have cut teacher training at a time when our teachers should, frankly, be getting 
more skills instead of fewer. They have cut the summer jobs program for kids. 
I can tell you a lot of kids don't have a chance to work during the summer. They not only don't make a few bucks and don't have a work experience, but they are tempted to do the wrong thing instead of the right thing. And they have cut technology grants to students and schools that need them so they can bring in the right technology. That is one of the things this 105th Congress has failed to do. 
They talk about crumbling schools. One of the earlier speakers said it is really not a problem that we ought to worry about. 
Take a look at this chart. K through 12 enrollment is at an all-time high, and is continuing to rise over the next 10 years. Where are these kids going to go to school? Where are their classrooms? Unfortunately, a lot of the classrooms that currently exist are deficient. 
This year K through 12 enrollment reached an all-time high, and continues to rise for the next 7 years. We need 6,000 new public schools by 2006 just to maintain the current class size. Due to overcrowding in schools, they are using trailers for classrooms, undermining discipline and increasing student morale. 
What about those existing classrooms and these crumbling schools? On this particular issue, I salute my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, who has really taken the national initiative on this. 
Look at the state of current schools in America. Fourteen million children learn in substandard schools. Seven million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint and radon in the ceilings or the walls. Twelve million children go to school under leaky roofs. One-third attend classrooms without enough panel outlets and electric wiring for computers. If we do nothing about this, the burden will shift considerably to the property taxpayers across America. 
But if we have a Federal initiative, as the President suggested, to build and repair 5,000 schools, it is going to help the kids prepare for our clear needs with more enrollment and to reduce the burden on local property taxpayers. 
Let me mention a few other issues that have failed in this Congress. One of the current questions that is asked of most pollsters in almost every poll is, Does this candidate really care about you? It is an open-ended question. It is an invitation for the person who is being asked the question to really say, `Well, I don't know if Senator so-and-so really cares about me. I would say no.' Or yes, whatever it might be. I think the appropriate question for the 105th Congress is, Did the 105th Congress really care about you as Americans and American families? When it came to education, the cutbacks that I have talked about clearly are not responsive to the needs of many families trying to raise their children. 
In the area of managed care reform, so that we would change health insurance to give doctors more say in treating us and our children, and those we love, so that hospitals would be able to make the right decisions for us medically rather than an insurance company, this Congress, this 105th Congress with the Republican leadership, failed to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights and managed care reform. For those families worried about quality health care, I am not certain that we have demonstrated that this Congress and this leadership in Congress cares about us. 
An issue near and dear to me is the question of tobacco. I started this fight about 12 years ago when I banned smoking on airplanes, joining Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in that effort. We had a chance this year, a historic opportunity because of the initiative of State attorneys general, to bring the tobacco companies and have them face their responsibility to the American people. We failed. We failed because 14 Republican Senators voted in an effort to stop us from having that happen. 
That is a sad commentary, because while we languish in this body and cannot face our responsibilities to these tobacco companies, they continue to market and sell their products to our children. I have never in my life met a parent who has said to me, `I have great news. My daughter came home last night and she started smoking.' I have never met that parent. Maybe some day I will. Maybe some of the Senators in this body have met those parents. I have not. 
As we have been unable to address this issue about tobacco companies, the number of American kids taking up smoking has risen 73 percent in the last 8 years. More than 1.2 million start smoking every day--kids under the age of 18--and are likely to be addicted, and one-third of them are likely to die because they did it. The rate of smoking--becoming smokers--is increasing. And this Senate turned its back and refused to take action to hold the tobacco companies accountable in their merchandising, their retailing and sales to kids--another failure of the 105th Congress. 
Another one clearly is in the area of campaign finance reform. I mentioned managed care reform. Some insurance companies that don't provide good care didn't want to see managed care reform; they succeeded in the Senate. Certainly the tobacco companies didn't want to see us change the way that they sell their product, and they succeeded. Now take a look at the contributions in this campaign, find out which candidates receive the most money from just those two groups, for example, and you will find the same Senators who voted to kill the tobacco bill, voted to kill the Patients' Bill of Rights, will be the ones receiving the money. 
We have tried on a bipartisan basis to pass campaign finance reform. This 105th Congress has failed. Nothing on education, nothing on managed care reform, nothing on tobacco reform, nothing on campaign finance reform, and no budget resolution, no effort to preserve Social Security or Medicare over the long term, no expenditures on behalf of the things that are critical for us. 
This Congress has stepped away from its responsibilities. Some have called it the worst Congress that has ever served in this building. I am not certain I would go that far, although I searched Senator Byrd's history of the Senate to find a more ineffectual Senate, and I can't find one. But I will keep looking. 
Another area where this Congress failed is when it comes to sensible gun control. Let's face it; the gun lobby holds sway in the Senate. Take a look at the rollcalls. Efforts that we have had by Senators Boxer and Kohl to require people to keep a trigger lock on their guns so that they are safely stored away from children failed on this floor. A bill which I introduced which held the owners of guns responsible to safely store their guns away from children was defeated. 
I am not arguing about your right to own a gun here, but I say if you own one, for goodness sakes, store it safely away from the child. The kids who are showing up in these schools and opening fire on their classmates and teachers are kids who have brought guns from home, guns that didn't have a trigger lock, guns that weren't locked away, guns that became instruments of death in the hand of a child. When a 4-year old can reach into a grandmother's purse, pull out a loaded handgun and shoot another 4-year-old, as happened last year in America, it raises a serious question about whether that gun owner has accepted her responsibility to store that gun safely. 
That radical notion of holding gun owners responsible for storing their guns safely is the law in 15 States and was defeated soundly in this Chamber because the gun lobby didn't want it. And the Brady law, which has stopped literally hundreds of thousands of convicted felons, people with a history of serious mental illness and the like, from buying guns expired, and as it expires the waiting period of 3 to 5 days to check on the background is going to go away in many States. 
This Senate and this House of Representatives failed to respond. Does this Senate, does this House care about families across America? When you look at the litany here, frankly, there is not much to point to. 
Some have suggested it is not an ineffectual Senate or Congress; it is a retrograde Congress--one that is moving back, and I think that is true. We have now reached that pinnacle where we are moving toward a real balanced budget, and having reached that pinnacle many in leadership on the Republican side can't think of a reason why they are here. And failing that, they have failed the American people time and again on education, on health care and protecting our children. 
I hope that in the closing hours, in some room here in the Capitol where the negotiators are sitting together trying to work out their differences, they will at least listen carefully to the administration and to the Democratic side. We do need to do something about education before we leave, something about 100,000 teachers across America and smaller classroom sizes. I hope we will have more money for title I, more money for summer jobs, more money for teachers and technology grants. 
It is not likely we are going to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is not likely we are going to have a tobacco bill. We are certainly not going to have campaign finance reform. But in 3 weeks the voters of this country get a chance to go to the polls. They get to look forward and decide what their vision of the 106th Congress will be--more of the same or new and different leadership. 
I hope that they agree, as I do, there is an important national agenda, an agenda which should be served whether the leadership is Democrat or Republican. This 105th Congress will put its tail between its legs and go whimpering out of town, back to their States, back to their districts to carry on the campaigns, but we squandered an opportunity here, an opportunity to lead, an opportunity to show that we truly care about families across America. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. I think it is very interesting. The comments made by the Senator from the State of Washington suggested an enormous percentage of the funds which were being appropriated at the Federal level were spent on administration. I have in my hand an April 1998 report by the Secretary of Education that was requested by appropriators from Congress that is based on data from States, the Coopers & Lybrand financial analysis model, and GAO reports, completed this summer, which I think should be part of the Record on this debate, and it says: 
One-half of 1 percent of the Federal funding for elementary and secondary education programs is spent on Federal administration. 
One-half of 1 percent. 
States retain on average an additional 2 percent. The remaining 97.5 percent goes to local school districts. 
End of quote from the report. To suggest that it is 50 to 60 percent cost of administration really doesn't square with the facts given us in this report. 
Across more than 20 major State formula programs, States, in fiscal year 1995, retained an average of only 4 percent of the money at the State level; they distributed the remaining 96 percent to school districts and other recipients, such as colleges and universities. For the program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the percent retained at the State level was even lower--about 2 percent. For Title I, the largest Federal elementary and secondary program, States retain only about 1 percent of the funds. . . 
The Department uses a very small portion of our appropriation for Federal administration. In fiscal year 1999, we will expend only about $87 million to administer some $20 billion in elementary and secondary programs; these funds come from a separate Program Administration budget account, not from funds appropriated for grants to States or school districts. Even with the addition of related research, leadership, and operations costs, the Department spends only the equivalent of about 0.5 percent of elementary and secondary funds for Federal administration.

Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at the outset, my respect for my colleague, Senator Grassley of Iowa, has not been diminished by this experience, but enhanced. It has been a joy to work with him over the last year and a half in preparing this important legislation. It is complex. It is difficult. He has shown both legislative and intellectual stamina throughout. He has been fair in his dealings with me, and to the moment where we were successful in passing this bill on the floor of the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 97-1, a strong bipartisan vote, 
I think we both took pride in the fact that we had given it virtually everything that we could to make the best possible legislation for a very difficult challenge. 
Having said that, I will knowledge, as the Senator from Iowa has, that once that bill left the Senate floor, once the conferees were appointed, a totally different process took place, which was very disappointing to me. It was totally different in that it was not bipartisan. In fact, as I stand here today and look up at the clerk's desk and see the conference report from this committee, this is the first time I have ever laid eyes on it. I wasn't there. I wasn't invited to the conference committee meetings. I wasn't asked to sign the conference committee report. In fact, virtually no Democrats--at least on the Senate side--were involved in any of that negotiation. That is truly unfortunate. 
There is no reason why this had to be a partisan endeavor. Senator Grassley and I proved that in working together on a bipartisan basis we could come up with a good and balanced bill. In fact, when this issue first came to me and people representing banks and the credit industry came to my office, I said to them: I agree with you, there are abuses in the bankruptcy system that need to be cleaned up. I will help you clean them up if, and only if, you will concede that there are also abuses when it comes to credit cards in America that need to be cleaned up as well. 
Each bank, each merchant, each credit card company said, without fail: We agree. We are in for both sides to be repaired, both sides to be changed, and reform to come that will really affect bankruptcy in the future. 
The Senate bill did that. The Senate bill said: Yes, we will clean up the bankruptcy court, but we will also say to the credit card companies, you have a responsibility to clean up your act. It also said to creditors that when it comes to the whole question of your efforts, if there are predatory credit practices that are, in fact, unfair, those credit practices will not allow you a ticket into the bankruptcy court.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am concerned that when we set about dealing with the bankruptcy code and reform, we tried to do it in a balanced fashion in the Senate bill. 
Tonight, when you go home, open the mailbox, and you know what you are going to find--preapproved credit card applications. If you are an average American, you get 28 a year. If you happen to be in the prime target group, you get many more. A college student, in the first 6 months they are in college, can expect to be inundated. You are 18 years old and you can sign a contract; they can't wait to get you. The dean of students at the University of Indiana tells us that the No. 1 reason kids are leaving school at Indiana is not grades, it is credit card debt. That is what is happening. 
So when there is a speech made about the shame of bankruptcy, what about the shame of some of these credit practices? 
So what did we suggest be changed as part of this debate? Let me give you an idea of one thing in the Senate bill that was totally rejected by the conference committee. The banks and credit card companies said: This is unreasonable, we don't want it in the bill. This example credit card statement belongs to a staff member who probably used this as a basis for acquiring more salary. We have added to this a provision that would have been from the Senate bill. We would put it at the bottom of your statement, a tiny paragraph, which says: if you pay only the minimum payment due and make no new purchases or advances, it will take you x number of months to pay off your balance, and the total cost will be approximately x. 
Does that sound like an outrageous request of a credit card company--that we as consumers would know what the minimum monthly payment means in terms of indebtedness? 
This individual has a balance of $1,295. They asked him to make a minimum payment of $26. If we put our provision on this, we would be telling him it would take him 93 months--almost 8 years--to pay off the bill. When it is all said and done, he would be paying $2,418, or almost double the amount of the current balance. 
I don't think consumers should be in any way tricked or deceived or the facts concealed. Yet, that is what is happening because this conference committee felt that it was unreasonable to put that burden on a credit card company. 
We had another provision that said that these predatory lenders that go after senior citizens--primarily widows in their late years--in the family home, and sign them up for siding and roofs and home repair with a second mortgage with a balloon, and take the house away because they have deceived some poor person, should not be able to walk into bankruptcy court and execute their claim against that person and their home. Predatory credit practices would not allow you a ticket to the bankruptcy court. As soon as this got in conference committee, they ripped it out and said: We don't want to go that far. 
Let me tell you what happened as a result. We received a letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Lew has written to us--in fact, to the leaders of Congress --within the last 2 days, to say that if this conference report is presented to the President, his senior advisers will recommend that he veto it. Why? Because it is unreasonable. This conference report could have been so good, could have been so fair and so balanced, and it is not. 
When it comes to the test that they are going to put someone in bankruptcy court, this is inflexible and unforgiving. Frankly, as a result of it, a lot of people who don't have resources and should not be put through this wringer will face it. 
In addition to that is the whole question of class actions. I will concede to the Senator from Iowa that there are undoubtedly class action lawyers who are unscrupulous, but there are also class action lawyers who stand up for consumers who could not afford a day in court by themselves. 
Consider this: A major retailer in the United States of America, as a matter of policy, has a coercive practice that when you are in bankruptcy court, they put the hammer on you as a debtor and say: We don't want you to have our debt written off. We want to tell you that you have to re-sign up to pay off this debt on this refrigerator--or car, or set of tools. They put the pressure on them. The person, under pressure, signs it. And it turns out to be a national policy. In fact, it is a national scandal. Only by class action suits on behalf of debtors across America can you go after these major banks and major retailers. 
This conference report removes the right of debtors, through classes, to come to court. That was a right under the law before we even considered bankruptcy code reform. And so not only does this bill take away new protections for consumers, it takes away the existing protections for consumers--another reason why the President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget says they will veto this bill, as I believe they should. 
There has been a lot said about child support and alimony. Consider how many of the people who go into bankruptcy court have an obligation to pay for the debts of their children and are, frankly, facing a lot of other debts and wondering how they will pay them off. The bottom line on this bill, as the letter from Mr. Lew indicates, is that they are putting more people in line to draw from the limited assets of estates. 
So a spouse trying to raise children and looking for child support, when they walk out the door in bankruptcy, has less money to turn to. 
This bill, unfortunately, does not provide the kind of protection that I believe is absolutely necessary. 
When we came to this Senate floor, we adopted a variety of consumer protection provisions that really gave balance to this bill. Almost without exception every single one of them was removed in this conference committee. 
The credit industry that promised us they would give us a balanced bill, that they would agree to end abusive practices in their own industry--when they went into that conference committee and closed the door, they basically broke the deal. They walked out of that door with the conference committee report to their liking. The conference committee report, which they are lauding, is one which most of us believe is, frankly, a bill that should not be signed into law. 
It is one sided. It is designed to reward the credit industry and to penalize the average consumer. They save the worst treatment for the unlucky families facing bankruptcy. They held aside the mother who depends on child support so that coercive creditors can claim the limited assets of bankrupt spouses. They refuse to protect the widow bilked out of her home by a home repair con artist. They refuse to provide any new credit card disclosure so that consumers can better understand the termination of their card agreements, or monthly bills. 
Our purpose in this bill on this side was never to ration credit, but only to say that credit should be more rational, that each of us, as we enter into agreements for credit cards, should be able to understand the terms of the those credit cards and make our own decisions for ourselves, our families, and our businesses. Each and every time we attempted to do that in the bankruptcy bill, it was stripped out in the conference report. 
What did they put in instead? A study--a study. So when it comes to nailing the consumers going into bankruptcy court, we need laws. When it comes to protecting the consumers who are trying to understand the terms of credit, they need studies. 
That isn't balanced. And that isn't fair. 
I think, frankly, that they have gutted the current law which protects consumers in bankruptcy from creditor abuse and manipulation. 
This bill rips into low- and middle-income families and still lets the Florida and Texas millionaires hide their assets in mansions featured in Architectural Digest. 
What am I talking about? Let's get specific. 
There is an actor we have all heard of named Burt Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds is going through bankruptcy. He had a chain of restaurants and that chain of restaurants, unfortunately for him, failed. So when he reached the end of his rope, he decided to file for bankruptcy. But Mr. Reynolds happens to be a resident in the State of Florida. 
If you happen to be a lucky resident of a State like Florida or Texas or Kansas, you can buy whatever size home at whatever expense you care to, and basically it is protected from bankruptcy. The rest of us living in other States would find in bankruptcy court that we are only protected to a limited extent. In those States, you are virtually unprotected. 
Mr. Reynolds--this is reported in the newspaper; it is not some privileged information--is going to be able to protect a home in bankruptcy valued at $2.5 million. 
This has been called the worst single scandal and abuse in the bankruptcy system. 
If we set out to clean up the system, how did we overlook this glaring problem? Because, frankly, there are an awful lot of politically powerful people who do not want to see this changed. 
We see a former commissioner of baseball moving to Florida and filing for bankruptcy so he can put as much of his assets as possible into a home that can't be attached under bankruptcy. 
A former Governor of Texas filing for bankruptcy is buying 200 acres of ranch land protected from bankruptcy. And the average person walking into a bankruptcy court across America doesn't have that kind of a sweetheart deal. 
We cleaned that up in the Senate bill. And the conference committee, when they closed the door, basically stripped it out. They made some changes--I will give them credit for that--some modifications. 
But when it comes to dealing with the amendment offered by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator Sessions of Alabama, they are not even close. 
If you are talking the shame of bankruptcy, I think it is shameful that we would allow that kind of loophole to continue and say that we have passed a meaningful reform bill. 
I come here today in opposition to this bill. I am glad that the administration has indicated that it will veto the bill. 
I have said to Senator Grassley and all others who are interested in this subject that I want a fair bill, one that is fair to consumers as well as to creditors. The door is still open for us to come and sit together and try to achieve that. 
But those who think they can push this through, that they can slam-dunk this change without taking into consideration the protection of consumers, I think have really done a disservice to families across America--families who count on this Senate and their House of Representatives to listen to their interests, not just to the interests of the banks and the credit industry and the institutions which can afford the high-paid lobbyists in this town. 
A few days after our bill passed in the Senate, I ran into a banking lobbyist in this town who said to me with a smile, `When it is all said and done, your consumer protections are gone.' She seemed to know already what the outcome would be. I didn't think that was going to happen. I thought when we got into conference we would be able to protect consumers. It didn't happen. What we got was a study--a study instead of a law. A law doesn't protect anybody unless it is enforced. And a study has never protected anybody even if it is enforced. 
We need to make certain that if we are going to have real bankruptcy reform, it is balanced reform. 
I hope this conference report is ultimately defeated. I hope it is vetoed by the President. I hope we will return to the table and in the spirit of bipartisanship guide us to a Senate bill that passed 97 to 1 on a bipartisan basis. I hope we will come up with that balanced legislation. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An identical resolution is being introduced in the House by my distinguished colleague, Representative Northup. 
As you know I am an ardent supporter of biomedical research and the National Institutes of Health. In this century, great strides have been made in the control of such killer infectious diseases such as polio, rubella, measles, cholera, typhoid fever, and diphtheria. Small pox has been eradicated. We continue to benefit from the development of new drugs and vaccines that contribute enormously to the betterment of the public health. 
At the forefront of these advances stands the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. NIAID began as the National Microbiological Institute, formed through the union of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, the Biologics Control Laboratory, the Division of Infectious Diseases, and the Division of Tropical Disease of the NIH. In 1955, Congress renamed the Institute as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recognizing the need for a coordinated scientific research program on infectious, allergic, and immunologic diseases. 
Research supported by the Institute has led to important advances, including: the development of vaccines against infectious diseases such as meningitis, hepatitis A, whopping cough and the rotavirus diarrhea; new treatments to fight against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and novel interventions to treat childhood asthma. 
However, despite significant progress, infectious diseases remain the world's leading cause of death, and the third leading cause of death in the United States, and immune-mediated diseases continue to exact a considerable toll. NIAID-supported research will continue to provide the necessary tools to develop diagnostic tests, new and improved treatments, vaccines, and other means to combat the microbial threats of today and those of the future, and to address diseases of the immune system. 
I am submitting this resolution today to demonstrate the support of the United States Senate for the NIAID, the NIH and all of the dedicated professionals who have devoted their lives to improving the quality of the nation's health.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the celebration of World Food Day on October 16th. I also rise to recognize the many successes achieved by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest international food aid organization, over the past 18 years. 
The WFP provides humanitarian relief to the world's poorest and most downtrodden people by distributing food to those individuals who are the most vulnerable to malnutrition and famine, particularly women and children. Last year alone, the WFP fed over 52.9 million people, by transporting food to needy and malnourished families in 84 countries. The WFP also provides much needed assistance to the tens of millions of victims world-wide who have suffered through natural disasters, such as earthquakes, severe floods and drought. Moreover, the WFP has committed itself to ensuring peace and stability around the world by providing food to people in war-torn countries like Sudan and Rwanda. Finally, the WFP uses donated food for development activities such as paying individuals that replant forests in Ethiopia and providing nourishment to workers repairing dikes in Vietnam. These activities help developing countries build strong infrastructures and promote economic stability. 
With nowhere else to turn, the poorest of the world's poor have been able to find solace in the hard work and dedication of the WFP's many volunteers and employees. 
American citizens have a particular reason to be proud on World Food Day. The United States has committed itself to be a world leader in the global battle against hunger. The U.S. was a primary founder of the WFP and has consistently been the world's single largest donor of food to the world's poor. 
As World Food Day is celebrated this year, we can applaud the progress the U.N. World Food Programme has achieved and the compassion that has been shown. We all must be reminded, however, that substantial work remains to be undertaken and completed. In recognition of this special day, I ask that we all carry with us the vision of a new day when abundant food is available to each and every human being and that we renew our collective commitment to achieve that vision.

Mr. DURBIN. If I understand, the statement is that before we go home we need to address the Patients' Bill of Rights. It appears that there is a wide public sentiment in support of this. It isn't a partisan issue, by a long shot. All the polls suggest that the voters, almost uniformly--Democrats, Republicans, independents--believe that this is a critical and important issue. 
When I brought this issue to the State of Illinois and visited a hospital with a doctor, he told me a story of a woman bringing her son in complaining of headaches on the left side of his head. The doctor thought that a CAT scan was indicated to see if a tumor was present. Before he told the mother, he called the insurance company. They said they would not pay for it. The doctor had to go back into his office and tell the mother that he thought they didn't need to do anything. He was prohibited by the terms of his contract with the insurance company from even telling the mother that he had been overruled by the insurance company. Think of that--if you are bringing your son or daughter into a doctor, that you could be treated that way. 
What Senator Kennedy is suggesting, and many of us believe is important before we go home, before we address other issues on the floor: We should take up the Patients' Bill of Rights for that mother and the millions of others like her across America who are counting on us to do something substantive before we leave. 
I fully support the Senator.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a subject of great importance to my home state of Illinois--falling farm prices and the impending economic crisis in Rural America. 
Illinois is one of our country's most important agricultural contributors. Illinois farm land, which accounts for about 27 million acres, is considered some of the most productive in the world. More than 76,000 farm families in the state produce corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, dairy products, and specialty crops. Illinois exports more than $3.4 billion worth of agricultural products. The state's agribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicago area to Decatur and throughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs thousands of people. And, our researchers, at the University of Illinois as well as at other institutions, continue to help provide answers to some of the most common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we face. 
With that said, the current downturn of agricultural prices is very troubling. Not just for Illinois' economy, but for the farm families who work to ensure that the state of Illinois, the country, and the world enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply. 
Recently, I had visits in my Washington office from almost every agriculture group in the state. I heard, firsthand, how farm income will fall to $42.5 billion in 1998, 20% lower than 1996 and 43% below the five year average. Meanwhile, total farm debt in 1998 has been estimated at $172 billion, the highest level since 1985. This decline in farm income could lead to massive job loss in the agriculture sector and in agribusiness, not to mention what it will do to our family farms. 
Last week, I hosted a roundtable discussion with 15 farmers in Springfield, Illinois to talk about the crisis in rural Illinois and America. It is clear that falling prices, the uncertainty with foreign markets--particularly in Asia and Russia, and poor weather conditions have contributed significantly to a severe economic crisis for our nation's farmers. 
I heard stories about low prices. In central Illinois, the price of corn went from $2.22/bu to $1.66/bu between July 17 and August 31, a 21 percent decline over a six week period. During this same period, the price of soybeans went from $6.50/bu to $5.15/bu, also a 21% drop. 
To further illustrate the seriousness of this crisis, it is important to look at this drop in commodity prices from a historical perspective. At the Shipman Elevator in Shipman, Illinois, the price of corn on September 18, 1998, was $1.64/bu. On this same date in 1993, the price was $2.17/bu. The price of soybeans at the Shipman Elevator on September 18, 1993 was $6.14/bu compared to the September 18, 1998 price of $5.00. 
Livestock prices have also dropped dramatically. The price of hogs at Farmland in Monmouth, Illinois, went from $54/cwt in September 1997 to $39/cwt in March 1998 to $29/cwt on September 18, 1998. 
At these prices, I worry that a number of our nation's farmers will not be able to survive. Whether this means leaving farming altogether or simply not being able to make their basic payments, I fear we are facing a serious economic crisis in rural America. And, farmers won't be the only ones impacted by this crisis. In the past several weeks, two of the world's largest agricultural equipment manufactures, Deere and Company, based in Moline, IL, and CASE Corporation, based in Racine, Wisconsin, have announced plans to reduce production and cut jobs. Both companies claim declining farm prices have reduced demand for their equipment. When American agriculture suffers, the effects are widespread, from equipment manufacturers to processors to commodity transporters. 
Mr. President, Congress needs to demonstrate strong leadership in the face of this economic crisis. There are some short-term solutions which have already been considered by this chamber--removing the cap on marketing loans and extending their terms, authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to make emergency storage payments to farmers to encourage the use of marketing assistance loans, and replenishing the disaster reserve. Unfortunately, partisanship has gotten in the way of offering rural America a helping hand. This debate is not about the sanctity of the 1996 Farm Bill, it is about giving American agriculture some of the tools needed to improve economic conditions and regain stability. 
The Administration, led by Secretary Glickman, has also offered some suggestions on how to address this crisis. They have put forward a $7.1 billion package to aid farmers including $2 billion in emergency disaster assistance. I welcome their proposal and leadership. 
In my Springfield meeting I was also told that many farmers won't feel the effects of the current crisis until well after the harvest when the grain bins are full and prices are at all-time lows. And, many of the farm leaders who have appealed to Congress and the Administration for help are concerned that this crisis could stretch into years rather than months. In short, they don't see an end in sight. 
Mr. President, Congress is scheduled to adjourn in less than two weeks. We won't be able to single-handedly solve this serious economic crisis in rural America before we go home for the year. But, we shouldn't wait to address this important issue and offer some assistance. We should act soon and in a bipartisan fashion. We should explore short-term fixes, like lifting the cap on marketing loans, as well as long-term solutions, like tax fairness and expanded trade opportunities. We should stand up for the men and women in rural America and let them know that Congress and the Administration will work with them to help alleviate some of the economic pain and uncertainty they face. 
To do anything less would be a disservice to our farmers and American agriculture.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President. 
I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding. 
Madam President, I rise today to oppose this effort to bring to a close debate on the Vacancies Act reform legislation, S.2176. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against cloture. 
Without so much as a blink, a breath, or a blush, a cloture motion on the bill itself was immediately filed last Thursday morning on the heels of the Senate's agreement to proceed to this bill. This quick flinch maneuver is an attempt to deny Members the opportunity to offer meaningful relevant amendments to improve this legislation, such as those I intend to pursue to address the Senate's responsibility to act expeditiously on pending nominations. 
Before I outline the importance of assessing both sides of the process and outline my specific reservations about the bill as presently drafted, I wish to emphasize that I share the convictions and concerns of the sponsors, notably Senators Byrd, Thurmond, and Thompson, about the critical need to preserve and protect the constitutional prerogative of the Senate to advise and consent to Presidential nominations to executive branch positions. I am sure that I am not alone in this view. 
I appreciate the sponsors' zeal to remedy what has grown to be, numerous instances and examples throughout the government, of outright challenges to Senate authority by ignoring the Vacancies Act. There has been flagrant and contagious disregard for the application of the existing law as the sole mechanism for temporarily filling advise and consent positions while awaiting the nomination and confirmation of the official candidate. 
I wholeheartedly concur that this law needs clarification so that moves to end-run its application are halted. The bill as advanced by the Governmental Affairs Committee laudably addresses this exclusivity question. 
Thus, I do not oppose efforts to bolster the Vacancies Act as the exclusive mechanism (with limited and explicit exceptions) for the president to designate officials to temporarily fill vacancies in positions requiring Senate confirmation. 
Unfortunately, in its current form this bill goes well beyond that justifiable but limited goal in several respects. Moreover, it fails to go far enough to address the Senate's duty to timely act on nominations. 
While the Administration may well bear some responsibility for the slow pace of nominations, I am dismayed that the Senate would want to so severely restrict the ability to fill vacant positions temporarily and to conduct the people's business while at the same time impeding the nominations process and confirming nominees at a snail's pace. 
The Senate bears partial responsibility for the time it takes to nominate officials for Senate confirmed positions. This Congress has subjected the Administration's nominees to unprecedented scrutiny, using almost any prior alleged indiscretion--no matter how trivial--by a nominee as an excuse to delay or prevent a vote. 
Senators have also interjected themselves into the President's nominations process to an unparalleled degree. As a result, that front-end process--the selection, recruitment, and vetting of candidates--takes longer than ever before. 
The nomination and confirmation process, it has been observed, is one of `the President proposing, the Senate disposing.' If the Senate expects adherence to the rigid parameters this bill would impose on advancing candidates, we as its Members need to be ready and willing to diligently consider these candidates for public office and take prompt and deliberate action to confirm or reject them. 
The Senate has frequently declined to exercise its advice and consent responsibility in a timely and appropriate manner. Too often, nominations die in Committee, languish interminably on the Executive Calendar, or simply take months or years to move through this Chamber. 
Just as the President has a responsibility to forward nominees to the Senate in a timely fashion, we in the Senate have a concomitant obligation to discharge our constitutional prerogative of advice and consent on those candidates in an efficient and expeditious fashion. 
We cannot simply confront practical deficiencies in the front-end phase of the process for recruiting and evaluating qualified candidates and ignore our own responsibilities. 
We owe it not only to the Executive, but to the American public, to offer--not withhold--our advice and where appropriate, our consent. 
I have filed and certainly hope to have an opportunity to offer some relevant amendments designed to address those instances of dilatory Senate Committee processing and floor inaction once a nominee is advanced to the calendar. 
One amendment would provide that any nomination submitted to the Senate that is pending before a Senate committee for 150 calendar days shall on the day following such 150th day, be discharged and placed on the Senate executive calendar and be considered as favorably reported. 
Another amendment would require the Senate to take up for a vote any nomination which has been pending on the Executive Calendar in excess of 150 days. Such Senate consideration must occur within 5 calendar days of the 150th day. In effect, it creates an end point after which we can no longer hold up a nominee. 
I am not suggesting that we would give our consent to all of these nominees. I am basically saying that this process should come to a close. The Senate should vote. It should make its decision. 
If we want to reasonably time-limit the front end of the process--with which I do not disagree--and promptly fill vacancies, we need to be equally willing to build some finality into the back-end of the process and impose some time limits on our own consideration of these candidates. 
The first problem I find with this bill is that filling positions in the Government requires time far longer than that specified in this bill. 
I have an amendment which suggests increasing the 150-day period to 210 days. I am sure people are wondering, if they are following this debate, why it would take so long for any kind of process to review a nominee. Well, as it turns out, the average number of days that a vacancy exists prior to a Senate nomination for the White House is 313 days. What could possibly take 313 days in investigating the qualifications of an individual to fill the job? 
Consider all of the things that are going to be investigated. Not only the lengthy forms the individual must fill out, ethics disclosures, financial statements, fingerprints and the like, but also an FBI investigation, 
a Federal Bureau of Investigation report on that person, the opportunity for groups to contact the White House and say that they either oppose or support the individual, the opportunity for Members of Congress to come forward and suggest to the administration that they either support that nominee or they oppose it. And as it turns out, some of these things such as an FBI report may not happen as quickly as some people imagine. We have heaped on that agency additional responsibilities every year. We entrust them with very important jobs. We tell them that we want them to fingerprint and make certain that those who want to be citizens of the United States, in fact, have no criminal record in any foreign country. That is a valid question, but it is an additional administrative responsibility. 
The list goes on and on and on. As a consequence, when the administration comes to this agency, and it is only one example, and asks for a timely review of an individual nominated for a position, they sometimes have to wait in line. And while they wait the clock is ticking. 
And consider this as well. As a result of this legislation, saying the administration shall only have 150 days, what if in the midst of this process--say, for example, 4 or 5 months into the process--the administration reaches a conclusion that the individual should not go forward and the nomination should not be sent to the Senate. Does the clock start to run again? No. The clock continues to run 150 days, so the new nominee, starting over going through all these processes, trying to clear all these hurdles, is still burdened by the original clock ticking at 150 days. I don't think it is realistic. I don't think it is fair. Merely adding 30 additional days to the current 120-day timeframe within which an acting official may temporarily perform the duties and functions of the vacant office unless the Senate has forwarded a nominee to the Senate within that span is impractical. It is unrealistic, and I do not believe it is adequate.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. It pains me to believe we would have a difference of opinion, but those things do occur. I am certain the Senator as majority leader did his constitutional responsibility--there has never been a doubt about that--and also acted with dispatch in a timely manner. 
I think the Senator makes a good point. We not only want to protect the clear constitutional responsibility and right of the Senate in this process, we want to bring the best men and women forward to continue serving our Government, and we want it all done in a timely fashion. My concern with this bill is it addresses one side of the equation. It says to the executive branch, you have to move in a more timely fashion to bring these men and women to the Senate for consideration. If we are clearly looking for filling vacancies in a timely fashion, that is only half the process. Once the nomination is brought to the Senate, we should move in a timely fashion, too. Otherwise, using the old reference to equity, we don't come to this argument with clean hands, and that is why I think there should be some symmetry here in the requirement of the executive as well as the legislative branch.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. 
I would just say that I can't believe that I hurried back from Chicago this morning to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to actually engage my friend and fellow Senator from West Virginia in any debate about the Constitution. I plead nolo contendere. I am not able to join you in that. And I can't even reach back in Greek or Roman history for any kind of solace or defense. 
I am not sure who the author was, it could have been a Greek or Roman, maybe a West Virginian, or even an Illinoisan, who once said the profound statement, `What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,' and that is what I am attempting to argue here. That is, if we are going to impose on the executive branch a requirement to produce the nominee in 150 days, or if the time goes beyond that to suffer the possibility of not having an acting person in that slot, then we should accept the responsibility on the Senate side as well, to act in a timely manner on these nominees.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. 
I think what we have found is that rarely do we visit this rather obscure area of the law, the Vacancies Act. I am hoping in this visitation on one side, that we have some balance and impose requirements on the Senate to act in a timely fashion, as we impose a requirement on the executive branch to report a nominee in a timely fashion. But I also hope the time periods that we choose are realistic. I think anyone involved in this process at any level understands that when a person's name comes up in nomination, they are subjected to far greater scrutiny than ever before. It discourages many good people from even trying public service, and I am sure that many have been disappointed. 
But let us, I hope, during the process of this debate, be sensitive to this reality. And it is a reality that, under the bill, the meter keeps on ticking even when this scrutiny is underway, even if it is interrupted and a new nominee is proposed for a post. And if, in fact, at 150 days the nomination is not forthcoming, then, as I understand this bill, we would preclude the President from filling the spot with an acting person. That, to me, is a sort of decision which on its face makes sense but may have some practical ramifications. It may affect the ability of the administration to choose the person most able to handle a matter that involves public health, public safety, or the national defense. I also think that this bill too narrowly restricts who can function in an acting capacity.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am concerned this bill too narrowly restricts those who can function in an acting capacity. I am worried that, in fact, the administration will not be able to pick that person best able to fill the spot, to conduct the duties, and to perform the functions of the office in the best way. I don't think that serves our country well. This bill could preclude the President from naming the most qualified person to serve as an acting officer. I do not think that will help us in any way. 
Third, while it would not affect this President, experience has shown that at the beginning of a new administration filling positions in the Government requires far longer than specified in this bill. At the outset of any new administration, the President must nominate individuals to at least 320 positions in 14 different executive departments. The new President cannot possibly make all the required nominations within the 240 days allowed by this bill. 
In 1993, when the nominations process was, if anything, simpler than today, the new administration was able to forward only 68 percent of the nominees within the first 240 days. Unless this time period is changed, the next administration could face departmental shutdowns because of this bill. 
The enforcement mechanism of this bill, which establishes that no one can perform the functions and the duties of the vacant office, is a sanction which would lead to administrative immobilization. 
I would like to also note it is ironic that we are here today debating whether to close off consideration of a measure designed to limit how long an acting official may temporarily fill an executive branch vacancy and legally perform the duties while awaiting an advancement of a nominee. The impetus is on the President to send nominees more expeditiously; yet with acting officials in many of these agencies, the work can continue. Such is not the case with the sister branch of Government which has eluded our debate here today, the Judiciary. In fact, a more serious crisis sits on the doorstep of the U.S. Senate, one that has been sorely neglected this year by many of the same people on the other side of the aisle who are proposing this change in the Vacancies Act. 
We must recognize there is no similar vehicle or parallel authority like the Vacancies Act for filling vacancies on the Federal bench. There are presently 22 candidates to fill judicial vacancies on the Executive Calendar of the U.S. Senate, and 24 pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee--3 of those from my State. Unlike the executive branch where qualified acting officials may step in, in the judicial branch we don't have `acting' or `interim' judges. 
I think, frankly, if we are going to assume some responsibility here, as we should, and impose responsibility on the executive branch, we should meet our responsibility. I think that responsibility requires us to act in a timely fashion on nominees sent before us. The reason I oppose cloture is I would like to see that the Senate shall also be held to the responsibility of acting in a timely fashion. If, after 150 days languishing in a committee there is no report on an individual, the name should come to the floor. If, after 150 days languishing on the Executive Calendar that name has not been called for a vote, it should be. 
Vote the person up or down. They are qualified or they are not. But to impose all of the burden on the executive branch and to step away from our responsibility I don't think is fair. It doesn't engage the symmetry, which I think is important. 
I will concede, as Senator Byrd has said, the constitutional question is directly addressed by this bill, but I think there is a larger question about the process and whether or not we meet our twin goals: timely consideration and ultimately the very best and most able people who are selected to serve us in Government. 
Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for announcing the schedule this morning. Those who have followed the last few days of Senate debate know we are considering a reform of the bankruptcy code. We will be joined shortly by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who will offer an amendment. 
For those who have not paid attention to this debate, I hope that they have followed at least the outline of it and understand that what we are about is to try to change the bankruptcy code in a way that will reduce abusive filings--in other words, people who may be going into bankruptcy court to file for bankruptcy in a situation where they can, in fact, pay back either their debts or a sizable portion of those debts. We have tried to address this at several different levels. We have had a spirited debate about how to do it. 
We understand the complexity of this. Historically, there has been a national commission which has taken a look at this rather complicated area of the law. I find myself in an unusual position here, having worked with my staff and studied this issue for a year, because I come to this with an interesting experience when it comes to bankruptcy law. Thirty years ago, I took a course in bankruptcy in law school. Twenty years ago, I was appointed trustee of a bankruptcy in my hometown of Springfield, IL, in one case. Now I bring that wealth of experience to this debate in an attempt to try to find our way through a very complicated area of the law. It was interesting. 
Yesterday, when I spoke to a colleague of mine about bankruptcy, she had said that she was surprised to learn how few people file bankruptcy with incomes over $50,000 a year. I told her that the average income of a person filing for bankruptcy in the United States of America is less than $18,000. So folks who are going into bankruptcy court, by and large, are people of very limited means. The average debt of the person going into bankruptcy court is about $28,000. 
So if we are out to stop the high rollers and the abusers of the system, I hope that we take care in this bill, as well as in conference, to protect the vast majority of people petitioning the bankruptcy court for relief of their debts, who are, in fact, in lower-income categories, with a debt that is beyond their comprehension or at least their control. 
As we go about these changes, I am glad to see that we have included amendments that not only try to tighten up the procedures in the bankruptcy court, but also say to the people in the credit industry that they have an equal obligation here. We want you to continue to extend credit across America so that American families and businesses can use credit cards and second mortgages and other things to finance their lives and businesses; but we want you to be certain that you follow some rules, too. 
We have talked a lot about personal responsibility here when it comes to consumers. I think that is a valid observation. We also want to speak to corporate responsibility, so that those who are peddling these credit cards around the country, in fact, give full disclosure to the would-be consumers about the terms. Many of us will go home tonight and look through the mail, and you know what you are going to find--a stack of preapproved credit card applications. It is luring. People say: This can be easy. I will take all my debts and put them on one card. Look at this low interest rate; this is terrific. Let's do this right away. 
Yet, they find that it is a teaser rate and only applies for a few months. If they decide in some instances to pay off their credit card at the end of each month, they may face a penalty. Yes, a penalty for paying off the balance on your card because, of course, the company makes money if you continue to really roll over the debt month after month and pay interest. 
Senator Reed of Rhode Island successfully offered an amendment that said that you have to have full disclosure if that is going to occur, and other amendments in this bill try to say to the consumers that you have a right to know, too. For example, if you pay the minimum monthly balance on your credit card, we have a provision in this bill that says you should state right under it how long it will take to pay off the credit card debt and how much you will pay in interest if you pay the minimum monthly amount. 
So we are trying to strike a balance here--a balance that says those who come into court have to be, in fact, deserving of bankruptcy procedure, and that those who extend credit in this country have to be more open and honest in the way that they deal with consumers. I think that is the right balance. It still puts the burden on each of us to make the right decisions for ourselves and our families. It gives us the information about the credit card companies to make that decision more knowledgeably and with an understanding of what we are getting into. 
At this time, I see my colleague from the State of Connecticut is here to offer his amendment under the unanimous consent agreement.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and I rise in strong support of his resolution. 
Let's understand what we are talking about. We decided long ago that if a person filed bankruptcy, we would allow them to protect certain things that we considered essential, and one of those things was a home. Now, of course, that is understandable; 50 percent of the people filing for bankruptcy are homeowners; but we left it to the States to come up with the amount of money that your home could be worth, and you could exempt it. 
As a consequence, with 50 different States, we have basically 50 different approaches. Some of these approaches, unfortunately, have led to abuse. The Senator from Wisconsin described two or three cases where people literally owed millions of dollars and quickly raced out to buy a multimillion-dollar home to put everything they could into it and to basically guard it away from any creditor in bankruptcy. I do not think that is what we had in mind when we put the homestead exemption in place. It was a legitimate effort to protect someone's home. 
I see the Senator from Alabama has taken the floor. I congratulate him, Senator Sessions, as well as Senator Kohl for their leadership here. 
Let me tell you why I think this is important. The idea behind this bill was to stop the abuses in bankruptcy. Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School, whom I have really come to respect for her knowledge of this subject, calls the disparity among State homestead exemptions `the biggest single scandal in the consumer bankruptcy system.' 
To think, in the instance of a doctor in Miami who refused to carry malpractice insurance, who was sued by four different people, one of them a person who lost a leg, and then when they went to collect against the doctor personally, because he had no insurance, he basically hid behind the homestead exemption and said, `Everything I own is in my home and you cannot touch it'--that really is an abuse of the system. I am glad Senator Sessions and Senator Kohl have shown leadership on this and I am happy to support their efforts.

Mr. DURBIN. The Federal Trade Commission should keep in mind that the definition will define the household goods that a debtor may keep after the bankruptcy, as part of the debtor's fresh start. The defining regulations should specify any tangible personal property reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and the debtor's dependents.

Mr. DURBIN. I would agree. Similarly, I believe the Federal Trade Commission should keep in mind that when we talk about a dependent of the debtor we are referring to people like an elderly parent or relative, or a disabled person. Property belonging to a dependent elderly or disabled person should also figure into the definition. 
Moreover, I would note that although some members of the Judiciary Committee have tried to tell the FTC what to do, this provision ultimately leaves the decision in the hands of the FTC. We have never had hearings or conducted any inquiry whatsoever into what household goods are necessary or appropriate in bankruptcy. The point of this provision is to ask the FTC to make the necessary inquiries and provide a suitable definition. As the lead Democratic co-sponsor of this bill, as the author of this provision--which I proposed during the Committee debate--and as the ranking member on the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the bankruptcy code, I believe the FTC is much better suited to do this than we. In addition, I would note that the definition of dependent must be drawn from the bankruptcy code itself in order for any FTC definition to be at all meaningful or useful.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would like to echo the comments of Senator Grassley. I really believe this vote of 97 to 1 is a tribute to his patience, endurance, and hard work. It has been a joy to be with him as part of this process. We have serious differences on many aspects of this bill. I am sure we will continue to debate them. But the core bill is a bill which I was happy to support because I think it is a more reasonable approach to reforming bankruptcy. We attempt to reform it in the responsible way, trying to stop the abuses in filing in the bankruptcy court and at the same time calling on the credit industry to accept some responsibility for those risky credit practices which lure unwitting consumers into a trap from which they cannot escape. 
I want to give acknowledgment as well to staff who have made this bill possible. Seated to my left is Victoria Bassetti, my staff attorney on the Judiciary Committee, who has spent more time looking at the bankruptcy code than almost anything else in the past year; Anne McCormick, who is with us as a detailee from the Department of Justice, who has done an extraordinary job; on the majority side, John McMickle and Kolan Davis have become friends during the course of this debate and have added greatly to the work product; Makan Delrahim and Rene Augustine of Senator Hatch's staff; Kara Stein and Brooke Byers of Senator Dodd's staff; Ed Pagano of Senator Leahy's staff; Kristi Lee of Senator Sessions' staff; and Brian Lee of Senator Kohl's staff; as well as Joel Wiginton, who once worked on my staff and now serves Senator Feingold. They all have added to the value of this bill. I thank each and every one of them. 
I would like to just note four or five things that I am particularly proud of in this legislation. 
We have worked back and forth in the banking industry, as well as with experts in the law, to come to a good conclusion about the ways to reduce abuse when it comes to bankruptcy filings. 
We have added some provisions here which I think many consumers will appreciate because it really does bring more balance to this endeavor. 
With the help of Senator Dodd, who is in the Chamber today, as well as Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, we have added some disclosure provisions to this bill which will make credit card statements clearer and make it more understandable when credit card companies solicit your business as to what you are going to have to do, how much you will have to pay in interest rates and what other conditions might be important to your relationship. 
We have an amendment here I am particularly proud of on predatory home lending. These are those unscrupulous credit practices where lenders prey particularly on senior citizens, forcing them into a situation where they sign second mortgages on their home without any real understanding of what they are getting into. They lose the most important asset in their life because of these unscrupulous practices. This bill comes down hard on that kind of conduct. 
We also have increased court supervision on reaffirmation. A person files for bankruptcy and says, Here is a debt which I will keep; I will continue to pay on it. For instance, a car loan because you need an automobile, or with a company that your family has done business with for generations. You reaffirm the debt. That is perfectly acceptable. It is something which should be encouraged where it works. But we say the court should look at it to make certain it is fair. 
I salute Senator Sessions and Senator Kohl for the homestead exemption cap. The unlimited homestead exemption in a few states is the single worst abuse in the bankruptcy system. Our friends in the House saw it differently on a floor vote. It is up to us in conference to convince them that ours is a better way. We protect retirement income in bankruptcy, a concept which I pushed for and was happy to join with Senator Hatch in finally passing in this Chamber. 
I thank Senator Feingold for his efforts to protect the poorest of the poor who file in bankruptcy. I also salute Senator Feinstein and others who have asked for studies which we think will improve credit practices in this country. And, finally, this bill provides for the creation of 18 new bankruptcy judgeships sorely needed in the States which will receive them. 
This is the first major legislation I have had in the Chamber. I don't expect every one of them to pass 97 to 1, but it really is a good feeling to know that all of this work over this time has resulted in a truly bipartisan response to this important issue. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Maryland for his kind words, and for his assistance in making S.1301 a bill that the Senate can be proud of. 
As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Senator Sarbanes has long been interested in the issue of consumer lending practices, and his efforts were invaluable in drawing the necessary connection between increased bankruptcy filings and the lending practices of credit card companies. 
Due to the efforts of a number of Democratic Senators, including Senator Sarbanes, we were able to have inserted into the managers amendment to this bill a number of important provisions dealing with consumer credit information. These provisions require credit card companies to provide in their monthly statements and initial solicitation materials information that will help consumers manage their finances in a way that will, I believe, obviate the need for bankruptcy in many cases. The bill also now provides for studies regarding (1) the extension of credit to individuals with a high debt-to-income ratio and (2) the use of credit card security interests to coerce reaffirmations of debt in bankruptcy. 
In short, we now have before us a bill that is balanced and that is not simply the wish list of the credit card companies. I thank Senator Sarbanes for helping to make this possible.

Mr. DURBIN. My colleague from Maryland sadly may be correct. Neither our Republican colleagues in the House nor the credit card companies are likely to be as enthusiastic as he or I about the efforts at cooperation and compromise that went into crafting the Senate bill. 
We will, indeed, have to be vigilant in regard to the consumer-oriented provisions in S.1301, and I hope that we will be joined in this effort both by our Senate Republican colleagues, who have agreed to accept most of these provisions without any debate, as well as by the White House, which has indicated the importance of preserving the Senate managers' amendment to its own consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation. We have our work cut for us, but I commit to my colleague from Maryland that I will do my utmost to ensure that the bankruptcy conference report contains the vital consumer protections we worked so hard to add to the Senate bill.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I rise in support of this amendment. When you have people who are so dirt poor that they can't come up with the $175 filing fee, we usually say in civil actions that we are going to waive the fee in court. For some reason, that waiver is not in the law in bankruptcy. It certainly should be. People wouldn't be coming to the bankruptcy court were they not in dire straits. 
I support the Senator from Wisconsin because this has been tried successfully. It does not result in a mad dash to the courthouse by people who otherwise would not file for bankruptcy. 
Now, the milk of human kindness curdled a few moments ago on the Senate floor when it came to bankruptcy lawyers, and the poor folks didn't do too well a few minutes ago when it came to minimum wage. Please stop and think about this for a minute. The poorest of the poor, coming to bankruptcy court trying to turn their lives around, want the same kind of treatment people get in all other civil suits. That is not unreasonable.

Mr. DURBIN. I rise to support this amendment because I think it makes a good bill even better. We are trying to stop the abuses in bankruptcy. We say if you want to file for bankruptcy and you do not have good cause, we are going to throw you out of court. We might penalize you, and we are going to do the same thing to your attorney. So from the debtor side--the person who owes the money--it is a pretty tough standard. 
What the Senator from Rhode Island says is, let's have a standard as well for the collection agencies and the creditors who are not treating people fairly. I think we want to eliminate all abuses in the bankruptcy court, not just by the debtors and their attorneys, but by the creditors, too. What the Senator from Rhode Island suggests is fairness and balance. It gives the court the ability to look at strong-arm tactics used by collection agencies and creditors to the detriment of debtors who are trying to get out of debt.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for leading this debate, an important debate. 
The first job that I ever had where I was paid an hourly wage was the result of two lies. I walked into a delicatessen at age 14 in the home State of the Presiding Officer, in St. Louis, MO, a place called Union Station. I bought a half dozen bagels for my mother. The man leaned over the counter and said, `Are you looking for a job, boy?' 
I said, `Yes.' 
He said, `How old are you?' 
And then the first lie came out. I was 14 and I said, `I'm 16.' 
`OK.' 
I said, `How much does the job pay?' 
Then the second lie came out. He said, `The minimum wage, 60 cents an hour.' 
With that exchange, we entered into a contract: An underage worker making less than the minimum wage got his first job besides delivering papers. I have had a lot of jobs ever since. I have met a lot of people along the way who have struggled at low-wage jobs and tried to make a living. 
And this debate is really about them. 
I guess there is a sense of frustration by some on the floor that these people in low-income categories will not be quiet. They keep speaking up and saying, `We can't make it. We're not making it. We need more help. We're trying to keep our families together. We're trying to provide the basics for our kids, and $5.15 an hour just won't do it.' 
A lot of people would wish that the so-called invisible hand of the market would be all that we rely on, but, fortunately, we do not. Fortunately, since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we have said this country will have a minimum wage, because we believe there is dignity in work and there is dignity attached to work that pays a decent wage. 
Unfortunately, we politicians, who draw regular salaries, have fallen down on the job of keeping up with inflation. Take a look at this chart about what has happened to the real minimum wage while we have gone through all this political gasification on the floor of the House and the Senate. 
Starting in 1955, it was the equivalent of $4.50 an hour; it was not that, but in 1997 dollars it would have been $4.50 an hour. We saw the minimum wage, the real wage, the earning power of the minimum wage reach a high of $7.38 and then plummet between 1970 and 1988 to a low of $4.34. 
If Senator Kennedy is not successful with his effort today, you are going to see that line plummet again. What it means is the real earning power of people in low-income jobs will continue to descend; and as it continues to descend, it will be more difficult for them to provide clothing for their kids, any kind of health insurance, to pay rent on a decent place to live, to provide some of the amenities of life that all of us just take for granted. 
I have listened to the arguments, and they are so weary and time worn that `if you raise the minimum wage, we will increase unemployment.' The spokesmen and spokeswomen for the business community have been giving us that song for as long as this debate has been on the floor of Congress. They cannot seem to divert their eyes away from their hymnal in singing this long enough to look at the facts. And the facts say just the opposite. 
Look at what the impact on unemployment has been by our most recent increase in the minimum wage. When it was increased to $4.75, unemployment started going down. When it was increased to $5.15, it went down further. So the argument that raising the minimum wage forces employers to lay people off may happen in an isolated case or two, but in looking at the overall economy, you have to say there is no correlation here. The minimum wage has gone up and unemployment has gone down. 
`Oh,' they say, `wait a minute. You're not talking about the most vulnerable people. These are the first ones they are going to lay off, that teenager,' like myself at age 14 or 16, or whatever, `trying to go to work and make a minimum wage. Surely, they will be the first casualties.' The facts do not support that. The facts say just the opposite. 
Look at this. Unemployment continues to go down as the minimum wage goes up among teenagers age 16 to 19. They say, `Well, there are special classes of teenagers.' We all know the problems with minority teenagers. They are a special class. `Surely, they'll be the first ones to suffer if we raise the minimum wage.' Again, not the case. Minimum wage goes up; unemployment goes down. 
There is really nothing to these arguments against an increase in the minimum wage. Frankly, we have heard so many of them--people who will not acknowledge that the last time we increased the minimum wage we saw an increase in employment in America. 
The Senator from Oklahoma stood up and said, `Be careful. If you raise this minimum wage, we're going to lose jobs.' Since September 1996, the last time we raised the minimum wage, 61,000 new jobs have been created in the State of Oklahoma. There are 154,000 Oklahomans who would receive a raise of $1 an hour if this Kennedy amendment passed. 
In my home State of Illinois, 179,000 new jobs have been created since we last increased the minimum wage. There are 374,000 Illinois workers and their families who are waiting for that, hoping that we will listen again to the need to raise this basic minimum wage. 
Who are the people who will benefit? The teenagers and the minorities? Yes. But if you want to describe who they are, you have to look at the bigger picture. Sixty percent of them are women; 74 percent are adults, 20 years of age or older. Some want to refer to this as a kid wage. Seventy-four percent of the people who would benefit by this amendment are over 20 years of age, 8.9 million workers in the United States. 
Work is an ennobling experience. It has been in my life, the lives of my parents and the lives of my children. I am glad that I did it. And I learned a lot in the experience. I always wanted to feel that I was getting paid fairly for hard work. Sure, I would work hard at my job to do a good job, but I would like to think when the paycheck came in I was getting a decent wage. 
Fortunately, in my life, there were very few times that I ever struggled to make ends meet with my family. My wife and I weathered those years. But for some people this is a weekly experience--waiting for that paycheck to come in and wondering if they are going to make it. 
Who are these people we are talking about? These are the people we entrust our parents to in nursing homes. These are the people who are changing the sheets on their beds, cleaning up after them. These are the people who we entrust our children to in day-care centers and our grandchildren--I might add since I am now in that vaunted category--grandparents worried about grandchildren. These day-care workers are making a minimum wage, and we give them the most precious cargo we can deliver in bringing in our children. These are the people who made the bed in your hotel room, who took the dirty dishes off your table, who took in your cleaning. These are the people who every day get up and go to work. They know that work is ennobling. They are asking for fairness. 
I ask for 1 additional minute.

Mr. DURBIN. I say to those who are opposing this minimum wage, that it is a sad day when we have reached the point when the U.S. Congress is so unresponsive to the reality of workers in America, so insensitive to what is really going on among workers in businesses across the United States. 
When the record is written about this Congress, and what it has achieved, I am afraid it will be reminiscent of General MacArthur's speech to a joint session of Congress over 40 years ago. He said, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.' 
Well, maybe--maybe--it is time for this Congress to fade away--this Congress, which has been unwilling to address the most basic issues in this country; unwilling to pass campaign finance reform; unwilling to pass a tobacco bill to protect our children who continue to be lured by those companies; unwilling to show initiative to protect Social Security when Americans say that is their No. 1 priority; unwilling to do anything about education, like the crumbling schools initiative of my colleague Senator Carol Moseley-Braun; unwilling to address a Patients' Bills of Rights when every American family knows how vulnerable we are when it comes to health insurance and the way doctors and hospitals are treated; and unwilling to address the most basic issue, the most basic issue of fairness, that the people who get up and go to work every day in America deserve a decent living wage. 
It will be a tragedy if this turns out to be just another partisan roll call swept aside and ignored because hundreds of thousands in my State and millions across America look to this Congress to be sensitive and to lead. Unfortunately, today, the debate suggests that we will not. And this Congress will fade away with an ignominious record when it comes to the people who are going to work every day and keeping America moving. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is beginning consideration of a very controversial and contentious issue, the veto override of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
I will vote to sustain the President's veto of this bill, which I believe is seriously flawed. But to make my position clear and state in positive terms what I believe we should do to address this troubling issue, I am introducing legislation today known as the Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998. 
I am pleased to have a bipartisan group of Senators as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators Snowe, Collins, Torricelli, Mikulski, Graham, Landrieu, and Lieberman. 
We believe that post-viability abortions should be allowed in only two types of situations--when the life of the mother is in danger or when she faces a medically certified risk of grievous physical injury. 
Senators Daschle and Snowe put forward a measure last year that reflected this principle. I support them, and our legislation builds on what they did. 
Our bill has one significant difference from the Daschle proposal, an addition that we believe enhances the Daschle amendment. Our legislation would require a second non-treating doctor's certification that the abortion is medically necessary to protect the life of the mother or prevent grievous physical injury. This second certification could be waived only in the case of a medical emergency, and the physician would have to document the nature of the medical emergency. 
We believe this approach is one that can be passed in the United States Senate. It is backed by a substantial and bipartisan group of Senators. It is a compromise approach that can bring to a reasonable conclusion the long-running debate over late-term abortion procedures. I urge my colleagues to read the language closely and give it careful consideration as a good faith effort to resolve this troubling issue in a fair and humane manner. 
Unlike the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, this legislation would actually reduce the number of late-term abortions because, instead of banning only one procedure, the measure would ban all post-viability abortions except when a continuation of the pregnancy risks grievous physical injury to the mother or poses a threat to her life. 
At the same time, the legislation holds to the Roe versus Wade standard which makes a clear distinction between abortions occurring before and after viability. Unlike the partial birth abortion ban, our bill preserves this important distinction and is thus more likely to pass court scrutiny. Before viability, a decision to have an abortion must be made by a woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience. But in the closing weeks of a pregnancy, the court affirms a role for addressing the public concern about late-term abortions and makes it clear that the State can draw the line limiting abortions to the most serious circumstances. 
I hope the legislation we are introducing today can help us resolve this debate once and for all, in a manner that is consistent with our laws and the views of most of the American people.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin. He is correct. We tried this across the United States in, I think, six different jurisdictions, to see what would happen. What is at issue here is a person is about to file for bankruptcy and is so penniless that they cannot even afford the filing fee of $175, then in these six different court jurisdictions we waived it. That is what this is all about. We found as a result of that experience they didn't open the floodgates to people coming in filing for bankruptcy. In fact, just the opposite was true. A lot of very serious cases, and those called out for justice, were served by this program. 
One of the judges in my home State of Illinois, the southern district, who tried this, Judge Meyers, has written a letter to me and said it was quite a success and he encouraged it be done on a national basis. 
If there is anything that distinguishes American jurisprudence from some other countries, it is the fact that we have basically said the court system is open to the rich and poor alike. It is an oddity in our law that we don't allow those who are truly poor to have a waiver of the filing fee so that they can come into bankruptcy court. 
Senator Feingold has a good amendment. I was happy to support it in committee. I hope now, because of the evidence of its success across the country that has been shared on both sides of the aisle, it ultimately will be adopted. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. I have called the Democratic Senators who have told me they have pending amendments and asked them to come to the floor as soon as possible so that we can start the amendment consideration. There is one amendment which the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, would like to offer relative to the minimum wage which does not relate directly to this bill, but there has been an agreement that he will have that opportunity. I think he will be here within an hour, and we can discuss exactly when that amendment might come up. 
I just say, as I have said before on the floor, it has been a pleasure to work with Senator Grassley and his staff. I think the way that we resolved over 30 amendments on this might be a good way to legislate. Because literally Senator Grassley and I, with our able staff members, and people from the administration, sat in a room and worked through some 30 different amendments. 
We now have pending about a dozen that were unresolved that we think should be the subject of floor votes. Once those have been voted on, we are prepared, I hope, with a good work product to move forward, to pass a bill, and move to conference to consider a very complicated and complex area of the law but one so critically important to over a million Americans each year who file for bankruptcy in the United States. 
We want to make certain that we keep those bankruptcy courts available for those who have truly reached the end of the rope and have absolutely nowhere to turn; and that, I think, describes the vast majority of people who come to the bankruptcy court. But we also hope to tighten the procedures to eliminate those abuses, petitioners who come to court who should not, those who were in court and engaged in tactics that, frankly, we do not think should be acceptable. 
We are also going to try to address in the course of the amendments to this bill questions relative to the whole offering of credit cards to Americans. I think virtually everyone here today can tell me that when they go home tonight and open up the mail, they are going to find another credit card solicitation--I see heads nodding in the gallery--if you are a normal American. And I am sure they are nodding at home as well. 
We want to make sure that the credit that is offered in America is credit available to everyone. The democratization of credit in this country has been a positive thing. But we also want to say to those who offer credit: Do it in a responsible way. Be honest in terms of describing the credit arrangement that you are seeking. Be certain that the people you are dealing with are truly capable of incurring more debt and can get involved in this process with a clear understanding of their obligation. Make your monthly statements intelligible so people who pay a minimum monthly amount have some idea when it might come to an end. Disclose some peculiarities of credit. Am I taking a security interest every time I use my credit card--for the toaster I just purchased? 
All of these things, I think, are relevant and will be raised during the course of this. 
One of the Senators is going to offer an amendment which basically says we can declare `time out.' If we are tired of credit card solicitations, we ought to be able to call a number and tell them to cease and desist, stop bothering us with all these solicitations. I think there is a right in America to be left alone. One of the amendments that will be offered will address that particular issue. 
I thank the Senator from Iowa. I am going to make some phone calls and encourage our colleagues to come to the floor quickly.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. 
I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. Let me say at the outset that my colleague from Pennsylvania comes to this floor to discuss this issue with heartfelt emotion. I am convinced of his commitment to this cause. I have served with him in both the House and the Senate. I would never question his motives. And I know a little bit about his family situation. I am sure that they are sincere. 
I also say to you that this may be the most difficult issue for any politician to deal with in America today. I have been in and around public life for 32 years. It has not gotten any easier in 32 years, at least not since the Roe v. Wade decision, because the American people are basically conflicted internally about this issue of abortion. 
There are some who would argue no abortions under virtually any circumstances and others who would argue that the State--Government--should not restrict abortions under any circumstances. But the vast majority of Americans, I think personally, fall into some middle ground where they understand that a woman's right to make this decision, in concert with her doctor, her family and her conscience, is something that should be protected under law--it is currently protected under law--but they want to see us do everything we can as a Government and as a people to reduce the likelihood of abortion in this country. The number of abortions have diminished some over the past few years, but it is still a very widespread practice and medical procedure in America. 
My own personal views on it--I personally oppose abortion but I believe that we should take care where we draw the line about the Government's involvement in that decision. You would think after serving on Capitol Hill for 16 years, and facing literally hundreds of votes on the issue, that this would become rote, that it would be an easy, automatic, reflexive vote. It has never been that for me. It never will be. I pause and think and worry over every vote on this subject because I know what is at stake is very serious. 
Today, the Senator from Pennsylvania comes to the floor and asks us to vote to override President Clinton's veto of his bill banning what is known as the partial-birth abortion procedure. I will be voting to sustain the President's veto. I will be voting in opposition to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I want to make it clear why I am doing so. 
It is my belief that this bill, as far as it goes, addresses one challenge before us. This bill addresses one abortion procedure. But there are many different kinds of procedures. As terrifying and troubling as this procedure is, there are others. And the Senator from Pennsylvania would ban this one procedure, if I am not mistaken, at any stage in the pregnancy. Many of us believe that this issue should be addressed in a different manner. 
When it comes to the issue of late-term abortions, allow me to try to explain what I mean when I use that term. In the Roe v. Wade decision--I believe in 1972, if I am not mistaken--the Court, the Supreme Court across the street, divided a pregnancy into three sections, three different trimesters, three different periods of 3 months and basically said in the first two trimesters, the first 6 months of the pregnancy, that they would give the paramount right to the woman to make the decision whether she continued the pregnancy. They made it clear that in the third trimester, the end of the pregnancy, that the State would be able to impose restrictions. 
They drew a distinction between that time when the fetus could survive outside the mother's womb and that time when it could not. And if it could not--the previability phase--then they felt that this was more a decision for the woman to make. After viability, that is, the ability of the fetus to survive outside the womb, then the State--the Government--could step in and say, `We will limit the circumstances under which a woman can seek an abortion.' 
Unfortunately, the bill before us today does not make that distinction. It does not draw that line. I fear it is fatally flawed from a constitutional viewpoint, from the viewpoint of the case of Roe v. Wade which guides us in this debate. As a result, I am not certain that this bill, even if it were enacted over the President's veto, would survive a Court test. I believe the Court has said repeatedly, `We are serious about drawing that line.' This particular bill does not draw that line. 
Having said that, though, let me tell you that I am not going to engage this debate just on pure legalisms and interpretations of Roe v. Wade. Let me go to the real question before us. Let me try to address some of the points which the Senator from Pennsylvania has made. 
I am not a medical doctor. Some Members of Congress are; I am not. When I hear medical doctors say that this procedure, this partial-birth abortion procedure, is never medically necessary, I take that very seriously. 
Recently, in the Chicago Tribune, in my home State of Illinois, a professor from, I believe, Notre Dame University, Douglas Kmiec--I hope I am pronouncing it correctly--wrote an article on July 27 in which he quoted a man whom I respect very much, C. Everett Koop, a medical doctor who served as our Surgeon General and who I have worked with closely on the tobacco issue. He quoted Dr. Koop as saying that this medical procedure, this `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.' 
As I said, such a statement from a medical doctor, and someone of Dr. Koop's reputation, I take very seriously. As a result, I came back to my office and wrote a letter the following day, on July 28, 1998, to a group which I respect, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists here in Washington, DC. I did not try to color this letter or to influence their reply in any way. I wrote to them and said, `Tell me, is Dr. Koop right? Is this abortion procedure never medically necessary?'

Mr. DURBIN. Let me speak to the contents of this letter, because I think it is an important letter when we consider the medical debate here--not the legal or political debate but the medical debate. 
Dr. Hale wrote to me: 
Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July 28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to Dr. Koop's statement that `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.' 
Dr. Hale goes on to say: 
The College's position on this is contained in a statement of policy entitled `Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction.' 
That term, `intact dilation and extraction,' is the technical medical term for what we term `partial-birth abortion.' 
Dr. Hale goes on to say: 
In that statement we say, `Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' It continues, `A select panel convened by [the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists] could identify no circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.' 
The statement goes on to say, 
An intact D&X, [partial-birth abortion] however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman . . . 
And listen closely, 
. . . and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. 
For this reason, we have consistently opposed the partial-birth abortion ban legislation. 
He encloses the statement in full. 
So what are we to do? Members of the Senate have conflicting medical opinions here. Some medical associations in my home State, some doctors whom I respect, like Dr. Koop, feel that it is never necessary; and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it may be the best or most appropriate procedure and only the doctor can decide. 
It puts us in a dilemma. Some think it is an easy call--never will we need it; never should we use it. Then you read from the doctors who work with these women who have come upon complications in their pregnancy that they never expected. 
When this matter was first debated, I met a woman from a suburb of Chicago, from the Naperville area, who has been kind enough or brave enough to come forward and explain what happened to her. Her situation opened my eyes to the fact that this debate is not as easy as it sounds. She was the mother of a child, pregnant with another child, and had determined through ultrasound that she was about to have a little baby boy. She and her husband had picked out a name. She had painted the nursery. They had bought the furniture. They were ready and expecting parents, only to learn late in the pregnancy that the child suffered from a serious deformity which precluded the possibility that it would survive after birth, and that the continued pregnancy could jeopardize her health or her ability to ever have another child. 
I spoke to her about what happened after the doctor made that diagnosis. She spoke of sitting up all night crying with her husband over what they were to do. They did not believe in abortion. Yet what a terrible dilemma they faced. Continue the pregnancy at the risk to her health, at the risk of never having another baby, or terminate the pregnancy of a fetus, a baby--whatever term you use--that could not survive. They made the decision to go ahead with the procedure that would be banned by this legislation. 
She told me that story. Then she introduced me to her new baby in the stroller she was pushing. They made the decision to go forward and look to the future with another baby. 
I won't presume that everyone listening to this debate would have made that same decision. Others might have seen it quite differently. In her case, she thought she and her husband, with their doctor, did the right thing, and their decision resulted in another baby boy that they are very proud of and happy to have brought on this Earth. 
So the belief that many people engage in this procedure for casual reasons--at least in this case--did not apply. We have to take care in this debate that when we ban certain procedures and say doctors can never use them, we apply them to all situations, including the one that I have just described. 
Here is what I think we should do. I will vote to sustain the President's veto. I don't know if I will prevail or whether the Senator from Pennsylvania will prevail. But I hope that we can leave this debate without saying that they have had another wild debate in Washington, the issue went unresolved, and they will probably return to that same debate next year--we have done that year after year after year. 
A number of us, today, came forward and said that we hoped that we could take this debate to another position, another level, a more constructive level, I hope, after we consider this legislation. I joined Senators in the press gallery today who have agreed to be original cosponsors of legislation which I have introduced. This is legislation that is supported by Democrats and Republicans: Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Republicans of Maine; Democrats Torricelli, Mikulski, Robert Graham, Landrieu, and Lieberman are my cosponsors on this legislation. I hope that in introducing this bill we can move this debate to another level, a different level, and one that is not inconsistent with the philosophy of my friend from Pennsylvania. 
What we attempt to do in this bill is say the following: Let us restrict all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure--whether it uses this procedure or some other procedure--to two specific examples: Situations where the life of the mother is at stake--in other words, if she learned in the seventh, eighth, or ninth month of pregnancy that if she continued the pregnancy she would die; or situations where that same mother learns late in the pregnancy that if she continues the pregnancy she runs the risk of grievous injury to her physical health, like the case that I just described. Those are the only exceptions. No other reasons. 
It is not a question of being depressed or changing your mind--as if anybody would make a decision on an abortion for that matter. I don't know that they ever would, but it is specifically prohibited under this law. 
And we say that not only the doctor who performs the abortion must certify these medical circumstances, but in addition, a second nontreating doctor must be brought in. He or she must certify in writing that these medical conditions exist. Then and only then could there be any abortion procedure, including this one, in a late-term pregnancy. 
We believe this is a constructive and, I hope, promising approach. It builds on an amendment offered last year by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, one that I supported. We have added the second doctor's opinion because criticisms were raised--I didn't agree with them--that the doctor who performed the abortion might make a certification that was dishonest. We think the second doctor's opinion will argue against that. 
The penalties involved in this are very serious. A doctor who would ignore the law which we seek to have enacted in the bill which we will introduce today faces a fine of $100,000 for the first instance, and a possible loss of his medical license. In the second case, a fine of $250,000 and the loss of his medical license. 
I don't know how you can be more serious than the approach we have taken, to say we want to make certain that late-term abortions are limited to these situations. 
Some people have asked, Why don't you just vote for the bill that is before the Senate as well as your own? I cannot do that. The reason I cannot do it is because there is no provision made in the bill offered before the Senate for cases where a woman discovers late in her pregnancy that to continue the pregnancy would present the risk of grievous injury to her physical health. There is a life-of-the-mother exception, but no exception for grievous injury to physical health. That is the reason I will vote to sustain the President's veto. Later today, at the appropriate time, I will introduce the legislation which I have coauthored and described. 
Let me say in closing that I respect the Senator from Pennsylvania and his views and I respect those who disagree with him. I believe this debate is a debate over an issue of conscience and one that many of us struggle with on a regular basis. I hope that what we have tried to do today on a bipartisan basis, to suggest an alternative approach, could lead us away from this long-term debate, to a resolution in a fair and humane manner. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say I am happy to support this amendment. I am happy to be a cosponsor with my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch. I had prepared an amendment on this subject and I am happy to join him in making this a bipartisan effort. 
I will not take any time because I know a number of Members have to return to their families this evening, but I concur with him, with the increased number of Americans over the age of 50 filing for bankruptcy, this is a problem which we should address and address directly. It is not only to the benefit of senior citizens who are saving for their own retirement, it is certainly to the benefit of their families who are concerned that they be allowed to live in independence and security in their retirement years. We have traditionally given special consideration to 401(k) plans. This amendment will extend that consideration to IRAs and other vehicles that allow people to put savings away for their future retirement. 
I am happy to support this and I am happy to say that the amendment which I offered, and I am sure this one as well, had the support of the American Association of Retired Persons and virtually every major senior citizens group in the country. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island. 
Recently, some credit card issuers have started to discriminate against people who pay off their account balances each month, and, therefore, don't incur finance charges for the credit card purchases. These issuers charge such customers a monthly fee, or they actually terminate the customer's account. 
The Reed amendment would prohibit credit card issuers from charging a fee, or terminating an account based solely on the customer's failure to go into debt to incur finance charges. 
Let me tell you why I think this is a good idea. 
Industry experts have concluded that many issuers of these cards have been actively discouraging consumers from paying off balances by lowering their monthly minimum payments, and, in some cases, requiring as little as 2 percent of the balance on their credit card debt each month. Think of how long it would take to pay off your credit card under such circumstances. At such a rate, it could take 34 years, in fact, to pay off a $2,500 credit card balance, with payments totalling 300 percent of the original principal. 
In fact, about 40 percent of American credit card holders pay their balances in full each month, thus incurring no interest charges. Such `convenience users' are considered freeloaders by these credit card companies--even deadbeats. They want people to go into debt. They want us to pay finance charges as much as possible every single month. Some credit card companies charge annual fees and other techniques to discourage this type of credit card use. 
I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island is a good one. I will support it on the floor. I believe that the credit card companies should understand that if some people are unable to make their monthly payments, and thus, incur additional expenses, so, too, there are people who really do pay off their debts as they are incurred, and in so doing these people should not be penalized. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. 
I would like to ask several brief questions to clear up this debate.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, because I think there have been some things said on the floor which mischaracterize his amendment. 
This debate has had a lot of reference to personal responsibility. We ought to keep a board up here to check off every time someone says `personal responsibility.' We are talking about bankruptcy, and I think people who go into bankruptcy court should be personally responsible. I agree. Most Democrats agree. Most Republicans agree. There are some people abusing the bankruptcy system. We ought to change it. 
The purpose of this bill is to tighten it up so that the abusers cannot take advantage of bankruptcy to the disadvantage of everybody else in America. 
But in addition to personal responsibility, can't we discuss corporate responsibility here? Don't the credit card companies have some responsibility to make certain that they don't offer risky credit, luring children and people who are unwitting into credit situations, and then watching it topple over them? Those same credit card companies which come to us and say, once these people have fallen deep in debt, once they have all this credit card debt that they can't get out of, and go to bankruptcy court, be strict and tough with them--I agree with that, but shouldn't we also have a standard which says these companies should be responsible in dealing with American consumers? 
Senator Dodd offers an amendment which is timely. Listen to this. Bankruptcies among those under the age of 25 have doubled in the last 5 years. It is estimated that a college student in the first few months on campus will receive 50 solicitations for credit cards. A student without virtually any income is going to be that target customer. As Senator Dodd has said over and over again, too many kids who are lured into easy credit before they have an income or the maturity to handle it end up deeply in debt, and many of them jeopardize their education as a result of it. 
The Senator from Alabama said he wanted his children to have a credit card at college. I wanted mine to have one as well. He would have gladly signed for that. I would have as well. That is exactly what the Dodd amendment says. If a parent will put a signature on the line, the credit card is there for the college student. 
But I salute the Senator from Connecticut. I support his amendment. I think we are talking about corporate responsibility and personal responsibility.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from the State of California. 
Let me say at the outset that this is about more money for California schools. It is about more money for land and water conservation, which funds the acquisition of park space and green space across America. It is about more money for historic preservation. It is about more money for Indian tribes, Native Americans, who receive benefits from these royalties. This is about a matter of principle on which the Senator from California is taking the floor to lead the fight. I salute her at the outset, and say to those who are listening to this debate that we are fortunate to have people of the caliber of Senator Boxer from the State of California who are willing to wage these battles, because, you see, it would have been so easy for us to really kind of look the other way with a wink and nod and let this one slip by. 
This is not an issue that went before a committee with a lot of investigation, witnesses and hearings so that America could tune in and be part of the debate. This was done on a disaster bill for tornado victims--a bill that was also designed to buy emergency funds for our troops in the Middle East. 
You say, What could that possibly have to do with the royalties oil companies pay for drilling on Federal land? The honest answer is that it had nothing to do with it. It was put on at a late moment with no hearings and with little publicity. 
I have been around legislatures for about 32 years--State and Federal. I can tell you there are two things to keep your eye open for toward the close of business: find out if there is something that just got popped on a bill without any hearings, and find out whether it benefits some large special interest group. Guess what? Bingo. That is what we are talking about here. Senator Boxer caught it, brought it up in the Appropriations Committee, and said to her colleagues, Please don't do this. At least for the taxpayers of this country, take a close look at what is going on here. 
I salute her for doing that. Her leadership is important, and this issue is important. It is about $66 million a year. And I guess by Federal standards people say, wait a minute, in a budget that is dealing with $1.5 trillion, what does this mean? 
Well, it means a lot, because for schoolchildren in her State and a lot of other States and for the people I mentioned earlier who are dependent on these royalties, this is an important amount of money. 
I think what is more important than the money involved is the principle that is involved in this. Consider for a moment, you own a piece of property and someone comes to you and says, `I want to rent from you under one condition, and that is I decide how much rent I am going to pay you.' Well, you say, `Well, at least let's have some standard. Let's have some objective standard.' And they said, `Yes, I will tell you what the objective standard will be. I will ask my Uncle Louie what's fair.' And you say to yourself, `Why would we sign such a lease?' 
That is what has happened here. The land that they are drilling for oil on is land that we own, ladies and gentlemen. It is the land of the people of the United States. It is not land owned by oil companies. They come on our land with our permission to drill oil from our land to make profits for their companies. That is what this is all about. And we say to them, `Make a profit. That's fine. That's the American way. But we want one-eighth of your profit. We want one-eighth of the cost of the oil.' Those who are involved in the oil business know that is not an unusual request. The owner of the land gets an eighth. 
The problem here is that the oil companies have said, `We will determine an eighth of what. We will determine what Uncle Louie says is an eighth.' And in this situation they won't take a market price that they are supposed to take. They take a price they have absolutely fabricated. They have made it up. They trade among themselves. They post prices and say, `This is the price,' and we know better. 
The charts the Senator from California brought to us make it clear the taxpayers are being cheated, because a handful of oil companies are declaring a price that they are basing the royalty on which is a phony, false price. State after State has turned around and sued them successfully for this sort of cheating. And now we are trying to promulgate a law here on Capitol Hill in the Senate which condones this cheating, saying, `Keep on reaching in Uncle Sam's pocket, pull out all the money you need, play us for Uncle Sucker, and we are going to look the other way.' 
I do not think we should do that. I do not think that is fair to a lot of people. And I really am, in a way, surprised that a lot of oil companies that have extraordinarily good business reputations would be involved in this chicanery. 
I listened to the Senator from New Mexico give a speech. His speech is, as far as I am concerned, very accurate. The oil industry in this country does suffer some problems, particularly independent producers. They come from my State. Illinois is not a major production State, but we have a lot of producers there who have come to see me. And it is a fact that the price of oil and the products of oil are so low that many of them cannot survive. It has domestic and international ramifications; I don't question that. But to argue that that situation with the oil industry in general means that we should give a handful of oil companies, 5 percent of them, an opportunity to reach in the Federal Treasury and pull more money out at the expense of taxpayers begs the question. If you let this 5 percent turn around and absolutely drill the oil for free and not pay the taxpayers a penny, it would not create a recovery in the oil sector. I am afraid that is what the other side is arguing. We are dealing with a small percentage here. 
And let me tell you what these royalties mean to these large companies that are drilling on taxpayers' land. The additional royalties represent approximately 1-100th of 1 percent of the $461 billion in 1996 revenues for these companies. We have crocodile tears in the Chamber here about these struggling oil companies at a time when we look at their balance sheets, and many of them are making billions of dollars and would say to the taxpayers of this country, `No, we can't pay you a royalty based on the real market price; we want to create some fiction.' And so not in the dark of night but in the darkness of a conference committee room, along comes a provision which basically says the Department of Interior may not investigate, may not determine whether there is fairness in the price that is being charged. No. The Senate of the United States will shut them down and tell them, keep their noses out of these corporate boardrooms.

Mr. DURBIN. I am happy that the Senator from California brought up the point, and I have this in my possession. I do not believe we can allow these major oil companies to hide behind the skirts of these independent oil producers who are struggling to survive. 
A letter from Secretary Babbitt that was sent to USA Today on this subject says that his data tells an entirely different story. 
Business is booming in the Gulf of Mexico. The industry recently paid more than $1.3 for new deep water leases in the gulf. Published reports claim there are more jobs available than workers to fill them. 
This is hardly an industry on its knees. And we are talking here about those who will come on our land, the taxpayers' land, the Federal land, draw oil from our land to make a profit, who are unwilling to pay a fair share of that profit back to the taxpayers of this country. 
Right outside of this Chamber in the corridor is the bust of a man who I consider to be a real inspiration in public life, Theodore Roosevelt. I would like to hear Theodore Roosevelt in this debate. If you take a look at this bust here, if you have a chance to see it, it looks like he is about to charge right off the pedestal; that is the kind of man he was. And then when you read the sign below it, it says they picked the more common, thoughtful pose; there was one that was more aggressive. I can imagine Theodore Roosevelt in this Chamber talking about the public lands and the exploitation of these lands by special interest groups and big corporations at the expense of the taxpayers of this country. 
I might say to my friend from New Mexico, I believe that that Senator, if he were one, would have been on your side of the aisle making our argument, and thank goodness he was there to set the tone in this century for the profit relationship between corporations and the public good. Thank goodness the Senator from California has the courage to stand up here and take on the oil giants when it comes to this issue. 
This is simple and straightforward. Will the taxpayers receive a fair amount from those who would come on our land to drill oil from the taxpayers' resources and whether or not this is going to pass. 
I say to my colleague from California and those who support her that she has taken on an important issue, one that is critically important not just for the money for those who would receive it but one principle: If this position that is being espoused by the other side is so right and so good, why did we not have a hearing? Why did this not come before us with witnesses so that all could hear both sides of the stories, that the oil companies' executives who are making these billions of dollars could sit there in the chairs before the cameras and the microphones and explain it? 
They could not face the music. They could not take that kind of scrutiny, and neither can this program. Let the Department of the Interior go forward on behalf of the taxpayers. Let them make sure that we receive a fair amount for those who would take profits from America's lands. 
I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the time back to the Senator from California.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am fortunate to be a Senator representing the great State of Illinois, the great city of Chicago, at great ballpark named Wrigley Field. 
Yesterday afternoon it was my good fortune to see at least part of the very historic game, a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers, which will now be part of baseball history. It was a game attended by 40,846 fans at Wrigley Field, and several hundred of us on the rooftops and around the field watched and marveled. Not only was it a great baseball game with the Cubs' victory, but it was a historic game for a very important person. Any newspaper you picked up in Chicago, or Illinois, or perhaps across the country, this morning let everyone in on the fact that baseball history was made yesterday in Wrigley Field. 
Paul Sullivan, a Tribune staff writer for the Chicago Tribune put it in lyric words that I would like to read: 
With the shadows creeping over the right field vines, and the crowd on its tiptoes, Sosa took hold of an Eric Plunk fastball in the ninth inning and sent it screaming onto Waveland Avenue for number 62, in the greatest home run chase the game has ever seen. 
I was happy to be there and to see home run 62. I am happy to represent the State which has in it such a fine man playing as Sammy Sosa. We are really blessed--those of us who follow baseball--to have this wonderful home run derby, and have two extraordinary individuals involved in it. 
Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals also sent 62 home runs this year, eclipsing the record of Babe Ruth, as well as Roger Maris. It is good to know that Mark McGwire is a good person. He announced early in the season that he would be donating $1 million of his salary this year for those children who have been physically and sexually abused. He has a heart, and he has shown it many times. 
Then there is Sammy Sosa, from the Dominican Republic. 
If you will recall the scene last week when Mark McGwire was breaking the record to be the first to do so, there was Sammy Sosa in right field. He could not have been more supportive and more congratulatory. There is a true friendship between the men. 
As Mark McGwire received all of this attention and adulation, Sammy was there to cheer him on. Yesterday, Sammy Sosa matched Mark McGwire with 62 home runs. He continued to praise him as a friend and hoped that they both had good luck in this home run derby in the remaining games. 
It tells us a lot about baseball. It tells us a lot about these two men. 
Sammy Sosa comes from particularly humble beginnings, starting off in the Dominican Republic. One of my favorite quotes during the course of the season is someone went to Sammy Sosa and said, `Aren't you under a lot of stress because of this race for the home run title?' And he said, `You think this is stressful, earning a living as a shoeshine boy in the Dominican Republic is stressful.' He put it all in perspective. 
He has been gracious and friendly. He has been a true sportsman throughout this race. He deserves our praise and our cheers as well. 
All of us watch anxiously for the closing games to see who ends up with the ultimate home run record. 
For those of us who are fortunate to love the game and to be watching it closely in 1998, I want to say my hat is off to Mark McGwire and especially to Sammy Sosa, who yesterday with two towering home runs over left field and into Waveland Avenue, really brought Chicago to its feet, cheering this man and all that he stands for. 
I am hoping now that they will continue this race to set the record and to put the great American pastime back on its feet. I think they have done a lot for it. 
I wish them both the very best. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President. 
During the course of this debate on the bankruptcy bill, we will be talking about a number of aspects of this procedure. When you consider a nation of 260 million Americans, and I guess about 1.3 or 1.4 million each year file bankruptcy, the vast majority of people who may be watching this debate have no personal knowledge of the subject. Of course, some lawyers and people who are involved in credit counseling do, but, unfortunately for a lot of unsuspecting people, bankruptcy becomes a critical part of their lives. Senator Grassley and I are attempting to change the bankruptcy code in a way that is fair, that will reduce abusive bankruptcies, but still allow the procedure to be available to those who truly need it. 
Let me give an example of one of the amendments which I have offered, or will offer if given the opportunity, which I think tells an important story about bankruptcy; that is, the whole question about retirement funds. Creditors want those who file for bankruptcy to pay their creditors every penny they have, often including retirement savings. If you are 54 years old and you have some IRAs, some 401(k) plans that you are putting aside for your own retirement and then lose your job after 30 years due to a merger or downsizing, or if someone in your family--a spouse or a child--incurs major medical bills and you find yourself facing literally tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and find you can't pay your bills, you may be forced into bankruptcy. What may be at stake is not only the money you have on hand, but the money you have saved for your retirement. 
Under current law, if you filed for bankruptcy, they go after everything except the 401(k) plan. So if you put aside these individual retirement accounts or Roth IRAs thinking, `Someday I will need this to supplement Social Security,' you will be shocked to learn that the creditors--the hospitals and doctors or whoever it might be--are going to say, `I'm sorry, but that IRA is now something that I can take away from you to pay off your bills.' 
That is why I think this amendment which I am going to introduce is so necessary. Current law puts Americans with financial problems in a Catch 22 situation: Either declare bankruptcy and go into poverty in old age, or don't declare bankruptcy and live in poverty now with creditors harassing you because your current bills and health care costs sap your entire income. 
This amendment that I want to offer to the bill, one of several, ensures that retirement savings survive a bankruptcy proceeding intact. The funds will be preserved to provide for your care and expenses in old age, rather than being paid to creditors who are unwilling to compromise when meeting this financial setback. It also provides that if you took a loan from your retirement savings, for example, to fund a downpayment on your house, you will have to pay yourself back by payroll deduction, uninterrupted by the bankruptcy. 
I think there are reasons to support this amendment. It is a good indication of why some amendments are needed on this bill. Think about the gravity of this situation and challenge. The retirement savings of hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans are at risk in bankruptcy proceedings. In 1997, an estimated 280,000 older Americans--that is, age 50 and older; and I am included in that group--filed bankruptcy; though I didn't file bankruptcy. Almost one in five bankruptcy cases, 18.5 percent, involve one or both petitioners coming to court who are 50 years of age or older. 
What are the top three reasons Americans give for filing for bankruptcy? Job loss, overwhelming medical expenses, and a creditor's refusal to work out repayment plans. Nearly 50 percent of older Americans declare bankruptcy because they lost their job at or about the age of 50. At this age, it is a tough situation to find another job that pays as well. It can be catastrophic to an entire family. 
Parents may have kids in college, elderly parents to care for, a house that may need a new roof, and a family that may have overwhelming medical expenses. About 30 percent of older Americans filing bankruptcy due to family medical bills that are completely beyond their capacity to pay. You should not have to choose between your family's health and your financial security in your old age. One in ten older Americans files bankruptcy because their creditors have refused to work with them to pay their bills. One in fifteen older Americans files bankruptcy to save a home they are about to lose. 
Young people really are protected by this amendment, as well, when retirement funds are set aside over a person's working career to provide them with privately funded care in their old age. My mother lived to the age of 87, and she always said time and time again, for years and years, `I just don't want to be a burden on you and your brothers.' She never was, but she was always worried about it. She saved carefully, so that there was money set aside, so that if something happened, she would be able to take care of herself and would not have to turn to us. 
I think that is the feeling of many senior citizens who put aside savings in IRAs and 401(k) plans, so they can be independent and live a life that doesn't take away from their children. 
But think about it. If something comes along, like a catastrophic illness, you have reached the limit on your health insurance policy, and all of a sudden debts are cascading around you and bankruptcy is the only option, you lose everything you saved--and independence is important to all of us, and particularly to those in their senior years. 
Security in retirement can only be achieved through the accumulation of assets over a working lifetime. Retirement funds should not be at risk simply because of an unexpected layoff or medical problems, sending a debt-strapped family over the financial edge. I don't think this amendment is subject to abuse, because debtors can't really sock away money in a retirement account just before filing for bankruptcy. Retirement plan contributions are heavily regulated and limited by law and not subject to bankruptcy planning abuse. Debtors have been criticized for poor management skills, but they should be rewarded, not penalized, for making rational economic decisions, like preparing for retirement. 
Who supports this amendment? The AARP, American Association for Retired Persons, National Council of Senior Citizens, the Profit Sharing 401(k) Council of America, the National Council on Teacher Retirement, and the New York State Teachers Retirement System, just to name a few. 
My reason for explaining this amendment is that there is debate underway here as to whether we will allow amendments to the bankruptcy bill. This is an illustration of the type of amendment that I think is important, so that we make certain that this reform of the bankruptcy code recognizes the reality of life in America. We want to protect the retirement funds of those who have been careful enough to save, who could never even have anticipated an economic calamity such as I have described. We want to make certain that they are given a chance to come through bankruptcy not only with dignity but with a chance to lead a good life. 
There are other elements to be considered as well. I would like to address one or two of them before giving the floor back to Senator Grassley of Iowa. 
We have talked a lot about those who file for bankruptcy. I think it is important that this be a balanced discussion, so that we talk about those who, frankly, are using the credit system in this country to make a great deal of money. Credit cards are one of the most profitable areas of financial endeavor in America. Those who have taken a close look at the interest rates they pay on credit cards understand why. If you happen to be late in making a monthly payment and the balance is held over another month, sometimes the interest rates can be dramatic in comparison to what we pay for mortgages and other loans, like automobile loans. The interest rates, many times, on unsecured debt, like credit card debt, can be substantial. 
Unfortunately, I don't believe many credit card companies or other financial institutions are as honest as they should be with American consumers. I will bet most of the people who are listening to this debate will open their mailboxes up today and find a preapproved application for a credit card. We know we are going to find them whenever we go home. If you look at it, you will understand that nobody has analyzed your credit situation. They have basically said: Here is another $100,000 in debt that you can run up if you like, at an interest rate that you may be able to pick out in the fine print on the back of the solicitation. 
I visited a football game in Illinois last year where they were passing out free T-shirts to any student at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, who would take an official University of Illinois credit card. They ran out of T-shirts because the students could not wait to get them. Most of these students ended up with credits cards, most without much income. 
We don't want to limit opportunities, but we do want honest disclosure. At that particular football game, the credit card company offering this credit card had posted on a banner behind the little booth, `Permanent introductory rate, 5.9 percent.' Think about that for a minute. `Permanent introductory rate'? How does that work? Clearly, at some point in time you are through the introductory period and into a new rate. 
I think it is important that there be an honest disclosure of the interest rate people will be charged on credit cards, so that on the myriad--perhaps dozens--of credit card solicitations you receive, you can make the right choice, not just the come-on rate, the attractive 6 percent or something on the envelope. What are you really going to be charged as an interest rate? 
I think the credit card companies owe it to us as well to send us, along with the credit card application, a worksheet so that people can say: Let me see, exactly where am I? How many debts do I owe? How much income do I have? Does this worksheet give me an indication as to whether I should go further in debt? I don't think that is unreasonable. 
I also think the monthly billings we receive from many of the credit card companies are a mystery to try to figure out, what they mean and what it means if we make certain payments. For example, there will be an amendment offered here, I believe, by the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, which will say that you cannot have your credit card canceled if you pay off the entire balance each month. Many people are surprised to learn that. They make the payment and say, `I am a good customer.' Obviously, they got their bill and paid it. But then the company says: `We are not interested in your business anymore. If you are not going to carry a debt and pay us interest from time to time, or regularly, then we don't want you as a customer.' They don't disclose that when you get the card. But you may find that out later on. 
Also, if you look at the monthly statement, it says `minimum monthly payment.' Well, I think there are some obvious questions that should be answered when they say `minimum monthly payment.' If I make that minimum monthly payment, how many months will it take me to pay off the balance if I don't add another penny of debt? How much will I be paying in interest? Those are not unreasonable questions. I think the average consumer should have the answer right there on the monthly statement. 
I looked at my own credit card recently just to see what the minimum monthly payment might result in. It resulted in my paying off the balance in a mere 60 months--5 years. That is paying off the current balance with a minimum monthly payment. 
The time may come when an individual can't pay off the credit card on a regular basis. They may have a problem and fall behind. That is understandable where the minimum monthly payment may be the only thing they can come up with. I think we have to educate consumers so they don't fall into this trap. 
There is another element here that I have learned during the course of this debate. Some people are surprised to know that once they have the credit card in hand and make a purchase, if you have a debt that they are trying to pursue in bankruptcy, the credit card company not only has recourse against you personally but has recourse against whatever items you purchased with the credit card. Surprise, surprise. You turned around and bought a television or a stereo with the credit card, thinking that that was the way you were going to own it, and you get into bankruptcy court and they say that the fine print in the contract says, `We now own the television.' I think that should be disclosed. People ought to know that going in. That is another example, in my mind, of the kind of activity that would lead to a more level playing field. 
Those critical of the increases in filings for bankruptcy, I think, have some good cause for alarm. There are too many. If we can reduce abusive filings, we should. The average person filing for bankruptcy in America has an income of less than $18,000 a year and average debts of $28,000. So the people we find in bankruptcy court are not the wheelers and dealers and high rollers; they are folks in lower- to middle-income situations who have run into a mountain of debt that they can't cope with. I don't want to see this bill penalize those people. I want to make certain that we are careful that whatever we do does not stop them from coming to court and trying to finally discharge their debts and start again. 
There is another element in this bill which I think deserves some consideration and discussion. It is called the homestead exemption. 
Under a curiosity in the law, each State can determine how much we can have in a homestead exemption, which means if I go into bankruptcy court in my home State of Illinois and file for bankruptcy, they have decided by statute in that State that the maximum amount which I can claim as the value of my home--I can't recall the exact figure in Illinois, but it is relatively modest. Some States have gone off the charts. That is why we had a couple of instances where noteworthy figures--one a former commissioner of baseball, another a former Governor of one of our States--before filing for bankruptcy, moved to, in this case Florida, and in the other case Texas, and bought million-dollar homes which were exempt under State law. They took everything that they had and plowed it into the home and filed for bankruptcy. The creditors ended up with little or nothing. Thank goodness this bill, because of the amendment offered by Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, is going to eliminate what I consider to be a clever loophole and an abuse in the law. 
Should this bill that Senator Grassley and I are working on pass the Senate, we will face a battle in conference because the House of Representatives eliminated that provision and allows each State to set whatever standard they want. I don't think that is fair. I think we ought to have a national standard. We shouldn't have people racing off to establish residency in some State to take advantage of a very generous homestead exemption. That is not fair to creditors. I hope that as a part of this debate we will preserve that important element in the law. 
At this time, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that it is tough to follow the Senator from Minnesota. Senator Wellstone brings to this body extraordinary talent, and more than that, a conviction and fervent commitment to principle that all of us admire so greatly. 
His first campaign for the U.S. Senate was legendary. He was a college professor, I believe, in a small college in Minnesota. He put himself on a school bus--an old, beaten up school bus--and traveled all around the State of Minnesota. He was dramatically outspent by a gentleman who had formerly served in the U.S. Senate, and, yet, prevailed. 
His presence on the floor of the Senate indicates his reelection to the U.S. Senate and to the fact that there are Members of the Senate who can basically break the rules. He wasn't supposed to win. You are not supposed to have a chance when somebody outspends you 6 or 7 to 1. It might raise some question in some people's minds. Why we are even debating this if someone like Paul Wellstone can win when he is being so dramatically outspent? Why do we need campaign finance reform? It is just because of the fact that Paul Wellstone, unfortunately, is the exception to the rule. The rule is that at the end of a campaign, if you take a look at the amount of money spent by a candidate, in most instances--the overwhelming majority of instances--the candidate, whether it is the incumbent or the challenger, who spends more money will prevail, will win the election. 
That really tells the story of why this bill--the McCain-Feingold bill--the only bipartisan campaign finance reform bill, is so important, because it strikes at the heart of this money chase. 
Think about this last Presidential election in 1996--incumbent President Bill Clinton v. Senator Robert Dole, two extraordinarily talented men with a background in public service running for the highest office in the land. They traversed America from one side to the other. They were on every newscast every night. They debated with frequency. There was a great exchange on issues, and a real difference of opinion on many important questions. 
We in America--at least the politicians--were focused on a daily basis. 
Then came the election in November of 1996. Something historic occurred. I am not talking about who won and lost. What was historic was the fact that we had the lowest percentage turnout of eligible voters casting ballots in the Presidential election than we had in 72 years in America. Think of it. Despite all of the publicity, and all of the attention, when the election day came, Americans--American voters--stayed home. 
Let me amend that for a moment. 
The reason why 72 years applies is that 72 years before 1996 was the first election in American history when women were eligible to vote, and many did not. If you would take that particular election in 1924 out of the picture, you have to go back into the early part of the 19th century to see a lower turnout of eligible voters. Is that important? Does it mean anything that voters stayed home; that they have decided for the most important election in America that they wouldn't participate? I think it means everything in a democracy, because the voters--the citizens of this country--will not even come forward to express their choice in an election. It is not only a sad commentary on our democracy. It is a threat to our democracy. 
The McCain-Feingold bill goes to the heart of the problem. Why did people stay home? Did they assume they already knew the results? That is possible. But I think a lot of them were sickened by this political process. They looked at the way that, in this case, men ran for President; and men and women ran or not for the House and Senate. They basically said, `We don't care to participate in it. Our family is going to stay home.' And they did. 
What was it about those election campaigns? Was it the groveling that all of us as candidates who were not independently wealthy had to do to raise the money to be viable? 
I think that is part of it. I think that is the big part of it. They wonder how a man or a woman aspiring to serve in this body, or the House, can raise literally millions of dollars without dirtying themselves in the process, without sacrificing their own principles and values. They become increasingly skeptical of politicians in general, and the candidates up for election in particular. 
There is another element, too--the advertising that we put on television during the course of the campaign. A lot of people are turned off by it. Most campaigns hire sophisticated people to make those ads. They hire pollsters who go out and take legitimate samples of American opinion--samples within a given State--and convert those samples into messages; 30-second messages that go up on television. Some of the messages are positive. Some are negative. It is the negative ones that unfortunately give us the bad name and lead a lot of people to say that this process itself is so fundamentally flawed. 
This McCain-Feingold bill has one more aspect. And one important aspect of that says when it comes to these so-called independent expenditures--the issue advocacy ads--at the very minimum let us find out who these people are that are paying for the ads. That is not too much to ask. Let me give you an illustration. 
The last time we debated this bill on the floor, I left the debate to go to a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee before which we had witnesses who were testifying on a variety of subjects, including the question of term limits. The term limits issue is fairly obvious. It says that we should limit--at least those people argue--that we should limit the number of terms served by Members of the U.S. Senate and Members of the House of Representatives. There is some surface appeal to this that has become a hot issue in a variety of elections. I know the issue myself personally, because in the closing days of my Senate race in the State of Illinois they spent about a quarter of a million dollars on TV ads criticizing me because I opposed the term limits proposal. And those ads were fairly effective. I won. But I had to deal with the criticism that they raised. 
So there sat before me this gentleman representing the term limits movement who said he agreed with the opponents of McCain-Feingold that we shouldn't reform our campaign finance system. I said to the gentleman representing the term limits movement, `Please, since I as a candidate have to disclose every penny that I raise, the source of the amount, and my political party has to do the same, I would like for your term limits movement, having spent millions of dollars to defeat or elect candidates to office, to do the same. Are you prepared to disclose to the American people the sources of the money that paid for those TV ads?' His answer in a word was `no.' 
Why wouldn't he make a full disclosure? His argument was--follow this one, if you will--that there would be retribution from elected officials whom they disagreed with. I don't buy it. 
Men and women organizations come forward on a regular basis to contribute to political campaigns. They understand they have taken a position for a man or woman running for office. The fear of retribution is part of the concern. But it is an illustration of how an organization with some high-sounding purpose like limiting terms for Members of the House and Senate can literally spend millions of dollars of mystery money and never make a full disclosure; never make any disclosure as to the source of those funds. 
Is it important? It could be. Who knows who is financing term limits in America? Is it one person? Is it one company? Is it one special interest group? That is a legitimate question. I can guarantee you that you will not see the term limits movement people standing around the shopping centers of America with kettles and bells asking for quarters and dimes. They don't do business that way. 
They deal in big checks from big players, big expenditures, to make a big impact on the system, and they are totally, totally unregulated. That to me is shameful. It is disgraceful. 
What is going on here in this debate on McCain-Feingold is an attempt to change the system, to clean it up, and to restore some character to our political process. I am at the same disadvantage as Senator Wellstone of Minnesota and Senator Feingold, one of the cosponsors, of Wisconsin. I was raised in a family that was not wealthy. I had a wealthy background in terms of values and education but not a lot of money. Fortunately, with good education and some good friends, I was able to start a career in public service. But now we find this new emerging phenomenon in American political life on both sides, Democrat and Republican, the so-called middle-aged, crazy millionaire who shows up on the scene bored with his life who decides he is tired of practicing law, he is tired of making lots of money in business and now has dreams of being Governor or Senator or you name it. They then take their personal wealth and, under the existing law, spend it to basically buy a campaign, buy their way into office. 
I think there are some genuinely good people who have done this, but I think we have to ask ourselves what will happen to this political process if more and more of this sort of person become the Representatives and Senators of America. I think we will lose something. We would lose something like a Patty Murray, who is a Senator from the State of Washington, who has a background of teaching in a classroom. I am glad Senator Patty Murray is on the floor of the Senate. When we discuss educational issues, I turn to Patty Murray. Time and again, I want her perspective because she has been there. She comes from a family of modest means, but she makes a great contribution because the voters in the State of Washington have allowed her to come to this floor. And when you look around this Chamber you find others, Democrats and Republicans, of similar backgrounds. Unless we are prepared to reform this campaign finance system, I am afraid it will become more elite, more plutocratic, if you will, and limited in terms of the types of people who do serve it. 
Let me also, in closing, note the procedural issue that we face here. This is an important issue. It was brought up before the Senate once before, and it was stopped. Some 57 Senators, if I am not mistaken, Democrats and Republicans, came forward saying they supported it, but in this body it really takes 60 in order to stop the filibuster. Sixty votes were not there. Campaign finance died. The House went through heroic efforts to bring this to the floor over the opposition of Speaker Gingrich. After weeks of debate, weeks of amendment, they passed it, and now this bill sits ready for our approval. 
Will we vote on it? That would seem the obvious thing. Let's vote on campaign finance reform, up or down. We are going to have it or we are not. If we can pass it, let's send it to the President. Let's try to make sure that we achieve at least one thing in this legislative session. And yet it is not likely we will ever see that opportunity. It is not likely because under the rules of the Senate procedurally you can basically stop a vote. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope we have an opportunity for the yeas and nays on this question, an up-or-down vote. Let the Senators of both parties be on record before they go home. Are they in favor of reform or would they want to obfuscate this issue, cover it up with rhetoric? Try to say to the voters back home: You just don't understand; it is much more complicated. 
I hope that doesn't occur. I hope that we will have the up-or-down vote. I hope the men and women of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, will cast their vote on this issue of campaign finance reform. I do believe what is at stake here is more than just a bipartisan bill. Senator McCain of Arizona and Senator Feingold of Wisconsin are the chief sponsors. At stake here is the question of the future of this democracy. We are just a few scant weeks away from an important election, an election which will ask the American people to make their choices again. 
I guess it sounds almost hackneyed now to talk about the legacy that we have in this country, that we so often take for granted. 
I can recall just a few years ago when I was given an opportunity to visit the tiny country where my mother was born, the country of Lithuania. Lithuania, which has for over 50 years been under Soviet domination, was given for the first time a chance at democracy, the first time in half a century. I was there as then-President Gorbachev sent in the tanks in an effort to quell this democratic movement, and, fortunately, he was not successful. People of that country risked their lives. They certainly risked their political futures because they wanted to vote. They wanted to elect their leaders. It was gratifying that they would invite me and others from the United States, because we represented to them what this was all about--democracy, the people speaking. 
I found it curious. As each one of these leaders would emerge in these new countries, they would visit around the world, but the first stop would always be right here in this 
building, on Capitol Hill, before a joint session of Congress. Whether it was Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel, the leaders of the Philippines and other places, in order to validate their democratic experiment, in order to come to what they considered to be the cradle of liberty, they came here to this building. They recognized in our country what many of our citizens are failing to recognize--what this democracy really means and what it is all about. 
There are some who will argue this issue and say that the speech I have just made is too idealistic, it is way beyond practical politics. They are right. It is about ideals. It is about the democratic ideals that are at stake if we don't reform this system. I hope those who oppose this bill will in all fairness give us a chance for an up-or-down vote. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, I am going to support this motion for cloture to proceed on the bill because I agree with my colleague and friend, the Senator from Iowa, that this is an important issue that should be addressed by this Congress. He has been eminently fair in all of his dealings with me on this legislation. Being a member of the abject minority, I appreciate that, and that sort of fairness I hope will be rewarded in the passage of a bankruptcy reform bill which both Senator Grassley and I will be proud of. 
I am hoping during the course of this debate we can point out those areas of the bill that need to be addressed and address them in a responsible way. I think this is, at its heart, a good bill. I think there are some elements of it which can be changed and improved to make it better. 
Let me address at the outset his frustration, and mine, too, over the fact that this bill may become a vehicle for other issues. First, why is this necessary? Why would any Senator want to come and put a measure such as an increase in the minimum wage on the bankruptcy bill? It does not seem to follow very closely. I guess there is some connection to it, but by and large you would think we could vote separately on the minimum wage bill. The honest answer is, we should. The honest answer is, we cannot. The Republican leadership refuses to afford an opportunity for many of the more serious measures that have been brought before this Congress to be considered. Some of my colleagues, in frustration, look for virtually any bill, 
any vehicle, to move important measures such as reform of HMOs, campaign finance reform, or an increase in the minimum wage. I hope, while Senator Grassley and I address the merits of this legislation, that the Republican and Democratic leadership in a bipartisan fashion can come to an agreement as to the proper time and place for us to consider important measures such as an increase in the minimum wage. 
Having said that, let me address the issue of bankruptcy reform. As I mentioned the other day, it is truly an area that deserves our attention. The dramatic increase in the filings in bankruptcy in America suggest that we should look at the bankruptcy system. We have tried to do that in the committee, both in the full committee and the subcommittee. We will address it again on the floor of the Senate. There are many people who have many explanations for the increase in the filings in bankruptcy. One of the most cogent explanations that I have found is demonstrated by this chart. 
Why do more people file for bankruptcy in a time when the American economy is expanding and more jobs have been created, people are building homes and starting businesses, and inflation is down? Why in the world would more people be filing for bankruptcy? I think this chart answers that question. Bankruptcy cases track consumer debt. As Americans become more deeply indebted, particularly unsecured debt--not their home or their car, but unsecured debt like credit card debt--they become more vulnerable. One bad occurrence in a person's life--the loss of a job, a divorce, a serious illness in the household --and they find themselves pushed over the edge. A lot of people find that as their debt increases they are more vulnerable to bankruptcy. 
Just look at this chart which tries to track the number of filings in bankruptcy per capita along with the debt-to-income ratio. It is no surprise to me that they are in lockstep. So the credit industry that comes to us and talks about bankruptcy reform must accept some share of responsibility for the increases in filing. 
Who are the people filing for bankruptcy? There are clearly exceptions to the rule, but if you look at the average person filing for bankruptcy, you will see that consistently the income of the person filing for bankruptcy has been descending, going down over the years; the average income in 1997, $17,652. These are people who are making less than $10 an hour who are filing for bankruptcy. So they are not the fat cats, the ones who are going to the canny attorneys who can find some way to bring them to bankruptcy court. These are genuinely low-income Americans. The average debt of the person filing for bankruptcy is about $28,000. That is the average. 
What this bill tries to address is not that average person but the person who is the exception filing for bankruptcy, the one who is, perhaps, trying to take advantage of the system. 
The reason this debate is important--and I hope my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, will note in the information that we have shared with him--is our belief that we should address not just the bill as it is written and some changes in it but some other aspects of this question. I do believe, as does Senator Sarbanes of Maryland and Senator Dodd of Connecticut, who are joining me in offering an amendment, that we should call on the credit card companies to accept more responsibility, too. If the people who are incurring debt are asked to be more responsible, so, too, should these companies. 
How many credit card solicitations have you received in the last month or two? You almost have to shovel them away from the mailbox. Whether you have asked for it or not, a lot of people want to offer you credit, perhaps more credit than you should have. Time and again, more people take these credit cards and get more deeply in debt and then struggle to find a way to pay for them. 
I also think we have to address the billing system, the minimum monthly payment on your credit card. I think the credit card companies should tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance and how much interest you will pay if you pay the minimum monthly amount. Is that unreasonable? I think it is only fair. It really gives a person at least some sobering message, perhaps, that they cannot continue to pay the minimum monthly balance and expect to ever come out of debt. 
Finally, you may not realize it but some of the credit cards that we own, when we go to charge on a purchase, establish a security interest. What does that mean? It means that if you find yourself in hard times, the credit card company can claim the item you purchased. You didn't know that? A lot of people do not. 
I don't think it is unreasonable that the credit card companies make that disclosure. 
We also want to make sure the credit card solicitations are done in an honest way. We find a lot of people, and some nonhumans, I might add, who are receiving credit card solicitations who should not--people who are mentally incompetent, people who are too young to own a credit card in any State. I think this needs to be cleaned up. 
We also need to protect retirement income in bankruptcy. If you file for bankruptcy, did you know your 401(k) plan is protected but your IRA is not? Why would that be? One of the amendments we are offering is to make sure that there is equal treatment of retirement income. 
We also want to change the area of farm bankruptcy. That has not been touched in 15 years, and it should be. 
In the area of reaffirmations, when it comes to the debts that the creditor should convince you that you shouldn't step away from, you should still accept responsibility for, let's make a level playing field. Let's make certain there is not too much pressure on the debtor. 
We also talk about tax returns with this bill. As it is written, if you walk into bankruptcy court and file a petition and do not produce within 65 days your income tax returns for the previous 3 years and your pay stubs for the previous 6 months, you are thrown out of court. I asked the Internal Revenue Service, if I asked for my income tax returns, how long would it take me to receive them? They said 60 days, if you are lucky. But you ask somebody who writes to the IRS, and they tell you it takes a lot longer. We ask that there be some provision in the bill that is sensitive to this. 
One of the other areas of the bill says you can't file for bankruptcy unless you have been to a consumer credit counselor. That sounds reasonable, but the consumer credit counseling industry came to us and said, `We can't handle this. We can't handle over 1 million people coming through our doors each year. We can't be the threshold for bankruptcy court.' That is what this bill does. I am afraid it goes too far. 
Another thing that concerns me is, in bankruptcy there are certain categories of debt that are protected. One of them is the area of child support. If we are going to have a mother with children, who was perhaps involved in a divorce and now relies on child support, receive enough money to raise her children, we can't send her into a bankruptcy court that diminishes her ability to recover those child support payments. Unfortunately, this bill does. 
I have just outlined a handful of the amendments that we think are important to make this a better bill. I believe that my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, is going to accept some of these or some form of these, as he has been very responsive and open in the past to talk about some changes, constructive changes in the bill. 
When it is all said and done, I believe we can pass a good Bankruptcy Reform Act, one that is a credit to both parties that have been involved in this debate, and particularly a credit to the chairman of the subcommittee who has worked so long and hard on this measure. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Central American and Caribbean Refugee Adjustment Act of 1998. This legislation will provide deserved and needed relief to thousands of immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean who came to the United States fleeing political persecution. 
In the 1980's, thousands of Salvadorans and Guatemalans fled civil wars in their countries and sought asylum in the United States. The vast majority had been persecuted or feared persecution in their home countries. The people of Honduras had a similar experience. While civil war was not formally waged within Honduras, the geography of the region made it impossible for Honduras to be unaffected by the violence and turmoil that surrounded it. The country of Haiti has also experienced extreme upheaval. Haitians for many years were forced to seek the protection of the United States because of oppression, human rights abuses and civil unrest. 
Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans have now established roots in the United States. Some have married here and many have children that were born in the United States. Yet many still live in fear. They cannot easily leave the United States and return to the great uncertainty in their countries of origin. If they are forced to return, they will face enormous hardship. Their former homes are either occupied by strangers or not there at all. The people they once knew are gone and so are the jobs they need to support their families. They also cannot become permanent residents of the United States, which severely limits their opportunities for work and education. This situation is unacceptable and requires a more permanent solution. 
Before outlining how this bill will provide a permanent solution, it is important to review the evolution of deportation remedies. Prior to the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in 1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful permanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate the harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present in the United States for long periods of time. 
In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of immigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable. 
In 1997, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could result in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries. This select group of immigrants were allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA standards. 
Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. The complex history of civil wars and political persecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in limbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution came to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but unfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they will have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents which occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of persecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and consequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay.  
Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is a necessary and fair expansion of NACARA. It provides a permanent solution for thousands of people who desperately need one. Specifically, the bill amends the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and provides nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under the same standards as Nicaraguans and Cubans. While the restoration of democracy in Central America and the Caribbean has been encouraging, the situation remains delicate. Providing immigrants from these politically volatile areas an opportunity to apply for permanent resident status in the United States instead of deporting them to politically and economically fragile countries will provide more stability in the long run. Such an approach is the best solution not only for the United States but also for new and fragile democracies in Central America and the Caribbean. Immigrants have greatly contributed to the United States, both economically and culturally and the people of Central America and the Caribbean are no exception. If we continue to deny them a chance to live in the United States by deporting them, we not only hurt them, we hurt us too.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been my good fortune to work on the subcommittee with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. We have worked closely together for more than a year. We disagree on some political issues--that is no surprise--but I respect him very much. He is a man of his word. He is a hard-working Senator, and it has been a pleasure for me to work with him on this very complicated issue. We will probably have our disagreements when this matter comes to the floor, but my respect for him will continue as during the course of preparing this complicated legislation. 
I also acknowledge the hard work of my staff members, Victoria Bassetti and Anne McCormick, on this complicated issue. Were it not for them, I don't believe I would be able to stand here and defend my point of view. They have educated me well. I will do my best to represent them, as well as the people of Illinois, on this issue. This is a highly technical and convoluted subject. We hear words like cramdowns, reaffirmations, panel trustees, lien stripping, automatic stays, codebtor stays, discharge stays, nondischargeable debt, super discharge, and on and on. Most people's eyes are glazing over and wondering what this bankruptcy debate is all about on the floor. 
This important Federal bankruptcy law is a delicate and perilous balance. When a person files for bankruptcy, they have a limited amount of assets. They come before the bankruptcy court and ask: What are we going to do with what we have left? It isn't enough to pay our bills and what do you suggest we do to discharge ourselves from this debt and go forward with a clean slate? 
When you push on one thing in bankruptcy, almost invariably something else will give. That is because no matter how hard you wish otherwise, we are dealing with a limited amount of assets--a pie of fixed dimensions. Try as we might, in almost every case the pie will not be made any bigger. All we can do is increase the fighting over that small pie--and usually no one really comes out ahead in that fight. 
In those cases where we can make the pie bigger, I fully support whatever we can do. We must ferret out those people who are abusing the bankruptcy system. One example is the homestead exemption. The homestead exemption allows a person, in some States, depending on State law, to claim that their home should be exempt from being subject to the claims of creditors. That sounds reasonable. People like to protect their home. But each State sets a different standard. Some States set almost unreasonable standards. That is why you can find a former Governor of a major State, or a former commissioner of baseball, racing to the right State to file bankruptcy--buying a huge home before they file bankruptcy, and then having it exempt from the bankruptcy estate. Luckily, this bill does away with that exemption. The House bill does not. On the floor of the House, unfortunately, we left this abuse in the bankruptcy code. I hope we will stand fast on this issue and that, if this matter goes to conference, we can prevail. 
Let me talk about the people who do file bankruptcy, who don't fall into the category of the rich and famous, never have been and never will. Let me show you one of the charts that indicates what happened in terms of the income people earn who are filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States. This is an interesting chart. The median family income is $42,769. In 1981, the median income of people filing for bankruptcy was $23,254. Look what happened. Over the next 16 years, we have seen a steady decline in the median income of people filing for bankruptcy. What it tells us is that people in the bankruptcy system are just getting poorer. We are not dealing with smoothies here who are racing out to get attorneys and find some way to protect some treasured assets. We are dealing with people who have a very limited amount of income and with very low-income and perilous circumstances. As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains that we need it. We can't dismantle or radically alter it without doing serious damage to our economy, to creditors, and to millions of individuals. 
To see what would happen if we didn't have a bankruptcy system, imagine a world where people could not declare bankruptcy when they were in bad financial straits. In this world, each individual creditor would have to file suit in State court when the debtor defaulted. And then it would be a race to the courthouse door. Some would end up with nothing. Almost nobody would win in this situation. So the bankruptcy code is important. But keep in mind that this median income person, with $17,652, really is not salivating for the opportunity to file for bankruptcy; a disaster has hit that person or his family. 
The information I am about to give you has not been produced by some consumer group, but by the major credit card companies. Visa and MasterCard did an analysis of the people who declared bankruptcy in 1997. Here is what they found: 11.6 percent of the people who filed for bankruptcy did so because of a divorce or separation; 16.5 percent declared bankruptcy because of medical or health reasons, and 15.3 percent, because of unemployment. Two-thirds of the people surveyed reported that creditors did not try to work with them to help them avoid filing for bankruptcy. 
You must remember the feeling. I can remember it in my early life after graduating from law school, deep in debt, trying to pay off student loans and having no really substantial income. It was a chore to fight off the people calling on credit cards. 
They really weren't offering the milk of human kindness in those telephone calls. 
From the Visa study, they went on to say:  
Although conventional wisdom holds that there is less stigma associated with personal bankruptcy filings today than there has been in the past, the experience of the respondents suggests just the opposite: A substantial majority--75.2 percent--had not been able to reestablish credit. Nearly a quarter of the respondents--24.7%--still owed income taxes after the bankruptcy was filed. More than half--52 percent--reaffirmed some of their outstanding debt * * * 
Let's talk for a moment about the debt. Credit card companies send out as many as 2.8 billion credit card solicitations a year to potential card holders. 
Let me show you a chart about one family that I happen to know a little bit about, the Durbin family of Springfield, Illinois. 
In a 6-month period of time at our house, we received in Springfield, Illinois, opportunities and invitations for credit cards, some wonderful credit cards. It used to be that they talked about gold credit cards. Here is one called `gold.' Now we are talking about titanium and platinum credit cards. 
If you look at the total amount of credit that was offered to my home and household, it comes to over $600,000. 
There was a time when I can recall getting my first car loan--of about $1,000--sitting nervously across from a loan officer at the First National Bank of Springfield, Illinois. Now, sight unseen, each day in the mail, come invitations to go deeply into debt--in this case over $600,000 worth. And this doesn't count the e-mail credit solicitation which I am currently receiving. 
What it suggests to me is that the credit card industry bears some responsibility for the increased filings and bankruptcy. 
We found in a 3-month period in 1997 that banks in the United States mailed a record-setting 881 million solicitations. 
I have some that my staff received here. I will not go through them all. 
I believe everyone here that is witnessing this debate on the Senate floor and those by television on C-SPAN know what I am talking about. You go home every night and start tossing out the preapproved credit card solicitations that say, `Just sign the back of this check, and we will send you a certain amount of money.' And you, of course, can have a second mortgage on your home. 
All of these things are coming at us fast and furious. 
In addition to the mail, credit card companies logged 24.1 million hours in 1996 on the telephones telemarketing their cards. 
You can be at home at night watching TV and listening to the radio. The phone starts ringing. It could be some charity. It might be some opportunity to change your phone service. It might also be a credit card solicitation. 
So if we are going to correctly analyze the current situation about the increases in bankruptcy, let us honestly look at what is happening here. 
You want to know why so many more people are filing for bankruptcy? Look at this. Track consumer debt in America, and track the filings in bankruptcy, and what you find is the lines are virtually identical. 
This isn't a matter of America losing its morality in family values because of the increased filings in bankruptcy. It is because we are deeper in debt as a nation and the credit card industry continues to lure people into debt. Yes. It is a free will choice. But many people are not as well informed as they get into it. The lure of consolidating your debts, and the lure perhaps of buying something that you might not otherwise be able to afford drags people deeper and deeper into debt with risky credit. One bad occurrence, as mentioned in the Visa and MasterCard study, and the next thing you know these folks are in bankruptcy court. 
Some people in the credit industry come to see you and say, `You know, I think these people have lost the idea of the moral stigma of bankruptcy.' The Visa study says they haven't. I am not sure they have either. I say to the people in the credit industry, `If there is no moral stigma to bankruptcy, then how do you explain the practices of your own industry, an industry that would consider installing ATM machines in casinos, which we now do in America? Where is the moral stigma there?' 
Let me talk to you about this bill in particular. 
I am pleased that Senator Grassley and I have been able to work well on many issues in this bill, and I will try to continue to do so. But let me suggest there are some changes that I would still like to see in this bill. 
We must make sure that reform of the bankruptcy system doesn't actually end up hurting vulnerable groups like women trying to collect alimony, children dependent on child support payments, and the elderly living on fixed incomes. 
We have a fixed amount of money here; a limited amount of assets. There will be a struggle and a fight over who will walk away with them. If you give additional assets from a bankrupt estate to a credit card company, you could do it at the expense of child support obligations. The Children's Defense Fund is opposed to the bill. That is one of the major reasons. Their concern is that this bill still does not protect child support payments. I think that is a major concern. 
We have to make certain that we lift that up to a level that is sensible. Keep in mind if we do not, we are going to assume that burden as a society. Children who do not receive their child support payments are kids who end up on welfare; kids who end up dependent on the Treasury of the United States and the States of our Union in an effort to survive. 
I hope we will be able to adopt an amendment which will, in fact, provide more protection when it comes to child support. 
Second, we must make sure that the reforms do not increase opportunities for creditors to themselves abuse and distort this system. 
I will not go through the lengthy history that we have of this process of reaffirmation. 
What is reaffirmation? I file for bankruptcy and I have a debt, and instead of having it discharged so I don't owe it any longer, I voluntarily agree to reaffirm that debt and to continue to pay all or part of it. Why would a person do that? What if you walked into the bankruptcy court and you owed money on your car? You need a car to get to work. You better reaffirm that debt on the car so you can continue to make the payments, even if you are discharged from bankruptcy from all other debts. It makes sense. Someone walks into a bankruptcy court and says, `My family has done business with that department store downtown for three generations, and I just could not stiff them. I will reaffirm my debt. I will pay it. Just discharge the rest of my debts.' 
The problem we have is in many instances creditors--major department stores and retail chains--have misled the debtors into believing they must reaffirm their debts; that they can't get off the hook in bankruptcy. I want to make sure that this bill does not create more opportunities for this to happen. I hope just the opposite will be true. 
Finally, let me urge that in the course of the debate on bankruptcy we address both sides of the problems. To those who are abusing the bankruptcy system, who walk into court and try to, through all sorts of chicanery, escape their obligations and their debts, we say: This will stop. And, on the other side, we say to the credit card industry: You also have an obligation. 
Sadly, all of this focus on the bankruptcy code simply helps to obscure a far more important and dangerous feature of our consumer economy--the profligate availability of risky credit. 
Merely making bankruptcy abuse harder is only part of the equation. The other part is preventing bankruptcy in the first place by encouraging more responsibility from the banks, as well as consumers. 
Come with me to a `Big-Ten' football game this autumn--a wonderful experience--in Champaign or Bement, Illinois--and walk into that stadium. What you are going to find there will be a booth giving away T-shirts. Mark my words. If you will take a T-shirt, you will also take an application for an official University of Illinois credit card. Kids fresh out of high school are signing up for credit cards when they are 18 to get a free T-shirt. You will find these booths at virtually all sorts of events. 
These sorts of things are going on at such a pace that, frankly, it has become almost scandalous. Credit cards are being issued to people who are mentally incompetent. They are being issued to pets; being issued to folks who have no business owning a credit card. 
I want to make sure that we straighten up that side of the equation as well. 
I want to make sure that the people who send us monthly credit card statements are open and honest. When they say your minimum monthly payment is `X,' they ought to tell you how many months it will take you to pay it off if you make the minimum monthly payment, and how much you are going to pay in interest. They ought to provide people with a simple worksheet so when they apply for a credit card they will understand where they stand financially. If fact, if the credit card company hasn't done any kind of analysis of your credit standing and they are offering credit blindly, you ought to know that. 
In addition, I want to make sure that we provide in these credit card statements a clear statement of the conditions. 
This same University of Illinois credit card solicitation--I don't want to pick on them--said, and I quote, `permanent introductory rate of 5.9 percent.' 
You don't have to be a business major to understand that `permanent' and `introductory' don't go together. What happens, of course, is that in a short period of time the interest rate goes through the roof. 
Let me conclude on this note. 
We can spend all of our time trying to punish or prevent a small number of abuses. We can also work on something infinitely more constructive. We can try to help prevent financial catastrophes. 
What I propose is a small step in that direction which works on the principle that a well-informed consumer is best able to protect himself. I am happy to join with my colleague, Senator Grassley, in an effort to change the bankruptcy code, but let us do it in a fair way that does not penalize the recipients of child support, that doesn't give an upper hand to creditors who abuse the system, and which says to the credit card industry, yes, we will clean up abuses in bankruptcy court but certainly you should extend your responsibility to issue credit responsibly to a well-informed consumer. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

<DOCNO>105-durbin-il-2-19980903</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. I thank you, Mr. President. 
In this brief period of time, I first applaud my colleagues. I am glad that I have had the honor to serve in the U.S. Senate. I am particularly happy to represent a great State like Illinois. I am honored to be a Member of the Senate with my colleagues and, in particular, Senator Kennedy who, time and time again throughout his career, has taken this floor to speak for those who do not have a lobby in Washington, to speak for those who do not have a special interest group with a large political action committee. When Senator Kennedy comes to the floor to speak for the poor, for the dispossessed, for those who do not have health insurance and lack the opportunity many of us take for granted, I am honored in joining him. Now that I am in the Senate, I find I am joining him more and more. I want to do that this morning on this particular issue. 
A few years ago at one of the National Democratic Conventions--I believe it was San Francisco--a resident of the city of Chicago, Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Jesse Jackson--not to be confused with his son, the Congressman--took to the floor of the convention hall and gave a speech I still remember today. 
He spoke to that assembled multitude of people about why we are involved in politics and what Government should be about. Jesse Jackson said in his own way--and I can't even hope to get close to imitating his style or his conviction--he wanted to speak to us about the people who get up every morning and go to work every day. He talked about the people who clean the hotel rooms of the conventioneers. He said they get up every morning and they go to work every day. The people who remove the dishes and glasses and cups from your table in the restaurant, they go to work every day. The people who watch our children in day-care centers, they go to work every day. The people who guard our homes, our offices, our schools, they go to work every single day. 
For many of us, they are invisible. They are the work 
force of America. We tend to focus on the leadership, those who rise to the top in terms of the public spotlight, but for millions of Americans who are part of our workforce, they are such an essential part of American life, and, unfortunately, too many of us take them for granted. 
What Senator Kennedy is challenging us to do today as the U.S. Senate is not to ignore these workers and their families but, rather, to show them that we respect them, we respect the contribution they make to America, we honor their work, and we do it with a vote to increase their minimum wage. 
Many of the critics of increasing the minimum wage like to argue, `Well, if you raise the minimum wage, people are just going to lay off a lot of these workers; employers can't afford to pay them.' That argument has been going on since the days of Franklin Roosevelt when we established the minimum wage. In very few instances, if ever, has that been the case. 
The most recent increase in the minimum wage had exactly the opposite impact. More and more people were employed. What Senator Kennedy is suggesting, raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour over a 2-year period of time, is hardly unreasonable. It is a reasonable way for us to address the needs of many families. 
We like to get on the floor here--and I have joined in this debate--and talk about eliminating welfare, changing welfare as we know it, moving people from welfare to work. I say to my friends, this is part of moving people from welfare to work, giving to those new workers a decent pay, a decent wage. These are people who get up and go to work every single day. 
It is also about family dignity. If we really believe in family values, it has to go beyond a speech on the Senate floor. It has to go to a question of whether or not we will vote to make sure that families receive the money they need to make a living. 
A lot of people argue, `Wait a minute, the minimum wage is just for kids, just for new employees--pay them a little amount of money because they don't have the experience.' Seventy-four percent of the people on minimum wage are adults; 57 percent of the gains of the increase in this minimum wage will go to working families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale. 
The other people argue, `Wait a minute, don't worry about the minimum wage, that is for part-time workers.' That is not the case. Fifty percent of the workers on minimum wage are full-time workers; 40 percent of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. 
What will $2,000 a year mean? That is what it will be if the increase goes through, $2,000 a year for a family. To a low-income family struggling to survive, it means money for groceries and rent, to pay for drugs, and to pay perhaps for health insurance for their children. It is the difference in quality of life which we cannot overlook. 
When the record is written about this Congress, questions will be asked: What did we achieve? Well, we haven't passed a budget resolution. We are now more than 4 months after the requirement to do it. We are struggling through the appropriations bills. I believe we will pass them. We have renamed the National Airport after President Ronald Reagan, and, folks, that's about it. Shouldn't we, before we leave, address the millions of Americans--200,000 in my home State of Illinois--who are, frankly, in a position where this increase in minimum wage could mean a dramatic increase in their quality of life? 
I will be coming to the floor on this bankruptcy bill debate. My friend, Senator Grassley from Iowa, and I have worked long and hard on this bill. We have our differences on it. But I will tell you this: I fully support what Senator Kennedy and Senator Wellstone have set out to do, to make sure it is part of this debate that we will increase the minimum wage. 
I hope those who are about to consider this issue, Republicans and Democrats alike, will understand that we are talking about people in America who get up and go to work every single day. 
They deserve our respect. They deserve an increase in their minimum wage. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for making this unanimous consent request. I would like to ask him a question. 
Many people who are watching this debate are not quite sure it is on the square. Is it possible that incumbent Senators now standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate really want to change the system that brought them to this body? I think there is a healthy degree of skepticism by people who are watching this debate wondering how they could want to change the system that brought them to their political position in life, brought them to the U.S. Senate. 
Can the Senator from South Dakota tell us how close we are to enacting meaningful reform, whether it is the legislation by Senator Feingold, by Senator McCain, or by the Shays-Meehan bill from the House? How close are we to that moment where we could call a vote and actually produce a bill that would change the system dramatically? Is this a pipe dream? Is this a theory? Is this a political stunt, or is this a reality, a real possibility on the legislative side?

Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from South Dakota a further question, anyone watching this debate has to be puzzled. If the Senator from South Dakota is truthful in what he says, as I believe he is, and if a majority of the Senate supports this reform, why isn't this bill on the floor? If a majority of the Senators are prepared to vote for it, why isn't this bill being brought up for consideration at this moment? 
Just a few minutes ago, the Senator from South Dakota made what is called a unanimous consent request to go to the bill. That is literally what it means. It takes unanimous consent of the Senate--not a majority vote--to bring it to the floor, and one Senator on the Republican side stood up and objected. So we were stopped in our tracks. 
But can the Senator from South Dakota explain to those who are watching this debate why we have to go to a unanimous consent request to bring a matter to the floor which we believe enjoys the support of more than a majority of the membership of the Senate.

Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask one more question. I see my colleague from the State of Connecticut is up for a question as well. I will make one last request of the Senator from South Dakota. 
The argument used most often by the critics of this campaign finance reform is an argument often used by the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican Senator who objected to this unanimous consent, which is that to reduce the amount of money being spent on a campaign will restrict free speech in America, will restrict the right of American citizens to express their views by spending their money in a political campaign. 
Would the Senator from South Dakota address this, because I think it is the core issue here. Are we in fact reducing the amount of money at the expense of restricting the constitutional right to free speech? That I think is the crux of this debate, at least the nominal debate that we hear, and I would like the Senator from South Dakota to address it.

Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from South Dakota in closing, beyond our rhetoric in the Chamber, take a look at the facts, and in 1996 we had more money spent on campaigns than any time in our history. We had the lowest percentage of eligible voters in American history in 72 years cast a vote in the Presidential election between President Clinton and Senator Dole. 
That is an indication to me that the American people understand what the Senator from South Dakota is saying. They think there is something fundamentally flawed with this system and negative advertising, the money chase that the Senator from South Dakota addresses. If we do nothing else before we leave this year, I hope this Senate will address this important issue. 
I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for taking the floor this afternoon and making his unanimous consent request. I sincerely regret there was an objection to it. I would like to ask the minority leader a question, but first I would like to note that over this last break, I made a tour of my State, and I did an interesting thing I never had done before. I visited community hospitals, and I invited the professional nursing and medical staffs to come down and meet with me and talk about this issue. I wanted to find out if my impression of the importance of this issue--what I had seen in the mail, what I had heard from my colleagues--was felt in downstate Illinois, in a small town, in a community hospital. 
I found it very interesting that many doctors came into the room to meet with me. They brought their beepers along. Some of them were called off to emergency calls and others with like requirements, but they met there because they wanted to take the time to tell me what they thought. 
The stories they told me were amazing. I thought I heard it all on the floor of the Senate about what the insurance companies were doing to American families, how health care was being compromised and why this legislation, which the Senator from South Dakota has suggested, is so important. But when a doctor comes before me and says, `I had to call the insurance company for approval to admit a patient and they said, `No, we won't go along with your suggestion, your medical advice, send the patient home,' this one doctor in Joliet said, `I finally asked the person on the other end of the line, `Are you a doctor?' 
He said, `No.' 
He said, `Are you a nurse?' 
He said, `No.' 
He said, `Do you have a college degree?' 
The man said, `Well, no.' 
He said, `Well, what is your training?' 
He said, `Well, I have a high-school diploma, and I have the insurance company manual that I'm reading from.' 
That is what it came down to, and a patient was sent home because this man, with literally no medical education, made a decision based on the insurance manual. 
Another doctor told a story, which was just amazing and frightening to any parent, about how a mother brought a son in who had been complaining of chronic headaches on the left side of his head. The doctor examined him and said clearly, `This is a situation where a CAT scan is warranted, because there may be a tumor present and let's decide very early if that is the case.' 
He left the room and called the insurance company. The insurance company said, `Under no circumstances does that policy allow a CAT scan of that little boy,' who had been complaining of these headaches for such a long period of time. 
The doctor said, `Not only did they overrule me, but under my contract, when I went back in the room and faced the mother, I couldn't tell that mother that I had just been overruled by an insurance company clerk. I had to act as if it were my decision not to go forward with the CAT scan.' 
That is what the gag rule is all about. We are restraining doctors from being honest with their patients, doctors from their honest relationship with parents bringing in children for care. 
So when the Senator from South Dakota suggests this unanimous consent request to bring this issue up, I say that my experience in the last few weeks suggests this is a timely issue, an important issue, much more important in many ways than a lot of the things that we have discussed on the floor of the Senate. 
My question of the Senator from South Dakota is this: I understand that he has said we must pass the appropriations bills. That is the responsible thing to do. That takes precedence. But he has also said let's move to this bill and allow amendments to it. 
We have seen repeatedly here--the Republican leadership has stopped an effort to pass a tobacco bill. The Republican leadership has stopped an effort to pass campaign finance reform. And now it appears the Republican leadership is going to stop an effort to have a Patients' Bill of Rights and do something about managed care. 
Can the Senator from South Dakota tell me what is it that is so pressing on this Senate agenda in the next 4 weeks that we cannot set aside even 1 day's time to discuss managed care reform? Is there something that perhaps the majority leader has told the Senator from South Dakota which we missed in the newspapers?

Mr. DURBIN. I will be coming to the floor and taking that opportunity when I can. I ask one other question of the minority leader. 
Is it not a fact that the Republican approach on this--should they call their legislation--on Patients' Bill of Rights--if you can characterize it as such--only protects 29 percent of all the American population from managed care abuses? Is it not true that the Republican approach, sponsored by Senator Nickles, in fact, does not provide protection for those who are self-employed, employees in small companies, State and local government employees; it leaves out a wide swath of Americans who deserve the same kind of basic protection when it comes to health insurance? Is this not one of the reasons why we would like to offer amendments so that we can cover the vast majority of Americans rather than exclude the majority, as the Republican bill does in its current form?

Mr. DURBIN. If he will yield for one final question. What is it that is so--if the Senator knows--what is it that is so frightening to the majority that they will not allow this issue to come to the floor? We know it is timely. We know it is important. The Republican Senators have put forth a bill that they think should be considered. Why is it that this particular issue, involving massive insurance companies and health care across America, is so frightening to the Republican majority that they will not allow your unanimous consent request? Can the Senator from South Dakota give us some insight as to why this issue should be so frightening to the Republican majority?

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I have submitted three amendments for consideration by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. It is my understanding that there will not be objection, but I would like to briefly describe each of these amendments and then offer them for consideration by the Senate. 
The first amendment that I will offer is one which addresses the microcredit issue. This is one that I think is of extraordinary importance in terms of supporting and promoting the entrepreneurial spirit of small business people around the globe through the use of microcredit loans. 
For those unfamiliar with the term, microcredit is a very small loan given to very poor people with dramatic and positive results. By accepting this amendment, we could enhance the lives of thousands of impoverished people throughout the world as well as their families and communities. 
Many years ago, I journeyed to Bangladesh with a colleague of mine from the House of Representatives, Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who passed away a couple years ago. In Bangladesh, we saw the activities of the Grameen Bank, the people's bank, which gave small loans to very, very poor people. Through those loans, these peoples lives were transformed. The people understood that this was a rare opportunity. And, they were supported by people in their communities who would cosign the loans. The payback rate on the loans was in the high 90th percentile. With only a few dollars, maybe $100, a woman in Bangladesh had a chance to buy some tools that would allow her to pursue a trade and to feed her family. Another woman might be able to buy a dairy cow and with the milk from that cow she could feed her children as well as provide products for sale, which would provide some income for her family. 
These microcredit loans are not charity; they are a means to provide poor, fledgling entrepreneurs in lesser developed countries with loans for startup of individual businesses. It has proven to be a successful way to help these people achieve economic independence and dignity for themselves. 
It is interesting that where we found people in Bangladesh involved in microcredit, we also found timely discussion and debate about critical issues, such as the elevation of the status of women, for example. It wasn't a surprise to find that the women involved in Grameen Bank were also actively involved in prenatal activities so that their children would be more healthy. They also actively participated in family planning programs on a voluntary basis that helped them to take personal responsibility for the size of their families as well as other issues that all of us, I believe, agree are part of the solution to dealing with developing economies. 
My amendment will change the status of the program in one slight respect. It gives microcredit a higher priority among U.S. enterprise development efforts. This amendment will ensure that at least half of the funds already appropriated through this bill, S. 2334, for USAID for microenterprise initiatives will be used for programs providing loans of less than $300 to poor people, particularly women, or for institutional support of organizations primarily engaged in microcredit loans. 
We don't increase the overall spending amount; we merely have a reallocation of the smaller loans in this package. Existing loans have a remarkably high repayment rate of 95 percent or more. 
This amendment supports the goals of the Microcredit Summit held in Washington, DC, in 1997 to offer credit for self-employment and other financial aid. It also supports the goals found in S. 2152, the Microcredit for Self-sufficiency Act of 1998, introduced in June, sponsored by myself, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, and 22 other Senators on a bipartisan basis. 
I believe that the use of microcredit loans is a pragmatic and proven method for fostering the growth of small businesses. 
I thank the chairman for acceptance of this amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my second amendment is one that deals with an issue of some controversy in my State of Illinois and one that we have followed very closely. 
Several years ago, two young people from Illinois made a very serious mistake. These young, I believe then teenage girls accepted an invitation to fly to Peru. It sounded too good to be true and it was. They found themselves lured into a drug trade and subsequently were arrested in Peru. 
For almost two years now, these young ladies, one is Jennifer Davis of Illinois, have languished in prison in Lima, Peru. Neither Jennifer Davis nor her family deny the fact that she is guilty as charged and that she should be sentenced and should serve time for the crime she has committed. In fact, she has cooperated fully with the Peruvian authorities and those who are seeking to find who was responsible for the drug trading involved. 
The difficulty, of course, is that the Peruvian legal system is much different than the United States system. It took an excruciatingly long period of time, nine months, before Jennifer was actually charged, brought to trial, and convicted. We had hoped that the trial and conviction would lead to the possibility of her being sentenced and then extradited to the United States to serve time for her sentence in an American prison, which is customary under international law. But, the conviction was appealed by her codefendants. Under the Peruvian system, the appeal went to the Supreme Court, which called for a new trial. Now, the process has started all over again. 
I have spoken directly to Jennifer Davis' parents. I have spoken to the U.S. Ambassador to Peru, Mr. Jett, about this case. It is not my intention in offering this amendment to in any way be confrontational with the Government of Peru. What we are attempting to do is to urge them to follow accepted international standards for a timely hearing and a timely trial of Jennifer Davis and all other Americans being held in Peruvian prisons. We do not presume the outcome of these trials. We do not ask for special or favorable treatment, only that they be treated as prisoners are treated in the United States and most other countries--in a timely fashion--and that any decision by those courts be carried out in a fair manner. 
That is all that we can ask. It is all that we do in this amendment. 
I send the amendment to the desk.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have one last amendment. Let me apologize. I thought they were going to be considered en bloc. I understand now. 
This last amendment is an attempt to address a matter of great concern in an objective manner, and that is the concern of some in the United States that we have expended taxpayers' dollars over the years for the training of foreign military officers and personnel in the United States with sometimes unintended tragic results. 
First, let me say, that many of the individuals who have come to the United States from foreign countries to receive military training have returned to their home countries and have served the cause of justice and the cause of civilian control of the military in an admirable way, but there have been notable exceptions. 
I will not at this moment offer the amendment that I had planned to offer involving the controversial School of the Americas. I was prepared to offer that amendment which would close down and terminate the School of the Americas. That is an amendment which has been considered for many years in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I voted for it there. I believe we should close that School. That is still my heartfelt belief. 
I have spoken to those who share my point of view. It is their belief at this moment that we should not offer that amendment. I follow their advice on the subject. 
Instead, I would like to offer for the consideration of the Senate and the House of Representatives and all others an amendment that would require the Inspectors General of the Department of Defense and Department of State to submit a report to Congress which spells out exactly what training is available to foreign military leaders and personnel in the United States, including the location, the duration, the numbers involved, the cost of the training, the purpose and nature of the training and, most importantly, an analysis as to whether that training is consistent with United States foreign policy and the goals of promoting democracy and the civilian control of the military and the promotion of human rights. I think this will set the stage for a more thorough and thoughtful consideration of all of the programs that might involve foreign military officers and personnel being trained in the United States. 
Let me say at the outset, I believe that some of these programs are invaluable, that many of the men and women who are participating in them leave the United States and go back to their home countries prepared to really create a new military ethic. I think the United States should continue on that course. But, unfortunately, in the past, particularly in the case of the School of the Americas, there have been some very controversial instances where those who have been trained have responded in ways most of us would consider to be anathema. They have returned to their home countries and have been involved in conduct of which I am sure no one would ever approve. 
I ask and urge adoption of the amendment which I have offered.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC) as it celebrates the 12th Annual Entrepreneurial Women's Conference. The event, which is to be held on September 9, 1998, at Chicago's Navy Pier, will celebrate the Women's Business Development Center's second decade of outstanding service to women in the business community. 
The Women's Business Development Center is a Chicago-based nonprofit women's business assistance center devoted to providing services and programs that support and accelerate the growing role of women business owners in the economy. Since its founding in 1986 by Carol Dougal and Hedy Ratner, the Women's Business Development Center has facilitated more than $20 million in women's business loans and has assisted women-owned businesses in gaining over $90 million of government and private contracts. More than 30,000 women business owners have benefitted from the following programs and services: counseling, workshops, entrepreneurial training, the Women's Business and Finance Programs, the Women's Business Enterprise Initiative, the Entrepreneurial Woman's Conference and the Women's Business and Buyers Mart. 
The success of the Women's Business Development Center has inspired similar initiatives across the country. Women's business development programs modeled after the Center have been launched by economic development organizations in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. The tremendous inroads made by women in the business community over the past decade is due in no small part to the efforts of these organizations. 
Mr. President, there are now more than 7.7 million women-owned businesses in the United States, and 250,000 of these businesses are located in my homestate of Illinois. Nationally, women's businesses generate $2.3 trillion of sales and employ one out of every four U.S. company workers. 
Given the importance of women-owned businesses to the economy, I look forward to hearing about the continued successes of the Women's Business Development Center in the years to come. Once again let me offer my congratulations to the Women's Business Development Center on their 12th anniversary.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a baseball star died this week. Bill Tuttle, centerfielder for the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, and Minnesota Twins over a period of 11 years, succumbed to oral cancer after a five-year battle. Among baseball fans, Mr. Tuttle's baseball card picture, with a bulging cheek full of chewing tobacco, is well-known. Unfortunately, that ever-present wad of tobacco was his undoing. Over the past five years, it cost him part of his jaw, his cheek, a number of teeth, his taste buds, and ultimately his life. 
To his credit, when Mr. Tuttle realized what spit tobacco, as he accurately called it, had begun to do to him, he devoted the last years of his life to warning other ballplayers about what might happen to them if they too use spit tobacco. But he did more than reach out to his fellow ballplayers. He spent many hours and days working to prevent young people from starting to use this addictive product.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, in honoring DePaul University on its 100th anniversary. 
The students, alumni, and faculty of DePaul University have much to be proud of. One hundred years ago, a group of Vincentian fathers founded what would become DePaul University in order to teach immigrants who would otherwise be denied access to a college education. Since that time, DePaul has been guided by its original mission: to foster in higher education a respect for all persons and a commitment to service of others. 
It is no surprise that DePaul produces some of Illinois' top citizens and plays a significant role in the Illinois economy. The University has distinguished itself in major education fields such as business, law, telecommunications, and art. The School of Education has provided the Chicago metropolitan area with many devoted and innovative professional elementary and high school teachers. Further, DePaul's School of Business is a nationally ranked program that has been recognized as one of the best in the nation. 
Moreover, the DePaul School of Law has garnered an international reputation for its work in international human rights. The International Criminal Justice and Weapons Control Center of DePaul University is working to establish an International Criminal Court in order to discourage war crimes. 
In keeping with its original mission to teach immigrants who faced disadvantages, DePaul continues to be committed to educating minority students who still face barriers to their advancement. The University is nationally recognized for the diversity of its faculty and enrolls the largest number of African-American and Latino students of any private college or university in Illinois. 
DePaul has matured into a prestigious university and an integral part of the city of Chicago. There are over 65,000 working DePaul graduates living in Illinois. Further, DePaul graduates are prominent in every facet of employment, including law, business, and the arts. 
Again, I extend my congratulations to DePaul University. The University has proven itself to be a great asset to the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago. I hope that its second century proves to be as successful as its first.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is the usual custom in the Senate as long as I have been here--almost 19 or 20 months now--to dispense with the reading of an amendment. In this case, I did not--first, because the amendment in its entirety is very brief, only one page; and, second, I wanted those who are following this debate to hear each word of the amendment, because in the wording of this amendment I think we have an important decision to make on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
This amendment which I offer reaffirms that the United States should only go to war in accordance with the war powers vested in the Congress by the Constitution. My colleague, who has just joined us on the floor, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, carries a well-worn and tattered version of that Constitution with him. I bet he has it on his person as this moment--and I win my bet--and Senator Byrd refers to it frequently to remind all of us that we, when we took the oath of office to become Members of the U.S. Senate, swore to uphold this Constitution. 
The section of the Constitution which my amendment addresses is one which is central to the power of the U.S. Senate and the power of Congress. Article I, section 8, includes in the powers of Congress, the power: 
To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water. 
Most constitutional scholars will know the meaning of the term `marque and reprisal.' We have read it many times, but for those of us who need to be refreshed, that is an effort, short of war, where the United States, short of some commitment of major troop forces and the like, would seek to impose its will or stand for its own national security. 
The most operative section of Article I, section 8, are the simple words `To declare War.' 
This amendment would prohibit the use of funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for `offensive military operations,' except in accordance with Article I, section 8, which specifically gives to Congress, and Congress alone, the power to declare war and take other actions to govern and regulate the Armed Forces. 
A similar amendment was offered by Congressman David Skaggs of Colorado and Congressman Tom Campbell of California in a bipartisan fashion. It has passed the House of Representatives. It is part of the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which will be considered in conference with the bill that we are debating. 
This amendment that I offer today reaffirms that the Constitution favors the Congress in the decision to go to war, and that Members of Congress have a constitutional responsibility that they cannot ignore with regard to the offensive use of Armed Forces. Why is this necessary? Let me quote from a scholar who has written on this subject extensively. Louis Fisher is a senior specialist in the separation of powers with the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress. He wrote in an article entitled `Sidestepping Congress: Presidents Acting Under the UN and NATO: 
Truman in Korea, Bush in Iraq, Clinton in Haiti and Bosnia--in each instance, a President circumvented Congress by relying either on the UN or NATO. President Bush also stitched together a multilateral alliance before turning to Congress at the eleventh hour to obtain statutory authority. Each exercise of power built a stronger base for unilateral Presidential action, no matter how illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic. The attitude, increasingly, is not to do things the right way, in accordance with the Constitution and our laws, but to do the `right thing.' It is an attitude of autocracy, if not monarchy. How long do we drift in these currents before discovering that the waters are hazardous for constitutional government? 
On January 12, 1991, the Congress, in addition to authorizing the use of force to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, took an important vote asserting its constitutional responsibilities and insisting that the President follow the wisdom of the framers of our Constitution when considering a question as serious as war. Despite the vocal opposition of the Bush White House, the House of Representatives in which I served voted 302-131 in favor of a resolution that I offered with Congressman Bennett of Florida. You may recall what happened. When Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Kuwait, there was fear that he would continue and then invade Saudi Arabia. The United States began positioning forces in Saudi Arabia. At the invitation of the Saudis, we brought in a sufficient force to at least discourage, if not deter, Saddam Hussein. 
Over time, it became clear that the force in place was growing and the intention was just not to protect Saudi Arabia, but in fact to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. At that moment, the nature of our commitment changed, and at that moment, the congressional responsibility changed, from my point of view. We were no longer in Saudi Arabia just at the invitation of the Saudis to defend; we were preparing a massive military force to, in fact, invade Kuwait and to oust the Iraqis. We knew that that would necessarily involve the loss of life, and many of us in Congress believed that it clearly fit within the four corners of Article I, section 8, that Congress should act and, in fact, we did. There was an extensive debate on the floor of the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives, and ultimately, Congress voted to authorize the use of force by the President--President Bush at the time--in order to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait. 
Another important congressional action was a 1994 Senate resolution rejecting the Clinton administration's claim that the United Nations Security Council 940 constituted `authorization for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in Haiti under the Constitution of the United States.' The Senate passed this resolution by a resounding 99-0 vote. The framers never intended the Armed Forces to be employed by the Executive as a blunt instrument for enforcing U.S. foreign policy without congressional approval. Yet, in the Iraq crisis earlier this year, and in the unstable situation in Kosovo today, that is exactly what we have seen. Absent a reaffirmation by Congress of its proper constitutional war powers, we will certainly see it again. The time for this amendment is now. I will speak to the Kosovo situation toward the close of my opening statement. 
Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution, the so-called war powers clause, vests in Congress this power that I have read. Other clauses of the same article I, section 8 vests in Congress the power to `define and punish piracies' and `offenses against the Law of Nations,' `raise and support armies,' `to provide and maintain a navy,' and `make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,' and `to provide for organizing,' arming, and disciplining the militia, and `governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States.' 
Very significantly, clause 18 of this section gives Congress the power to `make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.' This clause clearly states that it is Congress that makes the laws for the regulation of the Armed Forces, especially in matters of war. 
Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states: 
The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States.' 
That is all the war powers vested in the President by the Constitution. It is instructive for us to look back at the debate which gave rise to these constitutional provisions. 
Comments by the framers of the Constitution clearly indicate their intent in favor of Congress in matters relating to the offensive use of military force. 
James Wilson, speaking at the Pennsylvania State Convention on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, argued that the system of checks and balances built into the Constitution `will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.' 
No one less than Thomas Jefferson explained that he desired Congress to be `an effectual check to the dog of war.' 
James Madison wrote that Congress would have the power to initiate war, though the President could act immediately `to repel sudden attacks' without congressional authorization. 
Roger Sherman further delineated on the President's war powers: `The executive should be able to repel and not to commence war.' 
Constitutional scholar Louis Henkin of Columbia University wrote this in 1987:  
There is no evidence that the framers contemplated any significant independent role--or authority--for the president as commander in chief when there was no war. . . . The president's designation as commander in chief . . . appears to have implied no substantive authority to use the Armed Forces, whether for war (unless the United States were suddenly attacked) or for peacetime purposes, except as Congress directed. 
International law scholar, John Bassett Moore, wrote in 1944: 
There can hardly be room for doubt that the framers of the Constitution, when they vested in Congress the power to declare war, never imagined that they were leaving it to the Executive to use the military and naval forces of the United States all over the world for the purpose of actually coercing other nations, occupying their territory, and killing their soldiers and citizens, all according to his own notions of the fitness of things, as long as he called his action something other than `war' or persisted in calling it peace. 
The constitutional framework adopted by the framers for the war power is remarkably clear in its basic principles. The authority to initiate war lay with Congress. Other U.S. Presidents have affirmed this interpretation of war powers under the Constitution. 
Abraham Lincoln wrote this in 1848: 
This, our (Constitutional) Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. 
Fast forward 100 years into the 20th century, as we debated the possibility of creating a United Nations. The U.N. Charter was written against the backdrop of the disaster of the Treaty of Versailles and President Wilson's determination to make foreign policy without Congress. When President Wilson submitted that treaty to the Senate in 1919, he attached the covenant of the League of Nations. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge offered a number of reservations, specifically including a protection of the prerogative of Congress, and Congress alone, to declare war. President Wilson called this reservation `a nullification of the treaty.' The issue was joined. The Senate rejected the treaty, and thereby the League of Nations, in 1919 and again in 1920. 
In the midst of World War II, when the concept of another world organization began to form, care was taken not to cross the line that had doomed the League of Nations. Any commitment of U.S. forces to a world body would require prior authorization by both Houses of Congress. Debate on the Hill between the House and Senate had more to do with each body's prerogative and role than the underlying assumption. Even under the auspices of the United Nations, congressional approval was necessary before troops could be committed. 
Section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act is explicit. Agreements `shall be subject to the approval of the Congress by appropriate act or joint resolution.' 
Ultimately the decision was reached that both Houses of Congress--not just the Senate under its treaty authority--was necessary. 
Soon after President Roosevelt's death, President Harry Truman sent a cable from the conference in Potsdam that led to the establishment of the U.N., stating that all agreements involving U.S. troop commitments in the U.N. would first have to be approved by both Houses of Congress. 
President Eisenhower assured the press, in January of 1956, in an often-quoted statement, `When it comes to a matter of war, there is only one place I would go, and that is the Congress of the United States and tell them what I believe. I will never be guilty of any kind of action that can be interpreted as war until Congress, which has constitutional authority, says so. I am not going to order any troops into anything that can be interpreted as war until Congress directs it.' 
In the creation of NATO, Secretary of State Dean Acheson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1949 that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization `does not mean the United States would automatically be at war if one of the other signatory nations were the victim of an armed attack. Under our Constitution the Congress alone has the power to declare war.' 
Then came Korea. President Truman sent U.S. troops in 1950 without ever seeking, or obtaining, congressional authority. By historical fluke, the Soviet Union was absent from the U.N. Security Council when a crucial vote was taken responding to the possibility that the Korean peninsula would be overrun. Without a Soviet veto, the U.N. moved forward, and President Truman rationalized the use of force in this `police action' to uphold the rule of law. 
I recall that particularly, because my two older brothers served in the Korean war, and there was an ongoing joke about the fact that this was just a `police action.' They knew better. All of the families and all of those involved knew that it was, in fact, a war. 
The courts, too, have supported the constitutional prerogatives of Congress with regard to war-making, including the implied constitutional power to `authorize' war. 
The Supreme Court in Bas v. Tingy, in 1800 said, `Congress is empowered to declare general war, or Congress may wage a limited war; limited in place, in objects, and in time. . . .' 
Chief Justice Marshall, writing in Talbot v. Seeman in 1801: `The whole powers of war being, by the Constitution of the United States, vested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as guides in this inquiry.' 
U.S. Circuit Court, New York, U.S. v. Smith, 1806: `It is the exclusive province of Congress to change a state of peace into a state of war.' 
More recently, during the Persian Gulf episode, a case was filed in the U.S. district court in Washington. I joined with petitioners who filed this action to ask the court to spell out the power of Congress when it came to the declaration of war. The court rejected the Justice Department's contention that `the question whether an offensive action taken by American armed forces constitutes an act of war (to be initiated by a declaration of war) or an `offensive military attack' (presumably undertaken by the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief) is not one of objective fact but involves an exercise of judgment based upon all the vagaries of foreign affairs and national security.' 
The court said, `This claim on behalf of the Executive is far too sweeping to be accepted by the courts. If the Executive had the sole power to determine that any particular offensive military operation, no matter how vast, does not constitute war-making but only an offensive military attack, the congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a semantic decision by the Executive. Such an `interpretation' would evade the plain language of the Constitution, and it cannot stand.' 
Mr. President, over the last 40 or 45 years, Congress has virtually ceded its constitutional war powers responsibilities to the President. Many of the significant instances of use of force by the Executive without congressional authorization, including the only major unauthorized war in Korea, and localized conflicts in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Panama, among others, occurred during this period. 
I will not visit that sad and contentious chapter of American history surrounding the Vietnam war, but suffice it to say that after that war Congress made the decision, through the passage of legislation, to take a more active role in the decisionmaking process. 
The 1973 War Powers Resolution, which then-Armed Services Committee Chairman John Stennis called `an important step in this Congress to assume its duty in representing the people of this Nation,' unfortunately has done little to slow down the gradual assumption of war powers claimed by successive administrations or to embolden Congress to properly exercise its war powers responsibilities under the Constitution. 
Even in signing the congressional authorization of the use of force against Iraq in 1991, President Bush went to great pains to emphasize his claim that he possessed constitutional authority to act. `As I made clear to congressional leaders at the outset, my request for congressional support did not, and my signing of this resolution does not, constitute any change in the longstanding position of the Executive Branch on either the President's constitutional authority to use the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests, or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.' 
The Clinton administration echoed President Bush's comments and even took it one step further. 
During her congressional testimony during the Iraq crisis this last February, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of `the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use armed forces to protect our national interests.' 
In a Statement of Administration policy threatening a veto of the House version of this bill if the Skaggs-Campbell amendment were included, the administration stated that, `The President must be able to act decisively to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.' 
I do not believe that the framers of our Constitution would have ever accepted such inflated claims of executive authority, or the idea the Armed Forces should be used by the President as a device for implementing administration foreign policy, without the approval of Congress. 
President Bush's comments notwithstanding, Congress made a good start in regaining its proper constitutional war powers in its thorough 1991 debate and vote to authorize the war in the Persian Gulf. Congress affirmed at that time that its responsibilities extended far beyond merely paying the bills for Presidents' wars. 
Now it is time for the Congress to take the next step. This amendment will restore the proper constitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches in deciding when or if the United States is to go to war. 
Mr. President, in the time that I have served on Capitol Hill, in both the House and Senate, it has been my sad responsibility on several occasions to attend funerals in my home district, in my congressional district, for the families of those who have fallen in combat. 
I can't think of a sadder occasion--one of the saddest that I can recall--than the one that involved the sending of Marines to Lebanon, putting them in harm's way, and after a terrible bombing of the barracks, the loss of life of a young man from Springfield, IL. Time and again, I thought at those sad services that there is a legitimate question the family could ask of their elected representative in Congress, and now in the U.S. Senate. Was I part of the decision that led to the war that took their son's life? Because the Constitution makes it clear that I should have been part of that decision. In so many instances, I was not; the decision was made by the President. The only course for Congress is control of the purse, and virtually nothing else. As a direct result, we lost lives without the American people speaking to the question of war through their elected Congress. 
I caution my colleagues to read carefully this amendment and to realize that it does more than assert our constitutional authority to declare war. It also asserts our responsibility. Be careful for what you wish because with the passage of this amendment and the reassertion of our constitutional responsibility, we will be and should be called on more frequently to make important decisions about committing American troops. 
There is one operative and very important word in this amendment. It is the word `offensive,' as in offensive military operations. So the Record is eminently clear, there is no doubt in my mind nor in anything I have read that the President of the United States, as Commander in Chief, has the power to protect American citizens and the property of the United States. He need not come to the Congress and seek our approval when he is, in fact, defending Americans and their property. We are talking about a separate circumstance, a circumstance where instead of taking a defensive action, the President decides to take an offensive action. 
I might also add that for those who say, clearly the Senator from Illinois is offering this amendment because he is concerned about some current conflict, well, yes, I am concerned. I am concerned about any conflict that involves American lives, but that isn't what motivates me to join the gentleman from Colorado who offered this amendment in the House of Representatives. As I mentioned earlier, it was almost 7 years ago that I joined Congressman Bennett of Florida in a similar effort. I do believe this principle is sound, and those who want to gainsay this effort should know that I have tried to stand by this principle through the time that I have been in Congress. 
Is there a need for us to consider it now? I will leave that to your judgment. Consider the statements made by Robert Gelbard, special representative of the President and Secretary of State on Implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, when he spoke before the House International Relations Committee in Washington on July 23, 1998, relative to the tragedy in Kosovo. 
Mr. Gelbard said:  
In NATO councils, planning for possible NATO action is nearly completed. While no decision has been made regarding the use of force, all options, including robust military intervention in Kosovo, remain on the table. NATO planning is on track and Milosevic understands that this is no idle threat. The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a threat to regional peace and security. The potential for spillover into neighboring States remains a paramount concern. We and our allies have made clear to President Milosevic that spillover of the conflict into Albania or Macedonia will not be tolerated. 
Make no mistake, if Mr. Gelbard's statement is a statement of administration policy, the administration is poised to initiate an offensive military action relative to Kosovo, an action which I believe clearly requires congressional approval, If the men and women in service to our country who are presently in Bosnia--and I believe the number is about 6,900--should be called to take offensive military action and lives are lost, from all that I have read, it is clearly in derogation of article I, section 8 of the Constitution. This President, my President, any President, has the responsibility to come to Congress to seek our approval. Of course, then the responsibility is on our shoulders to decide whether or not this is in America's national security interest. 
I ask my colleagues in the Senate in considering this amendment to consider the historical perspective here. For the first time since World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt hobbled up the steps to take the podium for a Joint Session of Congress in the House of Representatives, asking for a declaration of war, we will state in clear and unequivocal terms that we are asserting our constitutional responsibility and authority when it comes to a declaration of war. 
I understand that this will require more dialogue and conversation between the executive and legislative branches about our foreign policy, and particularly about committing troops, but I do believe that is what the framers of the Constitution had in mind. Those of us who must face the families and explain to them why their daughters and sons, their husbands, their wives and friends and relatives are called on to not only serve this country, but stand in harm's way and risk their lives have to have the authority to stand before them and say we have done our part, we have played our role, we have made the judgment, the judgment which the Constitution gives to us and us alone to make. 
At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, to add Senator Feingold as an original cosponsor of this amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his generosity. I will conclude at 8 o'clock, as we promised, and ask for a vote on this. Allow me to try to describe what is at stake, because for everybody in the gallery and those listening to the debate, this could hit home some day. It is a question about when or if the United States should ever go to war, who will make the decision. If you were called on, or one of your children was, who will decide whether or not that person will stand in harm's way, risk their lives for their country? 
I have the deepest respect and admiration for those who serve in the armed services. They have given up their lives to protect this Nation and we owe them a great debt of gratitude. What we are talking about is how this decision is made. The men who wrote this Constitution understood very clearly that if they were going to have a voice in the process, they would have to rely on the Senators and Members of Congress to make that decision on the declaration of war. 
This amendment is very brief. By Senate standards, it is amazingly brief--just a few lines. But it states very clearly what I think is an important constitutional concept. First, the President of the United States as Commander in Chief of all of our Armed Forces still retains all of his power and authority to defend the United States and its citizens. He does not have to come to Congress on bended knee and beg for that authority. It is his; he is Commander in Chief. But when he crosses that line and no longer is defending us, but rather is pushing forward in an offensive capacity, saying that we are now going to invade a nation, we are now going to try to secure a certain objective or target, beyond a defensive objective, then the Constitution is clear: That is not his decision to make; it is our decision to make. Better yet, it is your decision to make--to speak to your elected Representatives in the House and Senate and to express your heartfelt feelings. 
I can recall the debate over the Persian Gulf war. There was quite a division within the military, and even within Congress. But I don't think there was a finer moment in the 16 years I have served on Capitol Hill than that period of time when each Member of the U.S. Senate and the House came to the floor and took all the time necessary to speak their hearts about whether or not we should put our children in harm's way to stop this aggression by Saddam Hussein. 
I can speak for myself--and I am sure for many colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike--there were sleepless nights when you knew that a vote to go forward and commit our troops in an offensive capacity was going to lead to the loss of life. It was a painful decision, but it is one that I accepted, and everybody as a Member of the House and Senate accepted as well. 
I say to my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, who I hope are following this debate, that this is about whether or not the oath of office that we took is meaningful. When we swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States, I don't believe they asked us to turn to Article I, section 8 and make an amendment to take it out. No, it was included. It was part of that responsibility--an awesome responsibility. 
My friend, the Senator from Alaska, has raised a procedural point. He says that this is beyond the scope of an appropriation or a spending bill. I disagree with his conclusion on that. I have seen what is considered authorizing language and much more expansive language easily adopted on the floor of the Senate and in the House time and time again. So I hope that those who vote on the amendment will vote on it on all fours, straightforward, up or down; do you agree or disagree? Do you agree with our Constitution, which says this is our responsibility in Congress to declare war? Or are you prepared to accept the drift that has gone on for half a century now, which says we will continue to give more and more power to the President to make this decision? 
If you should decide this is the President's province and we are going to cede all of our constitutional authority, mark my words, you should think twice before you come to the floor of the Senate--or our colleagues in the House--and question when the President uses this authority, because if you are not prepared to say that we accept our responsibility under the Constitution, that we will stand up and decide and vote when it comes to putting our troops in harm's way, then I think you may have forsworn any opportunity to come to this floor and second-guess the President--a President who uses the power that we have handed to him. 
As I have said in previous moments in this debate, there is no sadder moment than going home to your State or district and facing a casket, draped with a flag, of a fallen soldier, sailor, airman or marine and then facing that family. I believe that it is our constitutional responsibility to be part of the decisionmaking that leads to military action. It will not be an easy task. It will be a tough burden, but it is exactly why we have stood for office and why we have asked to represent our States. 
I hope my colleagues in the U.S. Senate will support this amendment. I believe this is straightforward and honest in its approach. I believe that as you consider the possibilities just in the weeks ahead--perhaps even while we are gone over the August recess--that there may be an effort in the Bosnian region, in Kosovo or some other place, to assert and take offensive military action. Those who have voted against this amendment tonight will not be able to say the President should have called on us first, because that is what this amendment says. This amendment says anywhere in the world where the President wants to take offensive military action--not to defend the property and the persons of America, but offensive military action--he is bound by the Constitution of the United States. 
Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a special moment in the history of this body. I wanted to be heard for a very brief moment on what happened in the last few days here in this building. I guess it is customary, when you work in a building for many years, to get used to it and not to be stirred by it, but not this building. For 16 years, it has been my honor to serve in the House and the Senate, and I can tell you that as I walk up to this building still in daylight, or in the middle of the night, it still has a special impact on me, as it does on so many Americans. There have been those who have come before us, and my colleague from West Virginia, who is a historian of this body, remembers, I'm sure, better than most that when President Lincoln was engaged in the Civil War, we were in the process of building the great white dome that we now see on the top of this Capitol Building. 
People came to him, and said, `Mr. President, we can't continue this construction. We have a war to fight.' He said, `No. We will continue this construction. We will build this dome during the war as a symbol of what this Nation will be after the war; that it will be united again; and that this building will be the symbol of that unity.' 
President Lincoln had it right. As you reflect on this building and what it means to so many of us, you have to also reflect on its history. 
This is not the first act of violence in this building. It is not the first time that lives were lost, or that blood was shed. 
The British invaded this building and came up the spiral staircase. During the Civil War, the Union troops who had been felled in battle were brought here and laid in the Rotunda in a hospital where they were treated. In the 1950s, a group of terrorists took control of the Chamber of the House for a few brief minutes, firing pistols on the floor and injuring people. In 1983, just outside this Chamber, there was a bomb that was detonated late at night. We have never discovered the cause of that bombing. And then, of course, the tragic incident which occurred last Friday involving one very troubled, disturbed individual who took two lives and injured another person. 
I guess each of us who walk in the door of the Capitol each day take for granted the warm greeting and the smile from the Capitol Police, and forget that it is more than just a responsibility to greet. It is a responsibility to protect that brings them to this building. Like so many Senators, I came to take that for granted. You think it is always going to be safe and that they will never need to take the pistols from their holsters, or use them. And yet last Friday that all changed. 
When I came to this building today and walked in the entrance and saw the Capitol policeman at his post, I looked at him in a different way, understanding that he was doing more than just his duty. He was protecting me and thousands of others who come to this building. 
In behalf of John Gibson and Mr. Chestnut, J.J. Chestnut, my sympathies go out, on behalf of the people of Illinois and all of my friends and my staff, to their families. To think that they have left behind eight children who now should be cared for, and I hope all of us will join in that effort to make certain that that occurs--and that their family goes through this period of mourning understanding that they do not stand alone, that we stand with them shoulder to shoulder in gratitude for what they have given us. Because what they have given us is something we all hope to bring to this building--to bring more honor to this building, to the people who work here, and to the great tradition in history of the U.S. Capitol. We do it in our daily activities, in our speeches, in our conduct. What these men have done is to give their lives in the service to that great tradition and that great history. 
There will be another time and another place when we will talk about how this tragedy might have been averted with better security measures, or better efforts in terms of the control of guns, or keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not have them. But let's save that debate for another day. Let us close this debate with fond memory of the contributions made by these two men, and with gratitude not only to them but to all of the men and women who protect our lives in law enforcement, and particularly those on the Capitol Hill Police Force.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this amendment with my distinguished colleagues Senators Collins, Jeffords, Reid, Harkin, Mikulski, Cleland, and Graham. 
Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. Those who perpetrate violence against their family members do not desist because the family member grows older. In fact, in some cases, the abuse may become more severe as the victim ages becoming more isolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. Other age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a victim's vulnerability. it also is true that older victims' ability to report abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser for care or housing. 
Every seven minutes in Illinois, there is an incidence of elder abuse. Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most under reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than child abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen incidents estimated to be reported. Seniors who experience abuse worry they will be banished to a nursing home if they report abuse. They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse by their children to the authorities and thus increasing their child's likelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they remain `silent victims.' 
The Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill funds the STOP law enforcement state grants program. This program provides funding for services and training for officers and prosecutors for dealing with domestic violence. This training needs to be sensitive to the needs of all victims, young and old. However, the images portrayed in the media of the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, with small children. Consequently, may people including law enforcement officers may not readily identify older victims as suffering domestic abuse. The victims themselves may also be reluctant to report such abuse. Many older women were raised to believe that family business is a private matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed with anyone, especially strangers or counselors. Only a handful of domestic abuse programs throughout the country are reaching out to older women. 
This amendment seeks to improve the STOP grants program by making it more sensitive to the needs of the nations seniors. We know that great improvements have taken place since the Violence Against Women Act was first passed. One of the most successful programs is the law enforcement and prosecutor training program, which received over $200 million in FY 1998. This bill would increase that level to $210 million. Improvement in this program can be made with respect to identifying abuse among all age groups especially seniors who are often overlooked. When the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law enforcement to deal with this person in the same way that they might deal with a younger person. Who wants to send an `old guy' to jail? However, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because then the abuser has every reason to believe that there are no consequences for their actions. Another common problem is differentiating between injuries related to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or illness. too many older women's broken bones have been attributed to disorientation, osteoporosis or other age-related vulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure that they are not the result of abuse. 
With the greying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in all its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we need to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence programs and ensure that these programs serve seniors and are sensitive and knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse. 
I am pleased to be joined by Senators Reid, Harkin, Cleland, Mikulski, Graham, Jeffords, and Collins in offering this amendment, which focuses attention on the needs of the `forgotten older victims of domestic violence.'

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce of Salem, Illinois, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary on July 23. 
A century ago, seven Illinoisans founded the Salem Business Men's Association, which was later renamed the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce. As they stated in their original charter, its purpose was `to promote and encourage the location of manufactories and other industries in our city * * * and to encourage in all proper and lawful ways the development of our city and its surrounding country.' It is hard to imagine that the seven founders could have foreseen how their association would grow and flourish into the present. 
Today, the Chamber supports the community of Salem through numerous projects ranging from economic development to educational support. In addition, the Chamber serves as a network for local businesses and a coordinator between them and the government of Salem. The Chamber also fosters a general sense of community in Salem, by welcoming new residents and promoting consciousness of Salem's unique heritage. 
In its role as coordinator, networker, and initiator, the Chamber has proven itself to be a crucial player in Salem's recent economic expansion. The city of Salem can boast a net gain of 900 jobs over the past five years. These gains are due in no small part to the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce. 
With a century of success behind it, the Chamber is now working to secure the future prosperity of Salem. The Chamber regularly notifies businesses of education and training opportunities so that Salem's labor force can continue to adapt to the changing needs of the economy. Further, the Chamber was instrumental in developing the Tech Prep program, which provides 25 local high school students with internships that prepare them for future careers. 
Throughout its history, the Chamber has proven itself to be an indispensable asset to the city of Salem and the state of Illinois. Again, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Chamber and all of its members and hope that their second century is as successful as their first.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the unanimous consent request we have 40 minutes equally divided between the Senator from Idaho and myself. 
I say by way of introduction, it is interesting we have two amendments that I don't believe are in conflict. I believe they are complementary. They both relate to guns. As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, he is seeking to reduce gun crime. I believe I will be able to support him. It appears to be consistent with my view, that those who misuse guns in the commission of a crime shall be accountable, regardless of their age. If that is what the Senator from Idaho seeks to do, I fully support it. 
The amendment which I offer is complementary and very important because it addresses an issue which all of us, unfortunately, know too well. On the floor of the U.S. Senate a few weeks ago, my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, came up and said to me, `There's just been a wire story report that two children in Jonesboro, AR, have taken guns and shot classmates and a teacher.' We couldn't believe that horrible story. Then it turned out to be true--four children killed, and a teacher, who put her life on the line to protect another student, also died. 
As the information started coming in about Jonesboro, AR, we heard a story similar to what had happened in Pearl, MS, and what would later occur in Springfield, OR. The curious thing about the situation in Arkansas was that an 11-year-old child and a 13-year-old child took 10 lethal weapons and a reported 3,000 rounds of ammunition, went to the woods behind the school, activated the fire alarm, and shot away at the classmates. 
Where did an 11-year-old child and a 13-year-old child come up with 10 lethal weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition? That question stuck with me as I considered this legislation. The story goes, now, that one of the kids went to the parents' home to pick up the guns and go about this violent, grizzly business and found out that the parent had locked the guns up under lock and key. The kids tried to break open the storage locker. They failed. They went to a grandfather's house, where they picked up the guns and ammunition and went out in the woods and went about their deadly task. 
How many times have we heard this story or versions of it? How many variations have we heard? The next day, in Dale City, CA, a high school student turns up at school with a semiautomatic pistol. You can bet that high school student didn't legally purchase it at a gun dealer. And that same day in Cleveland, OH, a 5-year-old turns up at a day care center with a loaded handgun. 
The point of my amendment is to say let's get down to the bottom line here. We are as concerned about troubled children and violent behavior as anyone can be. Let us focus our attention on all that we can do to stop that. Make no mistake, a troubled child is a sad reality. A troubled child with a gun is a tragedy about to happen, not just to himself but to other innocent people. 
This amendment which I am offering, called the Child Access Prevention Law, sets to establish a national standard which says that every gun owner in America has a responsibility to store his gun safely. An adult who has a gun in the house and knows, or should know, that a child could gain access to the gun, and a child does gain access and thereby causes death or injury or exhibits the gun in a public place, is subject to a Federal 
misdemeanor penalty of up to 1 year in prison, with up to $10,000 in fines. 
But the exceptions are important as well. If that adult has stored the gun with a trigger lock, with another safety device, or under lock and key, then they are not bound by this law; they have met the standard of care. 
If the juvenile uses the gun in a lawful act of self-defense, this provision does not apply either. 
If the juvenile takes the gun off the person of a law enforcement official, the gun law that I have suggested here does not apply either. 
If the owner has no reasonable expectation that children will be on the premises, then this law does not apply either. 
Finally--and this is a point I want to make clear--we specifically say if the juvenile, the child, came up with the gun as a result of a burglary, stealing the gun out of premises where they did not have a legal right to enter, then there is no liability on the part of the gun owner. 
We are talking about a situation where a gun owner owns guns, knows that children are present, and doesn't store them safely. Fifteen States have already addressed this. Ten years ago, the State of Florida passed the first law. They said: `There are too many children being killed with guns accidentally and intentionally. We want gun owners to accept the responsibility of storing them safely.' In the first year after the Florida law was passed, gun accidents involving children went down 50 percent. Fourteen other States have passed this law. Nationally, there has been a reduction of 20 percent in the gun accidents that have occurred in those States that have already passed a similar law to this one. 
What we are talking about here is establishing a national standard but not preempting any State law. If your State has a child access prevention law, then that will be the controlling law in every circumstance, and not this Federal law. 
But I tell you this, you need only sit and talk to parents who have been through this to understand how important it is for us to have a standard of care for gun owners across America. A woman from my hometown sent me a handwritten letter about her little boy going to play next door, and another playmate pulls out a gun that his parents left unattended. It was loaded. He fired the gun. She wrote:  
That little bullet went through my little boy's heart, and mine too. 
And mine, too. 
Susan Wilson who came here just a few weeks ago, the mother of a little girl that she sent off to school, gave her a kiss goodbye and sent her off to school in Jonesboro, AR, never to see her alive again. 
This suggestion for a change in law is not about taking anybody's guns away, it is about taking guns seriously. It says to every gun owner: You not only have the right to own a gun and the right to use it legally and safely, you have a responsibility--a responsibility--to store it safely and keep it away from children. 
One of the experts on the Senate floor when it comes to guns is the Senator who is engaged in this debate with me, the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig. Yesterday, during the course of a debate on trigger locks, Senator Craig said: 
Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every gun owner. 
And then Senator Craig said: 
A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is not accessible to untrained or unauthorized people. 
And, in Senator Craig's words: 
That is the right rule. That is the one that really fits. That is the one that really works well and then you don't have the accidents to talk about. 
I think that is as strong an endorsement of the bill that I am offering as any language I could offer as part of this record. 
I will tell you what I have found as I have traveled around and talked about establishing this standard of care so kids don't have access to guns. What I have found is overwhelming support from law enforcement. These are the men and women who answer the calls after there has been a terrible accident or a child has taken a gun out and shot someone intentionally. There has been solid support on this proposal from teachers. Can you imagine, a teacher who goes into a classroom, prepared to teach children, wonders if one of those kids has brought a gun to school. In my home State of Illinois, last school year--not this last one, the one before--144 kids were expelled for bringing weapons to school. It is, unfortunately, a growing trend in America. 
In most instances, those weapons came from homes where the guns had not been safely stored. Mark my words, a child will always find Christmas gifts and a gun, no matter where you hide them. If you put it in the back of the drawer, behind the T-shirts, or up on the shelf in the closet, it is not good enough. We are a nation of 265 million people. We are a nation of 300 million guns, or more--300 million. At this moment, it is estimated that half of those guns are readily accessible to children, and a third of all guns are loaded. That is a tragic accident about to occur. 
My goal in introducing this is not to send people to jail. My goal is to initiate a national conversation raising the level of awareness and saying to gun owners nationwide: Accept your responsibility to store your guns safely. If you want to own a gun, if you want to exercise your right, exercise your right responsibly. Save the children from these tragedies. Save the parents from this grief. Save innocent victims from what might occur. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with every right in America, there is a responsibility, even with the second amendment right to bear arms. Every gun owner has a responsibility to store his gun safely. 
What I find interesting about the argument from the Senator from Idaho is that when I speak to responsible gun owners across America, the first thing they tell me is, `Senator, I do not want any of my guns to harm any of my children or anyone else's children or any innocent person. I understand I have a responsibility to store them safely.' 
The Senator from Idaho is arguing that gun owners have no responsibility and should have no responsibility under the law to store their guns safely. 
That is not a fair standard. The overwhelming majority of the American people may support an individual's right to own a gun, but the overwhelming majority of the American people also understand that right carries a responsibility to protect innocent children. The fact that there has not been an enforcement action in 15 States where the laws are on the books should be heartening to the Senator from Idaho, and not discouraging, because in those same States that have passed laws just like this, the number of accidents involving firearms with children have gone down over 20 percent. 
We can save children's lives with this amendment by saying to gun owners: `Take this issue responsibly.' Let us send America's kids back to school safely, schools that are gun free and violence free, and let the parents of those kids realize they have a responsibility, if they are gun owners, to store their guns safely so their children cannot get their hands on them and hurt themselves or others. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I started in opposition to this amendment, but I now rise in support of this amendment. I think the Senator from Idaho is right. I think we should adopt this amendment with an overwhelming margin, and I believe he was right yesterday during the course of the debate when he said: 
A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is not accessible to untrained and unauthorized people. 
The Senator went on to say: 
Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every gun owner. 
The next amendment after we adopt the Craig amendment will give us a chance to adopt a children's access prevention law which says to every gun owner in America, you have the right to bear arms; you have the responsibility to store them safely. I urge all my colleagues to vote with Senator Craig and then support the Durbin-Chafee amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield a minute to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island. I urge my colleagues to understand that 15 States have enacted these laws to protect children. We all read about these horrible situations in Jonesboro, in Springfield, in Pearl, MS. Let us not just lament this situation, let us do something about it. 
Gun owners understand their responsibility. That is why the NRA supported this law in its enactment in five different States. We can do this tonight to save children's lives.

Mr. DURBIN. I certainly rise in strong support of what the Senator from California is setting out to do. I want to acknowledge that she shares the important position that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, has taken on this legislation. 
I have a query of the Senator from California. Many of the critics who come here saying this is unnecessary, it is impractical, are the same people who have lamented, along with all of America, the tragic loss of life involved in children picking up guns. I will offer another amendment later on dealing with what I believe to be the responsibility of gun owners when they have a gun in the presence of a child. 
The Senator from California, though, really raises this question about a very important mechanical part of this equation: Shall we put on each handgun in America a device which will protect it so that if the gun owner is not present and a child picks it up, the child can't hurt himself? 
I brought with me evidence of that, which I am happy to share with the Senator from California, to show exactly what we are talking about. This is a trigger lock. And this trigger lock, as the Senator from California has noted, is easily disengaged, just with the turn of the key, and opened. 
I first saw one of these when I went to Elgin, IL, and the chief of police showed me that every officer going home in the evening takes a trigger lock and puts it on the gun. Of course, the officer may need the gun for self-defense or law enforcement; they don't think a trigger lock is an impediment. With the key not in it, that gun can't be used. 
I pose this question to the Senator from California: Is the Senator from California aware that the Federal Bureau of Investigation requires that all of its agents have trigger locks on the guns that they take home in the evening?  
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-durbin-il-3-19980721</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Yes, it is. As a matter of fact, is the Senator aware of the fact that when Mr. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, I asked point blank, `What has your experience been at the FBI with this policy that requires child safety locks or trigger locks to be used by every FBI agent?' And Director Freeh said, `I think it has worked very well. I think it hasn't impeded any readiness or ability to protect. I think it is a very simple but very wholesome requirement. Having five small boys myself, I think it is a very good idea, whether or not it is mandated.' 
I just ask the Senator from California, is she aware of any of the critics of this legislation who can overcome this testimony from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that they already use these trigger locks for law enforcement agents who take the guns home in an evening?

Mr. DURBIN. In my home State of Illinois, the City of Elgin, which has decided to pass a local law, actually subsidized the trigger lock sales so anyone coming to the police department could buy one for $3. So anywhere from $3 for a subsidized trigger lock to a maximum of $10 buys this peace of mind that I think is so important when we consider this trigger lock legislation. 
I might ask the Senator from California, your legislation would require, then, a trigger lock be sold with each handgun?

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can I say something at the outset? There are people on the floor who oppose this amendment. I will be happy to yield during the course of my statement to debate it. I know they have strong feelings on the other side. I think we can add something to this issue if we have a real debate instead of just monologues on both sides. I invite any Senator on the floor who opposes the Boxer-Durbin-Kohl-Torricelli amendment to feel free at any moment to engage us in a question and debate. I think that would help the public in the galleries and those watching television to follow this debate and to understand the simplicity and the honesty of the amendment offered by the Senator from California. 
Let me say that we should look at the scope of this challenge. We are a Nation of 265 million people. We are a Nation of 300 million guns--300 million guns. As we stand here today in the midst of this debate, approximately half of those guns at this moment in time are accessible to children. They are accessible in the drawer behind the socks, in the closet up on the shelf, down in the bottom of the closet behind the shoes--accessible to kids. 
As the Senator from California will tell you--and I can attest to it having been a father and now a grandparent--children will always find Christmas gifts and guns. I don't care where you hide them, they are going to find them. When they find a loaded gun, tragic occurrences happen. In fact, in this Nation that we live in, 14 times a day we lose a child to a gun--14 times a day. 
What the Senator from California is suggesting is something that is so simple and practical that I think this Senate should go on the record with a vote in support of our amendment. This little trigger lock can save a life. It can save the life of that baby who you love so dearly--the grandchild who means so much to you. 
I am going to make a little confession here. I have a conflict of interest in this case, as does the Senator from California. She is the proud grandmother of 3-year-old Zack. I am the proud grandfather of 2-year-old Alex. I am reminded every time we get in this debate of how much of a heartbreak it must have been for the parents and grandparents of those children who came home to find they had lost this baby they loved so much because of a tragic accident. Could it have been avoided? Yes. For the lack of a trigger lock like this one, lives were lost. 
Let me tell you something else that troubles me about this debate. The National Rifle Association, to no one's surprise, opposes this. The gun lobby opposes this. Yet, I have spoken to gun owners about this issue, and I get an interesting response from them. How concerned are they about children who are being injured with guns? They are very concerned. They are also troubled that these gun lobby spokesmen stand up in Washington and say, `This is none of your business, you should not be passing laws to do this,' because the gun owners I speak to say, to a person, `We never want a single firearm that we own to ever harm anybody in our household or any innocent victim, regardless of their age.' These are responsible gun owners who understand their responsibility under the law when they exercise their right to use guns safely and legally.

Mr. DURBIN. All right. I think you saw what I showed you, in violation of the rules, a few minutes ago. I think you understand that this tiny object, which could fit in my hand, which I can't pick up under the rules of the Senate and under objection on the floor, is something that is not a major investment by any gun owner, but could bring peace of mind not only to the gun owner, but to other people. 
When I held a press conference in Chicago, IL, and invited a friend of mine who had been, unfortunately, a statistic in this debate, he told a story that chilled me about his 10-year-old son. He said, `My wife and I never had a gun in our house because we were afraid that with children around something 
might happen. We thought we were a safe family. Our son went next door to play with another child. . .' and I guess you can come to a conclusion as to what happened. His child was killed when the neighbor boy picked up a gun, playing with it, shot his son and killed him. 
Suzanne Wilson, who testified 2 weeks ago, a mother from Jonesboro, AR, who would have faded into the background of all of the American people who do their duty and raise their families, now has become a national spokesperson. She will not let the death of her daughter in Jonesboro, AR, be forgotten. She is supporting this legislation by Senator Boxer, as well as many other efforts to reduce the likelihood that guns will be fired accidentally or will harm some young person. 
I will tell you what. I cannot believe the opponents of this legislation could stand and look this woman in the eye--a woman who sent her daughter to grade school, who loved her with all her heart, kissed her good-bye in the morning, and never saw her alive again. I don't know if we will avoid the tragedy in Springfield, OR, or Pearl, MS, or Jonesboro, AR, or somebody else's hometown, tomorrow if we pass this law, but I know it is the right step forward. 
I know this Senate is capable of coming to the conclusion that we can pass laws that will save lives. I know that we are willing to say to certain special interest groups, `No, you have gone too far.' We have to use a trigger lock--which I can't show you--to protect our kids. I think that is something that is just basic. How many people in America now buy these clubs that they put on their steering wheels to protect their cars? This is a club to be put on a gun that is easily accessible. I can't show it to you, but you can turn the key and pull it off. Under the rules of the Senate, I can't show you that anymore. 
I think you understand what I am saying. This is not a major investment, nor a complicated issue for people who dearly love these children and understand what is at stake. Believe me, this debate is about you, not about States rights, not about the Bill of Rights. This debate is about our children and their lives. That is what is at stake here. This U.S. Senate can come together in a bipartisan fashion and do the right thing for families across America. We will all join in lamenting any gun violence. We will give speeches on the floor, and at home we will send letters of regret and condolences, as we should. But when it comes to the bottom line, how are we going to vote? Representing the people of Illinois, I will vote in favor of this Boxer amendment. I think she is right that we need a new day in this country, which says that we are not going to take guns away but we are going to take guns seriously, and guns not taken seriously become, unfortunately, the objects of crime and the objects of accidents, which break hearts and destroy families forever. 
This is not too much to ask. What the Senator from California has proposed should be supported. I have been waiting for those who oppose the amendment to engage me in debate. I hope they will. I am still waiting. Even without my trigger lock, I am waiting. I would be happy to engage any of them in a debate on this issue. I see they are not ready to do so. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin who, in the Judiciary Committee, has shown exceptional leadership on this issue, along with the Senator from California. 
I defer to my friend from Idaho who spoke earlier about the member of the National Rifle Association executive board. I am certain his knowledge of firearms and handguns surpasses mine. But I will say that his statement, `No one should use a trigger lock on a loaded gun' apparently depends on the type of lock involved. 
I have in my hand from the Safety Lock Company an advertisement that says: 
Lock for life. Hopefully, the garden hose is your kid's most powerful weapon. You no longer have to choose between your home security and your children's safety. Safety Lock is the only child safety lock for guns that can be locked safely while the gun is loaded, permanently installed on a handgun, unlocked in a few seconds, even in total darkness. 
It appears it depends on the type of trigger lock or safety lock we are discussing as to whether or not the gun should be loaded. 
I would like to address what I think is the more central argument made against this amendment by the Senator from Idaho. I am not surprised by the argument, because we hear it all the time. In legislative circles, it is known as the argument that the best is always the enemy of the good. Someone will come in and say, `Yes, you may save, oh, 5,000 kids' lives a year, but there are 44,000 other lives out there that you ought to try to save, too.' I am not going to argue with the Senator from Idaho. I think we should take every reasonable step we can to protect all children in all circumstances. 
In this particular case, though, the Senator from California and the Senator from Wisconsin come forward with a practical answer to a problem which haunts families across America with the proliferation of guns in our Nation. They have suggested trigger locks be sold with handguns. It is not an outrageous and radical idea. Law enforcement in America, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, already uses these trigger locks, and they work. 
For the Senator from Idaho to say, well, kids drown in swimming pools, that is a sad reality, too, but we are not about to close down swimming pools. We talk about children being trained, but we also talk about lifeguards and parents' responsibility. 
I say to my colleagues, this is about a parent's responsibility, too. No parent is going to take a 2-year-old toddler who has never been in the water and toss him in the swimming pool and walk away. They would never consider it. 
Would that parent leave a loaded gun where a 2 or 3-year-old can grab it? Sadly, that is happening time and time 
again. What we are saying is put a device on that gun that lessens the likelihood that a child is going to be injured. 
The National Rifle Association's opposition to this seems to be that it means there is too much Government--too much Government--to ask that we put a safety trigger lock, a child-safety device with each handgun. In States across the United States now, we are adopting laws to mandate children's car seats to protect kids riding in a car. We don't consider that too much Government. We consider that common sense. It is common sense when we are talking about seatbelts, children's car seats, children's seats in airplanes. It is common sense--protect the children. They are too young and immature to protect themselves. A trigger lock does that, too. It is not a matter of too much Government. 
The other argument from the National Rifle Association and others is this is too much to ask. You are asking a gun owner to spend another $3, $5 or even $10 to make their gun safe at home? 
I don't think that is too much to ask. I really don't. I think this is a reasonable suggestion. I think what you will find is as it becomes commonplace across America, the cost will go down and quality will go up on these trigger locks. That is something that is a reality of life. It is something that is not too much to ask. 
The seatbelt analogy, I think, is a good one. The Senator from Idaho made reference to it earlier. What we are talking about here is not putting every gun owner in jail who doesn't have a trigger lock. We are talking about creating an environment of thinking in America. 
Let me confess here that when I grew up, the first car I owned didn't have seatbelts in it. I guess you know how old I am. Then for a number of years, I bought cars with seatbelts and promptly sat on them every time I got in the car. Then somebody in my State said, `Let's pass a law and say you have to buckle your seatbelt.' I never got arrested for that, and I started using seatbelts. I don't feel all that comfortable without it. 
What we are trying to do is say to gun owners across America, `Please join us. This is not taking your guns away. It is trying to create an environment of safety around children.' What the Senator from California and the Senator from Wisconsin are suggesting is taking guns seriously. I will offer an amendment later along the same lines, but much like seatbelts, we want people to think twice about those guns. 
The Senator from Idaho criticized the bill and said, `Oh, there are so many teenagers who are misusing guns.' He is right. There are so many things we need to do about it, and he and I will join in increasing criminal penalties and so many other things that can be done. 
In most instances, we are talking about immature children, children who pick up a gun and don't have a clue as to the danger of this weapon, turn it on a playmate, turn it on a sister or brother and tragedy follows. 
I think the American people don't believe this is an unreasonable intrusion in their lives. They think it is common sense. 
I salute both Senators from California and Wisconsin for their leadership on this. I am happy to stand as a cosponsor of this amendment, and I hope Members of the Senate, gun owners and those who are not gun owners--Democrats and Republicans--will step back for a minute and say this just makes sense. Let us at least save some of these children's lives. Let us put safety into the equation. Let us understand that an industry that has basically fought off every effort to put safety standards on the guns they manufacture should at least not stand in the way of trigger locks to save lives. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
For those who missed a few innings and would like to know what the score is, what happened, the Senator from California offered an amendment which requires a trigger lock be sold with each handgun in America. And she does a few things procedurally so we are going to have an up-or-down vote. And, of course, there are people who do not want to vote on that. They are afraid of--well, let us not say that. There are people who disagree with her. There are people who don't want to vote on it. 
The Senator from Idaho, who openly opposes her amendment, comes in with what he considers to be a substitute amendment. That is what we are debating now. The good part is, when it is all over, we get to vote on both of them: The proposal of the Senator from Idaho, which I have in my hand, that he just described, and then the proposal of the Senator from California, which says, `Sell a handgun in America, sell with it a trigger lock.' 
Originally, the Senator from California and I thought: No harm, no foul; we will take the Craig amendment and get a vote on her important trigger lock amendment. And then we took a closer look. Do you know what this says? This says to comply with the law in America, a federally licensed firearm dealer must have available on the premises for sale a trigger lock or safety device--available on the premises. 
Then it has some words, some escape-hatch words in there that says, `unless it is tough for you to buy them.' If you cannot get them on the market, and such, then you do not have to have them on the premises. Do you have to sell them with the handguns? No; you just have to have them on the premises. I have to tell you, quite frankly, most of them probably have them on the premises now, but if people aren't buying them, then there is no safety aspect to this. We aren't protecting anybody. 
So what it boils down to is, we are putting a requirement in the law that really does nothing. Then there is an interesting provision in here--and I do not know why the Senator from Idaho included it--but I might call him to reference page 4 of his amendment, section (2). It says, incidentally, if the federally licensed firearm dealer does not live up to the requirements of this law and keep trigger locks on the premises for sale, and you find evidence of that and want to use it against him to remove his license--guess what?--under section (2) you can't--you can't. `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, [any] evidence regarding compliance or noncompliance with the amendments . . . [none of it is] admissible as evidence in [the court or any agency.]'

Mr. DURBIN. I will yield when I have completed. I thank the Senator. 
I think that really tells the story. First, there is no requirement, and if there were, it is unenforceable. So this really is eyewash. This is an opportunity to have something to vote for, but the real something is coming. It is the amendment by the Senator from California. 
Basically, what we are talking about now is whether or not we are for trigger locks to protect children. I am in favor of firearms safety and education. But the bottom line is that little trigger lock put on a revolver or a handgun keeps it from destroying another child's life. 
We can vote for or against the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, but after it is all said and done, the real deal here is the amendment by the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. She is the one who says, you do not just have to have trigger locks on the premises, you have to sell them with the gun. You have to make sure the gun owner walks out with a trigger lock, not just a nod and a shelf with a trigger lock on it. I am afraid that nod is all we get from the Senator from Idaho. It is not good enough. It will not save a life. It is, in fact, an effort by some to find something for which to vote. I hope they will find in their hearts enough empathy for the real problems facing America to support the Senator from California.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you. I will take a portion of the 10 minutes to start with and then allow my colleague from New Hampshire to state his side of the case on behalf of this amendment. 
Let me try to explain where we are in terms of what this amendment is doing. We are trying to set up a computer check across the United States, so if you purchase a firearm, there is a way for States or the Federal Government to check and see whether you have a history of having committed a felony or a history of mental illness, and in that situation States are saying, `Of course we do not want to sell a gun to you.' And that is the basic Brady law. 
Most people support it because it is eminently sensible that we want to keep guns out of the hands of people who are likely to misuse them. I think everybody supports that. The NRA and the people on the other side of the issue even support it. 
The Senator from New Hampshire comes before us, though, with a very interesting proposition. The Federal Bureau of Investigation does these background checks by computer. They have said that, `When we do these background checks, we will charge the prospective gun purchaser, the one who wants to buy the gun, for our cost in doing the background check.' And of course that sounds reasonable to me. 
If I want to purchase a gun, and I want to have a background check to qualify me for a gun, it is not unreasonable for me to expect to pay for what it costs for that to happen. Why should this be the burden of every taxpayer in America, those who do not own guns and those who are not purchasing guns? It really is a decision that I want to buy a gun; and, therefore, I am going into the system to prove that I am eligible to own a gun. 
The Senator from New Hampshire says: Wait a minute. Why do we want to charge the prospective gun purchaser for this background check? Shouldn't the Treasury pay for that? Shouldn't all the taxpayers pay for these people who want to buy guns? 
I do not think so. And the practical result of the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire is to take from the Federal Bureau of Investigation the amount of money they would have collected to do these background checks. And you know what that means? It means basically the Federal Bureau of Investigation will have anywhere from $50 to $75 million less in their appropriation to do their job. 
Well, can they absorb a $50 to $75 million hit? I think we can all answer that question, because we all come to this floor and come up with wonderful ideas for the FBI to get involved. We want the FBI to fight terrorism. Of course we do. We want to make sure that they are fighting it around the world and protecting people across the United States. And so we say, `We're assigning that responsibility to you.' The Senator from New Hampshire says, `Yes, we give you the responsibility. We're not going to give you the money you need to do the job.' 
We also say we want the FBI to go after some serious issues. Let me give you an example--crimes against children, to enhance the FBI's capabilities to combat child abductions, and serial killings. This is the responsibility we give to the FBI. The Senator from New Hampshire says: It is a great responsibility, but take the money away from them--$50 to $75 million less each year. 
How about narcotics? Is there a more serious criminal problem in America? What is filling our prisons? What is tempting our children? What is leading to the kinds of degradation in lifestyle that we see around this country, but basically the war on drugs, the war on narcotics? 
So the Senator from New Hampshire says: Let us take some money away from that, too, because we want people who apply for a gun not to have to pay for it. We want the Treasury to pay for it. We want the FBI to take this money from other sources. I do not think that is fair. 
I do not think it is fair for an agency with this sort of responsibility. And I do not think it is fair for those who want to purchase a gun to say, `We want a free ride.' For goodness' sakes, it is their decision to purchase a gun. They are going forward in the system to purchase it. Shouldn't they pay their own freight? 
Would you think twice about buying a car and trying to get a license and say, `I just decided to buy a car, but as far as the cost of the license for my car, why should I have to pay for that? Taxpayers ought to pay for that. I just want to drive the car'? That is what the Senator from New Hampshire is arguing.

Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Delaware is correct. The instant check system was proposed by the National Rifle Association as a way of avoiding the Brady law. They said, `We will do this by computer; we will punch it in.' 
The fellow who is selling the gun, the dealer, will punch in the information and find out if you are a dangerous person; if not, they can sell it to you. 
Now they have decided they want the computer check but they don't want to pay for it, they want the taxpayers to pay for it, and take the money out of the FBI. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. If I understand the argument of the Senator from New Hampshire, because we have a constitutional right to bear arms, all of the Federal taxpayers have to subsidize that right. 
I suppose since we have a constitutional right to exercise our religious belief, then it is the responsibility of taxpayers to pay for my priest or minister. I don't think so. I don't think so. 
In this situation, the American people are coming forward and saying, `We want to exercise our right to own a gun.' We are saying, `Fine, so long as you don't misuse it and you are not a person with a background where you are likely to misuse it.' And if you are going to submit yourself to this background check, be prepared to pay for it. 
The Senator from Delaware makes a good point. If we are going to hire people to work in nursing homes and child care facilities that need background checks--and that is not a bad idea--why shouldn't they, as a condition of employment, pay for the background check? Why should this be the responsibility of every taxpayer? 
The Senator from New Hampshire wants to say to the prospective gun owners they have the right to come to the Government and say, `I want it for nothing.' When you get it for nothing, someone will pay for it. In this situation, the FBI pays for it. 
Do you know why the FBI appropriation has gone up, as the Senator from Idaho has said? Because we keep giving them more responsibilities--do fingerprint checks on anybody who wants to be a new citizen in the United States; get serious about dealing with drugs across borders, make certain that you have the wherewithal to do it; fight terrorism. We tell them to do all of these things and now the Senator from Idaho says they should have enough money to absorb this $50 to $75 million loss. I think they are wrong. 
I think those who are for law and order and for law enforcement have to vote against this amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. Let those who want to purchase a gun and exercise their right, exercise their responsibility to pay for this check, to make certain that those people who worry about gun violence have less to worry about. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment from the Senator from New Hampshire.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the $100 million we have invested is for the hardware for the computers. It now costs $13 to $16 every time they do a background check. I think the people should pay for it. The Senator from New Hampshire would take the money out of FBI for other law enforcement. I think the FBI needs these funds to do important tasks. I hope the Senator will agree that the FBI is an agency that we need to be strong in the United States. Taking $50 million to $75 million away from them is not going to make them a stronger agency or make Americans any safer at home.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain this amendment. It is rather simple, straightforward. It is, again, on the issue of guns. I am hoping now, for the first time today, that we can find some consensus on that issue. And I have spoken to some of my former adversaries, and there may be a chance. But I would like to explain what this amendment does. 
Earlier today, we have said in our votes on this floor--this body has said--that when it comes to requiring people who purchase guns in the United States when they purchase a handgun to buy a trigger lock, we voted no, they should not be required to buy a trigger lock. Then we said, if you are going to have a criminal background check when you buy a gun in this country, you do not have to pay for it; other taxpayers have to pay for it; it is free. Those are the two votes so far. 
I hope that I am going to broach a subject here where we can find some common ground on the issue of owning guns. Remember with me, for a moment, last year when there was a terrible killing at the Empire State Building. Gun violence in America, unfortunately, is not novel. We read about it every day, and we see it on the news. 
But it struck me as odd when I heard about this case because, if you will remember--and I think I have the sequence correctly--a resident of the Nation of Lebanon came to the United States on a nonimmigrant visa, such as a tourist visa. When he arrived in the United States, he visited the State of Florida, which has relatively lax laws in terms of the purchase of firearms. He bought a firearm in Florida, took it up to the Empire State Building, and gunned down several innocent people, other tourists at the Empire State Building. 
It struck me as odd that while we enshrine the right of American citizens to own firearms, we apparently have few, if any, ways to check when people come into this country to buy a gun as to whether or not they are citizens of this country. 
So in this case, a man from another nation, a tourist, bought a gun and killed innocent Americans. I think that goes too far. I think, frankly, we ought to say that if you come into this country as our guest, not as a citizen of the United States, that we are going to restrict your right to purchase a firearm. You are not a citizen of our country; we have a right to impose such restrictions on you. 
So here is what we do: We say to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, send over, through your computers, the names of those who are in this country legally on these visas; we will put them into our background check. If this individual had shown up at a gun store and said, `I want to purchase a gun,' they would put his name in the computer. And if he came up as a nonimmigrant visa holder, not a citizen of the United States, they would have said, `No'; and had they said no to this man, several Americans might be alive today. 
I don't think that is an unreasonable requirement. In considering this amendment, I should think that people might question whether or not it is our obligation in this Nation, under the Constitution or otherwise, to arm people who come to visit us. I am not sure it is. 
Now, we do make exceptions, and I want to make certain that those who read this amendment understand the exceptions. We tried to imagine the exceptions of those coming to the United States on nonimmigrant visas who might need to own a gun for very real and legal purposes. 
Here are the exceptions that we included: We said if you are someone who has come to the United States for lawful hunting or sporting hunts--so you have someone who enjoys hunting and can legally do so in the United States, who comes here for that purpose, goes to the far west, wherever it might be, that person is exempt. That person may purchase a gun while here for that purpose. 
An official representative of foreign governments--certainly, any head of state brings a security contingent with him and that person may possess a gun. 
Those who are credited with the U.S. Government's mission to an international organization; those en route from one country to another; an official of a foreign government or a distinguished foreign visitor, a foreign law enforcement officer. 
We try to say these are categories of people which might in the ordinary course of events have a gun, need to purchase a gun, for very legitimate purposes. 
Now, what about those who are there on a nonimmigrant visa for a longer period of time? I am willing to concede that some are here for maybe even years legally on nonimmigrant visas and may need a gun at some point. We even put a provision in for that. 
A waiver of this requirement--if a person has resided in the United States for 180 days and can provide a statement to our Government from his Embassy or consulate that says he is authorized to acquire a firearm and he doesn't have a criminal record in his home country. 
So I think we have created exceptions which will allow those people who are here on nonimmigrant visas, who are not here to commit a crime, an opportunity to purchase or own a firearm. Yet we have said that tourists from any nation who comes in, buys a firearm, commits an act of terrorism or murder, is not welcome. We are not going to make it easy for them. 
That is the amendment which I have offered. I hope that those who are mulling over its provisions will come to the conclusion that it is not an unreasonable suggestion. I hope those who visit our country understand they are welcome. When it comes to purchasing a gun, which may lead to a violent crime, we are at least going to ask some questions. I think the people of America expect us to ask those questions. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

That is consistent with the original language of the amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. As we consider the FY 1999 VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill, I would like to call your attention to the serious flooding problems that continue to plague the City of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs, and to urge your consideration to provide funding for a system of flood control tunnels designed to mitigate these weather-related problems. 
For years, severe thunderstorms have caused extensive flooding in the Chicago area due to the antiquated storm drainage system that serves the region. The drainage system, also linked to the sewage system, is quickly filled to capacity and overwhelmed during storm events, resulting in sewage backflows into Lake Michigan and the basements of thousands of homes. This flooding creates major public health hazards, leaves neighborhoods without electrical power, and causes disruptions of major transportation thoroughfares. 
These kind of flooding emergencies will continue to plague the City of Chicago and neighboring communities until the construction of an important system of tunnels and reservoirs is completed. This system is known as the Tunnel and Reservoir plan (TARP), an initiative of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I with my colleagues Senators Chafee, Lautenberg, Torricelli, Reed, Dodd, and Boxer introduce the `Brady Waiting Period Extension Act of 1998.' It is vital that we enact this measure this year if we are to ensure Americans that the popular Brady Bill will continue to be one hundred percent effective. 
Almost 5 years ago, Congress passed the Brady Bill. That law contained a provision that required a 5 day waiting period before a person can buy a gun. Unfortunately, on November 30 of this year, the waiting period will be eliminated when we begin using the national instant check system for gun purchasers. 
I fully support the use of an instant check system to determine if a putative firearm purchaser is legally barred from owning a gun because of a criminal record. But I believe that it must be coupled with a cooling off period. 
Let me briefly explain what his legislation would to. It would require that anyone who wishes to buy a handgun must wait three days. There are two exceptions to this requirement. First, if a prospective purchaser presents a written statement from his of her local chief law enforcement officer stating that the handgun is needed immediately because of a threat to that person's life or that of his family, then the cooling off period will not apply. Second, if a prospective purchaser lives in a state that has a licensing requirement--and there are 27 such states--then the federal cooling off period will not apply. 
I think that both of these are common sense exceptions. Obviously people who have a legitimate and immediate need of a handgun for self-defense should be able to buy one. And in the states that have licensing or permit systems, the process of getting a permit acts as a state cooling off period. 
This measure also requires that when a person applies to buy a gun that the gun shop owner send a copy of the application to the local chief law enforcement officer. In addition, it alters the amount of time that the state or federal government has to investigate a potential purchaser who has an arrest record. Under the law that will go into effect on the first of December this year, if a person with an arrest record applies for a gun, law enforcement will have three days to determine if that arrest resulted in a conviction. The measure we introduce today would give law enforcement five days. 
Mr. President, let me walk you through the process of buying a gun if this law were in place. 
If you are in a state that does not have a permit system in place, then you go into a store and fill out a purchase form. A copy of that form will be sent to the Insta-Check point of contact for your state and a copy will also be sent to the chief law enforcement officer for where you live. You will then need to wait three days whereupon, assuming that you do not have a criminal record or any of the other disqualifying characteristics, you will be able to pick up your gun. 
If on the other hand, when the Insta-Check is run, the FBI learns that you were arrested, then you will have to wait at least 5 days. That five days will be used to determine if the arrest resulted in a conviction. If it did not, then after 5 days you can get your gun. It you were arrested and convicted then you cannot get your gun and may be prosecuted. 
Enacting this law is only sensible. A cooling off period may be the only barrier between a woman and her abusive husband whose local restraining order doesn't show up on a computer check or the only obstacle in the way of a troubled person planning to commit suicide and take others with them. A cooling off period will prevent crimes of passion and spontaneous suicides. The list of people who have bought guns and used them within a few hours or a day to kill themselves or others is far too long. 
A recent study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrates a disturbing trend that reinforces the need for a cooling off period. Normally, 4 to 5% of all crime guns traced by the police were used in murders. But the study found that 20% of all guns traced within 7 days of purchase were used in murders. That is a startlingly high incidence of guns being bought and used very soon thereafter to commit a murder. 
But this measure has a second, equally important justification. 
That the Insta-Check system is in very good shape, but it will never be perfect. For example, it will not have a lot of mental health records. And it is unlikely to have information like restraining orders entered in domestic violence cases. Letting local law enforcement know about a potential gun purchase is a good idea--the local sheriff may know that a person trying to buy a gun has a restraining order while the FBI's Insta-check computer might not. In short, then, this bill will help serve as a fail safe mechanism for the Insta-Check system. I for one do not want to learn a year from now that someone got a gun and used it to harm someone else when a simple check of local records in addition to the Insta-Check would have revealed that the purchaser had a history of mental instability. 
Making the Brady waiting period permanent is not about more government. It's about fewer gun crime victims. I hope that we can all agree on this goal.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his fine statement, as well as my colleague from Iowa. The Senator from New Jersey and I have introduced legislation which attempts to streamline this entire process. It is mind-boggling to try to come to grips with the many different agencies and laws that apply to food safety inspection in America. Though that is not the object of the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, it is something which I hope on another day the Senate will address. To think that there are some six different Federal agencies with the responsibility of food inspection, some 35 different laws and a crazy quilt of jurisdiction which not only wastes taxpayers' dollars, but creates risk for consumers is unacceptable. 
What we address today is more immediate, different than a change of jurisdiction within agencies. It is to address the immediate need to assure the consumers of America that its Government is doing all in its power to protect them at their family tables. 
This issue first came to my attention about 3 or 4 years ago. I certainly heard about the E. coli outbreaks in Jack-in-the-Box and the others that were well publicized, but I received a letter when I was a Member of the House of Representatives from a lady in Chicago. I didn't represent the city, but she sent me a letter when she heard we were debating modernizing our food inspection system. 
In this handwritten letter, Nancy Donley of Chicago told the tragic story of going to the local grocery store to buy hamburger for her 6-year-old son Alex, coming home and preparing it. Alex ate the hamburger and within a few days was dead, dead from E. coli-contaminated hamburger, which led to one of the most gruesome episodes one can imagine. 
Your heart breaks to think of a mother and father standing helplessly by a hospital bed wondering what is taking the life away from this little boy whom they love so much. She tells in graphic detail how Alex's body organ by organ shut down until he finally expired because of contamination in a food product. 
It brought to my attention an issue which I had not thought about for a long time, because you see, unlike some Members of the Senate, I have some personal knowledge when it comes to this issue, not just because I eat, which all of us do, but 30 years ago, I worked my way through college working in a slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, IL. I spent 12 months of my life there, and I saw the meat inspection process and the meat processing firsthand. 
I still eat meat, and I still believe America has the safest food supply in the world, but I am convinced that we need to do more. The world has changed in 30 years. The distribution network of food in the United States has changed. When I was a young boy, it was a local butcher shop buying from a local farmer processing for my family. Now look at it--nationwide and worldwide distribution, sometimes of a great product but sometimes of a great problem. That some contaminated beef last year led to the greatest meat recall in our history is just a suggestion of the scope of this problem. A contamination in one plant in one city can literally become a national problem. 
This chart that Senator Harkin of Iowa brought before us doesn't tell what happened across the United States in 1 year. It tells us what happened in 1 month, June of 1998. These were the outbreaks and recalls in the United States of America. I am sorry to say, with the possible exception of New York, my home State of Illinois was hit the hardest, for you see, we had over 6,000 people in the Chicago area who were felled by some food-related illness that might have been associated with potato salad--6,000 people. We are still searching to find exactly what caused it. 
We had a hearing with Senator Collins of Maine just a few days ago in the Governmental Affairs Committee which took a look at the importation of fruits and vegetables. She focused--and I think it was an excellent hearing--on Guatemalan raspberries that came into the United States contaminated with cyclospora, and, of course, caused illnesses for many people across the United States. 
The fascinating thing, the challenging part of that testimony was that if you look at our inspection process today, there is no way for us to detect the presence of that bacteria, nor is it easy for any doctor to diagnose a person as having been stricken by that illness. 
As we trace those imports in the United States of fruits and vegetables, we find that we face a new challenge in addition to this broadening distribution network. It is a challenge where our appetites have changed, and where we enjoy the bounty of produce from all over the world. So our concerns which used to be focused on the United States and partially on imported fruits and vegetables have expanded dramatically. Now we worry about imported fruits and vegetables from the far corners of the world. 
We worry about contaminations which we never heard of before which could, in fact, affect literally millions of Americans. The challenge of food inspection is changing dramatically. 
Let me give you another illustration about what is happening. Most of us can recall, when we were children, when mom would bake a cake or make cookies, and she finished putting it all together, and you were standing dutifully by waiting for the cookies or the cake, she would hand you the mixing bowl--and you would reach in with a spoon or spatula and taste a little bit of the dough, cake batter, whatever it might be. As you see, I did that many times; and I appreciated it very much. 
You know, now that is dangerous. You know why it is dangerous? Because of the raw eggs that are part of the mix. It used to be that the salmonella was traced to the shell of the egg, so if the shell fell in the batter, you would say, `Oh, that's something we need to be concerned about.' But, sadly, within the last few years they have found the salmonella inside the egg. So you can never be certain handing that mixing bowl to a tiny tot in the kitchen that you are not inviting a foodborne illness that could be very serious. 
Things are changing. We need to change with them. When President Clinton stepped forward and said, `America's concerned about this problem and American families realize they can't protect themselves as individuals, they're counting on us to do the job,' he challenged us to fund it. Sadly, we are not funding it in this bill. 
That is why the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, Senator Torricelli, and I are offering this amendment to increase the funds. 
What will we do with them? 
First, increase the number of inspectors. We clearly need more people on the borders taking at look at the process and the fresh food coming into the United States. I have been there. I have been to Nogales, Mexico, Nogales, AZ. I have seen that border crossing. 
I have followed the FDA inspection all the way from the trucks to the samples taken into the laboratory in Los Angeles, CA, to be tested; and I can tell you that, though it is good, it is far from perfect. 
In most instances, by the time they have tested that sample of fruits or sample of vegetables, and if they find anything wrong with it, it is long gone, it is already on the grocery shelves somewhere in America. Oh, they are going to be more watchful the next time around, but they cannot protect us with the resources presently available. 
President Clinton said we can do more, and we should do more. We also need to look into this whole question of surveillance. As we noted here, this distribution system around the Nation really calls on us to move quickly. If we find a problem at a processing plant in my home State of Illinois, we need to know very quickly whether or not it has been spread across the United States so that recalls can take place. 
We need more research, too, research on these foodborne illnesses, how they can be averted and avoided. I think we can achieve that, as we should. The Senator from New Jersey had the most telling statistic: 53,000 different food production sites around America, 700 inspectors. We will never have an inspector for every site. We certainly can do better than we have at the present time. 
Let me also say that the offset that the Senator from Iowa is offering to us is a very good one. I am personally aware of it because a large part of it represents an amendment which I have offered for several years, first in the House and then in the Senate. It answers a question which virtually all of us, as politicians--Senators and Members of Congress--face. 
How many times I have gone into a town meeting and someone raises their hand and says, `Senator, let me ask you a question. If you tell us that tobacco is so dangerous, why does the Federal 
Government subsidize it?' Well, I will tell you, there is not a very good answer to that question. 
This amendment being offered by the Senator from Iowa finally puts to rest and answers that question. We are going to stop subsidizing the growing of tobacco in America. We are going to stop asking taxpayers across the United States to pay for a subsidy to the tobacco-growing industry. 
I have offered this amendment before. I have never had a better use of it than what the Senator from Iowa is offering today. Take the taxpayers' money now being invested in the cultivation and growth of this deadly product, tobacco, take that money, put it into food safety. 
There is a real justice to this amendment and what the Senator is offering so that we can say to people, we are not only stopping this Federal subsidy of the cultivation of tobacco, we are trying to protect children, the elderly, and those who have some health problems that may make them particularly vulnerable. So I heartily support the offset which is being offered by the Senator from Iowa.

We could not think of a better investment of this money than to take it away from the promotion of a product which causes so much death and disease and put it into the kind of health initiative which the Senator from Iowa has suggested. 
Let me just say this: Mark my words. Within a few weeks we will read in the newspapers again of some outbreak of food contamination and food illness. We will be alarmed and saddened by the stories of the vulnerable--the children, the elderly, and those who are in a frail medical condition who have become victims because of it. 
Each of us, in our own way, if it affects our State will express our outrage, our disappointment; and we will promise that we will do something about it. Well, let us be honest. This is the amendment that might do something about it. We can give these speeches--and we will--but the real question is, Are we prepared to back up our concern in front of a television camera with our votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate? 
The Senator from Iowa is offering us an opportunity to really be certain that the American people understand what our commitment is to this important issue. I thank him for his commitment. I am happy to join him as a cosponsor of this amendment. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with language included in the House version of the agriculture appropriations bill that could have the effect of depriving rural working poor families of perhaps the only source of information they have on the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. 
In my own state of Illinois, for tax year 1996, over 750,000 working families received this critical tax relief. The EITC lifts approximately 4.6 million children out of poverty each year while encouraging work. The tax credit helps a substantial number of low-income working households in rural areas. A 1996 information bulletin published by the USDA Economic Research Service (No. 724-02) noted the importance of the EITC for rural working families: `The earned income tax credit (EITC) has become a major source of support for low-income rural workers and their families, especially in the South, where the rural poor are concentrated. Program benefits for rural areas are expected to total about $6 billion in 1996 . . . providing benefits to an estimated 4.5 million low-income rural workers and their families.' 
Unfortunately, report language included in the House's FY 1999 agriculture appropriations bill could deter and discourage important educational work done by CES offices. The language questions the appropriateness of CES involvement in informing families in their local communities about the EITC. This language could prompt many CES offices to discontinue their efforts to educate eligible workers about the tax credit. If that occurs, substantial numbers of low-income working families in rural areas could lose an important source of information about federal tax relief for which they qualify. 
In Illinois, Coop Extension Services offices in 22 counties or communities (many rural) have been working to alert eligible working families to the EITC. The University of Illinois-Urbana Cooperative Extension Service provides programs to low-income working parents and students, including a teen parent welfare-to-work program in the high schools of East St. Louis. It published a notebook, `The Easy Way to Prepare Your 1996 Individual Income Tax Return,' for distribution to program participants. The notebook contains simplified tax return instructions, including how to determine eligibility for the EITC and calculate the amount of the credit. The program surveyed participants, and found that only a third of the participants had filed a tax return previously, but 86 percent filed a return after their training. A third of the participants were found to be eligible for the EITC. 
The House language is simply not acceptable and should be rejected by the Senate conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Cochran in a brief colloquy regarding the need for increased funding for the nutrition for the elderly program, contained in this bill. Senior nutrition programs are our best defense against elderly hunger and malnutrition. The House has provided $10 million more than the Senate for this program which helps our elderly, low-income seniors have good, nutritious meals. This increased funding would restore funds for both meals on wheels and meal sites by $10 million to $150 million to their FY96 levels. 
The Senior nutrition program provides grants to states so that local organizations can prepare meals delivered to elderly persons in both congregate settings or in their homes. Many poor seniors rely on these programs as their primary source for nutrition. Unfortunately, 41% of Meals on Wheels programs have a waiting list. As the senior population grows, these waiting lists will only increase without adequate funding both local and federal for home-delivered meals programs. The average beneficiary for senior nutrition programs is 77 years old and 90% of beneficiaries live on income below 200% of the poverty level. 40% live on incomes below the poverty level. These poor seniors really need this program. I hope that the House level of funding will alleviate some of these waiting lists. 
Studies conducted at the University of Florida found that over 66% of beneficiaries of senior nutrition programs are at moderate to high risk for malnutrition. In addition, these senior nutrition programs not only make good social policy sense, but they also make good fiscal policy sense. Every $1 spent on this nutrition program saves $3 in federal Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' health care costs, since malnourished patients stay in the hospital nearly twice as long as well-nourished seniors, costing $2,000 to $10,000 more per stay. HHS Secretary Shalala has called these elderly nutrition programs `a bargain for the federal government'. 
This program also provides cash assistance to state agencies to help store and donate food to low-income seniors. 
Home-delivered meals programs highlight positive values through volunteerism and community support. It is this type of cost-effective, federal-local partnership that Congress should be encouraging. This level of funding is endorsed by the National Council of Senior Citizens, the Grey Panthers and the Meals on Wheels Association of America. 
4 million seniors live in poverty in this, the richest nation in the world. Another 16 million live near the poverty level. Our seniors are going hungry because we cut funding for this seniors nutrition program two years ago. Now is the time to restore this funding to its FY96 levels in conference.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers for accepting the amendment I offered to ban egg repackaging as part of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. This amendment is a first step in continuing to ensure the safety of the nation's egg supply. 
On April 17, 1998, the Secretary of Agriculture announced a prohibition on the repackaging of eggs packed under the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) voluntary grading program. This amendment codifies Secretary Glickman's prohibition which took effect on April 27, and affects eggs packed in cartons that bear the USDA grade shield. 
A recent `Dateline NBC' program focused public attention on the repackaging of shell eggs by egg packers, and raised concerns about this practice. This amendment will prohibit shell eggs that have left the packing plant, and been shipped for sale, from being returned to the packing plant for repackaging into USDA shielded cartons. This amendment affects the approximately 30% of shell eggs voluntarily graded by USDA. 
The amendment also directs that not later than 90 days after the date of its enactment, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall jointly submit a status report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This report is intended to provide the status of actions taken to enhance the safety of shell eggs and egg products. The report also will provide the status of the prohibition on the repackaging of USDA graded eggs, and provide an assessment of the feasibility and desirability of applying to all shell eggs, not just USDA graded eggs, the prohibition on repackaging in order to enhance food safety, consumer information, and consumer awareness. 
The safety of our egg supply is a primary example of the confusing array of laws, regulations, and voluntary programs which divides regulation among four federal agencies and the states. The legislation I have introduced with Senator Torricelli--The Safe Food Act (S.1465)--focuses attention on the problems of having multiple federal agencies with jurisdiction over various food safety laws, and how fragmentation and duplication cause waste and confusion. Jurisdiction over eggs is a good example of how confusion, overlap, and the lack of coordination leave the American public subject to food poisoning outbreaks. 
The health of American families is at risk if we do not work to ensure that only safe eggs reach America's store shelves. USDA recently reported that each year over 660,000 persons in the United States become sick from eating eggs contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Illnesses from SE can be fatal to the elderly, children, and those with weakened immune systems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the SE bacteria caused more reported deaths between 1988 and 1992 than any other foodborne pathogen. The Center for Science in the Public Interest estimated an annual cost of illness from SE at $118 million to $767 million. 
Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. However, we can do better. This amendment to ban egg repackaging will help advance the federal government's commitment to continue providing Americans with the safest food supply.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for making that point clear, because I would like to join him and the Senator from Kansas, as he says, in making a very clear record hear that none of us intend to in any way restrict the power of the President--this one, or any future President--to fight terrorism, or to stand firmly in opposition to nuclear proliferation or anything that might in any way assault the integrity of the United States or the integrity of any American citizen. 
I rise in support of this amendment that has been offered by Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, and Senator Biden in a bipartisan fashion. 
The seat that I usually occupy over here is a desk once occupied by Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Senator Humphrey of Minnesota was from an agricultural State, and said in the darkest days of the cold war when the United States was engaged in massive troop commitments in Europe to protect against the possible encroachment of communism, when we were fixated in our foreign policy of the possibility of Soviet expansionism, said that we should be willing to trade anything they can't shoot back at us, and on that basis promoted the idea of agricultural trade. 
You may remember visits by Nikita Khrushchev to the United States to farms in Iowa during the midst of the cold war and the suggestions that we should still engage in trade involving food with a nation that was, in fact, our mortal enemy, the U.S.S.R. A lot of us in the Farm Belt felt that this was a reasonable means to provide some exchange not only of goods but of ideas. We felt that it also said to the average Soviet citizen that the United States of America represented people who not only had a bounty to share but were willing to do it despite our clear political differences. 
Senator Humphrey inspired a policy which was followed by Democrats and Republicans for years. Soviet grain sales was a major source of discussion, even during the height of the cold war. I guess when President Reagan announced that the Soviet Union was the `Evil Empire,' we were still dealing in grain. We believed we could deal in food and still have a serious difference in terms of political philosophy. 
Does it make a difference? Are we kidding ourselves to believe that if American food products should be sent to another country it has any impact? I think it does. 
Eight years ago I went to India. Outside of Calcutta in a dusty little village I visited a site where some of America's agricultural products were being sent. It was a little facility where children--tiny little emaciated children--were being brought in for what, in effect, was their best meal of the day. I looked, and was somewhat amused to find that the bag of grain came from Peoria, IL. Imagine my pride that what we had grown in Peoria--the corn, soybeans, and wheat that was brought in--was a food product being fed in a small village outside Calcutta. What we provided these children looked like some mass of dough. It was just these basic grains mixed with water and a little sugar. They ate it like they were on a trip to Baskin-Robbins. It was the biggest treat of their lives. But before they ate the food from the United States, an interesting thing occurred. The person who was supervising the feeding of these small children in this nutrition center asked the children to pause for a moment and bow their heads and say a Hindu prayer of thanks to the United States for sending this grain. 
Does it make a difference? Would it make a difference in Libya, or in North Korea, for children and their parents to know that the people of the United States were involved in either humanitarian aid or the sale of food? I think it does. I think it says something about us as a Nation. 
Look at the situation in North Korea. The Senator from Kansas has been there. I have not. But it had to be absolutely frightening to see that sort of deprivation and famine in that struggle to survive. 
The Senator from Connecticut is telling us in this amendment that the United States should establish standards when we push for our political policies which define us to the world. I believe, as he does, that the export of food and medicine should be above the political agenda. We are talking about the survival of children, of pregnant women, and of their families. As much as we may abhor that form of government that rules over those families, we should never be in a position where the United States has denied its bounty, its excess, to those who are in need. 
As I have traveled, I have noticed the need for medicine in some countries around the world. Even those that have been liberated from the Soviet Union--now new democracies--really have medical care which is at the lowest level. Many times the basic medicines which we have in such great supply in the United States could make a world of difference in terms of disease like cholera, diphtheria, and other problems that children suffer from around the world. 
And so I think what the amendment seeks to do is to say that we will not deny to the children, in a country led by some dictator whom we might disagree with, the basic protection of medicine. 
This amendment really speaks to our values. This amendment draws a line in defining America to the world. This amendment says that we will not show our hatred at the expense of innocent children. This amendment says that when we apply unilateral economic sanctions, we have enough muscle in so many other areas to make our political point that we need not take it out on the most helpless in countries around the world. 
I am happy to stand in support of this amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Cochran, in a brief colloquy regarding the `Orphan Products Research Grant' program. I am pleased to note that the bill before us which includes funding for the Food and Drug Administration specifically maintains the current level of funding for the operation and grants that support research on rare conditions and diseases, the so-called `orphan products'. While I hasten to point out here, as in many other cases, continued level funding is a reduction in program effectiveness because underlying costs go up which result in fewer grants and less research efforts going into this effort to help what have to be some of the most neglected and medically needy in our society who lack effective therapies. 
Beyond the grant funding, I am seeking assurance that the Committee intends that the staffing and support functions of the FDA's orphan program are to be continued at not less than the current level of appropriated dollars and FTE's allocated to this most important mission and function. I understand that the FY98 resources are 17 FTEs and $1.8 million for operation costs for administering the Office for Orphan Products Development. The total funding level is $11.542 million which includes both grants and operation costs. The whole program is relatively small, clearly within the core functions of the agency, and extraordinarily effective and productive. It certainly deserves to have priority on any future increased funds that become available. In the last 15 years, this program has nurtured the development and marketing of more than 170 products, 21 of which have directly benefitted from its grant funding. It could easily get lost in the focus on many of the other big ticket, high visibility responsibilities of the FDA.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a private relief bill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would grant Nizar and Hassan Sweilem permanent residence in the United States. Nizar and Hassan Sweilem are natives and citizens of Lebanon. They are also brothers. 
The Sweilem brothers have lived in Des Plaines, Illinois for fourteen years and have made the most of this opportunity to obtain a first-class education in this country. Nizar recently earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Hassan earned a B.S. in Political Science and is completing a degree in Computer Science also at the University of Illinois. 
Both Nizar and Hassan were born in Beirut, Lebanon. They entered the United States as children in August of 1983 to visit relatives. When they entered the United States, they were accompanied by their mother, and their maternal uncle. Their uncle returned early to Lebanon and was killed two weeks later when a rocket destroyed the Sweilem family home. 
In April of 1984, because of her brother's murder and her own fear of persecution, Leila Sweilem applied to the INS for asylum in the United States without the assistance of counsel. Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were included in their mother's application since they were her minor children. Since 1984, the Sweilem brothers have been pursuing the right to live legally in the United States as permanent residents. 
In 1985, the INS denied the Sweilems' request for asylum and initiated deportation proceedings against the family. Leila, Nizar and Hassan renewed their application for asylum in their hearing before an Immigration Judge, but those requests were denied. The Sweilems appealed that decision, but before any decision was issued, the Attorney General designated nationals of Lebanon eligible for Temporary Protected Status on account of the extreme level of violence created by the Lebanese civil war. TPS for citizens of Lebanon continued until March of 1993. 
In August of 1993, Hassan and Nizar asked that their asylum appeal be reinstated and that their case be remanded to allow them to apply for suspension of deportation. In November of 1994, Hassan and Nizar applied for suspension of deportation. While their application was pending, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in September of 1996. This law retroactively made Nizar and Hassan ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable. Despite the fact that at that time the Sweilem brothers had twelve years of continuous residence in the U.S., the time accrued after the denial of their mother's initial asylum request does not count. 
Last year, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could result in grave injustices to certain groups of people, so in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan 
and Central American Relief Act granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries. 
That law allowed several hundred thousand Central Americans and former Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries, who came to the U.S. during the civil strife of the 1980's to adjust to permanent resident status under more lenient hardship rules that existed prior to the 1996 change. The U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. If Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were citizens of Nicaragua, El Salvador Guatemala or any of the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, they could continue to pursue their applications for suspension of deportation. The fact that they are citizens of Lebanon makes them ineligible for relief. 
Nizar and Hassan Sweilem have lived in the United States for almost 15 years, since they were 12 and 14, respectively. They have taken full advantage of their educational opportunities and are more than capable of caring for themselves. The brothers will face undue hardship by returning to Lebanon, as evidenced by their uncle's murder. The Sweilem brothers' extended family now resides in the United States, and the brothers have strong ties to the local community. My office has received numerous letters from the community on their behalf, including a letter from the Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois. They have no family left in Lebanon and have never visited it in the last 15 years. 
The Sweilem brothers have spent more than half their lives in the United States. At every step, the Sweilems took American law at its word: they always attempted to follow the law only to have Congress suddenly pull the rug out from under them. I think this is an injustice and these two brothers from Lebanon deserve the same relief that we gave people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Czechoslovakia. Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to support these Lebanese brothers by giving them permanent residence status and not depriving them of the opportunity to become United States citizens.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for recognition in support of his effort. I say to my colleagues in the Senate, we have, in the course of the century, embarked on major undertakings at the Federal level. Probably the most historic was the New Deal. The New Deal, which goes back some 65 years-plus, was an effort to bring this country out of a terrible situation. It was initiated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and he tried very many different ideas to try to get America moving again. 
I thought the hallmark of the New Deal was the willingness to concede that every new idea in the New Deal didn't work. Some of them had to be junked; some of them had to be changed substantially. 
I was one who voted in favor of the welfare reform legislation. I believed that we needed to change the welfare system in this country, to change the mentality of welfare, to break the generational dependency that was repeating and repeating. 
I said as I voted for it, and I repeat today, that bill, as drafted, was not perfect law by a long shot. It didn't reflect the reality of change that would take place across America. So since then, on four or five different occasions, we have modified welfare reform in order to be more responsive to the actual needs of Americans. 
What the Senator from Minnesota is asking us to do is to open our eyes, go beyond the stereotypes, go beyond the cliches, look at the real people who are now making the life struggle to come off welfare and into an independent state and a state where they can raise their families in dignity. 
I have met women like those who have written to Senator Wellstone. One I can recall is in Springfield. She is coming off welfare, attending the community college. Bringing her 12-year-old daughter to class with her because she had no one to watch her, keeping that daughter in class with her during the course of the day, and trying to find her way home in the evening by public transportation was making the ultimate sacrifice. She was going to get that associate degree and use it to improve her life and to help her daughter no matter what. We should never stand in the way of that. 
What the Senator from Minnesota is saying is let us have the flexibility to recognize when people are making an honest and determined effort. Let us not set up these barriers and walls to progress. Let us join in a partnership and hold our hand out to help these people come up that ladder to success. I think when it comes to education, it should go out without debate and really without controversy here; that if we have people who are moving on the track to training and education which liberates them from welfare dependency, we shouldn't constrict them with rules or with our laws or our legal stereotypes. 
I gladly support the Senator from Minnesota, and I hope that we can provide this flexibility, and with this flexibility, we can give more people an opportunity to succeed. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the remarks which he has made. 
The Internal Revenue Service, the agency we love to hate every April 15. We write out those checks. It is our responsibility as citizens of this country. But it hurts--all the money we send them. Then these hearings were held, and we found out that this agency, collecting taxes, has been using heavy-handed tactics, sometimes with not the most basic courtesy. We have a right to be upset, and because of that, Congress--the House and the Senate; Democrats and Republicans--and the President said, let us do something about it. And we set out to make some rather significant changes in the way the Internal Revenue Service does business. 
I am glad to see that happen. But I have to be a little bit wary of what the result might be. You see, in my home office in Springfield, IL, I received a phone call in the midst of this debate. And a gentleman said to one of my staffers, `Thank goodness this Senate has finally awakened to these thugs at the Internal Revenue Service. Their abusive conduct is just horrible. And now finally you're going to change this system.' And my staffer said, `Have you had a personal experience?' `Well, yes, I did,' he said. `And these people from the Internal Revenue Service just hounded me and my family to no end.' And he said, `Thank goodness you're finally doing something about it.' 
My staffer said, `Was it a serious problem?' `Well,' he said, `they made it out to be a serious problem.' He said, `I had a little problem with reporting on my income tax.' 
My staffer said, `What was the problem?' He said, `Well, I failed to file my income tax return.' My staffer said, `You didn't file your tax return?' He said, `Well, that's right.' And my staffer said, `Well, that can be serious.' He said, `Well, it was an oversight.' My staffer said, `How many times have you failed to file a return?' He said, `3 or 4 years,' and added, `You would think that was a crime by the way these people act.' Well, it is a crime. 
I hope that those who are critical of the Internal Revenue Service understand that we still rely on them and give them an important responsibility. The 99-plus percent of Americans who dutifully, willfully, voluntarily file their income tax returns each year are counting on the Internal Revenue Service making sure everybody else does, too. We are all part of the same American family. We all bear this responsibility. 
So as we talk about reforming this agency, let us not lose sight of the bottom line. They have an important job to do to collect the money to provide for our national defense, education, highways, and so many other things on which we rely. 
This bill went through a lot of different incarnations. I think the final bill, as it applies to the Internal Revenue Service, is a good one because it makes some rather significant changes. 
I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who was just with me on the floor. They headed the IRS Restructuring Commission. And under their leadership, the IRS commission produced a collection of very thoughtful recommendations, many of which are included in this conference report. Senators Roth and Moynihan have led a real truly bipartisan effort to make the commission's recommendations a reality. 
I also commend the gentleman whose name was mentioned a moment ago, and that is the new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti. His is not an easy job. He came from the private sector at great personal and financial sacrifice in the true spirit of public service to lead this important agency. 
One of the first things that hit him between the eyes is the so-called Y2K problem, the computer problem that when we switch over in the next century, will the computers get it right? Will they know we are going to the year 2000 and not the year 1900? It sounds so simple. When you look at all the computers in America and all the programs and look at the Internal Revenue Service, you can understand that Mr. Rossotti and most of the people at the IRS are consumed with the responsibility of getting it right and making these computers understand we are headed to the 21st century and not to restart the 20th century. 
There are parts of this bill that, I think, are very positive. The restructuring of the management and governance of the IRS so it operates more like the private sector--that certainly is a step in the right direction. The Commissioner asked for, and received, greater flexibility in managing his IRS workforce. We now make it easier for taxpayers to file their returns electronically by extending the due date for these returns from February 28 to March 31. The bill also requires the Secretary to develop a procedure that will allow taxpayers to confirm their return without having to send in their signature. 
We establish taxpayers' rights. As a practicing attorney before I was elected to the House of Representatives, I represented clients before the Internal Revenue Service. That was no mean feat. It is one of the few experiences in the law in America where you are guilty until proven innocent, and we assembled the data necessary to prove our innocence and did our very best. I didn't understand the gravity of that challenge until my own small business was audited in Springfield, IL, and then I went through it personally. I am glad to say we didn't have tax liability added to it as a result of the audit, but I learned first hand how daunting it is to challenge the Internal Revenue Service. 
Our bill says the burden of proof will be on the IRS in disputes that come up before the IRS Tax Court dealing with income, estate, and gift taxes, provided the taxpayer is cooperating by providing access to information and documents related to the return. So that gives the individual taxpayer, the business person, a little better chance of being treated fairly. 
There was also a provision in the law which was brought out during the course of the committee hearings which was very troubling. A lot of innocent spouses who may have put their name on the tax return at the request of their husband or wife, not knowing the contents, found out in later years, even after a divorce, that if something was wrong in that return, they, too, could have been held liable--in fact, criminally liable in some instances. We have tried in this law to define `innocent spouse' in a way so that those who are truly innocent do not bear that responsibility. 
We ease interest and penalties. Currently, for example, if a taxpayer makes an honest mistake--underline `honest mistake'--it might be several years before the IRS discovers it. Even if it is an honest mistake, it makes sense for the IRS to impose a penalty just as any other business would if you were underpaying bills. What doesn't make sense is for the IRS to charge interest and penalties during the time in which the taxpayer is unaware of the mistake. That is corrected in this bill. 
There is more congressional accountability, and that has been referred to on the floor. Yes, it is true, Congress will be watching the Internal Revenue Service more closely. 
There is another provision which I think is important so that taxpayers across America don't get the wrong impression. We ask the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury to report to us annually in terms of compliance; that is, what percentage of American taxpayers are meeting their legal obligations and filing their taxes and what percent are not. If we see an increase in those who are not meeting their legal obligation after we pass this, we are going to have to address it again, because, as I said, the vast majority of Americans do pay their taxes and pay them on time. 
Those are the good parts of the bill, and they are extremely good parts of the bill. I think the bill, when viewed in this context, is a plus. Unfortunately, in the dead of night, in the depths of the conference, some people couldn't leave well enough alone. They thought this bill was so popular and so destined for success, they couldn't wait to put their own amendments on the bill, none of which has anything to do with reforming the Internal Revenue Service, but all of which have something to do with our Tax Code and our Treasury and whether or not we are creating breaks in this bill that we shouldn't. 
One tax break has to do with a change in individual retirement accounts. I like IRAs. I think they have been good for America. A lot of people were able to save money, they are glad they did, and now it has grown over time and it will help them retire. I think we should expand IRAs, particularly for working families so they have a way to put a little money aside for their future needs. The Senator from the State of Delaware, Senator Roth, created the so-called Roth IRA. I kid him so much about the publicity he is receiving. No one will ever be able to defeat him. He is the author of the Roth IRA, and he will be remembered for that and many other things for years to come. It expanded the idea of an individual retirement account and gave Americans more options. 
Unfortunately, in this bill we have taken a new twist on this IRA, and created even more tax opportunities for those at higher incomes, under the name of an individual retirement account. Do you know what it will cost us when it is all said and done? It will cost the taxpayers some $13 billion--that is `billion dollars'--$13 billion. 
A year ago, this Senate was consumed with the debate over amending the Constitution to balance the budget. We had given up on the idea of balancing the books here and said, `That is it, put it in the Constitution, and let the courts enforce it.' That debate went on and on and on. The amendment failed by one vote. So here we are, a year later. Are we talking about the deficit and balancing the budget? No. Instead, in this bill and others, we are talking about a surplus and spending $13 billion we don't have to create tax breaks for wealthy individuals. I don't think that makes sense. I think that is very shortsighted. In the long haul, I think we will regret it. 
There is a reference, as well, to a provision in this bill which has nothing to do with the underlying legislation about the Internal Revenue Service, a provision that will deny veterans medical benefits. Why? Why, in God's name, would that be included in the Internal Revenue Service reform bill? It shouldn't be. 
So I find myself in a dilemma as a member of the conference. When I saw all of the baggage being loaded on to this bill, I refused to sign the conference report. I said I would not put my name to this, not because the underlying bill is bad--I think it is good--but because of all of the people 
who just couldn't suppress the urge to add another ornament to the tree, something they personally wanted. 
Now this bill comes to the floor, and those of us who like the underlying bill and despise the amendments added to it are in a real dilemma. I will probably end up voting for it, but it will be reluctantly. I can guarantee you this: If this passes--and I guess it will--I hope that others will join me, Democrats and Republicans, to make sure that we strip out these little baubles that have been added to the bill that, frankly, are not in the best interest of this Nation. They benefit a handful of wealthy people instead of Americans who deserve the real help and the real break in this legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I agree completely with his comments. 
If the Members of the U.S. Senate serving in the 2d session of the 105th Congress were charged in court with having passed meaningful legislation to help America, I am afraid there is not enough evidence to convict us, because if you look at what we have been about over the last several months, with the exception of renaming Washington National Airport, we have little to show for the time we have spent in Washington and only 10 weeks to go. 
The Senator is so correct, the President, in his State of the Union Address, challenged this Congress, leaders on both sides of the aisle, to address the issues America really cares about: Saving Social Security, campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation, education, child care, doing the things that American families would really applaud, responding to their needs. 
Yet, we stand here today in the first week of July and we hear, again, an effort by the majority leader to not only stop the train in an effort to stop legislation moving forward, but to stop the debate in what is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. 
It is a disappointment to me, and I think to a lot of people who are following this session of the U.S. Senate, that we are back here this week and not about the business that people really care about across America. 
I stand in support of what our leader, Senator Daschle, said, that it is a deprivation of our responsibility as U.S. Senators representing States across this country and as representing families who expect us to respond to these needs, when you think of the opportunities we have already missed--the campaign finance reform bill killed on the floor of the Senate by the Republican leadership, and then we turned around with an opportunity to protect millions of our children from tobacco addiction, killed on the floor of the U.S. Senate by the Republican leadership time and time again. 
Here is an effort by the Democrats to bring out legislation to protect families and patients who go to their doctors wanting the very best in medical care and find themselves twisted in knots by the insurance industry and, once again, efforts on the Republican side to stop us. 
I am afraid that when all is said and done this will turn out to be one of the worst Congresses in this century in terms of its productivity. And if we are to be measured by our productivity, I am not sure that many Senators can collect their paychecks and talk about their pensions based on what we have been able to do or failed to do in the last few months.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers amendment. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. This is a battle he has been waging for many years. I joined him as a Member of the House, and I am happy to join him as a Member of the Senate. 
Some might ask if I have taken leave of my senses to be on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating the elements of the space program with John Glenn on the other side. How do I find myself in that predicament? In this instance, I have to say I disagree with my friend from Ohio and my long-time hero. I believe the Senator from Arkansas is right. In 1984, President Reagan said to the American people that he had a dramatic announcement to make. A permanent-manned space station, an international cooperative effort, is going to be a staging area for further space exploration. It is a great opportunity, and we will be able, at the cost of $8 billion from the U.S. taxpayers to make this happen. Over the years, we have watched the concept diminish and the price explode. 
As the Senator from Arkansas explains to us, just last year, after a thorough professional study was done, they gave us an estimate that the first phase of this project would cost--no, not $17 billion, but in fact $24.7 billion, a 40-percent cost overrun. Those who have been watching this project since its inception and suggestion in 1984 have to wonder whether there is any end in sight. 
For each year the cost of this project continues to mushroom, the uncertainty grows and the scope of the project diminishes. Over the years, the debate over this space station has been enlarged to go way beyond its original intent. It is now going to be a research laboratory. 
I have listened to those who have argued for the space station say with a straight face, `If we could just have this space station, then we might one day find a cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer. We need to get up in a weightless atmosphere with microgravity research, and that might be the breakthrough.' 
Competent scientists rebut that conclusion, and common sense does as well, because we in the United States of America today fund only 20 percent of the approved applications for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. Here on God's green Earth we are unable to come up with the money for sound research to find a cure for diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, and instead, we are going to take another $80 billion and plow it into this project and send it up into space. 
I know that some people are energized with the idea of space exploration, and I am one of them. I can remember John Glenn, and I can remember the walk on the Moon, and so many other experiences in life, and going down to Cape Kennedy for a liftoff, and to feel that Earth rumble under your feet when that rocket takes off is something you will never forget. That is exciting. 
Let me tell you what else is exciting. It is exciting to pick up the morning paper and to read that we have found a cure for a disease. It is exciting to be able to tell the parent of a child that their baby can live, that we have come through with a new medical breakthrough. It is exciting for us to know that 
the next generation may not have to worry as much about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I find these revelations just as exciting, if not more so, than a space liftoff. 
The Senator from Arkansas presents a challenge to us today. He basically is saying to this Chamber, Will you look at the facts as presented? Will you acknowledge the dramatic increase in cost of this space station? Will you come to the understanding, as we did with the Superconducting Super Collider--that big tunnel in Texas, which we finally decided was headed for nowhere--come to the conclusion that this $80 billion could be better spent right here on Earth for real needs of real people, whether it is in the area of medical research or education? 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senator from Arkansas and to defeat this funding for the space station. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President. I rise today to offer an amendment that seeks to address some of the inadequacies in the current Armed Services' health care system. I know many of my colleagues will be aware of these inadequacies from their constituents complaints about this system which, at times seems more like a cost cutting operation than the health care system for those brave enough to put their lives on the line for their country. 
The inadequacies addressed by my amendment were brought to my attention recently through the tragic case of Stephanie Davito, the 14 year old daughter of a nuclear submarine commander who currently lies in a coma at Sentara General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. This little girl's family has been fighting to get her the care that she needs through the TRICARE PRIME health care system and they have met time and time again with a wall of bureaucracy. At this time of extreme stress and anguish, Commander Davito and his wife Kristine have been forced to literally plead for adequate health care for their daughter. No-one should be forced to plead for covered benefits, least of all our Armed Services personnel and their families. 
Commander Davito, who is a United States Naval Officer from Spring Valley in Illinois, had been the Executive Officer on board the nuclear powered attack submarine U.S.S. Hyman G. Rickover stationed in Norfolk, Virginia. In March, he was transferred to STRATCOM in Nebraska. His family remained in Norfolk to finish out the school year. On May 15th, tragedy struck as Commander and Mrs. Davito's young daughter was hit by a car on her way home from school. She has been in a coma ever since. STRATCOM, as Commander Davito explained in his recent letter to me, was wonderful and transferred him temporarily to Commander Submarine Force Atlantic in Norfolk, so that he could be with his daughter. 
However, Commander Davito's experience with TRICARE has been a nightmare. Even though Stephanie's neurologist, Dr. Robert Rashti, believes that Stephanie has a very good chance for recovery, a TRICARE bureaucrat tried to argue that because Stephanie was not `an active participant' in her rehabilitation, they would not have to cover her treatment. This is an absolutely outrageous claim. Such a view obviously affects anyone covered by TRICARE that is unfortunate enough to suffer a coma. To suggest that comatose patients do not deserve treatment is, to me a completely abhorrent suggestion. 
The TRICARE policy manual does in fact stipulate that Rehabilitation is a covered service, though must of the manual reads like alphabet soup with respect to clarity. Clearly, the manual needs to be made more explicit, as my amendment suggests, so that no utilization clerk within the TRICARE system will ever again be confused. 
TRICARE has on numerous occasions tried to encourage the Davitos to put Stephanie in custodial care which, by the way, they do not cover. There, she would not get the Rehabilitation that she needs. 
The Davitos contacted Senator Warner, Illinois State Representative Frank Mautino, and my office to see if we could help them. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Warner on their behalf for all his staffs' hard work on this issue. In particular, I believe that Mr. Sanford in his district office has been extremely helpful to the Davitos. In spite of all our offices' repeated intervention on behalf of the Davitos, Stephanie's care is still not resolved and we are still being met with a wall a bureaucracy from the TRICARE system. Secretary Dalton has personally intervened and I want to sincerely thank him for that. The Navy has been deeply involved in trying to resolve this but they too have met with incredible resistance from TRICARE West with respect to TRICARE committing to treating Stephanie adequately. These are not the wars that the Armed Services should have to fight. 
Stephanie's doctor believes that she has a good chance for recovery, if TRICARE would only provide her with the Rehabilitation that she needs. Dr. Rashti wrote on June 15th, and I am quoting from his letter to Senator Warner, `at the time of Stephanie's admission, she was in critical condition due to severe brain swelling from contusions and a small hematoma in the right frontal region of the head. After a stormy course lasting two weeks, her brain swelling began to resolve and Stephanie began to show signs of improvement. . . . Prognostically, her diagnostic studies in conjunction with her evolving clinical course, suggests that this young lady has significant potential for functional recovery. While there is no guarantee, this medical impression is based on over 26 years of neurosurgical experience, including experience at the Shock Trauma Unit in Maryland and the Multiple Trauma Unit for twenty years here in Norfolk.' Later in this letter, Dr. Rashti stated very clearly `From a medical standpoint, it is not felt appropriate that she go to a custodial care facility.' Another doctor, Dr. Kip Burkman was in full agreement with Dr. Rashti's recommendation. Neither medical opinions seemed to sway the administrators of the TRICARE West program who refused to allow for Stephanie's transfer to the Immanuel 
Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska which is near her family's home and which can provide Rehabilitation services that she needs. 
Can any of us imagine how we would feel if one of our children lay as Stephanie does in a coma, where the doctors said she would get better if only she has access to care, but the cost cutting plan administrators tried to use every ambiguity in the policy manual to deny care? The pain and suffering that Stephanie's parents must be going through must be incredible. Is this how we treat the families of a person like Commander Davito who has served his country for 16 years and who has time and time again put his life at risk for the good of his country? Is this the kind of health care system that we reward our Armed Services with? 
Further confounding this problem is the issue of whether the network of providers in some regions of the country are adequate. Part of the problem that the Davito's are experiencing is due to the absence of a Rehabilitation facility near the STRATCOM base that is affiliated with the TRICARE West network. The Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha which is close to the STRATCOM base, after TRICARE initially suggested that Stephanie could be transferred there, was found not to be within the TRICARE West network which was probably part of the reason that TRICARE West suddenly became reluctant to allow her to be transferred there. However, TRICARE West does not have any facilities within their network near the base that are capable of providing Stephanie with the Rehabilitation recommended by her doctors. TRICARE suggested again that she be placed in a nursing home in Omaha or a nursing home in Lincoln Nebraska which is over 80 miles from the base, or finally they offered a place in a hospital in Lincoln, again over 80 miles from Stephanie's parents. 
What would it mean if TRICARE was successful in denying Stephanie access to the care that she needed? Well, it would likely mean that when she recovers from her coma, she will not be able to walk because she will have been denied the physical therapy necessary to prevent muscle atrophy. A wide variety of other completely avoidable complications might also result from the denial of rehabilitation. 
This little girl deserves a chance to get better. After much prodding, TRICARE is now saying that maybe she could have one month of Rehabilitation care at the Immanuel Hospital near the STRATCOM base. However, the time-frame for recovery from these injuries is 4-6 months at a minimum. Stephanie's doctors are suggesting that she may need between 6 and 12 months of care. As Dr. Rashti pointed out in his most recent letter, `Progress in any rehabilitation program is usually not as rapid as 
family or insurance companies would like but that is the nature of recovering brain injury patients. Their course is frequently characterized by rapid spurts of improvement interspersed with plateau periods lasting weeks before the next level of improvement begin.' Dr. Rashti suggested that Stephanie would likely need 4 to 6 months of aggressive rehabilitation, with a maximum rehab benefit of about a year. I completely agree with Dr. Rashti when he says `This child is 14 years old and deserves every chance to reach her maximum potential'. 
My staff has contacted NIH to inquire of their staff at the National Institute of Neurological Disease, as to their opinion for the normal time-frame for recovery from such injuries. They have also indicated that 6 months to 1 year seems appropriate. 
Everyone except the insurance company seems to be in agreement as to the care that Stephanie needs. I hope that we can make some progress during consideration of the Department of Defense's Reauthorization bill to see that this issue gets resolved not only for Stephanie but also for all the other Americans covered by the TRICARE system. 
My amendment is very simple. It has two parts. The first part directs the Secretary of Defense to revise the TRICARE policy manual to make it perfectly clear that Rehabilitative services are available to a patient suffering from a head injury when the treating physician certifies that such services would be beneficial for that patient and there is potential for recovery. This would move medical decisions concerning treatment back where they belong into the hands of physicians and out of the hands of HMO bureaucrats that may be more concerned with cost cutting than care giving. 
The second part of my amendment would direct the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the adequacy of each TRICARE region's network of providers. Each region should have sufficient number, distribution and variety of qualified health care providers and facilities to provide all the covered services. If a region is found to have an inadequate network of providers for some covered services, then the Secretary would be requested to take remedial action to improve the adequacy of the networks. This part of my amendment is very important to those in the military who are frequently transferred from station to station. In some areas, where managed care has been around for a long time, the networks may be good and patients may access all the care that they need and are entitled to. However, in some parts of the country, the networks are not sufficient and someone that enrolled in TRICARE PRIME while in 
California or Oregon suddenly finds that their new network is completely inadequate. Should our Armed Services personnel be force to swap between TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard depending on where they are currently stationed? Will they only find out when they can't get the care that they need that their region has an inadequate network of providers? Surely, we can provide a getter standard of care to the men and women and their families who patriotically serve our country. 
After 4 years in operation, I believe it is time to evaluate the TRICARE system and to see if there are regional gaps in service. Obviously, if it turns out that some regions do not provide adequately for our military's the health care needs, then this should be remedied. However, if we don't ask for this evaluation, it may take much longer to correct problems that may exist. 
There are those that might argue that providing adequate health care coverage will cost us more. Actually, having inadequate networks may also be extremely costly because when a person is denied care, it may take many navy personnel working in the appeals process to secure them the necessary health care. It may also mean that the Plan has to contract temporarily with an out of network provider. This is not a very efficient way of doing business. As the saving goes, `You should fix the roof while the sun is shining', we should not leave it to tragedies like Stephanies to point out to us when our health care system for the Armed Services is deficient. 
I believe that this amendment will take a small step forward to making sure that the Armed Services have access to a decent health care system and I hope that my colleagues will support my amendment.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Today I introduce the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1998. Today, some of our nation's poorest rural and inner-city communities face a crisis --they may soon have inadequate or no hospital health care because nurses are unwilling to work in these neighborhoods. The Nursing Relief Act will ensure that hospitals located in these desperately under served areas can continue to provide adequate health care to our most needy communities. 
Hospitals located in underprivileged areas often experience severe difficulty in attracting nurses. These hospitals operate in the middle of some of the harshest poverty and crime in our country. The employees of these hospitals often treat the worst and most troubling cases. 
And, the condition of the surrounding area imperils the ability of these hospitals to recruit and maintain an adequate nursing staff. These circumstances have pushed some hospitals into a financial crisis, threatening the quality of health care to those most in need. 
For the past eight years, this problem has been addressed by the H(1)(a) visa program which has allowed these hospitals to hire nonimmigrant nurses. Unfortunately, the H(1)(a) visa program sunset last fall, and so once again such hospitals are in crisis. By replacing the H(1)(a) visa, the Nursing Relief Act will alleviate this crisis. 
The true beneficiary of this program will not be the hospitals, but the underprivileged communities which rely on the hospitals' services. Let me tell you a story about the role that this program can play in the health of a community. The story is about St. Bernard hospital on the South Side of Chicago. 
St. Bernard Hospital is the only remaining hospital in the Englewood community on the south side of Chicago, one of the poorest and most crime ridden neighborhoods in the country. Over the years, St. Bernard has become indispensable to its community. Even though it has not been designated as a trauma center, St. Bernard receives the second highest number of ambulance runs from the Chicago Fire Department. St. Bernard also provides free vision exams and free screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. In addition, schoolchildren receive free physicals and inoculations, and the hospital sponsors numerous health fairs throughout the area. 
St. Bernard also offers a great number of outreach and community services. A food pantry is stocked, and clothes are made available for patients in need. St. Bernard is sponsoring a project for affordable housing in the community. The hospital has opened four family clinics in Englewood to provide safe and easy access to health care for community residents. Physicians from St. Bernard visit senior housing facilities on a regular basis, and the hospital has been recognized by Catholic Charities for its work with senior housing and health care. 
In addition, St. Bernard is the largest employer in the Englewood area. When the hospital faces a crisis, many jobs in the community are placed at risk. 
Even though the health of Englewood relies on this hospital, St. Bernard almost had to close its doors in 1992. Even after aggressive recruitment efforts, the hospital was unable to attract enough health care professionals to maintain its services. The hospital was especially in need of registered nurses. 
The problem had been solved in part by hiring foreign nurses through the H(1)(a) visa program. The hospital had gone through great lengths to hire domestic nurses, and was using the h(1)(a) program only as a last alternative to closing its doors. 
In the first half of 1997, for example, the hospital placed want ads in the Chicago Tribune and received approximately 200 responses. However, almost 75 percent of the respondents declined to interview when they learned where the hospital was located. St. Bernard has also tried to hire nurses through nurse registries. However, the rates of the registries would cost the hospital more than $2 million each year, an unsustainable expense for an already financially burdened hospital. 
Clearly, the H(1)(a) visa program had been offering St. Bernard a way to maintain its service to the community when no 
other option was available. This past fall, even that option was eliminated. 
My measure, the Nursing Relief Act, will ensure that hospitals like St. Bernard can keep their doors open to the public and continue to support their community. In addition, however, my bill has been designed to protect the jobs of domestic nurses and to ensure that hospitals use the visa program faithfully and only as a last resort solution. 
I have therefore drafted the Nursing Relief Act to be more narrowly targeted than the old H(1)(a) visa program. My measure ensures that nurses can only be brought into the United States by hospitals that have no other alternative. In short, we have made every effort to ensure that no American nurse will lose his or her job as a result of my bill. While we want to assure that these hospitals have an adequate nursing staff, we must also guarantee that foreign nurses are not taking away jobs from domestic nurses. 
Let me tell you what my bill does: 
It establishes a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas. The program provides non-immigrant visas for 500 nurses each year to work in hospitals where there are severe nursing shortages. 
The Nursing Relief Act protects the jobs of domestic nurses in three separate ways: 
First, my measure requires that a hospital must certify that it has gone through great lengths to hire and retain domestic nurses before it can use this visa program to hire nonimmigrant nurses. 
Second, my measure requires that nonimmigrant nurses must be paid the same wages and work under the same conditions as domestic nurses. In addition, nonimmigrant nurses cannot be hired in order to disrupt the activities of labor unions. These provisions ensure that hospitals cannot undercut the working conditions of domestic nurses. 
And third, my measure limits the number of nonimmigrant nurses who may enter the United States in any given year. The Act provides spaces for only 500 nonimmigrants each year, and it caps the number of nurses who may enter each state. 
In addition, the Nursing Relief Act provides for serious penalties for abuse, thus ensuring that hospitals will not misuse this new visa category. Moreover, my bill guarantees that hospitals use this program faithfully by narrowly defining the hospitals which are eligible. In order to hire nonimmigrant nurses through this visa program, hospitals must fulfill four strict requirements: 
First, the hospital must be located in an area which has been defined by the Department of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals. 
Second, the hospital must have at least 190 acute care beds. 
Third, the hospital must have at least 35 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicare. 
Fourth, the hospital must have at least 28 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicaid. 
All of these measures ensure that the Nursing Relief Act will serve as a relief to our communities rather than a loophole in the immigration laws. 
Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this important and very timely initiative. I hope that my colleagues will join me and support the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1998 so that every hospital can maintain an adequate nursing staff regardless of its location.

Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, 11 years ago, I offered a bill in the House of Representatives to ban smoking on airplanes. I passed that bill by five votes. And since that bill passed, in the 11 years since, I have had any number of Members who came up to me and said, `I voted against you that day, Congressman Durbin, but I was wrong. And I realize I was wrong. I was on the wrong side of history.' 
I want to tell you, the folks today who are killing this tobacco bill on the floor are on the wrong side of history. In defending the tobacco companies, they are defending the indefensible. In refusing to protect our children, they are attacking the vulnerable. 
We can talk about all the procedural votes that we want to. We can talk about filing motions and voting against them, points of order, and all the rest. The bottom line is, for almost 4 weeks now we have endured countless amendments from those who have no use whatever for this bill, most of which have been adopted, and now the people who offer the amendments successfully are telling us, let's walk away from this, we don't like it after all. 
I think the American people will see through this. Although the procedural battle may be won today, ultimately the folks who opposed this tobacco legislation are on the wrong side of history.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, here we go again. 
There are people who hate trial lawyers just intuitively and instinctively. I guess the fact that I used to be one before I was elected to the House of Representatives, I kind of take exception to that observation. 
But I can recall times in my legal practice when people would walk into my office who were literally dirt poor. They didn't have any money. They had been injured, or they had some claim. And, frankly, the only opportunity they had to go to court was if an attorney said, `OK, we will take it on a contingency-fee basis. If we can win the case, then you pay a part of the winnings. If we don't win, you don't pay anything.' Contingency fee, trial lawyers--for a lot of people, it is their only ticket to the courthouse. 
Who in the world can come up with $50,000 or $100,000 to pay some lawyer or some legal firm when they need representation? A lot of Americans just can't do that. 
So this is really a system of justice which gives the plaintiff a ticket to the door of the courthouse on a contingent basis: `If we win, you pay the lawyer. If we lose, the lawyer gets nothing.' 
Take the case of the tobacco companies. Imagine, if you will, 42 State attorneys general who said, `We want to sue the tobacco companies, the largest corporations in America, the most politically powerful, a group that never loses a lawsuit. How are we going to do that?' You can't stop the business of representing the attorney general of Illinois or California. The only way you can do this is by going to the private sector, to private attorneys, and saying to them, `Will you give us a contingent-fee deal here?' In other words, `Will you join the 
State attorneys general in suing the tobacco companies? And, if we win--if we win--you will be paid. If we lose, you won't get anything.' Contingency fee basis. Trial lawyers. 
And imagine the tobacco company executives when finally it dawned on them that 42 States had found these law firms around the country willing to take on the risk, willing to take the gamble. Was it a gamble, or was this a sure thing? History tells us it was the biggest legal gamble in the history of America. The tobacco companies had never lost a lawsuit--never. Yet, these law firms came forward and said, `We will help the State attorneys general. We will sign on a contingency-fee basis. Win or lose, let's see what happens.' We know what happened. It ended up that the tobacco companies came to the realization that they couldn't win. They sat down about a year ago with the States' attorneys general and tried to hammer out some kind of an agreement. Part of that agreement has to be, `How are we going to pay these attorneys? We agreed we would pay them for what they were going to do if we won.' 
Now come the tobacco companies and those people who have no use for trial lawyers to the floor of the U.S. Senate and say, `We want to have a voice in this process. We want to rewrite these agreements. We want to decide what was fair and unfair.' 
I don't think this is a fundamentally sound amendment. I think we should defeat this amendment. Let me give you one basic reason why we should defeat this amendment: Because the critics of the trial lawyers, the critics of the attorneys who brought these lawsuits against the tobacco companies, have done it again, ladies and gentleman. They have come in and said it is an outrage to pay lawyers this amount of money, an absolute disgrace, if they are plaintiffs' lawyers, if they are lawyers representing people who died of cancer, if they are representing people in the State of Illinois who paid out millions of dollars in taxes. But did they put any limit whatsoever on the fees paid to tobacco company lawyers? Not one word. 
Take a look at this amendment. It is disgraceful for us to stand up here and say this is a matter of justice, that we are not going to allow these attorneys to be paid that amount of money, and to exempt the tobacco companies' lawyers. Make no mistake: In these lawsuits, these law firms representing tobacco companies have been raking in millions and millions and millions of dollars for decades. Now we know, because of the suit in Minnesota, for example, that there has been an effort to hide important documents behind the attorney-client privilege. We know these lawyers have been complicit in this effort. Do we punish them with this amendment? No, no, no, no. Our anger for lawyers is reserved only for those lawyers who sue tobacco companies, not for the lawyers who defend tobacco companies. 
Let me tell you that I think this is fundamentally unfair. It is fundamentally unfair for us to step in at this stage in the proceedings, not only because of the injustice which it does to the lawsuits which have been filed but because if this amendment passes, it applies to future lawsuits as well. Who will stand up in the future and tackle the billionaire giant tobacco companies with the prospect of limitation of legal fees of this magnitude? Four thousand dollars sounds so exceedingly generous until you wonder and speculate what is at risk here. How would a law firm decide to dedicate all of its resources and all of its time for an entire year or more to try to get to trial against the tobacco companies? What a gamble. What a risk. And the people who are pushing this amendment want to make certain that couldn't happen again. They want to close the courthouse doors to make sure that people who head up tobacco companies are not going to be intimidated by these lawsuits. 
We would not be here today on the floor of the Senate, we would not be discussing a tobacco bill, if it were not for the initiative of the State attorneys general and were it not for the cooperation of these private attorneys who got involved in the lawsuit. 
You hear a lot of speculation: `You know these lawyers get paid billions of dollars. Isn't that too much?' Yes; I think it is. But that is my judgment. The judgment in the bill says it will be made by arbitration panels. We will have people sit down and decide what is fair. And in States, they have dramatically reduced the attorneys' fees that would have come to these private firms with these judges' decisions and arbitration panels. And that will continue. That is the right thing to do. But for us to step up as the U.S. Senate to intervene in this debate and say that we know best, to say that the firms that came forward to have the courage to take on the tobacco companies should now be ignored and their agreements be ignored, their contracts pushed off the table, we know best here in the U.S. Senate, I think it is an outrage. It is an outrage for us, and it is an outrage for those in the future who count on this mechanism, who count on the opportunity to go into court and to plead their case in order to find justice. 
How many times in the history of this country have this Congress and the President failed to act and relied on the courts? So many times in my lifetime. I can recall the civil rights struggle. It generally started in the courts. It wasn't until the important cases in the 1950s that finally Congress could muster the courage to deal with this thorny issue. And the same thing is true on tobacco. I have been fighting these tobacco companies as long as I have been in Congress. 
I have had some victories and I have had some defeats. They are tough customers, and they have a lot of money. And boy do they have a lot of friends in the House and Senate. They found out there was one group they could not buy, the judicial system. They found out that when lawyers could come into court before a jury of peers and argue the case about their deadly product and what they were doing with it, they could not win. A year ago they threw in the towel and said, `We are ready to settle. We are ready to make big changes in the way we market our product.' 
That never would have happened were it not for the judicial system, I am sorry to say. And now we have those who resent that system, the tobacco companies, critics of trial lawyers, who say, `Isn't it a shame that this happened the way it did. We are going to rewrite history. We are going to change the terms for these attorneys.' 
We cannot let them do it because, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know where the next argument is going to be and where the next case will be. These were 42 cases brought on behalf of 42 different States. In my home State of Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan, a Republican, a man I admire for the courage in filing this lawsuit, stood up for our taxpayers. Michael Moore in Mississippi was the man who initiated that action. 
And now we come to the question, Are we going to close the door in the future to this opportunity? Which will be the group that wants to take on the tobacco companies? How will they muster the resources? How will they put together the lawsuit and the case law to prevail? If this amendment passes, we are tying their hands. We are saying to them that in the future you will not have the same chance as these 42 different attorneys general. 
That is fundamentally unfair. To do this and tie the hands of the plaintiffs' attorneys, the attorneys representing the people, while saying that the tobacco lawyers can continue to rake it in, millions of dollars deceiving, millions of dollars defending, that is fundamentally wrong. I stand in opposition to this amendment. 
We have an important bill here, a bill that can reduce the number of deaths in America from tobacco. It is a shame that we are diverted now in a battle against trial lawyers. This should be a battle against the tobacco company tactics that lure our children into a nicotine addiction, which for one out of three of them means an early grave. That is what this bill is really about. It is not about lawyers. It is about our kids. I sincerely hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in opposing this amendment. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to explain my absence during vote number 159 last night. I was returning to Washington from Chicago when the airplane I was on was delayed by weather problems. While the vote was going on, the plane was in the air over the Washington area as we waited for the airport to reopen so that we could land. 
Had I been present, I would have voted `nay' on the motion to table the Reed amendment to the tobacco bill. I am a cosponsor of the Reed amendment and I believe it should be part of the final tobacco legislation. 
The tobacco industry has been targeting kids with its advertisements and marketing gimmicks for far too long. The tobacco bill would re-promulgate the FDA's regulations, currently on hold, that seek to restrict tobacco advertising and marketing that appeals to children. 
The Reed amendment adds new teeth to the restrictions by linking each tobacco company's tax deduction for advertising expenses to its compliance with the regulations. As long as a tobacco company obeys the law and complies with the FDA regulations, the company can continue to deduct its expenses for permissible advertising. But, under the Reed amendment, if a tobacco company violates these restrictions, the company's privilege of deducting its advertising expenses for tax purposes would be lifted for all of its advertising expenses for the year in which the violation occurred. 
This amendment, as with the look-back amendment, is about accountability. If a tobacco company decides to try to skirt the FDA regulations, to keep advertising or marketing in ways that appeal to children, that company will face not just a regulatory action by the loss of its advertising deduction. With this amendment, taxpayers will no longer help foot the advertising bill for companies that continue to market to children. Tobacco companies will no longer get a tax break for advertising expenses if any of the company's advertising violates the FDA's regulations for protecting children. 
It's a simple amendment with a simple point. Its message is that we are serious when we say to the tobacco companies: no more advertising to children. This amendment deserves the support of the Senate.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a spectacular team that has propelled itself into the upper echelon of basketball history, the Chicago Bulls. Add a new name to the history books of the National Basketball Association; the Boston Celtics of the 1960s, the Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s, and undeniably, the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s. 
On Sunday, as I watched Game Six with basketball fans and Bulls followers around the world, I was privileged to witness another incredible performance by Michael Jordan and the entire Bulls team. For the sixth time in eight years, in a victory for the ages, the Chicago Bulls are the champions of the National Basketball Association. It is with great honor, pleasure, and pride that I salute and congratulate the entire Chicago Bulls organization. 
As a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times noted, `We live in the right city at the right time.' It is simple yet so true. No other team in any sport has been able to show the dominance and consistency that the Bulls have shown. The people of Chicago and Illinois have a special source of pride in the Chicago Bulls and especially in Michael Jordan. This wonderful championship and the five spectacular ones before it are all keepsakes in the hearts and minds of Chicagoans. I know personally that days, weeks, and years from now I will be recounting where I was when the Bulls achieved the `Six-Pack,' and I will be doing it with great pride. My grandson Alex, who recently turned two years old, is not quite old enough to realize what the Bulls have accomplished. But make no mistake about it, in the years to come I know he will have a proud grandfather recounting the almost mythical tales of Michael Jordan and telling of the amazing dynasty that they created. 
Michael Jordan. What more can possibly be said about him? There are simply no longer any more adjectives to describe his spectacular feats and clutch performances. Super-human? Possibly. The best to ever plan the game of basketball? Positively. In the pivotal Game Six, in a most unfriendly arena, Michael Jordan took his team and the people of `the city of big shoulders,' put them all directly on his shoulders and carried them all to the NBA's promised land, the world championship. Jordan, the ambassador of the game of basketball to the world, accomplished what no other player has been able to do. With his unprecedented tenth scoring title and sixth Finals Most Valuable Player award, Jordan has shown the impact he has on the game. But I'm sure that all of the personal accolades are secondary when it comes to the team and to being champions. The true champion puts his team and their success above all and Jordan has done that time and time again. 
None of us will forget the courageous performance given by an injured Scottie Pippen. With an injury that would have had anyone else bedridden, he played as well as he possibly could. But more importantly, he provided the emotional lift that the team needed. Again, another example of how being there for your team and your fellow players is ingrained in the hearts of these players, in the hearts of champions. 
And of course, the man who keeps it all together and running like a well tuned machine, Phil Jackson. With a combination of years of basketball experience as a player and as a coach, his special relationship with Jordan, Pippen, and the entire team, and a touch of his Zen philosophy, Jackson has been able to lead this team to the apex of the National Basketball Association despite all of the distractions and injuries. 
Surely we cannot overlook the contributions of the rest of the team--Dennis Rodman, Ron Harper, Luc Longley, Toni Kukoc, the `supporting cast' as they are called. But they are more than that. They are each a critical piece of a puzzle that when fully assembled presents us with an impressive and spectacular sight: Six golden, shinning, championship trophies. Each clutch three point basket by Steve Kerr and Judd Buechler, each suffocating defensive stop by Scott Burrell and Randy Brown, each rebound from Bill Wennington and Dickey Simpkins are essential pieces of the big picture. 
We should also acknowledge the impressive job that owner Jerry Reinsdorf has done with this organization from the time he took over as owner, and the sportsmanship and leadership that the Bulls organization has shown through the years. 
I could go on and on, but I would like to switch tracks and commend the Utah Jazz for a wonderful and exciting series. The Jazz organization and the fans of Salt Lake City were worthy opponents in this battle and did not go quietly into the night. They made the Bulls give every ounce of heart and determination to win this sixth championship. You could not have asked for more from the Utah Jazz. The Utah fans were the extra player on the bench ready to give their team a needed push. I'm sure that their biggest fan, my colleague Senator Orrin Hatch, provided the loudest cheers of all. Unfortunately, there can only be one champion. But in my eyes, and the eyes of all basketball fans, Karl Malone, John Stockton, and the entire team earned our respect and admiration. They too are champions and I commend them and wish them the best of luck in returning to the NBA Finals. 
As the city of Chicago celebrates another taste of excellence and prepares for another mid-June party in Grant Park, we can only hope that this is not the last we see from this team. But if it was our last opportunity to be graced with the performance of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Phil Jackson, the core and heart of this team, then we could not have asked for anything more. They continually gave this city and fans everywhere joy, pride, a glimpse at what it is like to be the best at what you do and to accomplish the ultimate goal. The Chicago Bulls have given millions of fans the chance to live vicariously through them. When the Bulls are champions, the entire city of Chicago and all Bulls fans are also champions. When Jordan steals the ball and makes the game winning shot with five seconds to go, we all make that shot. The Bulls give us hope and pride and the chance to be champions. I salute them for bringing so much to the city of Chicago, and to basketball fans everywhere. 
The breath-taking performances that Michael Jordan has graced us with and the six hard-fought championships that the entire team has brought to the city are truly `unbelieve-a-bull.' Without question, being successful in all six of their championship endeavors, they were `unstop-a-bull.' And their place in history and in the hearts of everyone in Chicago and the world is absolutely `undeni-a-bull.' I salute the Chicago Bulls on a wonderful season, and a heart-stopping championship. If this was Michael Jordan's last game then it could not have been scripted any better. It was a fitting, almost storybook ending in which the man who got us there also brought us back victorious. As coach Phil Jackson put it, `it has been a wonderful ride.' Indeed it has been. Congratulations to the city of Chicago and the World Champion Chicago Bulls.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today which is cosponsored by at least 20 of my colleagues in the Senate, a bipartisan offering on an issue which I came to be familiar with over 10 years ago. I traveled to the country of Bangladesh. It is not exactly on the itinerary of favorite congressional trips because it is a country which, although it is large and very interesting, has had its share of misfortune. It seems whenever any natural disaster would strike in the world it would stop in Bangladesh. We, of course, conjure an image in our mind of people who have suffered through typhoons and tornadoes and flooding and all sorts of deprivation. It is a very poor country. 
Then Congressman, the late Mike Synar, and I went to Bangladesh. One of the reasons we went was to explore an issue which we had heard a lot about. There is an institution created in Bangladesh known as the Grameen Bank. Grameen means `people's bank.' It is an extraordinary institution because it is an unusual bank; it is a bank designed to provide very small loans to very poor people. So Congressman Synar and I joined with people from the American Embassy and got in our four-wheel drive vehicle and drove out from Dakar into the countryside until the road ended, and then our four-wheel vehicle could go no further and we got out and started hiking a few miles into the brush and came upon a tiny little village. In this village we were invited to a bank meeting, a meeting of the board of directors of the Grameen Bank, in this tiny, obscure, almost nameless Bangladesh village. The bank meeting was unlike any meeting of any board of directors one would ever imagine. 
Seated in a little shelter were about 30 or 40 women, all dressed in brightly colored saris, with a third eye in their foreheads, many of them holding babies in a typical Asian squatting position and looking up at these visitors who had come to see them. 
Our host, a professor from a university in Bangladesh who was familiar with the program, Dr. Huk, introduced us to the women in the audience. He said at one point, `Is there anyone here who has ever heard of the United States of America?' Not one of them had. And here we were, these two Congressmen standing before them, looking like creatures from some other planet I am sure, wanting to know more about this little bank. 
This bank has grown in size and scope in an effort to provide microcredit, small loans, to some of the poorest people in the world. What does $100 mean to an American? For us, it might be a nice trip shopping or a trip to a restaurant. But for a woman living in Bangladesh, $100 might mean that she can buy some tools and develop a skill and a craft to feed her family; $100 might mean that she can buy a milking cow that she can then use, not only to feed her family, but to sell the products and to make some money for her future. 
How does this work, that people who are so poor, with literally no earthly possessions, can be debtors, can borrow money from a bank? It works because the concept is that when they undertake this debt, several other villagers will sign up with them, cosign the note, if you will, in a guarantee that the payment will be made because, you see, the cosigners cannot get a debt of their own until the original debt is paid off. So they look very carefully to make sure that the debt is repaid on a monthly basis. The payback rate on Grameen Bank is over 95 percent. 
Why in the world would I raise this question here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the great country that we live in, with all of our wealth and opportunity? Because I, frankly, think that this is a model that we should encourage and follow around the world. We do not spend an extraordinarily great amount of money on foreign aid compared to other nations, but we do spend billions of dollars. The bill that I introduce suggests that we should take a portion of that money each year and dedicate it to microcredit projects, 
projects like the Grameen Bank around the world. 
Many Americans might say, `Well, Senator, it sounds like a great idea, but why should we worry about a woman in Bangladesh?' One of the women in this meeting I attended came up to me afterwards and, with an interpreter--she had a baby in her arms --she told me her life story. 
She was 18 years old. The baby she was holding was her third child. She told me, quite proudly, that she was not going to have any more children. She was practicing birth control. She said, `My other two children are alive.' Now, that is an amazing statement in the United States. You think, `Well, of course, why would you bring that up?' But in a developing country, it is a very serious concern: Will my baby survive? Do I need to have another baby? That is why many of the developing countries have such high birth rates. 
She had decided that because of good health techniques, which the United States and United Nations had encouraged, that her babies had a chance to live, and with the Grameen Bank, she had a chance to improve their livelihood. She said, quite proudly, `I'm going to have a family of three and that is all we need and Grameen Bank has really helped to make this possible.' 
A tiny loan of $100, a family planning program, some public health techniques and this woman is going to limit her family to three. Is that important to us in the United States? It is, because in Asia, in Africa and around the world, the problem of overpopulation is one that is not local or regional, it is a global problem. 
Overpopulation leads to many problems--economic instability, political instability, environmental degradation. Look at the nation of India today. India is in the headlines because of its recent nuclear test, its fears of China and Pakistan. Yet, India is going to be in the headlines in a few years because it will be the most populated nation in the world. It will pass China. As that teeming population grows and creates political pressures, it becomes a concern in the United States. 
I hope we will make modest investments in those foreign aid programs that really can improve the quality of life in developing countries and can really cope with some of the problems such as overpopulation. Microcredit enjoys broad bipartisan support. 
An organization known as RESULTS, which is nationwide but has a very significant chapter in Chicago, has encouraged me to introduce this legislation, which I am happy to do. There are many people who are strong supporters of this. One of them is well known to many of us who grew up watching `The Mary Tyler Moore Show.' Her name is Valerie Harper, also known as Rhoda. 
For some reason, this has become a passion for her, a commitment to helping women around the world receive basic credit so that they can lift their lives and improve their families. I salute Valerie Harper for her leadership on this. Microcredit encourages entrepreneurship and free market economic development. 
The repayment rates on these loans are over 95 percent, and it is found that $1 million put into microcredit can generate $15 million in small loans over 5 years as people get better off and start building their own livelihoods. It gives poor people, and especially women, the means to meet the needs of their family in areas of health, education, and nutrition. 
Our First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke in Chicago a few years ago, and I thought she made a very important observation. She said, if you will look at the underdeveloped nations and wonder if they have a chance to move toward democracy or toward a free market economy, the first place you should look is how they treat women. Are women given an opportunity to be educated? Are they given an opportunity to work outside the home and develop their skills? How are they treated? I think we are finding in countries where microcredit is becoming an important part of the program that women are given that chance. 
This bill in particular requires the U.S. Agency for International Development to spend $160 million for fiscal year 1999 on its Microenterprise Assistance Program, with at least 50 percent of that amount dedicated to serving the poorest in the world with microcredit loans under $300. We know that these loans are repaid, and we know that they are recycled, so we are creating a stock, a basic pool of money that can be reinvested in nations around the world to bring them up to higher living standards. 
One-fifth of the world's population lives in extreme poverty. Microcredit is one of the most effective antipoverty tools in existence. I talked to one of my colleagues and asked him to cosponsor this bill the other day and he said, `You know, I like this bill. There are so many things we do in foreign aid that end up creating more bureaucracies and agencies and studies; this is real, this gives to people who need a helping hand the kind of help that they really need.'

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who have counted out the tobacco lobby, for those who said the tobacco giants are now flat on their backs and have no strength left on Capitol Hill, I am afraid the last vote is an indication that there is still life in that tobacco lobby. This vote of 42 to 56 on a motion to bring to a halt the debate and bring to a vote the tobacco bill is a sad commentary on where we are today. 
This legislation, S. 1415, which is the product of the Senate Commerce Committee and the hard work of both Republican and Democratic Senators, deserves a vote, not just because it is on the floor today but because what this bill sets out to do is so important for this Nation. Instead, what we have seen are the opponents of this legislation come to this floor over the last 3 weeks, producing amendments to grind us down, mire us down in debate, sink us in this morass of technicalities and procedures so we never get to this bill. 
Many of my colleagues, Senators, have come to this floor and offered very important amendments, interesting amendments. They are not related to tobacco and children though. An amendment comes to the floor from one of the Senators, `Let's talk about reforming the Internal Revenue Code.' That is a good idea. We should do that on a regular basis. But on this bill? Why on this bill? This bill, which is designed to stop the addiction of our children to tobacco products, why should it be a forum for this debate on reforming the Internal Revenue Code? 
Another Senator comes to the floor and says, `Let's talk about the problem of narcotics in America.' It is a terrible problem. It is a terrible problem. Everyone agrees with that. Every parent agrees with that. Yet, to raise that as an issue on this bill? To suggest, as part of this debate, we ought to talk about school vouchers? School vouchers, that is an important debate, too. But why in this bill? Why in this legislation, this historic piece of legislation that gives us a chance, for the first time in this Nation's history, to do something meaningful about tobacco, are we being diverted by so many amendments? 
Do you know what the order of business before the Senate is at this moment? I can tell you what it is. You may want to write this down. For those with scorecards at home, be prepared with your pencils ready. We are currently debating the Coverdell amendment to the Durbin amendment to the Gramm motion to recommit with two underlying Gregg amendments still pending. 
Hard to follow? It is designed to be hard to follow. It is designed to tangle us up in procedure so we never get to vote on this bill and never vote on this issue. 
The tobacco companies have to be cheering after that last vote, 42 to 56, so we continue to mire ourselves in this procedural mess and never get to the bottom line. What is the bottom line? Let me show you in this graph. This is the bottom line. The smoking rates among high school seniors in America are at a 17-year high. As I speak today, in the Senate gallery 
we have many visitors and friends and a lot of youngsters who are here from schools. You know what I am talking about. You know what is happening in your grade schools and in your junior high schools and in your high schools--more and more children are starting to smoke. I have never in my life ever met a parent who has come to me and said: `Great news, I just got the best news. My daughter just called, she started smoking.' Have you ever heard that? I never heard that from any parent. It is a troubling piece of information which every parent dreads. 
More and more kids, now over half the high school seniors in America, are taking up this deadly habit. Since we started this mindless debate, 66,000 children in America have started smoking for the first time. Tobacco companies have a big smile on their face: More and more kids addicted to their products, kids who will spend a fortune over their lifetimes on this addiction and ultimately a third of them to be victims of an early grave, because of this tobacco addiction. Yet here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Here we are with this historic opportunity, with bipartisan legislation, to do what is right, to pass legislation and say to the tobacco companies, `The game is over. We are no longer going to allow you to appeal to and addict our children. We are going to ask you be held accountable, accountable for reducing the percentage of children who are smoking.' And, by overwhelming votes, Senators on both sides of the aisle supported my amendment last week to hold the tobacco companies specifically liable if kids continue to be lured into this addiction. Yet, over the weekend one of the leaders here in the Senate says the tobacco bill is all but dead--all but dead, after all this work. 
Keep in mind, we are not just talking about another piece of legislation in the Senate. We are talking about the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, who missed this opportunity, will, frankly, have to answer for it--perhaps not in the next election, but maybe at a later time--as to why at this moment in history, when we had the chance to seize the opportunity and do something to help our children, we failed to do so. 
I continue to believe we have a chance to pass this legislation. We have Democrats and Republicans alike who believe it is not only right but timely. But if we allow this procedural morass to continue, if we do not bring to a vote the critical amendments necessary so we can bring this bill to final passage, then the clock runs out. 
As I said once before, I guess time is on the side of those who want to stop this legislation. But history is not on their side. History will judge them harshly. Having been given this opportunity to pass an important bill, they missed it. They missed it, to the detriment not of their own political careers but of their children. And the money to be raised from this bill, the money that comes from a tobacco tax--that is right, t-a-x, tobacco tax; call it a fee or what you like, I call it a tobacco tax--that money is going in for specific purposes to help children: Smoking cessation clinics, antismoking advertising, and medical research. 
I will stand in the State of Illinois, or wherever I am called on, to defend that vote. I think asking smokers to pay more for their product to reduce the sales to children and put money in the Treasury for those purposes is a defensible thing to do and not something we should shrink away from. I have heard all this argument on the other side about this bill: 
Senator McCain's bill is going to create some massive Federal bureaucracy. Not so. Not so. This bill basically does, in self-executing ways, what we sought to achieve in the beginning, when 42 State attorneys general filed lawsuits across the United States saying to tobacco companies: Your day is over. You are going to be held accountable. This came to a basic agreement about a year ago. We are building on that agreement. 
I salute them for their initiative in allowing us to reach this point. But, will this Senate miss this opportunity, as we missed the opportunity to pass campaign finance reform? Will we miss this opportunity to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation? This last vote, 42 to 56, is an indication we have a long way to go. Cooler heads have to prevail. Senators on both sides of the aisle have to understand, this is more than gamesmanship on some amendment tree; this is fundamentally a question about the public health of America and the public health of our children. 
What we and the American people are waiting for is leadership, leadership here in the Senate to bring action to a close on this legislation. While we wait for that leadership, the advertising industry is waiting, too, pens poised, ready to write the next generation of ads for cigarettes to hook children. That will happen if this bill fails. 
The lawyers are waiting, too. The lawyers are waiting with their legal briefs in hand to continue the next round of State litigation, and that will continue, month after month and year after year, if this bill fails. 
The parents are waiting. The parents of America are waiting to see whether or not their children will be able to escape this addiction to tobacco while they go to school and while they grow up. Passing this bill will help those parents. 
And, yes, the tobacco companies are waiting, too. They are waiting to see whether the Senate will drop the ball and give them another year of obscene profits at the expense of our children. 
The President of the United States and this administration have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. No President in history has ever stuck his neck out as far as President Clinton in fighting the tobacco lobby. He has taken a lot of grief for it. There have been a lot of people who invested a lot of money in opposition to folks who supported it. But he was right to do it. Those of us on the floor of the Senate who have been fighting this tobacco battle for over a decade have dreamed of this day and this opportunity. 
And that is why it is so sad that we find ourselves in this gridlock, this procedural gridlock. I am sorry that the motion to close down debate and limit the amendments to those germane to the bill did not prevail. A similar motion will be offered tomorrow, and I hope that motion will prevail. In the meantime, I hope Democrats and Republicans will join Senator McCain and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts in a bipartisan effort to pass this landmark legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the President. I am happy to stand this morning in support of the pending amendment before the U.S. Senate to this tobacco legislation. It is an amendment offered by Senator DeWine, Republican of Ohio, and myself, a bipartisan effort to make this important bill more effective. 
I would like to pause for a moment before addressing the amendment and speak to the historical significance of this debate. 
About 11 years ago I was involved in a struggle as a Member of the House of Representatives to pass one of the first tobacco-controlled bills ever considered by the House of Representatives. In comparison to this bill, ours was a very modest measure. We were setting out to achieve something which on its face appeared very simple, but turned out to be politically very difficult. What we wanted to achieve 11 years ago was to ban smoking on airplanes. You would have thought that we were proposing a second American revolution. The tobacco lobby organized its efforts, found all of its friends, both Democrat and Republican, and marshaled forces to beat our effort. 
They predicted that what we were setting out to do would create chaos in public transportation; it was totally unnecessary; it discriminated against the rights of smokers, and on and on and on. 
Well, Mr. President, it was our good fortune in the House of Representatives to have a number of Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, who, for the first time in modern memory, rejected these pleas from the tobacco lobby and enacted legislation a little over 10 years ago that banned smoking on airplane flights of 2 hours or less. It was a breakthrough. It was the first time the tobacco lobby lost. Those who joined me in that effort stuck their necks out politically. It wasn't considered to be very smart politics to oppose tobacco. This, in fact, was the largest, most powerful, most well funded lobby in Washington. Fortunately for us, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and his friends in the Senate joined us in the battle and together we successfully achieved our goal. Today, virtually all domestic airline flights--in fact, I think all of them--are smoke free. It is now becoming a trend worldwide. 
That battle and that victory, I think, set the stage for where we are today, albeit a small victory in comparison to our goal in this debate. But it would have been unimaginable 10 or 11 years ago to think that today in the Senate we are debating a bill involving tobacco and health of the magnitude of the McCain bill which comes before us. John McCain is our Republican colleague from the State of Arizona. I admire his grit and determination in bringing this bill to the floor despite a lot of opposition, primarily but not exclusively, from his own side of the aisle. 
When you think in terms of what we are setting out to achieve, it is substantial. It is revolutionary. It is long overdue. Our goals are simple: reduce teen smoking, invest in public health research and programs to help smokers quit, and protect tobacco farmers and their communities. 
The focus on children is a good one and an important one because tobacco companies have needed these children desperately. Each year, they have to recruit millions of children to replace those who are breaking the habit and those who have passed away. They set out their net and stretch it out for millions and bring in thousands, but they keep replenishing the ranks; 89 percent of all people who ever tried a cigarette tried by the age of 18. Of people who have ever smoked daily, 71 percent were smoking daily by age 18. Virtually no one starts smoking during adulthood. It is a childish decision. It becomes a childish habit, and it condemns those who fall into the lure of this nicotine addiction to the likelihood of a shortened life and more exposure to disease. 
This McCain bill not only sets out to reduce the number of teen smokers, but it also sets out to invest more in medical research. When I heard my colleague from Missouri decrying this bill and talking about this waste of tax dollars being brought into our Treasury, I paused and thought that we could argue--and I will during the course of my remarks--that raising the price of the product is going to discourage children from using it as well as others, but also the money that is coming in as a part of this bill is going to be invested back in America. 
I would stand by the results of a national referendum on the following question: Should we increase the Federal tax on a package of cigarettes, and then take a substantial portion of the money raised and put it in medical research--send it to the National Institutes of Health for research to find cures for cancer, heart disease, AIDS, juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's, and the myriad of medical problems that we face in this country? I will bet the results would be overwhelmingly positive because Americans believe in this investment. Americans believe that this bill, in providing money for medical research investment, is money well spent. 
Smoking cessation programs are part of it, too. I think that is sensible. My father, who was a lifelong smoker, was a victim of lung cancer and died in his early 50s. I saw, even after his 
diagnosis, the situation that he faced, the craving that he had for this deadly cigarette that had caused him so many health problems. I have always had a sensitivity and a sympathy for smokers who are trying to quit. For some, they can just literally walk away from it, decide in a minute that tomorrow they will never smoke another cigarette. But for others it is virtually a lifelong struggle. 
The McCain bill puts money into smoking cessation programs so that smokers nationwide will have the means to turn to, to reduce their addiction to nicotine. My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, spoke earlier about the need for medical research in this area, for breakthroughs to stop this addiction. I fully support him, and I think it should be part of this effort. We are hopeful these breakthroughs will make it easier for people to stop this addiction to nicotine. That is part of this bill. 
Another provision of the bill protects tobacco farmers and their families. I have never had any crusade against the tobacco farmers. I understand the devastation in health that their crop can cause, but I have always felt they deserve a chance to find another livelihood. This bill gives them that chance. That is why I support it. 
Let me speak to the amendment before us, the Durbin and DeWine amendment. It is a look-back provision. 
Now, we could give all the speeches we want to give on the floor of the Senate and in the Chamber of the House decrying teen addiction to tobacco products, addiction to nicotine. We can pass all the bills we want saying that as a Nation we are going to come to grips with this, and I am afraid we will not achieve our goal unless we are very serious and very specific. In fact, in every State in the Nation it is against the law for minors under the age of 18 to purchase tobacco products, and yet clearly they do on a daily and overwhelming basis. So the mere enactment of a law has not achieved our goal. 
Why is the McCain bill any different? It is different because one important facet of this bill is included. It is the so-called look-back provision. The look-back provision is accountability; it is honesty. It says that as the years go by we will measure the number of teen smokers in America, and if that percentage does not come down, the tobacco companies and tobacco industry will be held accountable in terms of fees that need to be paid as they miss these targets. 
That accountability brings reality to this debate. We can have the highest flying speeches, the most voluminous rhetoric, and yet we will not achieve our goal unless we are specific. Is this a matter that should concern us? Consider this chart for a minute. It is a troubling commentary on what is happening in America. 
This chart shows the percentage of high school students who currently smoke cigarettes. Look at from 1991 to 1997. In every grade, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th, across America, there has been an increase in the percentage of students who are smoking. In fact, the increase over the six years has been 30 percent. While we have given all these speeches, while we have talked about this problem, while the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and so many others have addressed it, we have, in fact, seen the children of America ignoring it. They have taken up this habit, and as they take it up more and more kids are vulnerable. 
For those who do not think this is a real American family issue, I pose one question which I always pose in this debate: Have you ever met a mother or father who came to you at work one morning and with great pride and a smile on their face said, `We have great news at home. Our daughter came home last night and she started smoking.' I have never heard that. In fact, just the opposite is true. Parents who suspect their kids have started smoking are worried. They understand the danger. They understand the addiction. And they understand better than most why this debate is so critically important. 
Some argument is made as to whether or not the increase in the price of tobacco products will reduce usage by children. The Senator from Missouri, who spoke before me, talked about all sorts of surveys that came to an opposite conclusion. I would point to two that confirm the belief in this bill that if you raise the price of the product, children are less likely to use it. 
In Canada, just to the north, when they imposed a substantial increase in the Federal tax on tobacco products, they had a 60-percent reduction in children who were smoking. Kids are price sensitive; they don't have all the money in the world, and when the price of the product goes up too high, they stop using it or reduce their usage. Canada is a perfect example. 
On the academic front, at the University of Illinois, Dr. Frank Chaloupka has performed a study in which he has surveyed cigarette prices and whether or not they have any impact on the percentage of youth smoking. He says:  
Based on this research, I estimate that a $1.50 increase in the federal cigarette tax, implemented over three years and maintained in real, inflation adjusted terms, will cut the prevalence of youth smoking in half. 
The bill sticks to $1.10, and the percentage decrease may not be as high or as dramatic, but clearly it will be a decrease. Increasing the cost of the product reduces its usage. 
I find it interesting that my colleague from Missouri talked about the so-called cash cow that this $1.10 creates, the billions of dollars brought into the Federal Treasury because of this increase in the Federal tobacco tax. I think this is money that is going to be raised for good purposes, to reduce teen smoking, to invest in medical research, to invest in smoking cessation, and to help tobacco farmers in transition. 
It is interesting that so many of the critics of this bill, who argue we need no tax whatsoever, are anxious to spend the proceeds from that tax. Reference is made to the marriage penalty, an interesting tax challenge which we should take up at some point. But the people who are opposed to this bill want to take the proceeds from the bill and spend them on correcting this tax anomaly, the so-called marriage tax penalty. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot decry this bill as a so-called cash cow, raising taxes that are unnecessary, and then make all sorts of proposals on how to spend it, and certainly proposals which have little or no relevance to the question of whether or not we are addressing the scourge of smoking addiction in this country. 
Let me also speak for a moment to the Food and Drug Administration. It is true that Dr. David Kessler, who is a friend and someone I worked with for many years, showed extraordinary courage, with President Clinton and Vice President Gore, in an initiative to reduce smoking in America. They took a lot of heat for it, because they took on the tobacco industry and they suggested they were going to get serious about it. They were going to try to view nicotine as the drug that it is. They were going to try to hold accountable retailers who were selling to children. And they were going to establish standards across America--for example, asking for identification for the purchase of tobacco products. When they proposed this, their critics went wild: `Oh, it is overreaching by the Federal Government. It is just entirely too much.' Yet they were on the right track, a track which we follow today. 
Let me try to zero in specifically on the Durbin-DeWine amendment. The fact that this amendment is being debated today has a lot to do with 40 State attorneys general who filed lawsuits against the tobacco companies, seeking to recover, for their States and taxpayers, money that was spent because of tobacco products. Last year, as a result of the aggregate effort of these attorneys general, a general agreement, or settlement, was reached. Part of that agreement included these so-called look-back provisions. The agreement said that the tobacco industry was willing to be held accountable to reduce the percentage of young people smoking. If they did not reach the goals, they would be penalized. So the idea of a look-back provision is not something being foisted on the industry or something brand new on Capitol Hill; this is an idea that was endorsed by the tobacco companies as part of their agreement with the State attorneys general. 
The difference, of course, in the DeWine-Durbin approach, is that we take this from an industry assessment, from an industry 
fee, and say let's look, instead, to the specific tobacco companies. Senator McCain of Arizona, in his bill, says we should do that for roughly a third of the penalties involved. Senator DeWine and I think it should be a larger percentage. Let me explain to you why we think it should be larger. 
Consider this for a moment. Some of my critics come to the floor and say it is impossible for us to measure how many children smoke how many brands of cigarettes. In fact, my friend, the Senator from Texas, says it doesn't pass the laugh test, to think that we would be able to measure how many underage kids are smoking Camels or Marlboros or Kools or Virginia Slims. 
Let me suggest to him and others who criticize this amendment, the tobacco companies have extraordinary resources and ability to measure the use of their product. If you challenged Philip Morris to tell you how many left-handed Latvians smoke Marlboros, I bet they could come up with the number. If you challenged R.J. Reynolds to come up with how many tongue-tied Texans use Camels, I'll bet they could come up with the number. Because they market these products and these brands on a very specific basis. They want to know not only how many they are selling, but to whom they are selling them because they have billions of dollars of advertising that they are going to focus in, to try to win over new groups. 
So the suggestion that we cannot measure the number of young people using certain brands of cigarettes just defies common sense. The industry has this ability. It has this knowledge. It is a sampling technique that is used by businesses across America, and it can be applied here. Senator DeWine and I seek to apply this standard in this situation. We believe--and I hope my colleagues will join us in the belief--that it is eminently fair for us to hold each tobacco company accountable. 
Let us assume, for example, that R.J. Reynolds takes this bill very seriously and says they are going to stop marketing their product to children, that they are no longer going to be selling Camel cigarettes to kids. They tell their retailers: `Don't let that pack go over the counter. Don't sell it to a child. We are very serious about it. Or we may cut off your access to our product.' They say to the people who are doing the advertising and marketing: `Get honest about this. Make sure that we don't advertise around schools. Make sure that we don't have all these promotions with Camel hats and shirts and all the rest of it.' 
And let's say they are successful. Should that conduct on their part, that positive conduct, be rewarded? Of course it should. In contrast, if Marlboro and Philip Morris, for example, decide they don't care, they just go on selling as usual, and in fact you see kids, more and more kids, turning to their brand, should they be held accountable for that decision? Why, of course they should. Company-by-company accountability makes sense. It says to the tobacco industry: This is not just an industry problem, this is a company challenge. Get serious about it. 
I was somewhat amused that the Richmond, VA, Times-Dispatch yesterday came out with a story from the Philip Morris company. For someone who has been battling this issue for a long time, it is hard to imagine, but Geoffrey Bible, chairman of the Nation's largest tobacco company, told employees in New York that he has recently appointed a senior executive to `design more actions' to back up the company's long-held claim that it does not try to appeal to youngsters. 
What a great epiphany it must have been in Richmond, VA, for Philip Morris to finally realize we are talking about them, we are talking about their marketing and advertising techniques, and we are talking about the possibility, if they do not get serious and start reducing sales to youth, that in fact they are going to have to pay for it. 
The Durbin-DeWine amendment says that payment should be directed at the companies based on their conduct. If they are positive and reduce sales to children, they will be rewarded. If they ignore this bill and they ignore these goals and end up selling more to children, they should pay a price for it. I don't think that is unreasonable. 
I want to salute, incidentally, the State attorneys general who started this ball rolling. Some have been critical of them. I have not. We would not be here today without their initiative and without the progress that they made. Particularly, I would like to salute Attorney General Skip Humphrey of Minnesota. He hung in there for a long time, and, literally before the jury retired to consider a verdict, he settled the case for over $6 billion for the taxpayers of Minnesota. That is great news for those taxpayers and Attorney General Humphrey. But equally important, during the course of his lawsuit he managed to draw out even more documents from the tobacco industry. It seems that the more and more documentation we bring out, the more obvious it is that these tobacco executives have been lying to us for decades. They have, in fact, been targeting kids. 
We have so many examples. I can't read them all to you here, but from a 1981 memo, a Philip Morris researcher said:  
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer. 
A 1973 Brown & Williamson memo said: 
Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the 26-plus age group. Growth is from 16 to 25 year olds. . .. 
Remember, at the time, it was illegal to sell their product to 16-year-olds in some States, and, yet, they were making it very clear it was part of their marketing strategy. The list just goes on and on of these companies that made conscious marketing decisions to sell to children. They knew they had to recruit these kids. If the kids turned 18, it was unlikely they would become smokers. All of these documents and evidence have really made the case. 
Our look-back amendment says we are going to take this very seriously on a company-by-company basis. Let me address for a moment some of the criticisms that have been leveled against this amendment. 
First, if you support the McCain bill, which has a company-specific payment in it, then you must necessarily reject the argument that you cannot assess on a company-specific basis. McCain assumes that, I assume it, common sense dictates that, in fact, the companies market their brands to specific groups and can measure the success of their marketing and sales. The Durbin-DeWine amendment takes the McCain premise of the fee assessed on a company-wide basis and expands it. So for supporters of the McCain bill, the Durbin-DeWine amendment is consistent with the methodology that is used. 
Second, this will not lead to price increases. The Durbin-DeWine amendment is just the opposite. Some are arguing the look-back provision means the cost of the tobacco product is going to go up. Well, not necessarily. If, for example, in the case that I used, R.J. Reynolds is doing a good job and they are not assessed a surcharge, but Philip Morris is doing a bad job and they are assessed, then Philip Morris is going to have to find a way to absorb that payment in their cost on the bottom line, because to raise the price of their products puts them at a competitive disadvantage with the people at R.J. Reynolds. 
The Durbin-DeWine amendment is specific in saying any payment that is assessed is going to be absorbed by the company in their bottom line. Let me give you an example of the breadth of this payment. 
If a company misses the target by 20 percent--in other words, we are saying we are going to reduce teen smoking by so much percent--15 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent--and it turns out they miss it by 20 percent, by a large margin, under our amendment their payment would add up to about 29 cents a pack. It sounds like a lot of money. It is, but don't forget for a moment that the tobacco companies' profit on each package of cigarettes is 40 cents. So our amendment is not going to drive them out of business. It simply is going to tell them their profits are on the line unless they stop selling to children. 
Some have argued that our surcharge is too high and will increase costs to $7 billion instead of the underlying bill's $4 billion. That is not accurate, either. The underlying bill is kept at $4 billion in industry-wide payments, but it also has company-specific payments as well. The Durbin-DeWine amendment draws a line and puts an absolute cap at $7 billion in total. 
The two approaches--the bill and our amendment--have similar aggregates if the companies miss by large amounts. 
Third, it has been said that this amendment is punitive--punitive. Our approach is not punitive. It reduces the industry-wide payment that applies to companies that, in fact, reduce their youth smoking while other companies fail to do so. It increases the surcharges on companies that continue to market or sell to kids. That is not punishment, that is accountability. 
And fourth, as a sign we are not punitive, we have capped the amount that can be charged. It has been pointed out that we require payments of as much as $240 million per percentage point, but keep in mind, too, that the underlying bill also has provisions in there for payments by percentage point. The lifetime social cost of hooking each youth smoker is $400 million. We are still charging companies less than the social cost of their continued sales to youth. 
I will conclude my time that has been allotted under the unanimous consent agreement by showing on this chart what happens under the Durbin-DeWine amendment as opposed to the McCain bill. 
If companies miss by 5 percent, the amount they are charged is $240 million under our amendment, and it is $190 million in the underlying bill. At 10 percent, you can see the numbers, and 20 percent as well. 
The Durbin-DeWine amendment sets out to achieve several goals on which I hope all Senators, regardless of party, will agree. We reduce the number of youth smokers by 450,000 over the McCain bill. We reduce the number of premature deaths by 150,000 with this amendment. We reduce by $2.8 billion the lifetime social costs that are attached to smoking addiction, diseases, and death. And we have the same target in reduction as the original proposed settlement with the States attorneys general. 
I hope those who have listened to this debate will understand what we are about here. This look-back amendment is more than just a technical approach. It is, in fact, an approach which requires honesty and accountability. The tobacco companies hate this amendment like the devil hates holy water, because this amendment holds them accountable and says, `We don't want to hear anymore verbiage from you about reducing teen smoking. We want to put it in writing. We want to put it on the line. We want you to be held accountable, and you will be held accountable. And if the Durbin-DeWine amendment is adopted and you continue to push your product on children and this addiction rate among our kids continues to grow, you will pay through the nose.' 
That is hard talk, I know. This is a hard subject. We are talking about the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. That is why this historic debate is so important, and that is why no other political diversion that has been raised on the floor should be taken seriously. Let us get about the people's business. Let us do something to give our kids a chance to be spared the scourge of addiction to nicotine and tobacco products. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the conference report to the Intermodal Surface Transportaton Efficiency Act (ISTEA). I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits of this legislation for my home state of Illinois. 
This conference report is truly historic. It makes the largest investment to date in our nation's aging infrastructure, $216 billion over the next six years. In short, this conference report increases the State of Illinois' total ISTEA dollars and provides greater flexibility. It goes a long way toward improving the conditions of Illinois' roads and bridges, properly funding mass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviating congestion, and addressing highway safety and the environment. 
The bill provides $175 billion over six years for highways, highway safety, and other surface transportation programs. Illinois has the third largest Interstate system in the country; however, its roads and bridges are rated as the second worst in the nation. The State can expect to receive about $5.3 billion over six years from the highway formula. That's nearly a 30 percent increase or $1.2 billion more than the ISTEA of 1991. 
Major reconstruction and rehabilitation projects like Downtown Chicago's Wacker Drive and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) will be able to move forward thanks, in large part, to this legislation. The conference report designates $25 million each for both of these priority projects. In addition, both the Stevenson Expressway and Wacker Drive projects will be able to compete for federal funds through certain discretionary programs. 
The conference report also includes funding for over 100 high priority projects from throughout the State worth more than $375 million. 
Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan area as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate congestion and provides access for thousands of Illinoisans everyday. The conference report includes $41 billion over six years for mass transit. Illinois can expect to receive about $2.5 billion over six years, a 67 percent increase or $1 billion more than the 1991 ISTEA. 
The conference report authorizes the Chicago Transit Authority to expand the capacity of the Ravenswood Brown Line and fully funds the rebuilding of the Douglas Branch of the Blue Line. It also will help METRA expand Northeastern Illinois' commuter rail system by double-tracking and extending service into rapidly growing areas. The Metro Link light rail system in St. Clair County will have the ability to complete an extension from East St. Louis through Belleville Area College to MidAmerica Airport under the conference report. The transit provisions will also help transit authorities throughout the State purchase and upgrade buses and bus facilities. 
The conference report also includes $150 million per year for the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Grants program. This program will assist communities in filling the gaps in transit service that prevent welfare recipients from finding and keeping the jobs they need to remain self-sufficient. 
Congress also has made a commitment to high-speed passenger rail, a safe, cost-effective means of transportation, in this conference report. With increased funding, it is my hope that the Midwest can develop an effective transportation system. 
This legislation also preserves and expands some important environmental and enhancement programs, including the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program. CMAQ's goal is to help states meet their air quality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. The conference report increases funding for CMAQ by 18 percent. Illinois can expect more than $1 billion over six years under the program. The report also fully funds transportation enhancement activities, such as bicycle pedestrian facilities and historic preservation. 
Illinois is one of 15 states that has been responsible enough to pass a .08 legal blood-alcohol concentration level for drivers. The State has had .08 BAC since July of 1997 and we are already beginning to see positive results. Unfortunately, the conference committee did not include language that would have sanctioned states that refused to pass .08 BAC legislaton. Instead, Illinois and other states who have passed .08 will receive as much as $6 million per year in highway safety incentives. 
I am pleased that the conference report extends the current excise tax exemption for an important Illinois product--corn-based, renewable ethanol fuel--through 2007. Farmers and the ethanol industry must have the ability to plan for the future. Extending the incentive gives them the tools necessary to expand their operations and this important industry while improving the environment and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. 
Mr. President, I know this conference report is not a perfect document. Illinois' highway formula should be higher. I will work with the Administration to ensure that Illinois competes for and receives a fair share of discretionary transportation funds available as a result of this conference report. With the passage of this legislation, Congress has upheld its obligation to reauthorize and improve our nation's important transportation programs. I am pleased to support this measure.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce this legislation with my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. Those who perpetrate violence against their family members do not desist because the family member grows older. In fact, in some cases, the abuse may become more severe as the victim ages becoming more isolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. Other age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a victim's vulnerability. It also is true that older victims' ability to report abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser for care or housing. Every seven minutes in Illinois, there is an incidence of elder abuse. Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most under reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than child abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen incidents estimated to be reported. Seniors who experience abuse worry they will be banished to a nursing home if they report abuse. They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse by their children to the authorities and thus increasing their child's likelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they remain `silent victims.' 
Domestic violence programs have a moral and ethical responsibility to provide services to individuals of any age who are the victims of domestic abuse. Yet most domestic violence programs see only a few older women a year. That is not to say that the domestic violence service providers actively discriminate against older victims. Analysis of the few studies that do exist of elder domestic abuse indicate that the vast majority do not themselves seek to access existing services. There may be many reasons for this. The images portrayed in the media of the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, with small children. Seniors suffering domestic abuse may not readily identify with these images and, therefore, may not see those services as being for them. Other cultural barriers may also exist. Many older women were raised to believe that family business is a private matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed with anyone, especially strangers or counselors. Only a handful of domestic abuse programs throughout the country are reaching out to older women. 
This legislation seeks to improve current federal family violence programs, such as The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Family Violence Prevention Services Act (FVPSA), to make them more sensitive to the needs of the nations seniors. Title I of this bill promotes the inclusion of elder abuse cases in law school clinics and training for law enforcement in the identification and referral of older victims of domestic violence or elder abuse to services. Title II allows FVPSA grant funds to be used for outreach to older individuals. We know that great improvements have taken place since VAWA was first passed. One of the most successful programs is the law enforcement training program, which received $200 million in FY 1998. However, improvement can be made with respect to identifying abuse among all age groups. When the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law enforcement to deal with this person in the same way that they might deal with a younger person. Who wants to send an `old guy' to jail? However, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because then the abuser has every reason to believe that there are no consequences for their actions. Another common problem is differentiating between injuries related to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or illness. Too many older women's broken bones have been attributed to disorientation, osteoporosis or other age-related vulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure that they are not the result of abuse. 
Title III reauthorizes the very important Elder Rights programs contained within the Older Americans Act. These programs provide seed money for state elder abuse programs. Included here is the Long-term-care Ombudsman program that monitors nursing homes and investigates reports of abuse in such institutions. 
Most domestic abuse shelters are filled with young families. The staff and volunteers are predominantly younger than 50 years old. The recreation calendar has activities for young women and children. Discussions at support groups can be dominated by younger women talking about their children, child care and custody. Many domestic abuse shelters are not readily accessible to those who are less mobile. For instance, some may not be accessible via the ground floor. Moving from your home into a shelter is always a traumatic event. However, it may be even harder for those who find themselves in surroundings so unfamiliar and so totally oriented to a different age group. In my home state of Illinois, there are only two centers that focus on the shelter needs of seniors. One is the Center for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, the other is the Swan center in Olney, which has a comprehensive elder protective services program. Title III seeks to address this shortage by encouraging expanded access to domestic violence shelters that cater to the needs of older individuals. 
This bill seeks to help foster collaboration between the aging networks and domestic violence coalitions. Throughout the United States, through the Older Americans Act, a variety of programs seek to serve seniors in their communities. Home-delivered meals and other services provide an opportunity for seniors to interact with individuals outside their own homes. Increasing the knowledge of such care providers in how to identify and refer victims of domestic violence would likely provide much-needed relief to many of these individuals. Title III of this bill contains a `Community Initiatives and Outreach' grants program to help coordinate both public and private efforts in elder domestic abuse prevention and treatment. Fostering communication between these two groups has the potential of dramatically increasing the number of individuals that are sensitive to these issues of abuse and, also, to increase the number of individuals who are served by domestic violence programs generally. 
Family violence is one of the most common causes of disease and distress seen by physicians. In spite of its existence as a pervasive and debilitating medical and social problem, many advocates in the domestic violence community believe that it receives insufficient attention in the curricula of most schools of medicine or other health professional training institutions. Dr. Jane Jackman, past president of the Illinois State Medical Society noted last year `Doctors are finding that the problem is under-recognized. Elder abuse or maltreatment is growing in significance as a factor in trauma, hospital admissions, rising costs of long term care and, ultimately, deaths.' Title III of this bill directs the Assistant Secretary of Aging to collaborate with other Departments of Health and Human Services and the National Institute of Aging to update and improve curricula for both training and retraining of health professionals and others in the area of elder domestic abuse. These curricula would be made available to educational institutions involved in training health professionals. Title IV would amend the Area Health Education Center and Geriatric Education Centers funded through the Health Professionals Education Act to allow them to use funds for training and retraining health professionals in elder domestic abuse. 
The last title of the bill, Title V, examines the issue of financial exploitation of seniors. Take the case of Helen (not her real name) reported in the Chicago Tribune last year. Helen was a 66-year-old mother and grandmother from DuPage County. Early in 1997, Helen lost $90,000 and even access to her own kitchen due to the actions of her daughter. Helen describes how she felt like a P.O.W. Helen had agreed to pool resources with her daughter and son-in-law and buy a house where all of them would live; the deal seemed like a win-win proposition. Unbeknownst to Helen, most of the money went to pay off her son-in-law's debts. Soon the young couple asked Helen for thousands more and $300 in monthly rent. Shortly after this, her daughter had construction done on the house which put a new wall between Helen's bedroom and the kitchen, blocking her way to the kitchen and forcing her to prepare her food in the bathroom. Eventually, Helen found herself in a shelter. She now lives in a government subsidized apartment. 
The Illinois Department of Aging and other elder abuse service providers will attest to the fact that Helen is not alone in experiencing such financial exploitation. Of the 5,833 reports of elder abuse in Illinois in 1997, nearly half (44.6%) were reports of financial exploitation. Statistics compiled by the Illinois Department on Aging show that the majority of financial abuse victims are female and that most have a functional impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. For some, financial exploitation may at times be accompanied by physical abuse or the threat of physical abuse or other form of coercion. The states Attorneys General have efforts underway to examine this area and are cooperating in sharing information on how best to deal with such abuse. Financial exploitation is probably more complex and sometimes more difficult to detect than other forms of abuse. Therefore, we are proposing a study by experts in the field to more comprehensively analyze the problem and to make recommendations for future actions. 
With the greying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in all its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we need to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence programs and ensure that these and other programs that serve seniors are sensitive and knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse. I am pleased that Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Harkin, Mikulski, Wellstone, Dodd, Kohl, Warner, Boxer, Graham, Cleland, Landrieu, Reid, Torricelli and Faircloth have all joined Senator Collins and myself in introducing this bill, and I hope that many more will join us in this effort to focus attention on the needs of the `forgotten older victims of domestic violence.' 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed the the Record.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, for those who are following this debate, I hope they will understand that we are genuinely trying to move this bill to final passage. This bipartisan bill is the product of the Commerce Committee, crafted by Senators McCain, Kerry, Hollings, and others in an effort to do something historic to reduce the number of teenagers and children in America who are lured into the addiction of smoking. 
We have tried to establish a procedure on the floor, which occasionally we have been able to hold to, and occasionally we fail. But that procedure was to allow each side to offer an amendment. Of course, Senator Gregg had offered his amendment, and, after some motions, then Senator Gramm of Texas offered his amendment. At that point, I was supposed to have been next. But as it stands, now I am coming up with this look-back amendment in this fashion. It is an amendment which I am happy to sponsor with Senator DeWine of Ohio, as well as Senator Wyden of Oregon, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, Senators Harkin, Collins, Kennedy, Snowe, Daschle, Conrad, and Reed. This is truly a bipartisan amendment. I hope that those who are following this debate will understand the significance of this amendment. 
The look-back provisions in the bill are really important in terms of enforcement. This term look-back is a relatively new term. It is not one created by the Congress. It is, in fact, a term of art which came about as a result of negotiation after the State attorneys general sat down with the tobacco companies. This is really an effort to make certain that the tobacco companies keep their word and reduce the number of young people in America who are smoking. 
We have talked about imposing a new tax, or fee, on tobacco products with the belief that it will reduce teen smoking. But we are not certain. We don't know how much we will be able to achieve by increasing the tobacco fee by $1.10 a pack. We believe it could be significant. But it may not be enough. 
That is why we have what is called a look-back provision. This is how it works. In years to come, we will do a survey of 
teenagers across America, and we will take a look particularly at children who are smoking. We will try to determine how many are smoking. We will also be able to determine what brands of tobacco they are using. With that information, we will be able to measure the effectiveness of the goal of this bill. We will look back on a periodic basis to determine how many children have been taken from the ranks of smokers or have not been recruited in the first place, and we will take a look at what they are smoking. 
The look-back provisions are an important part of the agreement with the States' attorneys general. The tobacco companies knew this had to be part of the bargain. They couldn't walk away from the table with all of the things they hoped for, walk away from liability in a State suit, for example, without some assurance that they were in fact going to be genuine in their efforts to reduce teen smoking. The look-back language that is included in the McCain bill which came from the Commerce Committee is a very good start, but only a start. 
That is the reason I am offering this amendment with Senator DeWine and others. We want to construct an effective look-back provision that will change companies' behavior and give them incentives to stop marketing to children. 
Our look-back amendment does two very important things. First, it shifts the emphasis on any look-back assessment so that it will fall primarily onto tobacco companies that are the worst offenders rather than primarily on the industry as a whole. That is a major element in this debate. 
If you were to ask what is the difference between the Durbin and DeWine amendment as opposed to the Commerce Committee bill, it is the fact that when we look back and determine whether or not the tobacco companies are keeping their word, whether in fact they are no longer marketing and selling to children, we believe at least in this amendment that we should hold individual companies responsible. The McCain bill, the Commerce bill, as good as it is--I think it is a good bill--looks at it primarily from an industry viewpoint. I will try to spell out here in more detail why I think that is not the way to go. 
The second thing we do that is very important is, we restore the smoking reduction targets that were originally agreed to by the tobacco industry in their proposed settlement with the States' attorneys general last June. On both scores, this amendment is about accountability. Will these companies change their behavior? Will they stop their insidious marketing practices? Will they get honest in terms of the retailing of their product? We can find out. We can measure it. We can hold them accountable. If they don't live up to the reduction levels proposed in the legislation, they will face financial incentives to create the right climate and the right results. 
Why do we need look-backs? Effective look-back provisions can help achieve the goal of reducing youth tobacco use and change the current incentives that drive tobacco companies to market to children. Make no mistake. We have gone through this debate over and over. You will recall that for years the tobacco companies used to say, `This isn't fair. We are not trying to sell to kids.' Then, of course, lawsuits were filed across the Nation. We required them to disclose the documents they were using. Along come these documents. It turns out that these tobacco company executives were not as honest as they should have been. 
You all may recall this great scene that occurred about 4 years ago in the U.S. House of Representatives when the eight tobacco company executives came before the Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives. This `gang of eight' raised their hands and solemnly said under oath that nicotine is not addictive. America laughed, because they knew that once again the tobacco companies had made an incredible statement, literally one that had no credence whatsoever. When the tobacco companies told us nicotine wasn't addictive, that they were not adding nicotine or manipulating it in cigarettes, that they were not trying to sell to kids, it turns out they were wrong on all counts. So much for the credibility of the `gang of eight.' Incidentally, they are no longer the managers of these companies. But, nevertheless, their successors still have to be held accountable. 
Today, each new child who starts to smoke represents a new profit opportunity for tobacco companies. Tobacco companies have a tough go of it. Think about it. If you were running their business--every year they lose 2 million of their best customers. But a half a million people will die from tobacco-related diseases. Another 1.5 million will finally be able to quit and break the habit, or will die of other causes. 
If you are running a company losing 2 million customers a year, you need new ones. Where will you turn? You know adults are not your most likely market. They are usually smarter, a little more mature, and they know the danger of tobacco. They are not easily lured into the addiction. You have to go after the kids, and get the kids in their rebellious youth when they are willing to try anything and think they are going to live forever, and get them started on tobacco. If you can get a kid to start smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco, it will develop into an addiction. The drug in that tobacco will go into that child's system and create a craving for this product that is very tough to stop. For those children who think that it is an easy thing to quit this addiction, it is not. The earlier they try to stop, the better. But the tobacco companies know that. 
Since most smokers start as children, children are the only available replacement smokers to take the place of these 2 million lost customers. In addition, we know that smokers are generally very loyal to the first brand that they smoke. We all know people who will only smoke certain brands--Marlboros, the cancer cowboy's cigarette, or Kools, Camels, whatever it happens to be. Many people who started with the brand when they were kids stay with it for a lifetime, albeit a shortened lifetime. 
These facts and the desire to give their shareholders steady profits lead the tobacco companies to market to children to ensure their future markets. The strong look-back provisions will totally reverse the economic incentives for marketing to children. It will say to the industry and to each company that they have an incentive to prevent their products from appealing to children. Manufacturers will start using what they have learned about teenage tobacco use to avoid having children use their products because every new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of snuff will be an economic loss to the company. 
Our goal is not to punish the companies or gain revenues. If this never generates a cent, that would be fine. But basically what we are trying to do is meet the smoking reduction targets. Our goal is to create the incentives which help achieve actual reductions in underage tobacco use so companies might never have to pay a penny of these look-back assessments. We are going to do our part. We are going to have youth access restrictions, counteradvertising, public education, and other governmental efforts to reduce youth smoking. We expect the tobacco manufacturers to do their part as well. And that is what this amendment is all about--accountability. 
Why focus on company-specific assessments? In the bill that is pending, a much greater share of the look-back assessments are imposed on the whole industry rather than on specific companies. There is a $4 billion annual cap on industry-wide payments that is much greater than the company-specific assessment. Although the company-specific charges could be as much as $3 to $4 billion in extreme cases, it is more likely they are going to be a lot smaller. If all the companies miss their target by 10 percentage points, the company-specific surcharges would only equal $640 million. If they miss by 20 percent, it would be $1.3 billion compared to nearly $4 billion for the industry as a whole. 
Let me show a chart here which gives you an idea of the difference between the look-back provisions that we are discussing. 
Consider the fact that we are setting these targets to reduce youth smoking, and these targets say that over a 10-year period of time we are going to bring down smoking among kids by a certain percentage. 
What happens, let's say, in the fifth year after this legislation passes when the tobacco companies as an industry are supposed to reduce the number of kids smoking by 40 percent? What happens if the largest company misses it by 20 percent, if instead of having a 40-percent reduction, they only have a 20-percent reduction? 
Look at what occurs. Under this comparison of the Commerce Committee bill, and this amendment by Senator DeWine and myself, the industry as a whole would face a penalty of 10 cents a pack and the individual company 9 cents a pack if they miss it by 20 percent under the Commerce Committee bill. 
But look at the other side now if our amendment prevails--6 cents for the industry per pack, but 29 cents for the offending company. Doesn't that make more sense? If we know as a result of our surveys that the kids are smoking Camels, for example, shouldn't R.J. Reynolds be held accountable? They are the company that makes the brand. They market the brand. They retail the brand. They have an obligation under this law to reduce teen usage of their brand of cigarettes. 
If you don't do that, think of the perverse situation where one company is trying its best to reduce teen usage and youth usage and another company ignores it. Under this bill, the penalty is 
spread across the industry by and large, and there is not that much of a forfeiture of funds for the individual company as would occur under the DeWine and Durbin amendment. We want to make this more company-specific. 
This approach, which currently is in the bill, risks creating incentives for some company to keep building future market share. There is money to be made here. As long as these kids are smoking, these companies are making money. We want to make sure the profit is taken out of this. Our amendment increases the company-specific payments, reduces the industry-wide payments. 
This amendment will not necessarily increase the price of cigarettes. I want to really pause for a moment on this point because I think it is so important. We have had a lengthy debate over the last several days about whether or not we are imposing, at least indirectly, new taxes on lower income individuals, whether by raising the price of a package of cigarettes we are passing along to lower income and middle-income individuals more of a tax burden. 
Think about this for a moment. Assume we have two companies and the Durbin-DeWine amendment is enacted. One of the companies is doing a good job; it is reducing its sales to minors--very happy with the results. The other company has made a calculation. The other company says we are not going to be so tough or restrictive. We will, frankly, look the other way. We are going to continue to do some marketing that we know appeals to kids. We are going to kind of tell our retailers we are not going to enforce the law that stringently, and so look what happens. If that occurs under the existing bill, they are both going to be treated equally in the industry-wide assessments; both will be facing these additional costs per pack equally. 
Under our approach, it will be significantly different and the company that is a bad actor, the company that is not trying to reduce sales to kids is a company that will face a much, much larger charge per pack. Now, what do you do? If you are the company that has been selling to kids, it turns out kids are smoking your brand, you are facing this kind of payment. You can't add this price to the package of cigarettes because your competitor isn't doing the same. You have to absorb this cost in your bottom line. So the consumers are protected from the price increase, and basically the company really pays a price for what they have done. 
This bill presently before us also reduces youth smoking reduction targets relative to what the industry agreed to last year. This second and very important element in the bill is one I would like us to pause and reflect on. Just last year, these tobacco companies came together, and with the State attorneys general said we agree to the following targets to reduce the number of smokers each year. 
Well, a year has passed. The issue has come to Capitol Hill. We debated it back and forth and now we have a chance to enact this legislation. What has happened during the course of that year? The tobacco companies have done very well. They have done very well in luring more children into this addiction. In fact, since 1991, we have seen a dramatic increase in the percentage of kids who are smoking. That is a sad commentary. It is a sad fact of life. 
What Senator DeWine and I are doing in our amendment is going back to the original targets the tobacco companies set in their agreement with the attorneys general. So instead of the McCain or Commerce Committee bill reducing smoking by 60 percent of kids over 10 years, we hit a target of 67 percent in the equivalent course of time, getting them to quit or sparing more kids from the possibility of becoming smokers and of facing disease and premature death. Four-hundred and fifty thousand more children will be protected with the Durbin-DeWine amendment by the year 2008 than in the underlying bill. There will be 450,000 fewer smokers if the tobacco companies continue to meet their reduction targets of 67 percent instead of 60 percent; 150,000 fewer premature deaths--we know that about a third of smokers are going to die young as a result of this habit; $2.8 billion in lifetime social costs are avoided; and we have the same real target as the original proposed settlement. I think that makes sense. 
The next question is the constitutionality question. The tobacco companies claim that these look-back provisions are unconstitutional. But both the Department of Justice and the Congressional Research Service have studied the issue and concluded they are wrong. Just as we hold companies responsible for clean air attainment standards, we can hold them responsible to help reduce youth smoking rates. 
The courts have required that there be a rational basis for this type of program, and this amendment is based on a very rational consideration. If companies' assessments or surcharges raise their cost of doing business as usual, they will consider it an incentive to change their behavior and use the knowledge they have gained over the years in terms of selling to kids, to stop selling to kids. 
With regard to the argument that this might violate due process, the purpose of the look-back assessments is to supplement the other measures in the bill designed to reduce youth smoking rates, including the bill's price increases, and to encourage the industry, which is uniquely able to develop innovative strategies, to take the action to minimize youth smoking. 
The look-back provisions don't violate the Constitution's bill of attainder. All of us who studied the Constitution over the years wondered if we would ever run into a case where somebody would start talking about a bill of attainder. I didn't think I would ever face that in my life on Earth, and here we are on the floor of the Senate talking about a bill of attainder. 
The bill of attainder in the Constitution prohibits singling out particular individuals or entities for legislatively mandated punishments. The tobacco companies have said: Oh, this look-back provision is a bill of attainder. The Department of Justice states the look-back provisions apply to all manufacturers of tobacco products, not a single company, and would operate as one component of a comprehensive industry-wide reform. Additionally, look-back provisions are not penalties for industry misconduct so much as an affirmative step to reduce youth smoking. 
I think the tobacco industry's constitutional argument is a weak one, designed to shift away the attention from their marketing to kids. 
Let me respond quickly to a few other items, and then I will be happy to defer to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator DeWine.

Mr. DURBIN. I think it is more likely a public health agency will try to reduce those numbers. I can recall a few years ago the tobacco companies said, `We are going to stop marketing to kids, and we are going to tell these kids we don't want their business.' And they delivered their message by buying full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal. There may be some kids who read the Wall Street Journal, but not a lot of them. It is far better to take that information and message and put it on a television show the kids are likely to watch.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his question, and I hope what we are doing is a coordinated effort. It is an effort which increases the fee on a package of cigarettes, which we have been told by economists, in and of itself, will reduce youth usage. It is an effort to change the advertising so that, by and large, children are not affected by the lure of that advertising. It is an effort by the Government--and the Senator is right--through HHS and others, to deliver this message effectively. But finally it comes down to the tobacco companies themselves who make the product and market the product and sell the product. And they bear a responsibility, too, a responsibility which, if they don't live up to it, is going to result in a charge against each package of cigarettes. 
Let me just conclude with two or three points before deferring to the Senator from Ohio. Some say the 67 percent reduction figure over 10 years is too high. I don't believe it is. Marijuana use by 12- to 17-year-olds declined 76 percent from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. The smoking rate among black 12th graders in the late 1970s was the same as the rate for all teenagers today. It declined by 76 percent from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, without advertising restrictions, education, and counteradvertising envisioned in the current legislation. 
Mr. President, 80 percent of adult smokers and 70 percent of adolescent smokers regret ever starting to smoke. I think we have a situation here where 67 percent is a figure that can be reached, and the actual number of young people who would then stop smoking is one that was agreed to by the tobacco companies when they met with the attorneys general just last year. 
Why do we want to strengthen this bill? Because, frankly, we believe that unless the industry is held to this standard on a specific company basis, the results will not be what we hope they will be. Some people say the amount of the payment here is more than the lifetime profit from each new young smoker. 
First, let's not get caught up in the debate of what is a lifetime profit from a new smoker. Is it only $500 or $1,000 or $1,500? I am not sure we accept these claims. 
Second, these companies are not just profit maximizers; they want volume. Why? Why would the tobacco industry want volume over profit? Because they are dealing with people who are addicted to nicotine, who will have to follow them up the track as the price increases. So they do not focus just on profits but also on volume. And we have to find a way to reduce the volume when it comes to children. 
Third, even this calculation does not get to the true cost of addicting a child on tobacco. The American Medical Association has estimated we would have to increase the surcharges to $400 million per percentage point--more than 6 times what the bill does in its company-specific look-back--to cover the societal cost of each additional smoker. It is about more than tobacco company profits; it is about the cost to America and American families as a result. 
I think what we are setting out to do here is create a payment structure that is reasonable. Under the bill, companies will pay an industry-wide payment of $80 million for each of the first 5 percentage points by which they missed the targets, $160 million for each of the next 5 points, $240 million for the next 12, maxing out at $4 billion. Each company that misses the target will pay a company-specific surcharge of $1,000 multiplied by the number of children by which a company falls short of in its target. There is 
no maximum for the company-specific surcharge, which could reach as much as 3 to 4 billion dollars in an extreme case. 
Under our agreement, companies will pay an industry-wide payment of $40 million for each of the first 5 percentage points by which the industry as a whole misses the targets, plus $120 million for each of the next 15 points, with a maximum of $2 billion. Each company that misses the targets will also pay a company-specific surcharge equal to the company's share of youth smokers multiplied by $80 million for each of the first 5 percentage points, $240 million for each of the next 19 points, with a maximum of $5 billion. 
The potential maximum surcharges are similar in the aggregate. Ours is weighted towards companies as opposed to towards the industry as a whole. 
Let me close by saying that I am happy that this is, in fact, a bipartisan amendment. For those who have argued on the floor over the last 2 days that they want to make certain that we don't increase the price of the product too much for lower-income groups, the Durbin-DeWine amendment addresses that directly. When you go company-specific, the money comes off the bottom line. For those who say that the targets that the State attorneys general agreed on to reduce the number of kids smoking were reasonable, as those tobacco companies said then, this bill returns to those targets. We think this is sensible. Let us reward those companies which are engaged in good conduct, reducing youth usage. Let us make those pay who do not engage in good conduct. 
I am happy to have this amendment offered today in the Senate, and I am proud to have as my cosponsor the Senator who will be speaking next, my friend who served in the other body with me and now is the Senator from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine. 
At this point, I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of Amtrak, recognizing the tremendous potential that advanced rail-passenger technology can play in developing our nation's 21st Century economy. 
Amtrak has a distinct and important relationship with the state of Illinois. Chicago is the headquarters of one of Amtrak's three Strategic Business Units and the Intercity Business Unit, which manages all passenger trains in America with the exception of the Northeast Corridor and West Coast services. Downtown Chicago is also home to one of the three nationwide Reservation Call Centers. Amtrak also operates over forty trains per day in Illinois, with a total ridership in excess of 2.5 million passengers. Illinois has first-hand experience with Amtrak's current services and recognizes its future potential. 
The Congress has also understood Amtrak's potential. In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, the Senate and House provided $2.3 billion in Amtrak capital investment to make our federally owned rail passenger carrier a strong contributor to our nation's mobility. Congress also worked diligently to enact the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. With the authority conferred on it by this legislation, Amtrak now has the ability to undertake the organizational restructuring and operational fine-tuning necessary to realize the full benefits promised by the $2.3 billion in capital funding. 
An integral component of the reform envisioned by this legislation was the timely selection and seating of an `Amtrak Reform Board' comprised of directors with fresh ideas and experience in dealing with the business world. We must ensure that the Administration moves swiftly enough to avoid the consequences of failing to appoint a new Amtrak Reform Board by the statutory deadline, July 1, 1998. Quick action on this matter will allow Amtrak to maintain the authorization mandated in the law signed last December. 
I am hopeful that the President will move quickly to appoint the seven directors required under the new law. These appointments should include professionals experienced in the leasing and financing of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment and people familiar with debt rescheduling and refinancing, which are among tasks tailored to Amtrak's business needs. 
I would also encourage the Administration to make certain that these appointments fairly represent the various regions of the country, and Illinois is certainly deserving of such representation. Amtrak provides service to over thirty cities in Illinois. In addition, Amtrak employs some 2,200 Illinois residents, with earnings totaling over $50 million per year. Regional representation will also ensure that the diverse interests of our regional economies can be brought to the table for equitable decision making in the Amtrak Boardroom. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues who support Amtrak will join me in encouraging the Administration to submit qualified candidates, women and men with the knowledge and experience required to strengthen our national system of passenger transportation, to the Senate as soon as possible.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank our friend for yielding this time. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on this, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts for offering this important amendment. 
For those of you following this debate who are wondering what is happened here, we are 4 hours behind where we were supposed to be. There was a minifilibuster on the floor here when the Senator from Missouri took the floor and slowed us down. So we will have a backlog of amendments with the Memorial Day weekend coming in the hopes that we will not finish this bill. This is a time-honored Senate tradition. You have seen it earlier on the floor. We are now 4 hours late. 
I have an important amendment to offer, and I hope to offer it today. And others want to do the same. I say to those who are joining in the minifilibusters that the clock may be on their side but history is not. They are on the wrong side of history in supporting the positions of the tobacco companies. 
Pick up the morning paper and take a look at what the tobacco companies are telling Americans about why they oppose 
the McCain bill, and why they believe the legislation we are considering on this floor, which would increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes to reduce the number of children smoking, the tobacco companies say that is wrong. Are the tobacco companies credible? 
Exhibit A, photograph A, eight tobacco company executives, 4 years ago standing before a House committee, under oath swearing that tobacco is not addictive. I rest my case about their credibility. 
There are three issues for us to consider here in this debate. 
The first, will price increase reduce teen smoking? It has been shown and needs to be shown again. We have a living example in Canada. As the price of the product went up, children smoking went down. We know that kids have less disposable income. You raise the price of the product, a few of them will say, `I don't think I can afford this habit.' 
That is what we are driving at. The experts come along and tell us that is right. 
We have a statement from Frank Chaloupka, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago who says: `Based on this research, I estimate that a $1.50 increase in the federal cigarette tax'--Senator Kennedy's bill, which I support--`implemented over 3 years and maintained in real, inflation-adjusted terms, will cut the prevalence of youth smoking in half.' 
Will price increases reduce teen smoking? Clearly they will. 
Second is a $1.50 price increase better than $1.10? It is a reasonable question to ask. I think we can see what happens when we deal with an increase of $1.50 over $1.10. 
Take a look at this chart. If we had no change in the cigarette tax, this is basically what would occur. We would expect the same prevalence of smoking. If we had a change of a $1.10 increase in the cost of cigarettes, we can see a 34-percent reduction in the number of young people who are smoking. Now, take a look at $1.50. The conclusion is obvious; a 56-percent reduction. 
So as we increase the price of the product, children stop using it, not only in economic models, but in our historical experience in Canada. 
The third question is this taxpayer. That is a legitimate question. 
I will concede that the opponents of this tobacco legislation say that this tax will necessarily hit lower-income Americans the hardest because they smoke the most. There are a lot of explanations for that, not the least of which is the tobacco industry, which over the years has really targeted those folks. Go into any inner-city area in America and take a look at the billboards and you will see block after block of alcohol and tobacco advertising. They believe that these folks and that income category are more vulnerable to become addicted to tobacco products. They have been successful in luring them. 
So we can tax the product and it will necessarily hit those in the lower-income category. Is it fair for us to tax it? We generally asked Americans what they thought of this idea. I think you might be interested in the results. When a poll was done, this poll was done by a national organization paid for by the American Cancer Society and released a few days ago. The results are that a majority, 59 percent of Americans, favor a 
$1.50-per-pack increase, Senator Kennedy's proposed increase, while only 39 percent oppose. 
When they were asked what would you do with the money that is raised, what do you think is a reasonable thing to do with these new tobacco revenues, they said additional health research on cancer, heart disease, and other tobacco-related illness. 
That is in this bill. That is exactly what we are setting out to do: 82 percent to fund antitobacco education programs--they think that is a good idea--81 percent, programs that are directed toward children to get them to stop smoking. 
So you see what we have here is an attempt to slow down the debate on an important piece of legislation that is literally historic. 
Eleven years ago, the Senator from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, and I embarked on a little project. I was a Member of the House at the time and he was here in the Senate. The two of us introduced and successfully passed legislation to ban smoking on airplanes. It was the first time the tobacco lobby lost on the floor of the House and the Senate in history. I was proud to be a part of that partnership with Senator Lautenberg, and am happy to serve with him today and to be part of this debate as well. 
How far we have come. Let us not miss this historic opportunity to pass the Kennedy amendment to make certain that the $1.50 increase will truly reduce the number of kids smoking to make certain that the goal of this legislation to protect our children is one that is served. The tobacco companies have spent billions of dollars to lure and addict these children. Do we have the courage on the floor of the Senate to beat back the filibuster and to muster the votes to protect those children and their families? I think we do. 
I rise in strong support of this legislation. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for it. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the Senator from Utah, I appreciated his oration and his irritation. He plays a valuable role in the Senate, and he raises issues that are important to all of us regardless of on which side of the aisle we fall. 
This amendment, sponsored by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, is one which we should understand what it stands for. This is an amendment to limit the attorneys' fees that will be payable to plaintiffs' attorneys who joined with all the States' attorneys general to bring the lawsuits against tobacco companies. 
Now, to paraphrase my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, the tobacco companies hate these attorneys like the Devil hates holy water. Were it not for these attorneys, there would be no McCain bill in the Chamber this week. Were it not for these attorneys, there would have been no State lawsuits. Were it not for these attorneys, these tobacco companies would continue to make billions of dollars, would continue to exploit our children, would continue to be the source of the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America month after month, year after year, and decade after decade. 
So it is no wonder that the Senator from North Carolina wants to get even with these attorneys. They have upset the applecart for Tobacco Row. These attorneys have joined with States' attorneys general, 42 of them, to bring lawsuits which have successfully brought the tobacco companies to their knees. And if this Senate has the courage this week that I hope it does, we will pass the most comprehensive historic legislation this Nation has ever seen to protect our children from continued exploitation by these tobacco companies. 
So here comes the Senator from North Carolina, and he says, well, I think it is only reasonable that we limit these attorneys to fees of no more than $250 an hour. At least I think that is what his amendment says; it has been written over a couple times. But I think that is what he ended up concluding. For most people in America, $250 an hour is an amazing amount of money. To anybody who would think about making $10,000 a week, that is an amazing amount of money. But, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about attorneys who are playing in the big leagues here. 
Isn't it interesting that all of his rancor and all of his anger about attorneys' fees only affect the fees that are being paid to attorneys who are fighting tobacco companies. I have searched this amendment, line for line and page for page, to find some limitation on the amount of money paid to the attorneys for the tobacco companies. No, not a single word of limitation. Pay them what you will. But the plaintiffs' attorneys, representing the children who are being exploited by these companies, the plaintiffs' attorneys who come in here representing flight attendants to try to make sure in a courtroom that they are protected from the kind of secondhand smoke that is damaging, those are the targets of the Senator from North Carolina. 
Isn't it an amazing thing that these tobacco companies, when they put their enemies list together, put at the very top these attorneys. Well, why did these State attorneys general bring in these private attorneys as part of the lawsuits? For one simple reason: They didn't have the resources in many States to really go after these tobacco giants, so they brought in the trial attorneys and they said, `If you are going to sue the tobacco firms, do it on a contingent basis. If you win the lawsuit, which has never been done--never been done--if you win the lawsuit, you will win a substantial fee. If you lose, you go home emptyhanded.' These attorneys said, `We will take it on; on a contingent fee basis, we will take it on.' And 
guess what. They are about to win. If we do the right thing, they will win. In at least four States, they have won. It just angers the tobacco companies to think that they are going to have to pay the fees of the attorneys who sued them. 
Why did we need these attorneys? Because, honestly, ladies and gentlemen, when it came to Congress, when it came to State legislatures, when it came to many Governors' offices, and, yes, even when it came to the White House year after year and time after time, the tobacco companies had a cozy relationship. They knew no one was going to go in and challenge them.

Mr. DURBIN. But in a courtroom, it is a different story. In a courtroom--I will when I finish; I will be happy to yield when I finish. In a courtroom, it is one attorney against another. It is a jury of peers, 12 Americans sitting in judgment, and that is when the tobacco companies are being brought to their knees. They could not buy it through lobbyists. They could not buy it through political contributions. They had to walk into a courtroom. And when it happened in 42 different States, they said, `It is time to settle. The game is over.' So naturally they are angry with these attorneys, these trial lawyers who have brought them to their knees. 
And think about the limitation of $250 an hour. Not a word about limiting the amount of money paid to the tobacco company attorneys, and certainly not one word about limiting the money paid to the tobacco company executives. Four years ago, do you remember that shameful scene when seven tobacco company executives, under oath, in the House of Representatives swore to God on a stack of Bibles that tobacco was not addictive? Tobacco is not addictive. Imagine they would say that. And these men, who were being paid millions of dollars a year by exploiting our children and selling their products, are not even mentioned in this amendment. 
Now, if we are going to work out some moral outrage about how much money we are going to pay people, then let us include not just trial lawyers. Let's include the attorneys for the tobacco companies. Let's include the tobacco company executives. Or let's call this amendment for what it is. This is an effort to get rid of the element that has brought the tobacco companies finally to this Senate floor and brought us finally to comprehensive legislation. 
I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many good reasons have been stated on the floor for the passage of this important legislation. I hold in my hand convincing evidence. It is an unsolicited e-mail sent to my Senate computer a few weeks ago. It boasts that they will offer for me to purchase 500 different bootleg video games from a person who says in this solicitation, `All the games I sell are pirated. I do not sell originals.' This business is operating across the United States, Canada, England, Australia, and claims to trade copies made in Hong Kong. 
When you think of the importance of intellectual property to America's exports and the importance of this business in terms of the United States and the world, it is clear that we need this legislation to stop this type of flagrant abuse, which I received and I am sure many others could receive if they surf the Internet. 
I commend Senators Hatch, Leahy, Ashcroft, and so many others. I urge its unanimous passage and yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to stand in support of this legislation. Senator Grassley and I have worked on it, but I want to give him the lion's share of the credit because this was his notion, his concept, and he has developed it into a very good piece of legislation. 
We work closely together on these bankruptcy issues, and for those who are interested in bankruptcy stay tuned; there is more to follow. But I think you will find this bill noncontroversial and certainly one everyone should be able to support. 
The bottom line here is whether or not you are dealing with a fraudulent conveyance. Someone in anticipation of bankruptcy may give away money and it is said by the court that you cannot do that; if you are going to give money away for nothing, then we are going to come back later on in the bankruptcy court and recover it. But Senator Grassley has pointed out, I think appropriately, the situation where people give money to a charity or a church, and he says that should be considered in a different category. And I agree. As he has mentioned in the opening statement, there is a limitation in the law of 15 percent of your annual income that can be given in this fashion. So we don't anticipate any type of abuse in this area. 
I thank Senator Grassley. It is a pleasure to serve with him and work with him. We have more to follow on the bankruptcy issue, but I am anxious to encourage my Democratic colleagues today to join with us in voting for this legislation.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might say in response to my friend, the Senator from Maryland, I agree with him completely. We now know that the caseload in bankruptcy courts has been growing every single year. It really taxes the system, and if not in this legislation, in the following bill I hope we will provide the resources to make sure the bankruptcy courts can respond.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I hope that we put it in context. This is an important procedure that Senators Feinstein and D'Amato bring to the floor. It addresses the issue of mastectomy. It makes certain that women and families have peace of mind when they face that procedure. I don't think there is going to be any opposition to that bill, and there should not be. 
The Senator from South Dakota makes a point--and I think we 
should make the point--that in this debate there are many other potential injustices, and injustices in the health care system. One should consider the fact that most Americans say, first and foremost, they want to choose their own doctors, and many women say, `I want to be able to make certain during the course of my pregnancy that I have a doctor, an obstetrician who I can be confident in, and one who will give me advice every time I come in for a visit.' There are families who worry that when their children are brought into a doctor's office, they will be referred to the right specialist, the one best for that child. They don't want that decision being made by an insurance company. They want it being made by a doctor. 
The irony here is that we are saying doctors should make that decision. These doctors who have been chosen by the insurance companies to be part of their plans should be trusted, and their judgment should be trusted. What the Senator from South Dakota is saying is, let's move forward on the Feinstein bill, on this important mastectomy protection; but let's extend this protection to so many other Americans and families and women in other circumstances who are being disadvantaged by insurance companies and HMOs that are unresponsive to families and their needs. 
I think the Senator from South Dakota puts a challenge to the Senate today. Will we do one small, but important, part? Or will we take a look at the whole picture and make certain that we can return home after this session with the kind of legislation that the American people will support? I hope the Republicans will join us. This ought to be bipartisan. What is the controversy here when we say patients and their families should come first, and protecting the patients when it comes to important medical decisions? 
I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I hope we can get the assurance from the Republican leadership today that we will not only consider the Feinstein-D'Amato bill, but also the patient protection that Senators Daschle and Kennedy will offer.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, for cosponsoring this bill with Senator Hollings. 
A little over a year ago, I received a letter in my Senatorial office in Illinois from a young woman who owned a business right outside the City of Chicago. She told a story of having her long-distance carrier changed without her permission, how it ended up costing her over $1,000, and she came to learn there was virtually nothing she could do about it. The recourse under the law currently available was not practical--that she would somehow hire an attorney and go to Federal court over $1,000. That wasn't going to happen. She asked me what could we do about it, so I prepared a piece of legislation, and a large part of it has been incorporated in this good bill, and I am happy to support this bill. 
Since then, I have come to learn that hers was not an isolated example. Any group of people you talk to, regardless of their walk of life, who have a telephone at home, will generally tell you that they know somebody or they personally have been victims of slamming. How do they end up having their long-distance carrier changed? Some of them might have been unsuspecting. They went to a carnival or county fair or neighborhood picnic, and they had a little thing handed to them. It said, `Win a free trip to Hawaii. Fill in your name and address and check the box in the bottom.' They didn't flip it 
over to see the other side that said, `You just changed your long-distance carrier.' 
It would happen time and time again. Folks would get these interminable telephone calls at night saying, `Would you consider moving to this new service?' They say, `No, no, there is no way.' It turns out they were being taped. People were splicing together the tapes. When it was all said and done, they took the spliced tapes, and said the person said `yes' when they asked about the long-distance service, but the person said `yes' when they asked about the name. 
It turns out a lot of people were being defrauded, and it cost a lot of money, not just for the lady who came to see me and her business, but many others. This is theft. This is stealing. This is not gaming we are dealing with here; it is a situation where a lot of people are making money without the permission of those whose long-distance service is being changed. 
I went up to the State of Maine with my colleague, Senator Collins, who spoke earlier on the floor, for a hearing on the subject and found it was literally a national problem. From the coast of Maine to California and everything in between, people were going through this and we didn't have the laws in place to protect the consumers. That is why this bill is so important--because this bill finally gives to the consumer an opportunity to say to the person who is slamming them, `You are not going to get away with it.' 
One of the amendments which Senator McCain was nice enough to adopt and make part of the bill was offered by Senator Collins and myself. It said you will never be charged more than what your original long distance carrier would have charged you. So if somebody comes along and doubles your rate without your permission, you still don't have to pay anything more than what was in the original rate structure with your original long-distance carrier. I think that makes sense. I think it is only fair. 
The other amendment which we pushed for, the second amendment, creates criminal penalties which are necessary for the most egregious slammers. These are not little companies with little ideas; these are devious groups with a network of information which are trying to set up a network of people across the United States who will be changed to their long-distance service just long enough for them to make some money. 
You should have seen the hearing that Senator Collins had before the Government Affairs Committee, where she presented a bill from one of these companies to the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. She posted it up on the board, and she said to the Chairman: `Take a look at this long-distance bill from a slamming company and tell me one thing. What is the name of the company?' 
The Chairman took a look at it, and he said, `I don't see any name of the company up there.' You know what? The name of the company was Long Distance Charges. So, when you are going through your telephone bill and you are looking at your local carrier who sent it to you, and you get to a page which reads `Long Distance Charges,' it never dawns on you that you are no longer receiving long-distance service from your old carrier. You have a new carrier called Long Distance Charges, and you didn't notice that your long-distance bill just went up. That is the kind of chicanery and trickery these people are guilty of. They make millions of dollars at it. As a consequence, we have to treat them with the criminal penalty which is included in this bill. 
I want to make an additional point about the criminal penalties amendment. Creating a criminal statute for slamming in no way lessens the applicability of existing laws such as wire fraud or mail fraud that can help combat slamming, too. Rather, this criminal statute for slamming will make it easier for prosecutors, because it applies specifically to this crime. 
Finally, a third amendment agreed to by Senator McCain will require telecommunications carriers to report the number of slamming complaints they receive about each company to the FCC. We know the incidence of slamming is on the rise. We have no way of tracking them. This will establish it. Slamming has already caused telephone customers to become angry and disillusioned with the entire telecommunications industry. These consumers have voiced their concerns to their local phone companies, to their State regulatory bodies, to the FCC. But they feel their complaints have not been heard. 
With this legislation, we can begin to restore confidence in the industry and assure consumers that the deceptive practice of slamming will be stopped. Long-distance telephone consumers should be able to stand up for themselves and fight back against slammers, to let them know their actions will not pay. 
You have heard, during the course of this debate, lengthy statistics about the nature of the problem. I will not repeat them, only to tell you that it is a serious problem addressed in a serious way by this legislation. 
In closing, one small footnote: The outrage of slamming has now been replaced in complaints to my office by the outrage of cramming. It turns out in the lengthy telephone bill you received there may be an item which looks innocent enough for two or three dollars for something you never ordered. Who is going to go through the telephone bill and analyze every line? But unless you do, you may find yourself in a predicament where they are cramming in charges you never asked for. 
You are paying three bucks a month every month of the year for something you didn't ask for. How are you going to find it? You have to take the time to read through it. We want to make sure we address that abuse as well. 
Today, though, we are addressing in a responsible way a very serious problem that affects consumers across America. I salute Senator McCain, as well as Senator Hollings, who have joined me in this effort through investigations, as well as in preparation of amendments to this very good bill. I am happy to support it. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Chicago Board of Trade, the most influential marketplace for futures trading in the world, on the 150th anniversary of its establishment. I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, in introducing a resolution commemorating this momentous occasion. 
On April 3, 1848, 83 merchants who realized that the grain trade was growing rapidly, came together to form a marketplace for grains and livestock. Thus, the world's largest futures and options trading facility was born, bringing buyers and sellers from all walks of life together under one roof for the first time. 
With the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade came a financial industry which has spread around the world over the last 150 years. The Chicago Board of Trade has been a vital part of Chicago since the first railroad, telegraph lines, and the digging of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The Board has weathered through a Civil War, the great Chicago fire, The Great Depression, World War I and II, and countless other struggles. 
The Chicago Board of Trade is a powerful economic engine that generates 150,000 jobs throughout the Chicagoland area and also produces $35 billion in bank deposits each year. Over the years, the Chicago Board of Trade has grown beyond grain and livestock, and has branched out into soybean futures, corn options, and wheat options. Last year, the Chicago Board of Trade set the record for the trading of soybean futures traded. The Chicago Board of Trade also established records for the trading soybean meal, and soybean oil. 
Mr. President, it has been a long time since the days when prices were shouted through a cloud of dust on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. The Board has relocated several times throughout its 150 years. Currently, the Board is located in downtown Chicago. The base of the building spans an entire city block, and is a Chicago landmark. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chicago Board of Trade on 150 years of bringing economic vitality to Chicago, the State of Illinois, and the world.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the people of Israel and all my friends in the American Jewish community on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel. 
This significant milestone in Israel's history offers all of us an opportunity to reflect on what makes that country so special. Israel remains the most important U.S. ally in the Middle East and the only multiparty democracy in the region. The strong and stable friendship between our two countries, built on a solid foundation of shared values, mutual support and trust, is in the fundamental interest of both nations. Ensuring the security of Israel will remain one of our most important foreign policy priorities. 
Transcending political considerations, however, are the profound ties with Israel and pride in its accomplishments felt by Jews worldwide. The State of Israel was created in the wake of the Holocaust and the tragic deaths of more than 6,000,000 Jews. Israeli society and its democratic institutions have been forged under the most difficult historical circumstances imaginable. Israel continues today to embody the aspirations of Jews from the northernmost villages of the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union to the tip of South America. The struggle of all Jews helped to create the State of Israel, and all Jews have reason to celebrate the country's 50th birthday. 
It is my hope that Israel's next 50 years will see the establishment of a permanent and secure peace in the Middle East, with Israel and its Arab neighbors working together to build a better future for all the citizens of the region. This would truly fulfill Israel's promise and its destiny.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me rise and first thank the Appropriations Committee for the work on this bill. 
I will not be able to vote for it for two reasons. First, I find it interesting that after a week of debate in this Chamber and a lengthy discussion about America's role in world leadership, we follow this historic vote on the enlargement of NATO with an appropriations bill which fails to appropriate funds for our Nation's obligation to the United Nations. It is a source of embarrassment to our Nation that Congress continues to fail to meet its responsibility to the United Nations. A great nation should pay its bills. 
Let me also add to what the Senator from California said. If you look at this bill on page 69, section 3009, you will find a provision that has never been in a House bill and never been in a Senate bill that comes in here at the last minute on an emergency spending bill. It is a rider which will give to oil companies some $65 million in breaks for oil and gas that they are taking off of public lands--lands owned by taxpayers. 
Last year, we passed a budget agreement with a provision in it for a $50 billion tax break for tobacco companies. We went back home and were embarrassed by it, came back and rescinded it. I'm afraid we are returning home to face more embarrassment for this provision which, unfortunately, provides a break to oil companies at the expense of taxpayers. 
For the fiscal conservative listening, this money is not set off by any cuts in spending. This gives to the oil companies, pure and simple, $65 million out of the Treasury, at taxpayers' expense. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to speak in morning business on an issue that I believe is of great importance to many families across the United States. It is the question of health care. 
Many people watch the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and wonder what this debate in the operations of this body have to do with their lives. They look at the bills and wonder who has written them and how it can affect them, and many times just write it all off as politics. But the issue I am about to speak to and the issue which I believe should be part of our legislative agenda is the issue of health care. 
Mr. President, we are in a state of crisis in this country, a crisis of confidence over America's health care system. A majority of the American people no longer believe their insurance companies are providing them with the quality of service or choice of doctors they were promised when they paid their premiums. Eighty percent of American consumers believe that insurance plans often compromise the quality of care to save money. Ninety percent of Americans say a patient protection act to regulate health insurance plans is needed. Such an act has been introduced, and we are hoping that we can bring it to the floor for consideration before we adjourn, because we have precious few days left this year to consider important legislation. 
Unfortunately in America some health insurers have put cost savings before life savings. Such cost-cutting practices are only inviting tragedy. 
I brought to the floor today a photograph of a couple from the Chicago area, the Garvey family. I would like to tell you the story of this typical American family and what happened to Mrs. Garvey on a vacation to Hawaii. Barbara Garvey, a wife and mother of seven from Chicago, suffered from severe arthritis. During a once-in-a-lifetime vacation with friends to Hawaii, Mrs. Garvey discovered some bruises on her body. She was worried. She was immediately sent to the hospital and examined. After examination, there was a diagnosis that she was suffering from aplastic anemia. 
There she was in Hawaii, thousands of miles from home, with a friend, with this terrible diagnosis. Doctors in Hawaii decided the only option was to perform an emergency bone-marrow transplant. Both Mrs. Garvey's HMO doctor in Chicago and the attending physician in Hawaii agreed that with no immune system and no ability to clot, a commercial flight back home to Chicago to receive treatment would put her at great risk for infection and stroke. 
Imagine, there you are, thousands of miles away from home, told that you have to face this emergency bone-marrow transplant and you can't move; you have to do it now. And if you do not, you could have serious consequences. 
They advised Mrs. Garvey to receive this emergency treatment as quickly as possible in Hawaii. Her insurance policy covered it. It wasn't a matter of debating that. But when she called the HMO that managed the policy, they refused to accept any treatment in Hawaii. The clerk at the HMO said to Mrs. Garvey she had to travel back from Hawaii to Illinois for this treatment. They wouldn't pay for it unless she did. And it is very expensive. She didn't have the ability to pay for the expensive treatment. 
So she made the only decision she could. She got back on the airplane to come back to Chicago. On the plane, as predicted by her treating physician, Mrs. Garvey suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed on her right side, robbing her of her ability to speak. She was left too weak and unstable to even undergo the bone-marrow transplant. She developed an infection and after 9 days at a Chicago Hospital, Barbara Garvey died of a cerebral hemorrhage and complications. 
She was 55 years old, on a Hawaiian vacation, in need of emergency medical treatment, but the decision by an HMO clerk cost her her life. She left behind her husband Dave, seven children, and numerous grandchildren. 
I might say to my colleagues in the Senate and those listening, this should not happen in America. Health insurers should not make decisions that are best left to doctors and trained health professionals. 
Mr. President, we should take up and pass meaningful patient protection this year in Congress. We have a bill, S. 1890, the patient's bill of rights, that would prevent tragedies like this from happening. The bill would allow for both an independent appeals process and for legal accountability for medical decisions made by health insurers. Without such accountability, insurers have no incentive to provide necessary and timely care to people such as Barbara Garvey when they need it the most. 
It may surprise some people to learn that many HMO plans across the country, if your doctor says he wants you to receive treatment, require you to call the insurance company. If the insurance company says no, no, we don't cover that treatment or we won't give it the way the doctor wants it, and you go ahead and follow the insurance company's lead and something bad occurs, guess who is held accountable. Guess who is liable in court. The insurance company? In many instances, no. The doctor, the doctor who really wanted to do it differently, who thought it was best for you and your family to receive a different treatment, ends up the person holding the bag. 
That is not fair. We should each be accountable for our conduct, and in this situation no doctor should be held accountable for a decision that was made by the insurance 
company. The insurance company should stand on its own feet. 
Now, we only have a few days remaining in the session. It is hard to believe that in April we are talking about leaving, but it is going to be an abbreviated session for reasons that are beyond me. The political leaders have decided it is time for us to get out of town. They think we have about 60 days to act and don't have much time to consider many issues. I hope that we don't leave town without thinking a little bit about this issue, an issue which most Americans are seriously concerned about, the quality of health care and the accountability of HMO's. Whatever we are going to do will not alleviate the pain the Garveys have endured, but we can fix the system. We can save families the pain of losing a loved one because some insurance companies put business before wellness. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Kansas for his remarks. It is always a great education to listen to his statements on the floor. Though we may not agree on any particulars, I certainly do respect him very much and have enjoyed our service together both in the House and the Senate. 
I stand this morning not to give a long speech, even by Senate standards, but I would like to say I hope all Members of the Senate will put this debate into its historical context. This may be one of the most important foreign policy debates of the decade. It is to determine the future of the U.S. relationship with a new Europe, a Europe after the cold war. 
Since 1949, the United States understood, particularly through the NATO alliance, our relationship with Europe. We defined that relationship in specific terms and committed not only the United States on paper but, in fact, at one point stationed some 300,000 Americans in Europe, in an effort to make certain that that sector of the world will continue to be safe from any type of aggression or invasion. 
When I think back on my own life and all of the concerns of the cold war, it focused primarily on the possibility that the Soviet Union might expand through some manner through its Warsaw Pact nations into the a NATO alliance and force us to respond. It was a concern that cost us lives, it cost us money, and it really was the focus of our foreign policy for many, many decades. 
With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union, as we knew it, and the emergence of countries in Eastern and Central Europe, formerly part of the Soviet orbit, we now are in a position to redefine the U.S. position in the world. There are some people who naturally tend toward the American tradition of isolationism. We are pretty far away from these countries. `Perhaps we shouldn't be concerned about them,' they will say. `Let them worry about their own future, we have our own concerns here.' But, we have heard that response many times in our past, and the Americans, by and large, have rejected it. We understand we are part of the world community. In fact, we are viewed by most nations of the world as a major leader, an example, in many instances, of democracy and a country which most nations choose to emulate. 
I found it interesting, when the wall came down in Berlin and the Eastern and Central European countries started emerging as democracies, how many of the new leaders made a point of coming not to London, not to Paris, but to Washington, DC, in the hopes that they might address a joint meeting of Congress. To them, it was a validation that the new Czech Republic and the new Poland was going to embark on a democratic experiment, and coming here to this building in Washington, DC, was really shown to be a break from the past; that they would separate themselves from the past and their connection with the Eastern powers, with communism, with the old Soviet Union, and dedicate themselves to democracy. 
Now we have the natural evolution of their emergence as democracies and our natural evolution as a leader in today's world. We are debating on the floor of the Senate the question of enlarging the NATO alliance to include newcomers, to include nations which just a few years ago were perceived as potential enemies and now we see as allies. What a refreshing change in this world that a nation like Poland, which we identify with certainty in my home State of Illinois and the city of Chicago very closely, that a nation like Poland now has a chance to join us as close allies. 
I listened carefully as some of my colleagues talked about the attitudes in these nations about the possibility of NATO membership. Make no mistake, if you visit these countries, that is all they talk about--the possibility that at some point in time, they will be part of the NATO alliance. 
This is an exciting prospect for them, not so much because they anticipate some military invasion or the need for military defense, but rather because they see this alliance with the United States and with other NATO allies as an assurance that they are committed to many things, to democracy, to a free market and, most importantly, to the principles of NATO. 
It is interesting, this alliance, in our world's history, is a unique one because for 50 years this was not an aggressive alliance, this was a defensive alliance. We basically said we respect others' boundaries as we expect them to respect ours and we are not setting out to invade and claim territory but merely to protect our own. It was a defensive alliance. It has been throughout history. And that is its future as well. 
As other countries come in--Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic--they accept the premise. The premise is, you are on board as an alliance to protect our borders and to try our best to maintain stability in this new and developing world. I think that is the bottom line here. It is no longer a fight against ideology or even the aggression of some superpower but rather the stability of the region. 
Is that stability important to the United States? I think it is critical to the United States. In just a few months we are going to see the creation of the Eurodollar, or the Eurocurrency, which is going to be perhaps one of the more dominant currencies in the world. We will see the European nations by and large coming together as an economic unit as a major competitor to the United States, and at the same time we will see opportunities in Europe for American firms. 
If we are going to engender this relationship, this free market economy and this new democracy, it is entirely consistent for us to build an alliance with these countries through NATO. 
I hear some of my colleagues arguing against the expansion of NATO, and as I listened carefully, they are actually arguing against the existence of NATO. I hope they are not. To pause on reflection, it has been one of the most successful military alliances in our Nation's history, perhaps in the history of the world. And it is important for us to maintain NATO and to expand it. 
I watched carefully the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, just an hour or two ago. I read it carefully, and I thought, does this amendment, which seeks to spell out the parameters of the expansion of NATO, in any way preclude the possibility that one day Russia would join NATO? Well, it does not, because it speaks in terms of principles and goals and values. 
I think when we talk about the nervousness in Russia about the expansion of NATO, we should put it in historical context. The Russians have gone through a major transformation in a very short period of time. Once considered a superpower and a major leader in the world, they are now struggling to redefine themselves in the 21st century. 
I know this causes angst and pain among many Russian leaders who can recall, I am sure with fondness, days of empire. But the fact is, it is a new world and a new opportunity, and they have a chance for a new relationship. A new and expanded NATO is no threat to Russia. A new and expanded NATO is an invitation to Russia to join us in the same principles and values. I think that should be our view, our vision of the new world. 
When I hear about this Russian concern and nervousness, I 
really hope they will take the time to consider the history of this alliance, which has been a peaceful alliance, a defensive alliance. 
Let me speak for a moment before I close about the Baltic States. I always confess my prejudice when I come to this issue. My mother was born in Lithuania. So when I speak of the Baltic States, it is with some particular personal feeling. I have visited Lithuania on four our five different occasions and have also visited Latvia and Estonia. 
I did not believe in my lifetime that I would see the changes that have taken place in those three tiny countries. When I first visited Lithuania back in 1978 or 1979, it was under Soviet domination, and it was a rather sad period in the history of that country. The United States said for decades that we never recognized the Soviet takeover of the Baltic States. We always believed them to be independent nations that were unfortunately invaded and taken over by the Soviets. 
When I went to visit them in 1979, I saw the efforts of the Soviet Union to impose upon the people in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia the Russian culture. They expatriated so many of the local people and sent them off to Siberia and places in the far reaches of Russia; and then they sent their own populations, the Russian cultural population, those speaking the Russian language, into the Baltic States in an effort to try to homogenize them into some entity that was more Russian than it was Baltic. 
But it did not work. The people maintained--zealously maintained--their own culture, and they kept their own religion, their own language, and their own literature and their own dreams. I did not imagine in my lifetime that I would ever see these Baltic States once again free, and yet I lived to see that happen. 
In fact, at one point I was sent as a member of a delegation by then-Speaker of the House Tom Foley to witness the first democratic election in Lithuania. The Soviets refused to give me a visa. I sat in Berlin day after weary day waiting for a chance to get in. And finally I was only able to be there the day of the election, that evening for the celebration. But I was there for an important moment, and I am glad I saw it. 
Today these three nations are trying their best to become mature economies, to watch their democracies flourish. And they have ample evidence of real progress. The fact that they would entertain the possibility of being part of NATO should not be a source of concern to us but one of great hope and great optimism, because as countries like Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and so many others that were either part of the Warsaw Pact or even Soviet republics become part of NATO, they really show this transformation and this progression into a democratic form and a new democratic vision in Europe. 
One of the resolutions being offered by one of my colleagues wants to single out the Baltic States as if they are the real concern of Russia. If you took a look at a map of the world and saw the huge expanse of Russia today, and then took a look at these three tiny nations, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it is almost laughable that the Russians would look to them as any threat to their future or to their security. They are small nations with very small armies and virtually no sophisticated military forces. What they are asking for is a chance to flourish, and I think they should have that chance. 
So I close by saying that I hope my colleagues in the Senate who have followed this debate will understand its historic importance and understand that those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate and have a chance to vote on this question of NATO enlargement may be casting a vote on foreign policy that is going to be viewed for generations to come as a milestone--the end of the cold war, the new vision of the world, the new definition of an alliance involving the United States and freedom-loving democracies in Europe that led to stability and to growth. That is my vision of the world. That is my vision of NATO enlargement. 
I hope that a majority of my colleagues will join me in supporting President Clinton and supporting virtually all of these nations that are asking for NATO to be enlarged to reflect this new vision. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great 20th century American family from the state of Illinois--the J.P. `Cotton' Knox family. Through the industrial age, the Great Depression, two world wars, and presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, the Knox family has spanned the American Century. We take a moment today to reflect on their history and their contribution to our nation. 
It all began with J.P. `Cotton' Knox, born November 16, 1880, and his wife Esther Loretta Knox, born April 11, 1885--both in Sangamon County, Illinois. They started courting at the turn of the century, married in 1907 and lived on a small farm west of Curran in Sangamon County where J.P. shucked corn by hand in the moonlight. 
During the first quarter of the 20th century, the family grew rapidly. Thomas Dickerson, J.P. and Esther's first child, was born July 8, 1908. James Donald came next on November 24, 1909 and was followed by Kathryn Loretta on May 9, 1912, John Louis on July 23, 1914, Charles Carroll on November 21, 1916, Lawrence William on January 26, 1919, Howard Eugene on March 29, 1921, Paul Edward on January 18, 1923, and Joseph Patrick on February 10, 1925. Each child was born healthy and at home except for Howard Eugene, who was born in the hospital because of a scarlet fever epidemic. 
In the second quarter of the 20th century, the family struggled through the Great Depression along with the rest of the nation. Kathryn had grown old enough that she was able to serve as relief pitcher and back-up quarterback for her mother. J.P. was elected Coroner of Sangamon County in 1932 and instilled in his children the importance of voting because it was a duty and a privilege as an American. 
Perhaps the most remarkable chapter in the family's history came when the United States entered World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Thomas, the oldest, was 33 and married with three children when the war began. As CEO of Doyle Freight Lines based in Saginaw, Michigan, he was declared an essential man in an essential industry. The Governor of Michigan appointed him as coordinator of transporting supplies to military bases in certain Midwest states. After the war, he was listed in Who's Who in the Midwest. 
The other brothers, one by one, joined the military, even though some could have remained on the homefront. Lawrence, who worked in the FBI in Washington, was exempt from military service but chose to enlist in the Marines. Joseph was the last child left home with J.P. and Esther. He could have applied for a deferment but chose to serve with the approval of his parents. Three weeks after graduating from high school in 1943, he was in the Navy. Carroll was the only brother who did not go overseas, and served as a medical corpsman in the Navy in San Diego, California. Of the seven brothers who served, three were in the Navy, three in the Army and one in the Marines. 
J.P. and Esther would have been all alone had it not been for Kathryn and her three children who lived with them when Kathryn's husband joined the Navy. Kathryn provided tremendous support to her parents, who had a lot to worry about with six of their eight sons in harm's way. She kept their morale high until, amazingly, all seven of the Knox boys in the military returned home safely with honorable discharges after the war. Combined, they gave 20 years, six months of service, including nearly 13 years overseas. 
The third quarter of the 20th century had just begun when J.P. passed away in 1951. He was eulogized with a one-quarter page editorial by V.Y. Dallman, editor of the Illinois State Register in Springfield, Illinois. Esther passed away in 1972. All nine children were employed in various fields and raising families of their own. Joseph followed in his father's political footsteps, serving several terms as Clerk of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County and Public Health Commissioner for the City of Springfield. To this day, he insists the voters were not voting for him, but rather for the Knox family. His was simply the name that happened to be on the ballot. 
In the last quarter of the 20th century, three of the Knox children passed away--Thomas in 1986, Howard in 1987 and Louis in 1993. Six siblings remain--all in reasonably good health.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Marin Turcinovic of Croatia and his wife Corina DeChalup of France. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Marin and Corina, affording them the legal security they need to rebuild their lives in this country. 
Marin Turcinovic first arrived in the United States from Croatia in January 1990. He was admitted on an H-1 visa as a member of the band Libertas. On February 8, 1990, during the period of his authorized stay, Marin was hit by a car in Fairview, New Jersey. Both his legs were shattered. His spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed below the neck. He will probably never walk again. His then-fiancee, Corina DeChalup of France, immediately came to the United States. Both Marin and Corina have been in the United States since their initial entries, and neither now has legal status. 
Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance settlement from the car accident litigation provides Marin with lifetime medical and rehabilitative care, in a specially modified house located in the Beverly community of Chicago. According to Marin's lawyers, the insurance settlement that provides for Marin's lifetime shelter and medical care would not cover him at another location. A medical malpractice suit against the doctors who initially provided care to Marin is pending. 
Corina and Marin married in February 1996, 6 years after his accident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been with Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in coordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for Marin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now enjoys without her support. 
Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as a tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are primarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-time employment and would like to obtain authorization to work. 
According to Marin and Corina's lawyer, Corina has no way to legally gain permanent resident status in the U.S. Because she entered the U.S. under the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject to an order of deportation, without the right to an administrative hearing, once she overstayed her 90-day authorized admission in February 1990. Since 1994, she has received a stay of deportation in 1-year increments. She cannot currently travel to see her family in France, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from 1 year to the next. 
Marin was placed in deportation proceedings in 1997 at his request. This allowed him to seek a suspension of deportation, a legal remedy that in the past has resulted in permanent resident status. Although Marin's application was granted, the grant is conditional. If Marin's grant does not fall within the annual quota set by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, it is unclear to what status he will revert. There is a possibility that Marin would be issued an order of voluntary departure. 
Corina's status depends on Marin. If granted permanent resident status, Marin will be able to petition for Corina, but she will face a 4- to 5-year wait before qualifying for resident status, herself. 
Mr. President, 8 years ago, fate tragically changed forever the lives Marin Turcinovic of Croatia and Corina DeChalup of France. A terrible accident in the United States left Marin permanently injured, making his return home impossible. Fortunately for Marin, he had the love and support of Corina, without whom he may not have made it this far. Given the tremendous adversity that Marin and Corina already face on a day-to-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress to grant them permanent resident status. Such status would clear up much of the uncertainly that currently clouds their future, and would allow Marin and Corina to rebuild their lives in our country with confidence.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Chaffee, Reed and Boxer, to introduce the Child Firearm Access Prevention Act. 
The tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, AR, last week raises many questions. Two come to mind immediately. Why do children kill? I do not know the answer to that. I have heard a variety of opinions from people who suggest that violent television and violent movies are somehow contributing to this. There are others who say, if the children would just pray in school, it would make all the difference in the world. Some look to the families more than the schools; others think the schools have a greater role to play. 
We will debate this at length, and I am sure many of us will come up with a lot of different explanations as to why children reach the point in their young lives where they would take the life of another. 
But the tragedy in Jonesboro raised another question which I think we can address because it is a simpler question. How do children at that young age come to possess lethal weapons? Think about it. An 11-year-old and a 13-year-old with 10 firearms--rifles, shotguns, and handguns, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition--went into the woods behind that middle school, tricked the students out with a fake fire alarm, opened fire and shot off somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 rounds before they were finally stopped. 
Four little girls were killed. A teacher, who deserves all of our recognition and praise for her courage, stood in the line of fire to protect one of those little girls and lost her own life. This teacher, the mother of a 2-year-old, lost her life defending her students. 
How do kids come into possession of firearms? They do not buy them. In most States it is unthinkable that they would even approach a counter and try. And yet, day after day in America there is further evidence of children, younger and younger, being found with firearms. 
The day after the Jonesboro, AR, tragedy, in Cleveland, OH, a 4-year-old showed up at a day-care center with a loaded handgun. 
In my home State of Illinois, in Marion, IL, a high school student showed up at school the next day with a handgun. 
In Daly City, CA, the day after Jonesboro, a 13-year-old was arrested for attempting to murder his principal with a semiautomatic pistol. 
There is something we can do about this. I am not sure that it will solve the problem completely, but it can help. Fifteen States have already recognized this problem and done something about it. These States have passed a child access prevention law which is known as a CAP law, saying to those who purchase and own handguns, it is not enough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use those guns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access to it. 
And these laws are effective. Florida was the first state to pass a CAP law in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of children dropped by 50 percent. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 1997 found that there was a 23% decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those states that had implemented CAP laws. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, if all 50 states had CAP laws during the period of 1990-1994, 216 children might have lived. 
Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the obvious answer is yes, because the tragedy in Jonesboro, which we will not forget for a long, long time, unfortunately, is not unique. Every day in America 14 young people, ages 19 and under, are killed in gun homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, with many more wounded. 
The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most helpless members of our society--our children. 
Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will apply to every State, not just 15, but every State. And this is what it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely. 
You may buy a trigger lock. Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin has a proposal that all handguns be sold with trigger locks. I support it. I am a cosponsor of it. It makes sense. 
How many times do you read in the paper, how many times do you listen on TV, to kids with their playmates and the gun goes off and someone is killed? A trigger lock, as Senator Kohl has proposed, is sensible. It should be required. It shouldn't even be debated. I think that legislation will go a long way toward reducing gun violence. 
But beyond that proposal, the legislation I propose today, says to every gunowner, if it is not a trigger lock, put that gun in a place where that child cannot get to it. 
As to these two kids, 11 and 13 years old, God only knows what was going through their minds when they were setting out to get the guns to go out and start shooting. They first stopped at the parents of one of the kids and wanted to pick up that parents' guns. That parent had the guns under lock and key in a vault and they couldn't get to them. So they thought about it and said, wait a minute, my grandfather has some, too; let's go over to his place. And that is where they came up with the weapons and the ammunition. 
In one instance, one parent had taken the necessary steps to take the guns and keep them away from kids. Sadly, it appears--and I just say `appears' because I do not know all the details--in another case that did not happen. 
Now a lot of people will say to me, `There they go again, those liberals on Capitol Hill. Another bill, another law to infringe on second amendment rights.' Oh, I know I will hear from the folks from the National Rifle Association, all the other gun lobbies, screaming bloody murder about the second amendment. 
But look at the 15 States that have already passed these child access prevention laws, to protect kids, to say to gun owners `you have a special responsibility.' You will not find a list of the most liberal States in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was Florida. The list goes on: Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, and in 1995, the last State to pass a child access prevention law, certainly no bleeding heart State by any political definition, was Texas. The Texas law says it is `unlawful to store, transport or abandon an unsecured firearm in a place where children are likely to be and can obtain access to it,' and it is a criminal misdemeanor if you do it. 
I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate to not only return home during this recess and to not only witness those sad events on television--the funerals in Jonesboro, the tributes--but to also resolve to do something about it. That is what we are here for. That is why we were elected to the Senate and the House, not just to be sad as we should be, but to do something about it. Not to infringe on people's right to own firearms, but to say `Own them responsibly, put them securely in your homes, keep them safely, keep them away from children.' 
Mark my words, my friends, and you know this from human experience, no matter where you hide a gun or a Christmas gift, a kid is going to find it. You can stick it in a drawer and say, `Oh, they will never look behind my socks, that is the last place in the world,' or up on some shelf in the closet and believe your child can't reach that, but you know better. You know when you are gone and the house is empty those kids are scurrying around and looking in those hiding places. So I hope we can address this issue. 
First, Senator Kohl's legislation for these child safety devices, these trigger 
locks, will help. But then take the extra step, follow these 15 States and enact a federal law. 
But please, let this Senate and this House, before we leave this year, do something to make certain that those troubled children cannot get their hands on a firearm. I think every parent in America, particularly those of children of school age, paused at least for a moment after they heard about Jonesboro and thought, could it happen to my son, my daughter, my grandson, my granddaughter? The sad reality of life in modern America, is, yes, it could. There are so many weapons being kept so carelessly that it could happen to any of us or any of our children in virtually any school in America. 
Mr. President, I know that the Senate has a very busy schedule and limited opportunity this year, but I hope as part of our work we will let the lesson of the tragedy of Jonesboro result in legislation that will be designed to protect children and schoolteachers and innocent people in the future.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution. Members of the Senate and the House often wonder about America and the districts and States, and try to perceive the issues that American families really care about. I invite the Members of the Senate to go to the movie theater and see `As Good As It Gets,' with the top actor award going to Jack Nicholson and the top actress award going to Helen Hunt. At one point in this movie, Helen Hunt, the mother of an asthmatic child, vents on her beliefs about HMOs and managed care. Do you know what happens in movie theaters across America? They break out in applause--applauding the fact that this poor woman on the screen is struggling with an asthmatic child and is caught up with the bureaucracy of managed care. 
I will concede the point made by the Senator from New Mexico. Managed care is designed to reduce costs. The people who manage these systems are trying to reduce costs, reduce services, and, of course, maximize their profits. The resolution offered by the Senator from Massachusetts looks at it from the perspective of the patient, of the family, and of the physician. Are we going to speak to that as well? 
This goes beyond the bottom line. This goes to a basic question. If I go into a doctor's office with my wife, myself, or one of my children, can I trust that doctor giving me advice based on his medical education and the science that he has available? Or is he telling me that the option for my family is one dictated by some manual, some code, some book out of a managed care office in some part of the country that bears no relationship to my personal need? 
That is what this is about--the trust that we need to restore so patients seeing doctors know they are getting medical advice and not insurance recommendations. 
Second, accountability--that these managed care plans are held accountable. Today, they dictate to doctors what they will do, the procedures that are allowed, where they will take place, and how long they will last. Forget the patient. We are talking about the bottom line. When they make a mistake--and sometimes these mistakes are fatal--they are not held accountable under the law. 
What Senator Kennedy is suggesting here is not only restoring the trust between doctors and patients but also restoring accountability in the system. So that when the managed care clerk off somewhere in Omaha, NE, pages through the manual to decide your fate in that hospital bed they are held accountable--not just for the bottom line but what happens to your health, your family, and your future. 
I am glad we are having this debate. I think this is just the opening salvo. 
For those who think everybody is rosy in America, American families could care less, and managed care is all perfect, please take a trip to the movie theater and see `As Good As It Gets.'

Mr. DURBIN. I concur with most of what has been said here. I read this resolution, and it is hard to argue with a resolution that is praising marriage and the married. I think we are all for that. Anything in the law of this land, whether tax law or otherwise, which detracts from that institution, should be examined and seriously considered. 
But I keep wondering--I am not an expert on tax law, but there are some situations where marriage actually reduces the tax burden; where, in fact, if you have one of the spouses who has a high income and marries someone with a much lower income, it could reduce the tax rate. I certainly hope there is nothing in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution which suggests we should change that. I think we want to try to encourage people, and when the Tax Code rewards those who are married, we should continue doing that. 
What I am told is there are two sides to the story. As 
there are those who are losers and are penalized by the Tax Code by marriage, there are those who are benefited by the Tax Code.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. 
Let me say, I hope those who are listening to this debate understand the issue that is at stake here. It is the care of our children. When Senator Domenici speaks about 4.5 percent of the Federal budget going to the care of our children, that is not an overwhelming percentage. But I will tell you what is overwhelming, speak to the working families who show up every day at day care centers struggling to pay for quality, safe child care. Senator Dodd understands what their concerns are. 
I hope this Senate will support his effort to finally let this Federal Government go on record as saying, yes, let us reward work but let us also care for the children. We pay a fortune when we fail with children. And we pay it every day. Let us invest some 
money to help families take care of their kids and in a safe, quality setting. 
I yield back my time. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague and friend. 
The great philosopher Kris Kristofferson once said, `Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.' I believe those were actually sung or spoken by the late, great Janice Joplin. 
This amendment characterized as the Freedom of Health Care Choice for Medicare Seniors, on its face, appears to be a positive addition to the Medicare system. You would think if you proposed, as the Senator from Arizona does, that we will give more freedom to Medicare seniors--more freedom--that you would just guess that the major senior organizations from around the country would be unified in support of this amendment. In fact, they are unified in opposition to this 
amendment. So there might be more to this amendment than freedom. There is something to lose in this amendment. 
Let me get down to the bottom line of what all this debate is about. This debate is about whether a Medicare senior going into a doctor's office is going to have to pay according to an established Medicare schedule or whether that doctor can charge more. So it is whether the doctor--some doctors have the freedom to charge some seniors more for services. You might argue that that is necessary if there is a shortage of doctors providing benefits to Medicare seniors. But, lo and behold, 96 percent of doctors are already providing benefits to Medicare seniors. So virtually all of the doctors, 96 percent of them nationwide, have signed on. They are prepared to treat Medicare seniors and to be paid according to the fee schedule. 
What is at stake here is not about doctors in service but, rather, whether or not some doctors can charge more. What will this mean to us when we reach the Medicare eligibility age, which is creeping up on many of us, or our parents, or grandparents? It may mean before you have a chance--if the amendment of the Senator from Arizona prevails, before you have a chance to talk to your doctor about your problem, if you are a Medicare senior with this new `freedom,' first you will have to talk to the accountant in the office, who is going to want to know a little bit about your salary, your net worth, and how much they can charge you for the benefits they will provide. For some, that may be freedom. From where I am standing, that is not freedom. In fact, it restricts the rights which seniors already have. 
I think we ought to take a look at this amendment for what it really does. Private contracting sounds good on its face, unless you understand what you lose in the process of private contracting. In this situation, it means for seniors that instead of knowing what they pay when they go to the doctor's office, it really is going to be an uncertainty; they won't know. They will walk into the office uncertain whether that doctor will charge considerably more than they might have expected. That is the reason every seniors group--the AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens, Families USA, and others--have come out in opposition to this amendment. 
I might also add that there have been groups, one group in particular, which is called the United Seniors Association, which is sending mailings to seniors and would-be seniors. Lo and behold, I ended up on their mailing list. They were writing on behalf of this amendment's concept. I don't believe they were authorized by the Senator from Arizona. I am sure they were not. But they are, unfortunately, spreading some rather alarming news to seniors across America. 
Listen to what it says on the front of the envelope sent to my home in Springfield, Il:  
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Durbin: As of January 1998, our government for the first time ever will stop everyone over age 64 from getting lifesaving medical treatment. 
If you receive this and you are a senior, or close to it, boy, you will open it up in a hurry. What you find in here is a total misrepresentation of the Medicare system as it currently exists. The Medicare system in America is a very successful medical system. It is true that we will need to deal with the fact that the cost of health care continues to go up and our resources to pay for it are not matching that, but the bottom line is from the viewpoint of parties. They are happy with the 
system. They are content with the care they are receiving. They don't want Members of Congress, House or the Senate, meddling with the basic Medicare system. This amendment, this so-called private contracting freedom amendment, meddles with the system in a way that most seniors are not going to be happy with. 
Some doctors will, because they can charge more. But for a lot of seniors, we will find them really disadvantaged. For 38 million Americans who rely on the system, I think it would be a serious mistake for us to adopt this amendment. As a matter of fact, Senator Chafee and I will be offering an amendment at a later time in this debate which I think more correctly addresses the feelings that I hope more Members of the Senate share about the future of the Medicare system. In that amendment, we say as a sense of Congress that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution assume that seniors have the right to affordable, high-quality health care, and they have the right to choose their doctors, and no change should be made to the Medicare Program that could impose unreasonable and unpredictable out-of-pocket costs for seniors or erode their benefits. 
If the Senator from Arizona prevails with his amendment, we cannot make that claim, because the benefits provided to seniors will be unpredictable in cost. Each doctor can decide how much more they want to charge. 
We also say in our resolution that we don't want to compromise the efforts of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and, finally, to allow unscrupulous providers under the program to bill twice for the same services. Senator Chafee and I will offer this later during the course of the debate. I hope my colleagues, Democrat and Republicans, will join us in supporting it. 
In closing, let me say I know the Senator from Arizona is firm in his belief that this would be a solid addition to the Medicare system. I happen to think the system as it currently exists, with predictable costs and predictable services for seniors, is exactly what they want to protect. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today together with my distinguished colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, to introduce legislation to designate the United States Post Office facility at 3750 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the `Daniel J. Doffyn Post Office Building.' 
This legislation honors the service and heroism of Daniel Doffyn, a 40-year-old rookie officer with the Chicago Police Department, who was fatally shot in the line of duty two years ago. 
On the afternoon of March 8, 1995, Daniel Doffyn and his partner, Milan `Mike' Bubalo, who had just completed their regular shift, responded to a report of a burglary in progress. What they encountered, in broad daylight, just a few steps away from the Austin precinct house on Chicago's West Side, were three gun-wielding gang members hiding in an apartment. Believing the officers to be there to arrest them for their involvement in an earlier gang shooting, the trio panicked and tried to escape through a window. 
After capturing one suspect, Doffyn was shot in the head and chest by a second man, who opened fire with a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol, one of the 19 assault weapons banned under the 1994 Federal law. Officer Doffyn died in surgery later that evening. In the barrage of gunfire, Officer Bubalo was seriously wounded in the thigh, and has an artificial left hip as a result of the shooting. 
Officer Doffyn tragically lost his life in the course of performing a job that he truly loved, less than a year after graduating from the Chicago Police Academy, following a three-year quest to fulfill a dream to protect and serve his community. If someone needed help, Danny Doffyn was the first one there. In the words of District Commander LeRoy O'Shield, `he exemplified the very finest the police department has to offer. He was not assigned this job but responded to it.' 
The post office sought to be designated is in the neighborhood where Officer Doffyn, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor for his ultimate sacrifice, resided with his parents, bicycled and roller skated with his eight-year-old daughter, Brittany, and donned his blue uniform and police star #14030 with pride. 
We trust our colleagues will agree that this designation is a worthy tribute to salute the life and courage of Daniel Doffyn, and to pay respect to the thousands of men and women in law enforcement careers who risk their lives every single day striving to keep our citizens, streets, and sidewalks safe.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, AR, this week raises many questions. Two come to mind immediately. Why do children kill? I do not know the answer to that. I have heard a variety of opinions from people who suggest 
that violent television and violent movies are somehow contributing to this. There are others who say, if the children would just pray in school, it would make all the difference in the world. Some look to the families more than the schools; others think the schools have a greater role to play. 
We will debate at length, and I am sure many of us will come up with a lot of different explanations as to why children reach that point in their young lives when they would take the life of another. 
But the tragedy in Jonesboro raised another question which I think we can address because it is a simpler question. It is a question of, how do children at that young age come to possess lethal weapons? Think about it. An 11-year-old and a 13-year-old with 10 firearms--rifles, shotguns, and handguns, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition--went into the woods behind that middle school, tricked the students out with a fake fire alarm, opened fire and shot off somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 rounds before they were finally stopped. 
Four little girls were killed. A teacher, who deserves all of our recognition and praise for her courage, stood in the line of fire to protect one of those little girls and lost her own life. This teacher, the mother of a 2-year-old, lost her life defending her students. 
How do kids come into possession of firearms? They do not buy them. In most States it is unthinkable that they would even approach a counter and try. And yet, day after day in America there is further evidence of children, younger and younger, being found with firearms. 
The day after the Jonesboro, AR, tragedy, in Cleveland, OH, it is reported a 4-year-old showed up at a day-care center with a loaded handgun. 
In my home State of Illinois, in Marion, IL, a high school student showed up at school the next day with a handgun. 
In Daly City, CA, the day after Jonesboro, a 13-year-old was arrested for attempting to murder his principal with a semiautomatic pistol. 
There is something we can do about this. I am not sure that it will solve the problem completely, but it can help. Fifteen States have already recognized this problem and done something about it. These States have passed a childhood access prevention law which is known as a CAP law, saying to those who purchase and own handguns, it is not enough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use those guns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access to it. 
Should we consider this as a national model? I think the obvious answer is yes, because the tragedy in Jonesboro, which we will not forget for a long, long time, unfortunately, is not unique. Every day in America 14 young people, ages 19 and under, are killed in gun homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, with many more wounded. 
The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most helpless members of our society--our children. 
Here is what I am proposing. I am proposing Federal legislation that will apply to every State, not just 15, but every State. And this is what it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely. You may buy a trigger lock. Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin has a proposal that all handguns be sold with trigger locks. 
I support it. I am a cosponsor of it. It makes sense. 
How many times do you read in the paper, how many times do you listen on TV, to kids with their playmates and the gun goes off and someone is killed? A trigger lock, as Senator Kohl has proposed, is sensible. It should be required. It shouldn't even be debated. I think that legislation will go a long way toward reducing gun violence. Beyond that, we say to every gunowner, if it is not a trigger lock, put that gun in a place where that child cannot get to it. 
As to these two kids, 11 and 13 years old, God only knows what was going through their minds when they were setting out to get the guns to go out and start shooting. They first stopped at the parents of one of the kids and wanted to pick up that parents' guns. That parent had the guns under lock and key in a vault and they couldn't get to them. So they thought about it and said, wait a minute, my grandfather has some, too; let's go over to his place. And that is where they came up with the weapons and the ammunition. 
In one instance, one parent had taken the necessary steps to take the guns and keep them away from kids. Sadly, it appears--and I just say `appears' because I do not know all the details--in another case that did not happen. 
Now a lot of people will say to me, `There they go again, those liberals on Capitol Hill. Another bill, another law to infringe on second amendment rights.' Oh, I know I will hear from the folks from the National Rifle Association, all the other gun lobbies, screaming bloody murder about the second amendment. 
Look at 15 States that have already passed these laws, these child access prevention laws, to protect kids, to say to gunowners `you have a special responsibility.' You will not find a list of the most liberal States in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was Florida. The list goes on: Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, and in 1995, the last State to pass a child access prevention law, certainly no bleeding heart State by any political definition, was Texas--Texas. The Texas law says it is `unlawful to store, transport or abandon an unsecured firearm in a place where children are likely to be and can obtain access to it,' and it is a criminal misdemeanor if you do it. 
I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate to not only return home this weekend, as I am sure we all will, and witness those sad events on television, the funerals in Jonesboro, the tributes, the teacher who gave a life, but to resolve to do something about it. That is what we are here for. That is why we were elected to the Senate and the House, not just to be sad as we should be, but to do something about it. Not to infringe on people's right to own firearms, but to say `Own them responsibly, put them securely in your homes, keep them safely, keep them away from children.' 
Mark my words, my friends, and you know this from human experience, no matter where you hide a gun or a Christmas gift, a kid is going to find it. You can stick it in a drawer and say, `Oh, they will never look behind my socks, that is the last place in the world,' or up on some shelf in the closet and believe your child can't reach that, but you know better. You know when you are gone and the house is empty those kids are scurrying around and looking--I plead guilty and did the same 
thing as a kid, and it helps now with tragic consequences when a gun is involved. So I hope we can address this issue. 
First, Senator Kohl's legislation for these child safety devices, these trigger locks, will help. But then take the extra step, follow these 15 States and say as we address the overriding question, the big question, why do children kill, we will come to a conclusion that there are troubled children in America and we should never ignore that fact. 
But please, let this Senate and this House, before we leave this year, do something to make certain that those troubled children cannot get their hands on a firearm. I think every parent in America, particularly those of children of school age, paused at least for a moment after they heard about Jonesboro and thought, could it happen to my son, my daughter, my grandson, my granddaughter? The sad reality of life in modern America, is, yes, it could. There are so many weapons being kept so carelessly that it could happen to any of us or any of our children in virtually any school in America. 
Mr. President, I know that the Senate has a very busy schedule and limited opportunity this year, but I hope as part of our work we will let the lesson of the tragedy of Jonesboro result in legislation that will be designed to protect children and schoolteachers and innocent people in the future. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak of the tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, AR, yesterday. News reports tell us that two boys, aged 11 and 13, dressed in camouflage, opened fire on the students and teachers of the West Side Middle School. Four children were killed, and a teacher who tried to shield other children also lost her life. 
This tragedy did not occur in my home State of Illinois, but, sadly, it could have. Gun violence on children has become so common in America that kids killed in drive-by shootings are no longer lead stories on the national news. We are jarred into the harsh reality of modern American violence only when there is something unusual about the gun violence on children: the number of victims, the setting, or the perpetrators. 
In Jonesboro, AR, five victims at a peaceful school, dead at the hands of other children with guns, have caught the national attention for at least a moment. News stories headline the tragedy. This evening's news begins with long features about what this means. Today, from Africa, President Clinton calls on Attorney General Reno to investigate. Parents across America pause for a heartbeat to wonder, `Can it happen to my child? Can it happen at my child's school?' 
Sadly it can and it does. 
I hope that America is not so careless or so inattentive not to take a moment and reflect on what is happening with these terrible crimes. Sadly, this is not the first or only instance when this has occurred. On December 1 of last year, a young boy opened fire on a student prayer circle in the hallway in Heath High School in West Paducah, KY. Three students were killed, five others wounded. A 14-year-old student, described as small and emotionally immature, was arrested. 
Two months earlier, a 16-year-old outcast in Pearl, MI, was accused of killing his mother, then going to school and shooting nine students. Two of them died, including the boy's ex-girlfriend. Authorities later accused six friends of conspiracy, saying the suspects were part of a group that dabbled in satanism. 
Closer to here, a sniper who holed up in the woods wounded two students December 15 outside a school in the southwestern Arkansas town of Stamps. The two, both wounded in the hip, were hospitalized overnight. A 14-year-old boy was arrested in the manhunt. 
And now the news reports to us what was confiscated as being in their possession. Mr. President, listen to what was confiscated in the possession of these two boys, 11 and 13, who opened gunfire at this Jonesboro school: three rifles, three revolvers, two semiautomatic pistols, two derringers, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. 
It is interesting when foreign visitors come to the United States and reflect on the great American culture and on our values, how many of them that I have entertained in Illinois or in Washington comment about the love affair America has with guns. They are puzzled--what is it about this great Nation that would allow so many people to own so many guns and so many to be used recklessly, causing such violent crime and death on a daily basis? 
There are some things that are being done about it on a State basis that we should reflect on at this moment. Some States have decided that adults in possession of firearms have a responsibility to possess those firearms in a way that is safe and that protects members of their family as well as others from coming into contact with the firearms. 
I recall a story that came about at a recent family reunion, because in my family in Illinois there are many gunowners. One of them was talking about the fact that one of my relatives, he was a father of a young boy, but he had his guns safely locked away, that that little boy could never get to those guns. And another older man in the family said, `Yes, I know, that's how I used to do it. I'd lock them away and my son could never find them.' But his son was sitting there and he said, `Dad, I got into those guns all kinds of times.' Guns and Christmas presents are going to be discovered by kids. And if they can be discovered, tragedy can happen. 
So a number of States have decided to do something about it. They have assigned responsibility to the adults involved and said that they must be careful. If you want to own a handgun, a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, you must own it responsibly so that gun does not become a weapon of violence and death and some innocent victim result. 
Listen to what is happening in America with gun crimes: 
The rate of firearm-related deaths among American children is 15 times greater than that in 25 other industrialized countries combined. 
In a 1-year period, 86 percent of all gun-related deaths in the industrialized world occurred in the United States of America. 
Every day in my home State of Illinois, a child is killed by gun violence. 
At least one child in Illinois every month is unintentionally killed as a result of a gun accident. 
In 1993, the Department of Justice issued a report that concluded street gang violence in Chicago is becoming increasingly lethal, primarily because of escalating gang firepower. 
We took a survey for 1 month in the State of Illinois of gun crimes involving children. In 1 month in 1996 in a Chicago suburb, 15-year-old Ronald Walker was shot in the head as he left a grocery store. 
That same month, police had to rush two 7-year-old boys, Donnell Ross and Kenyon Pope, to Cook County Hospital when they wounded each other while playing with a .38 pistol found in their apartment. One of the boys was shot in the chest. 
Earlier in the same week that Donnell and Kenyon were shot, an 18-year-old boy handed a 9-year-old boy a loaded gun and told him the safety was on. It wasn't. That 9-year-old pulled the trigger. He shot 15-year-old Theunco Bell in the throat. 
A day before that incident, a 10- and 12-year-old were playing with a gun. It went off and killed the 10-year-old whose name was Michael Fuller. 
As former staff physician at Cook County Hospital said:  
Whether intentional or unintentional . . . children have access to guns. Children are naturally curious, and a gun can be a very sexy toy for them. 
So what can we do? Can we watch in horror as the stories come to us from Chicago, from Jonesboro, from Kentucky, from Mississippi? Can we lament the horror that has been visited on these children, their families, their teachers and the whole community? Can we say that this is just part of the price of doing business in America today, or do we act? Do we decide as a nation that it is time for us to come to grips with this challenge, to accept the reality that people, if they are to own guns, must own them responsibly? 
Senator Kohl of Wisconsin has trigger-lock legislation, which I support, which would reduce the likelihood of gun violence among children and, as I mentioned, many States have passed legislation imposing responsibilities on gun owners so that they not let these guns go into the hands of children. 
Are these laws in the States effective? Well, as a matter of fact, a study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association makes clear that children's lives have been saved when States have required gun owners to make guns inaccessible to children. The study found that accidental shooting deaths were reduced by 23 percent in States that passed child access prevention gun laws. 
Mr. President, I will be preparing legislation to federalize child access prevention gun laws. There is no reason why every child in America shouldn't be protected at least in some small way by assuming that every owner of a gun has to own it responsibly, keep it in a safe manner, keep it in a way where it cannot be accessed by children. 
I know this won't put an end to gun violence. There is just too much of it going on in America. But, in fact, it may slow down the carnage and it may reduce the horror of the stories that we heard just this evening and last night from Jonesboro, AR. As we reflect on these four children and their teacher and this terrible tragedy, keep in mind that gun violence every day claims the lives of children and adults alike across America, black and white and Hispanic. It is a scourge, a scourge on those who live not only in 
big cities but in small towns. 
I hope that my colleagues on a bipartisan basis will join me in this effort to reduce the incidence of gun violence. I also hope that this tragedy in Jonesboro, AR, will inspire us to do it and do it quickly. I yield back the remainder of my time. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to pay tribute to one of our Nation's most important industries--agriculture. Today, we celebrate National Agriculture Day. It is a time to reflect on the value of production agriculture and to say thank you to all those who are involved, both directly and indirectly, in producing the most abundant and safest food and fiber supply in the world. 
Illinois is one of our country's most important agricultural contributors. Illinois farm land, which accounts for about 27 million acres, is considered some of the most productive in the world. More than 76,000 farm families in the State produce corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, dairy products, and specialty crops. Illinois exports more than $3.4 billion worth of agricultural products. The State's agribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicagoland area to Decatur and throughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs thousands of people. And, our researchers continue to help provide answers to some of the most common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we face. 
Since last year's National Agriculture Day, we've made some real progress for rural America. The Taxpayer Relief Act raised the inheritance tax exemption for small businesses to $1.3 million, lowered the capital gains tax rate, and began a gradual increase in the deductibility of health insurance premiums. 
This year, we face a number of equally important issues, specifically, reauthorization of agricultural research, expedited health insurance premium deductibility for the self-employed, extension of the ethanol tax incentive, and food safety. 
The safety and availability of our Nation's food supply depends directly on agricultural research. This year, Congress must reauthorize the research title of the farm bill. Reauthorization will establish a national policy for important agricultural research into the 21st century. In these times of constrained federal budgets, it is vitally important to maintain an effective system for agricultural research. 
Agriculture-related research in this country is currently conducted at over 100 ARS labs, including Peoria, and at over 70 land grant institutions, including the University of Illinois. The University of Illinois is involved in biotechnology, aflatoxin, genome, and food safety research on their campuses. Southern Illinois University is working on groundwater contamination and an important National Corn to Ethanol Research Pilot Plant near its Edwardsville campus. These projects are simply too important to delay. However, the future of agricultural research depends on Congress reauthorizing these vital programs sooner rather than later. 
With regard to health care costs, I believe that a 100-percent tax deduction for health insurance premiums is one of the most basic issues of fairness to farm families across this country. Because of the high cost of health insurance, especially insurance purchased in the individual market, lack of affordability is a growing problem to farmers. Health insurance is particularly important to those involved in production agriculture because farming is one of the more dangerous occupations. It is essential that farmers have access to quality health care and affordable health insurance. 
In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress made the commitment to increase deductibility very gradually from 40 percent in 1997 to 100 percent in 2007. Although I believe this legislation was a good first step, we need to provide this relief faster. I have introduced legislation that will expedite the full deductibility of health insurance premiums. I also intend to offer an amendment to increase deductibility to 60 percent in 1999 and 100 percent thereafter. Relief for farm families in this area is needed now. Farmers should not have to wait until 2007 for equity with their corporate competitors. 
Mr. President, finding new and expanded uses for agricultural products is an important endeavor. Soybean growers and the oilseeds industry are proposing a strategy for biodiesel, a diesel fuel derived from soybeans. Including biodiesel in existing and future Department of Energy programs will help the nation reduce dependence on imported oil, while improving the environment, reducing global warming, and creating new domestic agricultural product markets. And, of course, ethanol, a corn-based renewable fuel, is one of the best alternative use opportunities that exists today. 
On a day like today, it is important to point out the benefits of ethanol. The industry is responsible for more than 40,000 American jobs. Ethanol contributes more than $5.6 billion annually to our economy. Five percent of our nation's corn crop goes to ethanol production. Corn growers have seen their incomes increased by more than $1.2 billion because of ethanol. This year alone, over 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be produced . Thanks to the reformulated gasoline program, toxic air pollutants like benzene and carbon monoxide have fallen substantially. And, ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. 
Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly defeated a proposal that would have removed the ethanol excise tax exemption from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). That vote was the strongest in Senate history in support of ethanol. It is my hope that an extension of the ethanol tax incentive will be included in the final conference report on ISTEA. Time is running out. Farmers, the ethanol industry, and rural America deserve to have this important program extended. 
An issue that also needs immediate attention is food safety. Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest food supply in the world. However, we can do better. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 33 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the next decade. 
I have introduced the Safe Food Act, S. 1465, which would empower a single, independent agency to enforce food safety regulations from farm to table. It would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. Research could be better coordinated within a single agency rather than among multiple programs. And, new technologies to improve food safety could be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency. 
At a time of government downsizing and reorganization, the U.S. simply can't afford to continue operating multiple systems. In order to achieve a successful, effective food safety and inspection system, a single agency with uniform standards is needed. 
Mr. President, National Agriculture Day affords us all the opportunity to say thank you to those who farm, process agricultural products, conduct the research and plan for the future, and keep American agriculture the best in the world.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, we are debating something of historic proportion, and that is the question of whether or not the NATO alliance shall be enlarged to include three countries. At this point, those three countries are Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This is not a new concept. 
In 1994, the United States announced that we were, in fact, going to consider the enlargement of NATO. Why? The world has changed so dramatically. The Berlin Wall is down. The Soviet Union has dissipated, or at least broken up into different political entities. We are starting to see the world in different terms. For over 50 years, we saw the world in terms of East and West, the Soviet Union and the United States, the cold war. 
How many of us, as kids in the 1950s, huddled under our desks in preparation for the possibility of an air raid? Now what a different world we live in--a world where the United States of America and its taxpayers, since 1991, have given to Russia over $100 billion in an effort to help that country get back on its feet. What was once our mortal enemy, a country that we literally spent $6 trillion to defend against, is now our ally. So we view the world in much different terms, and now we should view NATO in different terms. 
My colleagues who come to the floor in opposition to NATO enlargement are stuck in old thinking, as far as I am concerned. They view Europe, East and West, in terms of lines that were drawn by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. We should not. We should view Europe and its future in terms of a new century and new opportunities. 
When you visit a country like Poland--which I did a year ago--and realize now that the Poland of today is not looking to the East, but rather to the West, that the Poland of today wants to be part of an axis which includes Western Europe, the United States, and freedom-loving countries around the world, then you can understand the momentum and impetus behind the enlargement of NATO. These countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are willing to step away from the old Soviet way of doing things; they are willing to pledge themselves to human rights, respecting the borders of their neighbors, and to civilian controlling of the military, and to free markets. They are prepared to join NATO because they know NATO is the future. 
What an alliance NATO has been in the history of the world. If you study the history of the world and consider all of the different countries that have come together for various reasons, NATO is an anomaly, NATO is an oddity. Why? Because it is a purely defensive alliance. It was created by the United States and our allies after World War II to defend Western Europe against the possibility of Soviet aggression and expansion. Throughout its history, since 1949, NATO has consistently stood for that principle. There is not a single instance that anyone can point to in the history of the alliance where the NATO countries have come together in an aggressive way to try to take over some other country. It is just not the nature of that alliance. 
So when I hear the criticisms--and you hear them from many people who come to this floor--that the Russians are worried about NATO expansion, my obvious question is, Why? Why would any country be concerned about other countries coming together simply to defend their own borders and pledge themselves to principles that I think all freedom-loving countries should be dedicated to? This troubles me, too. If there is genuine concern in Russia that these countries are going to come together in a defensive alliance, maybe the defensive alliance is necessary. It is something to pin our hopes on the relationship between the United States and Russia on the medical reports on Boris Yeltsin. I hope that he continues in power for a long time. I am happy to report that, by and large, with few exceptions, his relationship with the United States has been a very positive one. But we have to accept the reality that there will be change in Russia. I hope it is change for the better. 
Now put yourself in the shoes of Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, or, for that matter, the Baltic States. What gamble are they willing to take about the future of Russia? What they have said to us is: We feel comfortable coming together with you in an alliance, which will stabilize our boundaries and give us some certainty about our future. So if a future leader in Russia is more conservative, more liberal, more expansionist, or more friendly, they know that they have this alliance to turn to. 
When you look at those who are supporting the idea of 
expanding the NATO alliance, the list is very impressive. It includes not only General Colin Powell, but former President Bush, Margaret Thatcher, Lech Walesa, and Vaclav Havel. The list goes on and on and on. These leaders, worldwide, understand what NATO means. 
Now, let me say this. Some criticize this NATO enlargement by saying, `There they go again. They are ending up giving away U.S. taxpayer dollars for the defense of Europe. Shouldn't the Europeans be defending themselves?' The answer is, of course, that they should. That is their own personal responsibility. I, for one, in my 15 years on Capitol Hill in the House and Senate, have argued for burdensharing at every turn in the road. I think more and more of these countries should accept that responsibility. 
But let's be honest. If these countries come together, if they agree on certain standards for their own military development, if they agree on certain principles, if this alliance is in place and strong, the likelihood of needing these military forces is dramatically diminished. And each of these new countries that wants to join us in NATO has proven their bona fides in terms of their good-faith effort to be part of a Western alliance by already committing troops when we have asked, some in the Persian Gulf war, some in Bosnia. 
In fact, in the situation in Bosnia, Lithuania sent a brigade down and within a few weeks one of their soldiers was killed by a landmine. It was devastating news in that tiny country. It might have led their legislature to convene and bring their troops home from Bosnia. But they did not. They convened and, with a vote that should tell you about their view of the world, voted to send even more forces down to Bosnia. To prove that they wanted to be part of this alliance, they were willing to put their troops and the lives of their countrymen on the line. 
That story is repeated over and over. This is a positive thing. This is something that we should view in terms of NATO's future as really, I guess, an excellent start for the 21st century--that we are now at a point where we can talk about all of these countries--which once were at war and in the past had been rivals with conflicting ideologies--that are now coming together. 
Some have said, Well, let's not hurry this debate. Can't this wait 6 months or a year? I suppose it could, but I hope it doesn't, because we have spent more than 4 years preparing for this debate. We have gone through lengthy hearings in the Foreign Operations Committee. We have had many people meet--NATO allies and others--to discuss the expansion of NATO. We have studied this to the point where we can make an intelligent and mature decision, and we should. 
Last Friday night in Chicago, IL--which is in my home State and which boasts the largest Polish population outside of the city of Warsaw, Poland--we entertained the new President of the Assembly of Poland. Marian Krzaklewski is the new President and a member of the Solidarity party. I can't tell you what this issue means to the future of Poland. Any of you who have studied World War II and understand the devastation that was wrought on Poland as a result of World War II understand how important it is to the people of Poland today to have the security of an alliance that they can count on. We, of course, know of the tragedy of the Polish Jews who were lost in the Holocaust, but there were many others of other religions, and some of no religion, but they were all victims in World War II. The numbers stretch into the hundreds of thousands and millions. That is the legacy of war in countries like Poland. 
For those who come to the floor saying, `Can't we wait 6 months or a year before we give to countries like Poland the assurance that those days are behind them?' I have to say that I think that is shortsighted. I think the right thing for America to do is to follow the leadership of the President, follow the bipartisan support on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and enlarge NATO. This Senate should vote for the enlargement, first, to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and then, frankly, open it up to any other country that is able and willing to dedicate itself to these same principles. 
We don't like to think in terms of the military and war; we tend to focus more on domestic life in the United States, as we should. But I happen to believe that an investment in our time and debate on this issue at this moment is the right thing to do. I believe that if we make the proper move today, this week, and next week in the Senate to debate this issue fully and vote on it, we can bring together the kind of alliance that will give our children and grandchildren peace of mind for decades to come. I hope that we will do that, and I hope that we will understand, as well, that what is at stake here is more than just a debate over a single issue; what is at stake here is whether the legacy of World War II and the legacy of the cold war will or will not be revisited on our friends in Europe. 
The United States cannot be the policeman for the world, but we can ally ourselves with other nations of like mind and like values, who will join us in bringing stability to this Earth, so that the day may never come when we are asked to send large numbers of Americans to fight in foreign lands for issues and causes and for American interests. These are things that I think are part of this debate today. 
I close by saying that I appreciate this time to speak, and I hope my other colleagues will join me. I don't know that there is another single issue relative to global security that is more important than this debate about the future of NATO. I hope that the United States and our NATO allies will write our foreign policy and plan our future based on the interests and values that have held us together as a Nation for over 200 years. 
When the argument is made that moving forward with the expansion of NATO makes some people nervous in Moscow, I have to ask, Why should it? Why should we not even hold out the possibility that the day will come when Russia will ask to be part of NATO? It is not an incredible idea. The thought that they would give civilian control of the military, pledge to the same principles, and cooperate with the United States--that should be the new world order; that should be the new thinking. 
But the belief that we should hold back and not engage these other countries in an alliance, important for our security and theirs, because of some misgivings among some hardliners in Moscow is just plain wrong. We should be driven by foreign policy decisions right for America, right for our allies. We should not be driven by the melancholy of the few in Moscow who long for the return of empire. When you hear the argument made that we can include Warsaw Pact countries like the three I mentioned, and that is all right, but you can't include former republics like the Baltic States, it troubles me greatly. My mother was born in Lithuania, so I come to this debate with a special interest, and maybe even some prejudice is involved. 
For 50 years, we refused to recognize Soviet domination over the population of those sovereign states and thought they were entitled to have their own self-government. We ignored Soviet domination and we fought Soviet domination for over 50 years. And now, to defer to some Russian thinking that because these republics that were once part of the Soviet Union want to be in NATO, that is supposedly unthinkable, I disagree. For the Baltic States and so many other countries in Eastern Europe and near the Baltic Sea, NATO really is their security of the future. It is something the United States can be proud to support. I know they will be supportive of the values which we treasure in this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Thursday the Senate overwhelmingly approved reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). I want to take this opportunity to explain the benefits of this legislation for the State of Illinois. 
First, let me offer my congratulations and also say thank you to Senators Chafee and Baucus for their extraordinary work in bringing this bill to the floor and shepherding it through in record time. The final product, S. 1173, reflects their diligent work and profound understanding of our nation's diverse transportation needs. 
Illinois is a vitally important link in our nation's transportation system. My colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who has helped lead an important effort to improve this bill to reflect Illinois' needs, has referred to the State as the `Transportation Hub of the Nation.' I couldn't agree more. 
Illinois has the third largest Interstate system in the nation. It is a critical freight transfer point. The Chicago area boasts of the nation's largest intermodal hub. Illinois is also a passenger and freight rail hub. The State's ports handle the third largest amount of domestic waterborne traffic. Illinois' rivers are the fourth busiest in the nation. The Chicago Transit Authority operates the nation's second largest public transportation system. And, of course, O'Hare International Airport is the busiest in the world. 
Unfortunately, Illinois' urban roads have been rated as the second worst in the nation. And, the six-county Chicago region is considered the fifth most congested area in the U.S. 
This ISTEA reauthorization is a good first step toward improving the conditions of Illinois' roads and bridges, properly funding mass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviating congestion, and addressing highway safety and the environment. 
The bill provides $173 billion over six years for highway, highway safety, and other surface transportation programs. Illinois can expect to receive more than $5.3 billion over six years from the highway formula, as well as from the high density and the bonus programs. That's a 29 percent increase or $1.2 billion more than the ISTEA of 1991. Major reconstruction and rehabilitation projects like Downtown Chicago's Wacker Drive and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) will be able to move forward thanks, in large part, to this legislation. 
Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago area as well as to so many downstate communities. It helps alleviate congestion and provides access to thousands of Illinoisans everyday. Under the Banking Committee title, Illinois can expect to receive $2.1 billion over six years. A 40 percent increase or $600 million more than the 1991 ISTEA. These important transit dollars will help the Chicago Transit Authority rehabilitate several lines, the METRA and PACE systems in Northeastern Illinois expand and improve their service areas, the Metro Link light rail system in St. Clair County complete an Illinois extension, and transit authorities throughout the state purchase and upgrade bus and bus facilities. 
The Senate bill also preserves and expands some important environmental and enhancement programs, for example the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program and bicycle pedestrian facilities. CMAQ's goal is to help states meet their air quality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. S. 1173 increases funding for CMAQ by 18 percent. Illinois can expect more than $1 billion over six years under the program. S. 1173 also provides for increases in funds for transportation enhancement activities, such as bicycle pedestrian facilities and historic preservation. 
This bill also contains a number of highway safety provisions. One of the most notable is the .08 amendment. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Lautenberg and DeWine, S. 1173 contains a provision that would lower the legal blood-alcohol concentration level for drivers to .08. It's a law that Illinois has had on the books since July 1997. The provision could save as many as 600 lives a year. 
Finally, the Senate ISTEA bill extends the current excise tax exemption for an important Illinois product--corn-based, renewable ethanol fuel--to 2007. Farmers and the ethanol industry must be able to plan for the future. Extending the incentive will allow them to do so. 
Mr. President, the Senate's action on ISTEA sets the stage for Congress to uphold its obligation to reauthorize these vitally important transportation programs before they expire again later this spring. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our nation's transportation needs are properly met.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak to an issue which involves our Executive Calendar. 
Since November of last year, there have been two names pending on this calendar of judicial appointees for my home State of Illinois. One is Patrick Murphy, of Marion, IL, to be U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District. The other is Michael McCuskey, who is seeking the position of District Judge for the Central District of Illinois. It is unusual that these two nominees would have been on the calendar for such a long period of time, and the situation is aggravated by the fact that these vacancies are very serious, creating, in fact, what has been characterized as a judicial emergency. 
The Southern District of Illinois has the second oldest judicial vacancy in the Nation. The Southern District, for which Mr. Murphy is seeking this confirmation, has been without this Federal judge for 1,952 days. In the Central District of Illinois, it has been more than 1,000 days since that judgeship has been filled. In fact, the exact number is 1,255 days. 
There are four judgeships in the southern district, two vacant. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and I have proposed Mr. Murphy and Judge David Herndon, of Alton, to be named to fill those spots. Mr. Murphy is the only candidate who has reached the calendar to this point, but we are hopeful that Judge Herndon will as well. This 50 percent vacancy rate in one judicial district is much, much higher than the 10 percent vacancy rate which we have experienced around the Nation. In the Central District of Illinois, where I live, the numbers are exactly the same; half of the judges have not been appointed. Of course the obvious question is, What is wrong with these two nominees? Why would they sit on the calendar of the U.S. Senate for over 1,000 days? 
They clearly must have very serious problems. Exactly the opposite is the case. 
These two gentlemen, Mr. Murphy and Judge McCuskey, were nominated by President Clinton on July 31, 1997. They were unanimously recommended by the Judiciary Committee on November 6 of the same year. They have been sitting on this calendar for 127 days with absolutely no one raising questions as to their qualifications for the job. 
What happens to a person who finds himself in this predicament? I have talked to many of them. Their lives are changed. The prospect of being appointed to the Federal bench makes life difficult on a professional and personal basis. 
Judge McCuskey has a family. He is trying to find a place for his family to live. Think about buying a home and not knowing when you can move into it, and then the fear that if you move too soon, you will disqualify yourself from your previous judgeship. That is what he is facing. 
His family is going through a lot of turmoil this week because they had thought surely within 100 days the U.S. Senate would act on this nomination, but it has not happened. 
Mr. Murphy is in the private practice of law. We have spoken from time to time. He has important cases representing people from his part of Illinois, and people are wondering: `Pat Murphy, are you going to be around? Can we count on you? Will you take this case to trial? Should we bring business to your office?' 
All of these things weigh heavy on a person who has decided to make this commitment to move forward and ask to be appointed to the Federal bench. 
I hope that Members of the Senate, those who will read my remarks and those who hear them, will understand that this type of thing is more than an inconvenience. It is a hardship that we should not impose on two people for whom there is no controversy. 
Let's take a look at the Central District of Illinois. There are 162 cases in that district that have been pending for more than 2 years. Imagine if you were to say at some point, because of your business or family concerns or personal needs, that you had to go to court, and then you went into court with an attorney and said, `How soon will this be resolved?' 
And they said, `At least 2 years.' 
`Two years?' 
We can do better. 
Fifty-five of the cases in the central district have been there for more than 3 years; 30 of the suits are related to civil rights cases, people who feel they have been discriminated against; 21 are civil rights suits; 15 are contract disputes; 9 are personal injury cases; 11 are product liability suits; and 2 are patent cases. 
Let me tell you how this works, since I have practiced law in this district. When the day comes for you to go to trial after waiting 2 years, you better hope there isn't some intervening thing or event that ends up postponing it. A friend of mine took a case and, after waiting for 19 months, finally went to trial only to have a death in the family of one of the other attorneys, causing them to postpone the trial date. Then, of course, they were told they would have to wait for at least another year before the case could be tried. 
When the Senate fails to do its work and confirm judges, the hardship is imposed on ordinary people in America and they are puzzled: `Well, why is this the case? Why does it take so long for me to get my day in court?' Is justice delayed truly justice denied? In many cases, it is. In this situation, unfortunately, the burden is on us, those men and women who sit in this Chamber and have the singular responsibility to confirm Federal judges. 
The Southern District of Illinois is another sad story when it comes to the impact of the vacancies. Since 1992, case filings have increased 9 percent. People are still going to the courthouse; 58 cases there have been pending for more than 3 years; 7 have been pending for 10 years. Why is that the case? Because Judge Phil Gilbert, the active Federal judge in this district, with Judge Paul Riley, are working overtime to try to deal with a heavy criminal docket which must be dealt with first under the law and, of course, we want them to, and in trying to deal with that docket, they keep postponing the civil docket. So people wait. 
In one of those 10-year-old cases in the southern district, a plaintiff sustained serious neck and back injuries that required him to pay out $15,000 in hospital bills. He was operating a mine shuttle cart that hit a small obstruction. The cart had no shock absorbers, and he suffered a serious injury, and now he waits for his day in court. 
When you take a look at the statistics that have been compiled by the administrative office of the U.S. Court System as to the median amount of time that it takes a civil case to come to trial, it tells the story even more graphically. 
The Southern District of Illinois has the longest waiting period, 23 months. There are 94 districts nationwide, and the southern district has the 54th longest median time from filing to trial; the central district, 33 months. These numbers are from early last fall. More recent numbers are not going to be encouraging or much different. 
We have heard from the judges in both of the districts. Phil Gilbert of the southern district has written to Members of the Senate and said they are getting the job done--and I know he is working hard with Judge Riley--but they badly need additional judges. Those are his words. 
Judge Michael Mihm of the central district said that they, too, are working to keep up with the caseload, but definitely feel the pinch. They have had to delay one major civil trial. They are only getting the job done by bringing in other judges from other districts, and, of course, causing problems in those districts in the meantime. 
Let me tell you about these two individuals, because I think you will come to realize why they moved through the Judiciary Committee without any controversy and why their still sitting on the calendar is a travesty of justice. 
Judge McCuskey was born in Peoria, IL. He is currently a State court judge and for the last 9 years has been serving in that capacity. Before that, for 2 years he was a circuit court judge. Since 1990, he has been a justice for the third district appellate court. 
Before going to law school, he worked at a local high school as a history teacher and baseball coach. During law school, he helped pay his bills by working as a security guard. After graduating, he started his own law firm. Since becoming a judge, he has earned a reputation, deservedly, from Democrats, Republicans, as well as Independents, as an outstanding--firm, fair and thorough--jurist. 
He is also involved in community work. Mike McCuskey is known throughout the Peoria area for going to local grade schools and reading to children. He emcees the senior citizen activities during the annual county fair. 
Then there is Pat Murphy in the Southern District of Illinois. I never met Pat Murphy before he came to the interview process that Carol Moseley-Braun and I held. I have to tell you, he just swept us off our feet. He is such an impressive individual. 
Pat Murphy was born and raised in Marion, IL, from a very humble family. He served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam. At the age of 17, he enlisted. On almost exactly his 18th birthday, he arrived in Vietnam where he served a tour of duty as an enlisted man in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Corps weapons platoon. 
After he got out of the Marine Corps, Pat Murphy decided to go on to get his college degree and law degree with the help of the GI bill. 
His parents died, and some of his brothers and sisters were still very young. Pat took on the responsibility of raising his four younger brothers and sisters. As he said to us, `We ended up raising one another.' 
I met Pat's brother Kevin. He is the unit manager and a guard at the Marion Federal Penitentiary. 
Pat's story shows extensive legal experience. Since beginning the practice of law, Pat Murphy has tried almost 100 cases. I will tell you, it is hard to find a trial attorney who can say that. He has tried almost 100 cases before a jury; 200 before a judge. He has represented banks, municipalities, school boards, insurers and individuals. He has tried several criminal cases, representing plaintiffs and defendants. In the first year he was eligible, he was elected to the prestigious American College of Trial Attorneys. He has built more than a solid reputation in southern Illinois. He has been building a national reputation. 
Isn't this the kind of person we want to serve on the Federal bench? I think it is, and so does the Judiciary Committee in unanimously approving his nomination. 
One thing I have to say, though, that shouldn't be left out of Pat Murphy's biography is that he is known throughout Marion and southern Illinois for his unstinting generosity to veterans. He himself served, as I said, in the Marine Corps during Vietnam, and ever since, he has given local veterans pro bono--that is free--representation whenever they walk through the door. 
I have heard it said that in southern Illinois, when there is a funeral and burial of a veteran, many times they will see this lawyer come driving up, jump out of the car and stand in reverence at the grave site for his fellow veteran. 
Pat Murphy has endeared himself to so many of the people in southern Illinois and would be an excellent choice for Federal judge. 
So here we sit 127 days after these two men have their names brought before the Senate for confirmation. There is no objection in the Judiciary Committee, no objection to their qualifications and talents, and yet they wait. With personal hardship, they are waiting patiently for the opportunity to serve the United States of America as Federal district court judges. 
They have accepted that responsibility pending our confirmation. Shouldn't the Senate accept its responsibility? Shouldn't we vote out today, or at the latest the first day we can next week, these two men so that they can serve their country as Federal district court judges, so that they can, in some way, address the backlog of cases in the southern and central districts and give people who have been waiting patiently for their day in court an opportunity for a trial? 
I hope we respond to this. I say to my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, I am going to continue to raise this issue. I think it is unfair what we are doing to these two individuals. I hope the Senate can move very, very quickly to rectify this injustice. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I say to the majority leader I thank him for the conversation we had over the last several days about a matter of concern to me and I hope to the Senate. 
My objection to your unanimous consent request is not based on the belief we should be doing less business but in the hope we will be able to do a little more--specifically, that the two judges who are pending on the Executive Calendar since November of last year from the State of Illinois, judges I referred to earlier as coming from districts with extraordinary problems because of these vacancies, I hope these judges can be considered, and considered very soon. 
I have tried to say to all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, that I stand ready to work with you to move this calendar's agenda as quickly as possible. I hope they will empathize with the challenge that faces us in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois and that we can call these judges for consideration as quickly as possible. 
For that reason, for that reason alone, I do object.

Mr. DURBIN. If the majority leader will yield, I am asking that we schedule as quickly as possible the confirmation of these two judges. I am trying to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that they have been on the calendar since last November. There are extraordinary hardships back in the State of Illinois. I know of no other way, and I have tried every way, to avoid this objection. I do not speak for the minority leader but only as one Senator from the State of Illinois. And I do object.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the outset I would like to say to my colleagues in the Senate and those who are witnessing this Chamber this morning that we have a unique opportunity this year to do something of value not only for the children of this country but for many others. It relates to an issue that I have been involved in for over 10 years. It started a little over 10 years ago when as a Congressman from Illinois I was about to catch an airplane in Phoenix, AZ, to Chicago, but, as usual, I was late. I came rushing into the airport in Phoenix, AZ, put my ticket on the counter of United Airlines, and said to the flight attendant, `Can I make this plane?' She punched it into the computer and said, `You can if you hurry.' I said, `Can you get me a seat in the nonsmoking section?' She punched it into the computer, and said, `No. I am sorry. It is too late. The only seat we have is a middle seat in the smoking section.' I looked at her, and I said, `I know I am in a hurry, but isn't there something you can do?' She looked at my ticket, and she looked at my title, and she looked me in the eye, and said, `No; but, Congressman, there is something you can do.' 
So I got on that airplane and flew from Phoenix to Chicago seated between two sumo wrestlers chain smoking the whole way. I turned my air vents on, one and then the other, and realized when I got off that plane that my clothes were stinking, my sinuses were clogged, and I was grumpy. But I still would be alive. I looked a couple of rows away and saw a woman with a tiny baby and, on the other side of the plane, an elderly person. I thought to myself, this doesn't make any sense at all. Why do we let people smoke away in the cabin of an airplane and endanger the health and lives of other people? 
So I came to Washington and in 1987 introduced legislation to ban smoking on airplanes. I never dreamed that it would be successful. In fact, it was the first time in its history that the tobacco lobby had lost a major vote on the regulation of their product on the floor of the House of Representatives. It was a bipartisan effort. I never would have succeeded without the intervention of Senator Claude Pepper, who was chairman of the House Rules Committee, my friend; and Mike Synar, the late Congressman from Oklahoma; Henry Waxman of California, and some others. 
It really started in my political career an effort to take a close look at tobacco. Now, almost 11 years later, that wave that was just starting to rise in 1987 is about to crest in 1998. We have a chance now to not just deal with the annoyance and danger of secondhand smoke but something much, much bigger. We have a chance to enact legislation in 1998 that will dramatically change, in America, our view of tobacco as a product for sale. If we are successful, if we do our job, we will finally say that the law in every State in the Nation which bans the sale of tobacco products to children will be enforced. What a breakthrough that would be for us to finally come to grips with the fact that these tobacco companies with their insidious strategy and their advertising have been going after our kids. That is it. 
They lose 2 million of their best smokers each year; 400,000 die from tobacco-related diseases, and 1.5 million or so quit. Well, if you are in the corporate board room of RJR or Philip Morris, you say, `I have a problem. Two million customers gone. We have to replace these customers. Where are we going to go?' 
Well, we found out as we have surveyed that when a person reaches the age of 18 and beyond, they are less likely to decide for the first time to smoke. They are a little more mature. They know the danger, and they stay away from it. But these corporate leaders in the tobacco companies know that if they can get kids to start smoking, they might have customers for life, albeit an abbreviated life for many smokers. 
So we see Joe Camel, we see Marlboro's cancer cowboy, and we see all these efforts to glamorize tobacco. For what purpose? Ultimately so the children will try to smoke. Oh, these tobacco companies do a great job. You know what happens? Every single day in America 3,000 kids start smoking for the first time. A third of them, 1,000 of them, will find their lives shortened because of that experience. Kids who become addicted to nicotine become smokers for life. The tobacco companies win. The kids lose. Their parents lose. America loses. 
We have a chance this year to change it. But we may blow that opportunity because, unfortunately, this Senate, and the House for that matter, have become tangled up in the politics of this issue and can't see the forest for the trees. If we miss this chance this year to do something about this effort to addict our children, we may never have it again. 
The President and Vice President have been leaders on this issue. We would not be here today discussing it were it not for President Clinton's leadership. And we have seen many others, 42 States' attorneys general, who brought lawsuits against the tobacco companies and said, now it is time for you to pay for the damage you have caused to America by tobacco products; now it is time for you to be held accountable for your lies, your fraud, your deception, your advertising directly at children. 
So we are here today and the ball is in our court. Will we do something about it? Take a look at this. This is the situation. Here is the 1998 teen smoking report. How many kids will be hooked today? Three thousand. How many kids have been hooked so far this year? Mr. President, 213,000. How many kids will die too young because Congress has failed to act this year? Mr. President, 71,000. How many days are left for Congress to act? Sixty-seven days. And the count goes up every single day--more kids addicted to nicotine, addicted to tobacco; more kids who will die. 
We are told repeatedly this is a short session; we do not have a lot of time here. We have just 67 days and then we have to get back to other things. What is more important? What could be more important than the lives of our children? What could be more important than this opportunity in history for the first time--the very first time--that we can do something? Think about it. If we said, as part of our legislation, legislation I support, that the tobacco companies have to show reductions in kids smoking or they are going to pay more, guess what will happen. They will reduce the number of sales to kids. They will watch it more carefully. If we say to these tobacco companies that we are sick and tired of your insidious advertising at sporting events and all sorts of billboards near schools--we know what is going on here--it is coming to an end, we can do it; we can do it this year. 
There is more. We also have to take the money that will come from this effort--from additional fees, for example, on tobacco products--and make sure that it is well spent on antitobacco advertising, on medical research, and on so many other things the President has suggested. 
The President wants to take these funds and put them into the basics, make sure there is money for education, make sure there is money for child care, make sure there is money at the NIH for medical research. This is money that is well spent and well invested. But we can miss this opportunity. We can find ourselves twisted in knots. Unfortunately, we may find, if that occurs, we may never have this chance again. 
Today is March 12; there are 67 days left on Capitol Hill to take action on an antitobacco bill. If we are going to do this, the Senate needs to finish up its work on this bill by Memorial Day and no later. There are 3,000 reasons each day to pass this legislation--the 3,000 kids who start smoking for the first time. There are no good reasons not to. When you count the days and you count the kids and you count the cost, I think you understand the gravity of this situation. We have offered comprehensive legislation. I hope we can count on our friends on the other side of the aisle to join us. 
Yesterday the committee hearings focused on details of tobacco legislation--immunity, liability, committee jurisdiction--but it is time to bring the focus back where it belongs. This is not about the details of the legislative process, it is about our children. Let's send a bill to President Clinton that he can sign. We certainly owe it to America's kids to stop stalling and start saving lives.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, while on the subject of the calendar, let me tell you I have waited patiently now--as has the Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun--I have waited since November 1997 for the Senate to take up consideration of two Federal District Court Judges of Illinois. Patrick Murphy of Marion, IL, is a nominee for the southern district; Michael McCuskey, now an appellate court judge at the State level, is our nominee for the central district. We have waited patiently for over 100 days while these names languished on the Senate Executive Calendar. During that period of time, other judges' names have come and gone, been approved by the Senate, but the two nominees from Illinois sit and languish. 
It is bad enough that these two gentlemen, for whom there has been no negative comment, no suggestion that they are not qualified--it is bad enough that their lives have been interrupted because of the Senate's failure to act. What is even worse is that for the people they would serve in southern and central Illinois, there are vacancies on the Federal bench. The southern district of Illinois has the third oldest judicial vacancy in the Nation. We have seen over 1,900 days have passed since there was a judge in this seat, more than 1,000 days in the central district. These high vacancy rates for the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois are causing a great hardship, not only on the judges who are sitting and trying to meet their responsibilities but on those who come to the courthouse and expect, as every American citizen, every American family, and every American business should, that they will be handled fairly and in an expedited fashion. 
I think it is time for us to act as a Senate on these two nominees. I will stand on this floor and gladly defend each of these nominees because I know the stellar qualities that they bring to this appointment. But the Senate has to meet its responsibility. It has to call these names for consideration. 
We have seen, unfortunately, over the last year or so, a pattern in the Senate which is distressing. Last year, President Clinton had only 45 percent of the nominees for the Federal bench that he sent to the Senate who were actually confirmed. You may say that probably is what the average is, is it not? In fact, it is not. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the confirmation rate of their nominees, by a Democratic Senate, was substantially higher--70 and 80 percent. 
Some of the Republicans say, `I wish the President would send us more qualified people.' Yet when you take a look at the ratings of the President's nominees by the American Bar Association compared to the nominees sent by President Reagan and President Bush, these are actually better nominees. They rate higher by the American Bar Association, one of the few standards that we use to grade men and women who are being appointed to the bench. So, clearly, we are being sent qualified people in a timely fashion to fill needs in Federal judicial courts across America. Yet the Senate acts too slowly or refuses to act. 
I stand here today and appeal to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to consider seriously these two nominees and bring them up for consideration this week. Under the rules of the Senate, I can put a hold, incidentally, on people and a hold on bills. I can even do that in secret. That is what the Senate lets me do. In other words, they cannot move the person, they cannot move the bill, if this one Senator decides he does not want them to move it. I have not done that. I have never done that to an individual, and I don't want to start. I don't think it's fair. I hope I never reach the point where I have to use that strategy. I would much rather see us vote on these men and women on their merits. If they are worthy of appointment to the Federal bench, let us take the action and make sure it happens. 
I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me and this week we can finally see the logjam broken, not only on these judicial appointments, but also on this critical legislation. With only 67 days left for us to go to work, let's make sure we do not miss the most important issues and challenges facing us. 
I yield the remainder of our time.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the concerned citizens in Chicago and around the world who have taken part in activities to commemorate the 39th Anniversary of the Tibetan People's Uprising of 1959. 
Since China's brutal invasion of Tibet in 1949, Chinese rule has brought oppression and misery to a proud people whose national history extends back 2,000 years. Tibet functioned fully as an independent nation-state from 1911 until 1951, when China imposed its notorious so-called `17-Point Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,' forcing the Tibetan government to acknowledge Chinese sovereignty. 
As China consolidated its power during the 1950s, refusing to permit even the regional autonomy permitted under the treaty, Tibetan resistance grew. It came to a head in the People's Uprising, which was suppressed by the Red Army at the cost of thousands of civilian lives. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's head of state and the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, was forced into exile in India, where he has been campaigning for the freedom of Tibet ever since. 
The International Campaign for Tibet estimates that, during the 20 years following the uprising, some 1.2 million Tibetans, about one fifth of the country's population, perished due to China's policies. Many more were imprisoned, went into exile, or disappeared. More than 6,000 monasteries, temples and other cultural and historic buildings were destroyed. The Chinese occupation of Tibet stands as a monument to the worst excesses of Communist tyranny.

Mr. DURBIN. I congratulate my friend from Wisconsin for his statement on behalf of his State. I have warm feelings about Wisconsin, as a southern neighbor in the State of Illinois. 
I am happy to report that of my three children, one is a graduate of Marquette, my son; my daughter is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin at Madison; and our third child married a young man from Janesville, the Senator's hometown, so we have our bases covered in Wisconsin. 
That does not suggest I will be rooting for the Packers when they play the Bears, but I thank the Senator for his comments on behalf of his great State.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning I rise to discuss an issue which I hope Americans will come to realize is one of the most timely issues facing the U.S. Congress. Consider for a moment this is supposed to be a year of short sessions on Capitol Hill. Members of the House and Senate, anxious to return to their States and districts, hope to do the people's business in short order and go back home. They suggest that perhaps we have about 68 days of session remaining for this calendar year, which is an amazingly short session. 
I am concerned that we not forget during the course of the remaining days the high priority that faces us when it comes to the tobacco legislation. It is a high priority because each day, every day in the United States of America, 3,000 children start smoking for the first time. A third of those kids will ultimately become addicted and their lives will become shortened because of tobacco-related death and disease. This is a tragedy that is repeated every single day. So far this year, about 240,000 children in America have started their nicotine addiction. We have a chance through tobacco legislation to start reducing that number substantially. Every day that we wait, every day that we miss, we are certain that more kids will become addicted to this product. 
The tobacco companies understand there is a lot at stake here. Of course, they saw the lawsuits from 42 different States attorneys general and concluded that they needed to reach some kind of a settlement. They have gone on now to buy full-page ads in newspapers. In this morning's Wall Street Journal they urge the public to consider the importance of a tobacco settlement. It is nothing short of amazing that the tobacco industry, which years ago thumbed its noses at the public policy leaders of the United States and the public health experts, now starts talking in very positive terms about the fact that we need to do something--a massive, sustained assault against underage smoking, paid for by the tobacco companies, when each and every day they are addicting 3,000 more children. 
I say to the people who are following this debate it is no accident that these kids start smoking. They are appealed to by the advertising of tobacco companies. It is subtle, it is pervasive, and from their point of view, it is very effective. 
I hope that in this debate on tobacco legislation we do not lose sight of what is really at stake. First, right now in the State of Minnesota where Attorney General Skip Humphrey is vigorously prosecuting an action against tobacco companies, we are learning every single day of the depth of the deception of the tobacco companies. Because of Attorney General Humphrey's courage and initiative, they now have some 39,000 documents which the tobacco companies over the years have refused to publicize, which are now being ordered to be made public by the court. Tobacco companies, naturally, don't want us to see them, so they have taken this case on appeal. There are another 103,000 documents which may involve children in advertising and other topics which should be released. 
I hope that these documents see the light of day because, as these documents are disclosed, we begin to realize the insidious campaign by the tobacco industry to lure our youth into addiction. The tobacco companies have systematically lied about what they know about their products. They have known for a long, long time that their products cause death and disease. They have known that their products are addictive. They have known that they are appealing to children. And yet they have categorically denied it. One of the most outrageous scenes in the history of Congress occurred before a subcommittee chaired by Congressman Waxman several years ago when the executives of the tobacco companies stood up under oath and swore that tobacco was not addictive. What an outrage. And the same executives of the same companies came before that committee and said, `No, we are to not appealing to children. No, we are not trying to encourage high nicotine tobacco to addict people even more.' We can't believe a word they say. Now, when their successors in ownership in these tobacco companies buy full-page ads and tell the American people what a great deal they have for them, I hope there is a healthy degree of skepticism across America. 
Let me tell you something else that needs to be taken into consideration in this debate. Not only has the tobacco industry systematically hidden the truth from the American people, they have had the opportunity in their own research to realize the devastation of their product and they have refused to acknowledge it. Time and again, we learn of the suppression of scientific research which could have saved lives. 
Thinking of the billions of dollars of profits that this industry has made at the expense of death and disease in America is an outrage. 
They have also tried to manipulate nicotine levels. They don't just take the tobacco leaves that come from the field and put them in the cigarettes and sell them to America. They like to spike the nicotine in there, get the addiction levels higher so you can't quit. How many people have you run into who said, `I wish I could quit. I have tried everything. I chew the gum, put on the patch, go through hypnosis, go through acupuncture, try everything imaginable, and I cannot quit.' 
The tobacco companies had a role in that because they were making their product more addictive. They focused their marketing at children--imagine that. We are so concerned, and rightly so, about the scourge of drugs in America, narcotics and what it means to America's kids, but the single greatest addiction of our children is the addiction to nicotine, tobacco, and ultimately death and disease are a result of it. They have known this. The tobacco companies have been hawking their products to kids across America for decades. They lose a substantial number of their best customers each year. They lose about 400,000 who die because of tobacco-related death and disease and then about 1.5 million who quit. They have to find 2 million new customers each year. You know what. They won't find them in adults. They find them in playgrounds, in school yards, in children who make a decision to smoke and, unfortunately, become addicted. 
Let me tell you what we have to look for in legislation here on Capitol Hill. We have to have performance standards that hold tobacco companies accountable so that we can look year to year to see if the number of children across America is being reduced for smoking. That can be done. It can be done by an aggressive advertising campaign, an aggressive campaign to enforce the laws across America in terms of illegal sales to minors. Any bill that comes to us for consideration on the floor that doesn't have performance standards for children should be rejected. 
Second, we have to give the Food and Drug Administration the power to fight this industry. Don't believe we can pass this bill and walk away. We have to give the agency the power to regulate nicotine, to make sure the tobacco companies don't get up to their old tricks again and come up with this high nicotine tobacco leaf to addict people even more. We have to make sure the tobacco industry pays and pays, in an amount that will not only compensate for the losses they have created across America, but to discourage kids from buying this product. I believe $1.50 per pack as a fee is a minimum--a minimum. To go less than that is really to not address the serious problem that faces us. 
This whole question of immunity, that is what it is about. That is why they are buying the ads. The tobacco companies want off the hook. They don't want people who are addicted today and die tomorrow to either sue personally or have their estates bring a lawsuit. They want to get out of this courtroom scene in a hurry. They want to get back to the boardroom scene where they make billions of dollars. I tell you this, we should not trade away the liability of these companies, because we believe as politicians that is the only way to hold this industry accountable. I hope there is enough political will among Democrats and Republicans to make sure that we have an agreement that is sensible. 
Finally, let us not, in the name of reaching a tobacco settlement, protect America's kids and endanger children around the world. The strategy of the tobacco companies in America is to export their product overseas. We used to have an image of America abroad, the stars and stripes, the great American image. You know what it is today? It is the cancer cowboy, the Marlboro man. You can find him on the streets and billboards in Warsaw, Poland; Bangkok, Thailand, all around the world. The new image of America, a sad image of America, an image of death and disease being promoted by the companies that are shameless in their efforts to exploit and addict children around the world. We cannot stand for that. It is a moral embarrassment to the United States of America if our legislation does not include strict limitations on the sale and advertising of American tobacco products overseas. We can do it. We should do it. 
For a century this Congress has enjoyed a reputation as a leader in the world in public health. Let us not in this next century bear the burden of a country that has exported death and disease by American tobacco. I hope that we pass this bill and pass it soon. For those who wonder whether we can get it done, I ask them to consider the following. Count the days remaining in the session. 
Count the children who become addicted to this product every day; count the lives that will be lost if we don't act; count on our responsibility in the Senate and the House to move this legislation as quickly as possible. 
I yield the remainder of my time.  
Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program and my opposition to any attempt to weaken or eliminate the program. Under the DBE program federal transportation trust funds from user fees are distributed by the Department of Transportation (DoT) through state DoTs and state and local mass transit agencies. These agencies are required to establish a 10 percent goal for the trust funds they receive, but are afforded tremendous flexibility in reaching those goals. If a state agency or prime contractor is unable to find enough qualified subcontractors to perform the work, they are allowed to apply for a waiver or lower goal. In short, the DBE program does not establish a quota nor a set-aside program. 
The opponents of the DBE program argue that this sort of flexible, constitutional affirmative action flies in the face of the American people's disagreement with affirmative action. This is simply not true. A Wall Street Journal poll published in November of last year found that 48 percent of Americans favor affirmative action and only 43 percent oppose. In addition, the voters in Houston last year rejected a Proposition 209-like initiative by 55 to 45 percent, thus, demonstrating the people's commitment to affirmative action. 
Moreover, since the opponents of affirmative action often offer no alternative other than the promise of a society free from all prejudice against women and minorities, they must implicitly believe that discrimination no longer exists in this country. Either that, or they are not concerned that there are still very real disparities between the races and genders. Both alternatives are troubling. 
The reality of these disparities is still disturbing. In a recent Urban Institute study identical black and white college students posed as test subjects in an experiment designed to measure the extent of racial discrimination in employment. The subjects were identical in dress, had the same resumes, and had scripted presentations. The only variable was race. Whites received job offers 41 percent more often than blacks. For those who received job offers, the wages whites were offered were 17 percent higher than the wages offered to blacks. 
Another recent study conducted by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that 96 percent of the senior managers of the Fortune 1000 Industrials and the Fortune 500 Companies are male; 97 percent are white; 0.6 percent (that is, less than one percent) are black; 0.4 percent are Latino; and 0.3 percent are Asian. 
Sadly, I am concerned that the arguments waged against the DBE program are not truly criticisms of the program but are merely thinly veiled attacks on civil rights itself. Although I respect the DBE program opponents' right to disagree on these issues, I find it disturbing that the underlying theme of their arguments against the program boil down to this: `Minorities and women may have been discriminated against in the past--they may even still be discriminated against today--but we, the majority, are no longer going to provide remedial efforts to counteract this discrimination. Enough is enough.' 
This sentiment runs counter to this country's dedication to civil rights and humanitarianism. To preserve our civil rights and to earn equal rights for all we must acknowledge the disappointing reality that we have not yet achieved a color or gender blind society. By attacking the DBE program, the opponents of the program are also dismantling the steps of progress we have made toward a nation we all want--a nation where there will be no reason to debate civil rights and where color and gender are not determinative of opportunity.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. 
Let me at the outset salute my colleagues, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, who are, on a bipartisan basis, offering an amendment today which is critically important to the safety of American families. 
America has learned the dangers of drunk driving. Americans understand that we lose one of our neighbors, or one of our children, or one of our friends, or one of the people we work with every 30 minutes to a drunk driver--every 30 minutes. America understands that this law which we are debating will save 500 to 600 lives each year. It will spare countless parents, spouses, and friends from the senseless tragedy of drunk driving deaths. 
America understands. Does the U.S. Senate understand? The vote will answer the question in just a few moments. 
Let me address the issue of States rights. I don't believe this debate is about States rights. I think it is time, in this particular situation, to reject this well-worn argument when it comes to saving lives. 
I can remember this argument about States rights a few years ago when I served in the House because there was a hodgepodge of standards around the United States. In some States you could drink at the age of 18, some at the age of 21, and we decided to make it uniform. The States said this is a mistake, that the Federal Government shouldn't to it, that it is the heavy hand of Central Government trying to impose its will on States. Of course, it made no sense. 
In my home State of Illinois, where the kids at night would drive across the border to Wisconsin and drink legally and then drive home drunk, killing themselves and innocent people, it made no sense. We rejected it. We said it will be a national uniform standard drinking age of 21. What we are saying here is that we will have a national uniform standard when it comes to drunk driving. 
This debate is not about protecting States rights. This debate is about protecting families that live in every State. It is about protecting families who go on vacation from State to State and worry about their safety. It is about people who go to the store and think it is just a casual trip in the car and find, because of a drunk driver, that a fatal accident or a serious accident resulting. That is what this debate is really about. Families that cross State lines shouldn't fear that there is more danger in one State or the other to drunk drivers. 
I think we have to react to the reality of the number of Americans who are losing their lives each year because of drunk driving. 
The New York Times probably said it best in the title to its editorial: `One Nation, Drunk or Sober.' Should it be a different standard in each State because of the issue of States rights? Can you imagine going to the funeral home, can you imagine meeting with the grieving parents, or the students when someone has lost a classmate, and saying, `I am sorry we cannot do more on drunk driving because it is an issue of States rights?' How empty that argument sounds when we are talking about saving lives. 
When you look at the groups that are supporting this, listen to what the Wall Street Journal has to say. This is no liberal organization. It is pretty conservative. And they say: 
Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, not the lobby for Hooters and Harrah's. The Lautenberg-DeWine-Lowey amendment isn't a drive toward prohibition but an uphill push toward health consensus. 
Then go to the experts--not only the health experts--who will tell you that the impairment of drivers at .08 is a serious matter. They estimate that some 40 percent of all of the alcohol-related accidents occur with people who have been drinking and have imbibed at a level that doesn't quite reach .10 but is at .08, and still is very serious. 
Then, of course, go beyond the health experts. Talk to the law enforcement people--the people who respond to these accidents, the people who have to see the tragedy when someone makes a terrible decision to drink and drive and, as a consequence, lives are lost and people are injured. They stand shoulder to shoulder begging us to pass this Lautenberg-DeWine amendment, as does the organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
I want to salute them especially. This is the type of political movement in America which is really, I guess, unique to our country; people who have been touched by tragedy come together and say, `Let's make a difference; let's spare other lives that might be lost.' Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, Students Against Drunk Driving in Illinois and around the Nation have really led this debate. 
I am happy to stand in support of the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. I think doing this will not only save lives, but it will put to rest once and for all this empty argument that this is really about States rights. This is about much more. It is about the rights of every family in every State to get on the highway and to realize that they can be safe. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the President. 
Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of baseball's most colorful contributors, Harry Caray. I join my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, in cosponsoring this resolution. 
Baseball fans, from Chicago to St. Louis to Oakland, often heard Harry's trademark greeting over the last 53 seasons. He used to start out by saying, `Hello everybody, this is Harry Caray at the ballpark.' Harry was a fan's friend, the guy who spoke for us all, our eyes and ears in the broadcast booth. Every day from April to October, he invited us aboard for an irresistible ride, to enjoy a kid's game and have the time of our lives doing it. 
Harry Caray was more than baseball's goodwill ambassador, he was ever youthful, a voice who crossed the generations. He was the pied piper of fun, the white-haired kid in the oversized horned-rim glasses who made us feel better for the experience of sharing the game he loved from our seats at home listening to a radio or in front of a television set. 
Harry Caray broadcast his first St. Louis Cardinals game in 1945, five days after the death of President Franklin Roosevelt and his final game with the Chicago Cubs last year. He met every president from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton. 
As a boy, I tuned in KMOX from across the river in East St. Louis many a night. While I was supposed to be asleep, I heard Harry Caray rooting hard and hoping for a Cardinal victory or, like the fan he was, bemoaning a misplay or failure in the clutch with those disheartened words `Popped it up!' 
But, Harry taught us never to give up hope, especially when someone like Stan `The Man' Musial came to the plate. `Musial waves that magic wand,' Harry would say. `He's in that familiar stance. Now the pitch. Here it comes. There she goes!!! It might be, it could be, IT IS! A HOME RUN. HOLY COW!!!' 
I will remember forever in 1966 as a kid fresh out of college going to Sparta, IL, just south of St. Louis, late at night to meet with a party official, and it was dark outside. There were no street lights. I had a street address. But I couldn't see the numbers on the houses. I had to get out and walk around. It was in August. You would have thought that they had a PA system in that town with Harry Caray on it. Everybody was sitting in the backyard and on the front porch listening to KMOX and the Cardinals from house to house and yard to yard. You didn't miss a play. That is the kind of devotion that Harry Caray brought. 
In 1970, after 25-unforgettable seasons in St. Louis, Harry Caray hit the road. He stopped in Oakland, but he needed the hot-blooded passion the Midwest brought to the game. So back he came a year later to a new town, Carl Sandberg's City of Big Shoulders, to announce White Sox games. It was a match for the ages. Chicago, the raucous city that never slept, fun, exciting, alive, and Harry Caray, who loved the city and its people so much he couldn't get enough of it. Chicago reciprocated in kind as witnessed by the unprecedented outpouring of tributes this past week. 
After eleven seasons, the bloom wore off the rose on the South Side, so he crossed town. With the superstation power of WGN carrying Cubs games, and another Sandberg, Ryne, to extol, Harry Caray became the first genuine superstar on cable television, selling baseball and the Cubs around the world. 
Another memory I have was having been elected to Congress and I made one of my first trips out of the country to Costa Rica. I went into San Jose, Costa Rica, checked into a hotel in the middle of the day, walked in, put my suitcase down, flipped on the light, turned on the TV, and there was Harry Caray's voice in San Jose, Costa Rica, again broadcasting the Cubs. 
Harry Caray missed out on just three things during his 16-years with the Cubs: a World Series, retirement that he never sought, nor desired, and the thrill of sharing the mike on a day-to- day basis with his grandson, Chip. 
A few years ago, Harry, his son Skip who does such outstanding work with the Atlanta Braves, and Chip, broadcast a Cubs-Atlanta game. It was the only time three generations of one family, the Carays, ever called a major league contest. 
In Illinois, only one thing is more contentious than politics. It's baseball. Downstate from Springfield south is Cardinals' country. Up north, Cub fans are every bit as vocal and spirited. Then, there's the intra-city matter of the Cubs versus the White Sox. One man, and one man alone bridged that gulf. To paraphrase Harry, now here was the only guy who broadcast baseball games for the Cardinals, White Sox, and Cubs, and remains loved by all. 
Mr. President, Harry Caray's nonstop sprint through life lasted 83-far-too-brief years. As someone put it the other day, Harry joined another team this week--the `Angels.' 
If old Harry is up there, and I am sure he is, there is one thing I can guarantee. The cherubim, the seraphim, the saints, and the heavenly choirs will be taking a break from singing `Amazing Grace,' and will join old Harry in a chorus of `Take me out to the ball game.' 
So long, Harry, and thanks for all those great memories.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Saturday morning, in the early morning hours, my wife and I received a telephone call that was a shock to us. A dear friend and close political ally of ours, State Senator Penny Severns of Decatur, IL, had succumbed to cancer in the early morning hours. 
I have literally known Penny Severns for over 25 years, since she was a college student. I followed her political career. We had become close and fast friends. The outpouring of genuine warmth and affection for Penny that we have heard over the last few days since the announcement of her death has been amazing. 
Penny Severns was 46 years old. A little over 3 1/2 years ago, she was running for Lieutenant Governor in the State of Illinois, and she discovered during the course of the campaign that she had breast cancer. I think most people, upon hearing that they had cancer, would stop in their tracks, would not take another day on the job, would head for the hospital and the doctor and say that the rest of this could wait. But not Penny Severns. She announced that she was going through the chemotherapy and radiation and then would return to the campaign trail. And she did. 
I will tell you, in doing that, she inspired so many of us 
because her strength, her caring, her spirit, were just so obvious. She finished that campaign and was reelected to the State Senate and announced last year she was going to run for secretary of state in our State of Illinois. She filed her petitions, and within a week or so it was discovered she had another cancerous tumor, and in December she went into the hospital to have it removed. She went through the radiation and chemotherapy afterwards and had a very tough time. Unfortunately, she succumbed to the cancer in the early morning hours last Saturday. 
It is amazing to me how a young Democratic State Senator like this could attract the kind of friends she did in politics. Penny was not wishy-washy; when she believed in something, she stood up for it. Yet, if you listened to Republicans and Democrats alike who have come forward to praise her for her career, you understand that something unique is happening here. 
There is so much empty praise in politics. We call one another `honorable' when we are not even sure that we are. But in this case, people are coming forward to praise State Senator Penny Severns because she truly was unique, not just because she fought on so many important political issues and gave all of her strength in doing that, but because of her last fight, which was her personal fight against cancer, and the fact that she just would not give up and would not give in. 
Breast cancer has taken a toll on her family. She lost a younger sister to breast cancer a few years ago, and her twin sister is in remission from breast cancer today. Penny dedicated herself, in the closing years of her service, to arguing for more medical research when it came to breast cancer--not just for her family, but for everybody. That is part of her legacy. She will be remembered for that good fight and so many others. 
I have to be honest with the Presiding Officer and the other Members. I would rather not be here at this moment. I would rather be in Decatur, IL, because in just a few hours there will be a memorial service for Penny Severns. My wife will be there, and I wish I could be there, too. But if there is one person in Illinois who would understand why I had to be here on the campaign finance reform debate, it was Penny Severns. I am going to miss her and so will a lot of people in Illinois. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding to me. 
Mr. President, when I try to understand the logic of those who oppose this bipartisan campaign finance reform and try to understand their thinking, which concludes that both the rich and the poor in America should have the right to purchase millions of dollars in television time, my mind is drawn to a movie, the movie `Titanic.' 
What is the link between the opposition to McCain-Feingold and the fate of the Titanic? On the Titanic, only 5 percent of the first-class women passengers drowned; more than 50 percent of all 
the women in the lowest class cabin drowned. 
Now, in the eyes of those who oppose McCain-Feingold, everyone on the Titanic had the right to a lifeboat. Unfortunately, they would have to conclude, I guess, that those passengers in first-class cabins were just better swimmers. In fact, on the Titanic, they locked the doors of the cabin class until all the lifeboats had been opened for first-class passengers. 
It reminds me too of their logic that the rich need to have their opportunity to exercise free speech. It reminds me of the old case in law school or the old story in law school that said the law, in its infinite wisdom, makes it a crime for the wealthy as well as the homeless to sleep under bridges. That gives us an insight, I think, into the thought processes that guide those who oppose this bipartisan campaign finance reform. 
We have to understand what the result of the current campaign financing system is. It is a system without rules and without any moral grounding. It is a system heavily weighted in favor of the insiders, the grifters and those middle-age crazy millionaires who just cannot get the melody of `Hail to the Chief' out of their minds. The flaw in their thinking in supporting the current campaign system is their conclusion that campaign spending limitations restrain speech. 
I know the Supreme Court reached that decision over 20 years ago. And I guess there is some value that the Supreme Court Justices by and large have never been political candidates. They have not been sullied by this nasty process. But that decision and their conclusion lacked any grounding in the real world of campaigns. 
The campaign system we have today, where wealth buys speech, creates in fact, if not in law, a restraint on speech more insidious than any frontal assault on the first amendment. We give the candidates of modest means a throat lozenge and a soap box and give the wealthiest candidates the magic lantern of television and all its proven power of persuasion. The opponents to McCain-Feingold are blind to this obvious disparity and its consequences. 
Now in this debate over changing our campaign system, if you stay tuned today, and perhaps later in the week, do not be surprised that the `haves' in politics are unwilling to concede any ground to the `have-nots.' 
If Machiavelli did not write this axiom, he should have: `No party in power will ever willingly surrender the means by which they came to power.' 
The Republican party is and always has been more adept at fundraising. They seldom lose for lack of money, only for lack of talent or ideas. And now we have a situation where eight Republicans have stood up and said that they are for campaign finance reform. They deserve our praise. It took courage for them to do it. 
John McCain, who has joined Senator Russ Feingold, deserves that recognition, as well as Senators Chafee, Susan Collins, Tim Hutchinson, Jim Jeffords, Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter and Fred Thompson. But I hope we can rally some more Republican support to join the 45 Democrats who are on the record for real reform. 
Step back for a minute and ask yourself this question: Is the current campaign system serving America? Not whether it is good for Democrat or Republican incumbents or challengers. Is it serving America? 
Let me show you two charts to take a look at. This is an interesting chart because it shows on this red line the percentage of eligible voters who are actually registered. 
Back in 1964, 64 percent of eligible voters actually registered. By 1996, the number was up to 74.4 percent. That is good news, isn't it? More Americans are signing up to vote. We certainly want to encourage that. But look down here at the bottom line. Look at the turnout of voters for Presidential elections. The high number--61.92 percent over here in 1964--look how high it was in comparison to those eligible to vote who actually 
registered, and then look what happens in 1996, 49.08 percent actually turned out to vote for President. 
So, 74.4 percent eligible, 49 percent turned out, the lowest percentage turnout of eligible voters since 1924. In 1924, the first year when women were allowed to vote, it was a year when it was an extraordinary count. There were more eligible women than actually voted. You have to go back to 1830 to find this low a turnout.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. 
This chart really brings home the issue what we are faced with. In 1960, the total amount of money spent in the United States of America on all Federal, State and local campaigns--$175 million. Watch it grow. Watch it grow dynamically until we get to $4 billion, the estimate of the amount spent in 1996 on all political campaigns. 
But look what is happening to the voters. When we are spending $175 million, 63 percent of the voters turned out. As we get up to $4 billion in spending, we are down to 49% of the voters showing up for the Presidential election year. 
If you were running a company and you said to your marketing division, `I want you to double the advertising budget and sell more of our product,' and they come back in the next quarter and said, `We doubled the advertising budget and we're selling fewer products,' you would have to reach one of two conclusions: something was wrong with your advertising organization or something is wrong with your product. In politics there is something wrong with both. 
People are sick of our advertising. It is too negative. It is too nasty. These drive-by shooting ads that we have, 30-second ads by issue groups you never heard of, at the last minute of a campaign, and candidates, myself included, spending a lot of time groveling and begging for money, that does not help the process. It does not help our image. It does not encourage people to get involved. 
What McCain-Feingold is about is not just changing the law but changing the attitude of the public toward the political campaigns. And unless and until that happens, we face a very serious problem in this country. What McCain-Feingold goes after in eliminating soft money is something that has to happen. Soft money is what is left after all of the restrictions on hard money have been applied. 
For those who are not well versed in the language of politics and campaigns, `soft money' can be corporate money, it can be money that is given by a person that exceeds any kind of limitation. It can be money that is used indirectly to help a campaign. And that sort of expenditure has just mushroomed. 
I am glad that the legislation of Senator Feingold and Senator McCain is going to ban soft money. I also think it is critically important they do something about these issues ads. For goodness sakes, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, I have to disclose every penny raised and every penny spent. And when I put an ad on the air, I have to put an allocation at the bottom of each ad as to who paid for it and a little mug shot of myself so they can see my face. 
But these groups that appear out of nowhere come in, in the closing days of a campaign, and absolutely blister candidates in the name of issue advocacy groups that do not disclose one single item of fact about how they raise their money and how they spent it. Don't believe for a minute that there is some group called the `Campaign for Term Limits' that is running around shopping centers with kettles and bells collecting money. This is a special interest group, spending literally millions of dollars in our political process to defeat candidates in the name of an issue, and you do not know a thing about them. You do not know if they are funded by the tobacco companies, you do not know if they are funded by foreign money, you do not have a clue. That is not fair. 
What we have in the McCain-Feingold bill is an effort to finally--finally--bring some reality to this process and some sensibility to it. And it is long overdue. We have to make sure that we have a bustling, free marketplace of ideas. But the evidence is compelling that political megamergers of special interest groups like the NRA, Right to Life, Americans for Tax Reform, Chamber of Commerce, and even the AFL-CIO, which has clearly supported more Democrats than Republicans, all of these things are driving individuals with limited means and middle-range incomes out of the political process. 
To argue passionately as we have in America for `one man, one vote' as a pillar of democracy and ignore the gross disparity of resources available to pursue that vote is elitist myopia. 
I rise in support of this bill. And I hope that those who do support real campaign finance reform will not fall for proposals and poison pill amendments which will basically scuttle this effort. We have a rare opportunity to win back the American people and their confidence in our process. Defeating McCain-Feingold by procedural tricks and any other mechanism that they dream up is really not serving the future of this country and the future of our Republic. So I stand in strong support of McCain-Feingold, and thank my colleague from Wisconsin for yielding this time.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into the Record an amazing story of heroism and courage. Faced with the threat of severe injury to his 4-year-old brother, Michael, Christopher Simmons, an 8-year-old from Mt. Vernon, Illinois, boldly placed himself between his brother and a 95-pound dog. In doing so, Christopher demonstrated a profound sense of selflessness that is all too rarely reported. His heroism, as described in an article in the Mt. Vernon Register-News, was quite possibly the only thing that saved his younger brother from serious bodily harm. 
On April 6, 1997, as the boys' father, Phillip Simmons, spoke with the dog's owner, Christopher noticed the boxer playfully tugging at Michael's jacket. Suddenly, the dog lunged for the 4-year-old's throat. Christopher, without the slightest hesitation, stepped in front of the attacking dog and kicked it in the left eye. The dog, startled momentarily, became more angry and jumped onto Christopher, clawing and biting his chest. Fortunately, Christopher's quick thinking gave his father enough time to come to his aid, removing the dog from the boy's chest and subduing it until the owner arrived. 
Christopher received two chest wounds and lost a significant amount of blood. Michael, now 5 years old, needed surgery to repair a wounded jaw and a severely damaged ear. The dog's teeth barely missed nerves that help control the movements of the eyes and the jaw. If the dog had been able to do more harm to Michael, the little boy may not have survived.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay special tribute to a legendary radio personality, Steve Dahl, who today is celebrating his twentieth anniversary of broadcasting in Chicago, Illinois. 
At age sixteen, Steve launched his career into radio broadcasting. At the time, he was considered somewhat of a rebel on the airwaves, but over the years, Chicagoans have come to love his unique style and personality. 
With his afternoon talk-show, `The Steve Dahl Show,' on WCKG FM Chicago, Steve continues to entertain and inform more than a half million listeners everyday. As his loyal audience tunes in daily to hear his commentary on life in the Windy City, Steve's popularity continues to grow. 
Steve Dahl has made a lasting contribution to the Chicago radio industry. Today, I join his colleagues, listeners, friends and family to commend Steve for his impressive tenure on the Chicago airwaves.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, no Senator from the State of Illinois could rise on February 12 without noting the birth date of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln never served in the Senate, although he did serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of his most famous political experiences was in 1858 when he ran against Stephen Douglas for the Senate seat which I am honored to occupy. Lincoln lost that election. Of course, following the course of the lengthy debates with Douglas, which became part of the legend of American politics and an important part of our history, by 1860 Lincoln was elected President. And we all know his leadership was so critical in one of our Nation's greatest hours. 
We in Illinois dote on Abraham Lincoln. We have his name on license plates. In my hometown, we are consumed with the Lincoln legend and with all that he has given to the State and to the Nation. I hope that those who are witnessing the events in this Chamber today will reflect for a moment on this great man and the great legacy he left to the United States. Lincoln was known very well for his leadership at the time the Nation was in great peril with the Civil War. He did so many things with vision, and I think it is a perfect lead in to my reason for standing before the Senate today. I hope those of us who are in successor generations to Abraham Lincoln can rise to the challenges and can show the same type of vision and leadership on the challenges now facing Americans across the country.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just left a meeting, partisan meeting, Democrats, Senators and Congressmen, with the President and Vice President where we discussed our agenda for this year. At the end of the meeting, President Clinton said that he hoped we could reach across the aisle to the Republican side and find common ground, concede honest differences of opinion but move forward on an agenda which is critically important to all of America's population and families. 
I know it is ambitious to think that in a year with an abbreviated schedule we will achieve even a majority of the ideas that were propounded at this meeting or that the Democrats stand for--for that matter, that the Republicans stand for--but we would be remiss if we didn't try. I think we were all sent here to use our best efforts to find common ground and to resolve those difficulties that ordinary Americans face. 
One of them I have taken a special interest in and over the last month or so have really focused on in the State of Illinois is the issue of child care. I have visited 16 or 18 child care centers in my State from far south in Cairo, as we pronounce it, to Chicago and across the length and breadth of a very diverse State, my home State of Illinois. 
What I find in child care for working families in Illinois is extraordinary diversity. Just about every community in which you stop has a little different approach. It seems that some are blessed with the support of larger institutions. Maybe the most modern, up-to-date and impressive facility was at a U.S. Air Force base, Scott Air Force Base near Belleville, IL. But, of course, the Federal Government has made a rather substantial investment so that the children of the men and women who are working on that base have the very best in child care. I then went as well to the Belleville Community College and saw where the community college made the same type of commitment. It makes a difference. You can just feel it in terms of what is being offered. 
That is not to diminish the efforts being made in a lot of different settings. When I would go down to Marion, IL, into the back of a church and find a very small and crowded room with the happiest kids I have ever run into, being supervised by a lady who is probably close to 60 years of age but who truly is devoted to these children, it tells you that what is part of the success of child care in America has to do more with the people involved in it than any Government program or any structure or building or any bricks or mortar. 
But having said that, I came away from this tour sensitized to the fact that this is a real issue. So many people in America look at the Senate and the House of Representatives and wonder what newspapers we are reading, what people we are talking to, as we are consumed with issues that seem totally irrelevant. 
Now, some of those issues are truly important, but for the average working family their concerns are much more down to earth. I have yet to meet a working mother or a working family with small children where I don't find a genuine concern about day care. My wife and I raised three kids, and we were fortunate; my wife was able to stay home until the kids were all off to kindergarten at least. And I think that was the very best that we could give to them. I look back on it as something that really made a positive impression, a positive difference in their life, and yet we know today that so many parents cannot 
make that choice, that both parents have to work or if it is a single parent that there is just no alternative but to turn the children over to a care giver during the day. And we also know that care giving in day care is occurring at a critical moment in that child's development. Seventy-five percent of the human brain is developed in the first 18 months on Earth. Most of the day care centers I visited would not accept a child until they had reached the age of 2 or until they were out of diapers. And so for the first 2 years of critical brain development in these children it was a gamble. Was there someone nearby that could be counted on, a neighbor or relative, perhaps some other setting where the child would get honest, good, safe care? 
What the President has proposed in his State of the Union Address and I hope that Democrats and Republicans can debate is what we can do to help working families provide for quality child care. I honestly believe that the investment in early childhood development is the best investment this Nation can make. You often wonder how a child born in ordinary or even poor circumstances has much of a chance. They usually have a chance if they have loving parents with the skills and the time and the resources to make their living meaningful. I came from a family of modest means but, thank goodness, had a mother and father who cared, and I think that is why I am standing here today. 
But for a lot of kids that option is strained because a lot of parents do not have resources, and as a consequence they look around in the system and find precious few alternatives. First, most child care is expensive. It is expensive for families that are trying to get by and trying to pay the bills. 
What the President has suggested is that we, through money raised in the tobacco bill, send those revenues back to States to make available to working families. So that those families that are out struggling, trying to get by will have a helping hand from the Government to pay for child care. I think that is money well spent, and there is no two ways about it. 
Secondly, we have to ask who will work in these child care centers. It is a fact of life that most of the people working there receive precious more than the minimum wage, and they look for alternatives. The turnover rate nationally is 40 percent and in some communities even higher each year as child care workers move on to another job. 
In Illinois, we demand of these workers 2 years of college education and then give them a minimum wage. High school dropouts are paid a minimum wage. These students who stayed in school and worked hard to pass the courses are basically being asked to work for the same. Then, of course, we know that businesses that invest in child care really do bond with their employees. Employees value this as one of the most important benefits of work. 
So the President has said not only money to help families pay for child care, also some resources to make certain we can help the students who want to get the education, qualify to be child care assistants but encouragement as well in the Tax Code to businesses to set up child care centers. 
Each day, three out of five children under the age of 6 in America including almost half of the babies and toddlers spend some or all of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. In my home State, we estimate about 600,000 children each day under the age of 6 are in child care. The cost--$4,000 to $10,000 a year. Think about a person struggling by on a low-wage job and facing $4,000--$80 a week--that has to be out of pocket and paid for child care. 
In our agenda, the Democratic agenda, we set out to change this, to try to make certain that working families are given a helping hand. 
I have tried to reflect about the course of history when it comes to caring for children in America. We all remember child labor laws and things that have been done to help kids, but in the 19th century we made the most significant decision when we said in America that we would embark on creating a system of public education so that if you happened to be a child from a family of modest means you still had a fighting chance. America cared and America made a commitment through the State and local units of Government to make certain that public education would be there starting at the age of 6 and it was a sensible commitment, not only for the good of the child but the good of the Nation. 
Here today as we embark on the 21st century we know so much more. We know that by the age of 6 many children have gone through important formative years, many children have been trained, for good or bad, and that that training is going to be part of that child for years to come. 
So what more can we do? What more should we do? We have created a Head Start program which is designed to give these kids, at least those from 3 to 5, a chance to have a structured, positive learning environment. It is a very good program and one that needs to be funded at higher levels. But now we know even more is needed. Are we ready in this Chamber, Democrats and Republicans alike, to really engage in a national debate about whether the model for the 19th century of public education is adequate for the 21st century for America? 
Most educators, if they give you an honest appraisal, will say, if they were given the option of one additional year of mandatory education, they would not put it after high school, they would put it before kindergarten. 
Bring the children in earlier. 
Talk to teachers, if you will, who are in classrooms every day. They can identify kids who come from a good family and home, where one parent stayed home to help raise the child or they went through some good child care and received the right training, and they can identify those kids who did not. Some of them fall behind, never to catch up. So one of the things we are striving for this year is to follow the President's lead and make sure we make a commitment here in the Senate and the House of Representatives to help these families.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding this time. 
Crucial to this question of providing help for child care is providing the revenue. I find it curious that a year ago, in my first year in the Senate, if you would have come to this Chamber about this time, you would have seen Senator Orrin Hatch, our colleague from Utah, standing at that desk with a stack of budget books almost up over his head, saying this is the legacy of deficits, these are the unbalanced budgets that we cannot come to grips with, and arguing for the passage of a new constitutional amendment to force us to come to balance in our budget. That was a year ago. That amendment did not pass. 
A year later, where are we? We are at a point where the Congressional Budget Office gave us their forecast yesterday that, indeed, we would balance the budget. We have reached the point where the budget is in balance. Ironically, instead of talking about a constitutional amendment to force a balanced budget, we are now engaged in a debate about spending a surplus. Imagine, 12 months later we have gone from deficit talk to surplus talk. The President counsels us to be patient, to make sure the surplus is true and honest and to first dedicate it to Social Security. 
So, of course, you are going to say, `Senator Durbin, having said that, how are you going to pay for child care? How will the President pay for it? These are good ideas, but they have to be paid for.' 
The money is to come from the tobacco bill. This is a bill I have supported both as introduced by Senator Kennedy and yesterday by Senator Conrad, because it is a bill which addresses the reality of what we face today with tobacco. This bill imposes a $1.50 health fee on each package of cigarettes. We know that discourages kids from buying them. They are too 
expensive. It takes the revenues from that to not only educate young people about the dangers of smoking but also to use it for other good purposes: for example, to increase the number of public school teachers across America to 100,000 so that no child in the first, second or third grade will have a classroom with more than 18 students, or to put money into medical research. 
Let me tell you that has to be the most widely popular Federal expenditure there is. Not a family touched by cancer, heart disease, diabetes, HIV, would ever suggest that that is not a good investment, to put the money into medical research. But, also, a portion of it for child care. 
So, in order to make this work, it is not enough for us, as Democrats and Republicans, to make speeches about child care. We have to roll up our sleeves and pass this tobacco legislation, and we have to do it on a bipartisan basis. The tobacco companies will resist us every step of the way. They have. They will continue to. But I think the American people have decided they have had enough of the tobacco companies and the fact that they have had unreasonable sway over Washington for too long a period of time. 
This year, 1998, is a year of political testing for Senators and Congressmen as to whether they will rise to the challenge and join in passing tobacco legislation, reducing the scourge of children who are taking up smoking, and raising revenues for things that are critically important for America's future--like child care. 
I am happy to support the legislation that has been introduced, and I hope that we come up with bipartisan approval to make sure that it is passed. It is not just a question of raising this revenue, but the core reason for the tobacco legislation is to discourage the young Americans each day who take up smoking. Today in the United States of America, and every single day this year, 3,000 children will start smoking cigarettes for the first time. I have never, repeat never, met a parent who has said to me, `I got the best news last night. My son came home and announced he started smoking.' I have never heard that. In fact, just the opposite. Parents are concerned because they know this is a health concern. 
Tobacco companies have deceived the public. They have deceived Congress. They have gone after kids for decades. Now we have a chance to call an end to that and to hold these companies accountable to reduce sales to minors and to make certain that our kids have a fighting chance for a bright future. 
So, I will conclude by saying our agenda is filled this year. We may have more items on the agenda than they have days in session. But we need to pick and choose those that are critically important. I hope my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, will agree that passing the tobacco bill is the first important step, then taking the revenues from that to help working families bring their children up under the best circumstances and to give these children a fighting chance to enter school ready to learn and to have a bright future. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to suggest that we should not be rushing to consider a bill that may do far more than ban human cloning permanently. The Lott-Bond cloning bill was only introduced last Tuesday and has been available for review for a very short period of time. The identical bill that was introduced by Senator Bond was referred to the Judiciary Committee and yet we have had no Judiciary committee hearings on this topic to examine exactly what this bill does. Is the bill really written to accomplish its goal of banning the duplication of humans via this new technology? Or does it go much further than its stated goal? I don't think that many of us here on the floor of the Senate (myself included) are well equipped to make that determination without hearing from experts in the field including scientists, bioethicists, theologians and others qualified to give us advice on this very important matter. 
It is also not clear as to why we are rushing to consider this bill given that the FDA has already announced that it has authority over this area. In fact I have a letter here in my hand from the FDA that explains that before any human cloning would be allowed to proceed, FDA would need proof that the technology was safe. FDA will prohibit any sponsor of a clinical study from developing this technology if `it is likely to expose human subjects to unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury' or `the clinical investigator was not qualified by reason of their scientific training and experience to conduct the investigation.' The letter goes on to say that `In the case of attempts to create a human being using cloning technology, there are major unresolved safety questions. Until those questions are appropriately addressed, the Agency would not permit any such investigation to proceed.' 
The National Bioethics Advisory Committee recommended a five year moratorium on the use of this technology to create a human being. Due to the time limit that they were under, the committee was unable to focus on the issues beyond safety. They concluded that, at this time, the technology was unsafe for use for the purpose of cloning a human being. They did not address the many ethical issues involved with the use of this technology. The committee believed that these issues were too complex to be dealt with in such a short period of time. Therefore, it is still necessary to allow time for discussion about the ethical use or need for a specific ban on the use of this technology. 
To date, we have excluded Patient groups, physicians, scientists and other interested parties from the discussion of how this particular bill should be drafted. Yet it is these very patients whose future hope for cures may be cut off by a bill if it is improperly drafted. 
I find it extremely troubling that we are rushing to consider a bill that every patient advocacy group, doctor, or scientist that has contacted my office has either urged us not to pass or has asked us to consider in a more deliberative manner. Organizations such as: The American Heart Association, the 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society for Human Genetics, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Pediatric Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Parkinson's Action Network, the AIDS Action Council, the American Academy of Pediatrics and 27 Science Nobel Laureates. These organizations and individuals are dedicated to finding cures for diseases. They are not advocates for unethical research. They are mainstream organizations committed to finding cures for such diseases as heart disease, strokes, spinal cord injuries, birth defects, asthma, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis. These are diseases that afflict millions of Americans. Biomedical research may be some patients with these illnesses only hope. 
For some, new technologies as yet undeveloped may be their only hope. For instance, some of my colleagues may have heard the story of Travis Roy. Travis is now a 21 yr old college student at Boston University. Travis grew up in Maine and was an avid ice hockey player. Unfortunately for Travis during his first collegiate hockey game 3 years ago, 11 seconds in to the game, he collided with the wall and suffered a spinal chord injury that has left him paralyzed with only a small amount of movement in his right hand. Travis has written a book about his experiences and his fight for recovery. For people like Travis that have had their spinal chords severely injured they look to new research that might help them regenerate their damaged tissue. As Travis so agonizingly stated recently: `All I want to be able to do is to hug my mother.' 
Researchers hope that they may be able to generate what are known as `stem cells,' that is cells that can give rise to lots of other cells, using the technology that the Lott-Bond cloning bill seeks to ban. With continuing research, those cells might be used to repair injured spinal cords or damaged livers or kidneys or hearts. 
Stem cell research could provide: cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn victims; neural cells for treating those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases; blood cells to treat cancer anemia and immunodeficiencies; neural cells to treat Parkinson's Huntington's and ALS. The generation of stem cell lines using an unfertilized egg as a host is far removed from the act of creating embryos for research or creating a fetus for organ parts. In fact, it is the exact opposite giving an avenue for therapies that involve the culturing of single cells from adult cells. Some of these therapies would actually result in fetal tissue no longer being necessary for the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. Others might give hope to parents that conceive children that have genetic diseases, so that they are not faced with the agonizing choice between terminating a pregnancy or giving birth to a severely disabled child. 
I think that many of us do not really know what the full scope for this technology really is. It is possible that this technology may be used in a life enhancing, life promoting 
manner. 
We should have a full hearings process with opportunities to hear from specialists in medical genetics, researchers at NIH and other institutions. We should listen to what the medical community has to say on treatment options. We should also hear from patient advocacy groups and all others that may have expertise in this area or be affected by the legislation at hand. Likewise, the area of assistive reproductive technology has become incredibly complex and we should listen to bioethicists and religious leaders and their opinions which we surely value. Again, I wonder why we are rushing here. What about the committee hearing process is the Republican leadership afraid of that? 
Some may argue that the announcement by the Chicago Physicist, Richard Seed of his intention to start cloning necessitates a rapid response. However, Dr. Seed has no training in medical procedures nor in biology. He does not have a lab for this purpose. He does not have the venture capital and in fact his home was recently foreclosed by the Bank. Thus to suggest that he will be cloning anything soon, seems outlandish at best. By the FDA's stated criteria of an investigator needing to demonstrate expertise, Dr. Seed would clearly fail and thus would be prohibited by FDA from proceeding. 
One person's far-fetched claims should not propel us into passing legislation that has not been adequately reviewed. As J. Benjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has said: `We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed.'

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to the position of Surgeon General. As many colleagues have noted, he is exceptionally well qualified for this position. He has been involved, throughout his professional career, in a very broad range of health issues and has championed improvements in all the areas that he has been involved with. 
I find it somewhat unusual that this appointment to an important position, though not a Cabinet-level position, seems to always attract such debate and such controversy. Certainly, we want someone with real leadership skill to serve as the Surgeon General; but why, time after time, do we find ourselves embroiled in a debate over who that person might be? Some critics will say it is the fault of President Clinton for bringing names before the Senate that are so controversial. Yet, I think if history serves me correctly, I believe Dr. Koop, an appointee of President Reagan's, was a controversial nominee. Dr. Koop caused a lot of people some concern. He had some rather strongly held personal views on a controversial issue, the issue of abortion. The Democratic-controlled Congress wrestled with his nomination and came to the conclusion that Dr. Koop's medical credentials and in the area of public health were so compelling that he should be given a chance to serve, even though a majority of the Democrats might disagree with his position on the issue of choice or abortion. It is a good thing we did because, despite our differences with Dr. Koop on that issue, he proved to be an exceptional leader on public health issues for America. In fact, some of the initiatives that Dr. Koop really spearheaded, I think, were so timely and so important that history will treat him very kindly. For example, alerting America at that moment in time to the dangers of HIV/AIDS was a controversial thing to do. Yet, he did it with the approval of the Reagan administration, at a time when it was appropriate. I think lives were saved as a result of that. So I have always drawn from the experience of Dr. Koop, who has become a friend of mine on the tobacco issues, that you should not judge a person on one life experience or one issue, but you should look at the totality of the circumstances, look at their values and principles and try to determine whether or not that person, man or woman, can do the job. 
That is why it is easy today to rise in support of Dr. David Satcher to fill the spot as our Surgeon General of the United States. Some of the areas he has worked in have been extraordinary. From increasing childhood immunization rates, to improving breast and cervical cancer screening, Dr. Satcher has been a leader. 
I want to focus on one aspect of his work at the CDC, in improving the Nation's food safety programs. Make no mistake--and I want to underline this, if I can--America is blessed with the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. You need only travel to any other country and take a look at the alternative to appreciate what I have just said. But we can do better. 
The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 33 million Americans will suffer food poisoning this year, and more than 9,000 will die from it, primarily infants and elderly people. The annual cost of foodborne illnesses in this country may rise to as high as $22 billion a year. 
Since 1993, the CDC, under Dr. Satcher's direction, has played a critical role in modernizing our food safety programs and responding to challenges created by the large amount and variety of food now available in the United States. 
As part of this effort, the CDC has led rapid response to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, conducted research into the cause and transmission of foodborne illness, and expanded outreach to health officials and the public on treatment and prevention of foodborne illness. 
The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the next decade. Such estimates make increased vigilance even more important. Both early detection and rapid response are critical to minimizing health hazards from unsafe food. 
Building on these efforts, President Clinton announced in January 1997 that the CDC will join forces with the Federal, State, and local agencies on new efforts to improve the safety of our Nation's food supply. 
CDC and Dr. Satcher have played a key role in the new early warning system to help try to catch and respond to outbreaks of foodborne illness earlier and to give us the data we need to prevent future outbreaks. 
In 1995, the CDC, with the FDA, Department of Agriculture, and State health departments, established this network of `sentinel' surveillance sites in five States that conducted in-depth surveillance for foodborne illness and related epidemiological studies. 
Since becoming operational in 1996, the network already has identified an outbreak of salmonella caused by contaminated alfalfa sprouts and an outbreak of E. coli from lettuce. 
I hope we can do more. We need a Surgeon General in place who is sensitive to that need. I think that we can start to consolidate under one Federal agency the many disparate Federal agencies that now try to keep our food supply safe. Isn't it a curious thing that when you take something as common as an egg, and if that egg is broken and served as a product, it is the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. If that egg remains in the shell and is sold as a product, it is the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Consumers have to shake their heads in wonderment that we would make such arbitrary distinctions between products which families view as the same thing, as far as they are concerned. It calls for leadership not only in the Department of Agriculture, the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, and many other agencies, but it calls for the leadership of a Surgeon General, and that vacancy should be filled by Dr. Satcher, sooner rather than later. 
Dr. Satcher, as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has dramatically expanded the CDC's landmark `National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program,' which offers comprehensive breast and cervical cancer screening services to medically underserved women nationwide. 
Prior to Dr. Satcher's tenure and leadership at CDC, 18 States had the program. Today, all 50 States do, as well as 5 U.S. territories, and 13 American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations have programs. This expansion was based on strong scientific evidence showing that breast and cervical cancer screening can save women's lives. 
As of 1996, more than 1.2 million cancer screening tests were provided by the program. There are some critics of Dr. Satcher who might dwell or focus on one or two controversial things. I hope they will judge the man in his totality, and that they will judge his contribution fairly, because if you look at his work in public health, it is truly extraordinary. 
There is one area I would like to speak to that has been brought up on the floor, and I would like to close with this. Some have been critical of the efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to address the whole issue of firearm injuries in the United States. Many believe that this is entirely too political for an agency that is supposed to be dedicated to public health. I disagree. Over 38,500 Americans are killed each year with firearms in America; 17,800 homicides; 18,700 suicides; 1,300 unintentional deaths; 5,800 children and teenagers die in America each year from firearm injuries; they are the leading cause of death among African American teenagers and the second leading cause of death among white teenagers. 
In the city of Chicago, IL, there is a hospital that we all admire so much, Mount Sinai. Next to it is a facility known as the Schwab Rehab Institute. Mount Sinai Hospital is in a tough neighborhood. In fact, a visit there on any weekend evening would be a sobering experience for all of us, because the people who come in there, the victims of dramatic injury and gunshot wounds, unfortunately, are in great number. Those physicians, nurses, and medical personnel scramble to do their best to try to keep these people alive. They manage, in many cases, to do that, and it takes the miracle of medicine to do it. Those folks might find themselves, a few weeks or months later, across 
the street at the rehab institute, Schwab Rehab, where I visited a few times to speak to victims of gunshots, and to talk to men in wheelchairs, paraplegics and quadriplegics, who will never have a chance to enjoy full physical mobility, because they were so victimized. It is not a surprise to me that many of the Nation's largest medical organizations and physician groups are now starting to focus on firearm injuries as a national epidemic --not only because of their number, but because of the severity of injury that is suffered. What day goes by in a major city in America where we don't hear or read about some innocent victim, many times a child waiting for a school bus, or a child who is out front playing on a bicycle, who is sprayed by random bullets and becomes a victim and is perhaps even killed? In that situation, we should step back and say, what can we do not just to treat the injury, but to reduce the likelihood that that injury will occur. 
I think the CDC, which really tries to improve public health across America, should include firearm injuries on the agenda. I am happy that Dr. Satcher feels the same way, and I hope CDC does not relax its efforts in this area in any way whatsoever. 
Finally, let me say, over the years, I have worked with the CDC on the issue of tobacco and tobacco-related diseases. They have really been leaders. They have brought out sound, credible evidence of the devastation caused by tobacco in America. They have talked about what we need to do to reduce what is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America from occurring. I think the CDC has that responsibility. 
Our Surgeon General, in the past, has exhibited the same kind of leadership. We have seen those men and women come forward to the post and try to identify those issues that are important to Americans. Some friends of mine are managers of television stations. Since most of us spend a lot of our waking moments watching television, I sometimes say to them, `When you are scheduling your programming for television, what do you look for? What are people interested in? What are American families anxious to watch and hear about?' An interesting thing has occurred over the last 10, 12 years. You will notice it if you watch the news tonight, or any other night for that matter, or any morning. Americans are interested in public health issues. They are primarily interested in breakthroughs in medical discoveries. You see it every day. Since talking with this one station manager in Decatur, IL, 10 years ago, I have been focusing on it. Most news programs include a story about medicine. America's families want to hear what we know and what we can share with them that might improve the quality of their lives. I think that is a indication of why this debate over the appointment of the Surgeon General is so important, and why we should not delay it or in any way sidetrack this debate over some tangential political issue. What is important is that we put a person of quality in this position, who can address the important public health challenges facing America. I think that is our responsibility here. 
Let me tell you, after reviewing his background, I think there is nobody better qualified for that position than Dr. David Satcher. I am happy to support his nomination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for this opportunity to speak. 
I came to Washington 15 years ago to be a Member of the House of Representatives. I can recall that one of the major items that we discussed in the entire 14 years that I served was the budget deficit. It seemed like such an impossible, intractable problem. Through President after President, we had these theories on how we were finally going to reach balance. 
Oh, there was this steely resolve from everyone that we are going to get it done, and it seemed to be an elusive target that we missed year after year after year. As the balanced budget effort failed, the debt of the Nation grew and our deficits grew. We continued to shell out millions and millions and billions of dollars in interest on the national debt, money wasted that couldn't be spent for other good purposes. 
Thank goodness we are in a different era. I pick up the morning paper and see the President of the United States has submitted to Congress for the first time in over 30 years a 
balanced budget. I read as well the last balanced budget submitted by President Lyndon Johnson was the result of a substantial tax surcharge which was imposed on the American people. So this President has brought us to a point with a balanced budget without this increase in taxes on working families, but giving us, I think, a better opportunity in the future. 
How did we reach this point? I think you have to go back at least to 1993 when we passed the budget of the President. A Democratically controlled Congress, with not one Republican vote in support, passed a budget which moved us substantially toward a balanced budget. 
It said that in the outyears, we would reduce spending, we would make certain that our books would be in balance, and then, to give credit where it is due, with the Republican Congress, just this last year, we came together again and, on a bipartisan basis, finished the job, finished that last important but small piece that needed to be added to reach balance. Add that to our bustling and thriving economy, and we have a situation that all of us can finally take pride in that we have a budget that is balanced for America and is balanced in its priorities. 
Speaking to that budget, my friend from North Dakota mentioned several areas that are near and dear to my heart. The whole concept that we would finally find the resources in this budget to help working families pay for child care is one that is long overdue. During the break that we just completed, I traveled the length and breadth of Illinois visiting child care centers, seeing what was going on in the small communities and large cities of my State. 
I can tell you, it is heartening, it is encouraging--but there are many challenges there--to go to St. Vincent de Paul Child Care Center in the city of Chicago and find 400 children in a very positive, warm and safe environment and to know that those children are receiving the very best care. But then I hear from Sister Katie that there are, in fact, a thousand more children waiting to come to that center. Where are those kids today? 
Who is watching them? What are they learning? Is it good or bad? 
The President's budget says let's start providing more money for families to pay for child care, and he issues the resources from the tobacco agreement--one that I think should be one of our highest priorities this year. If we leave town in 1998, if this Senate and House leave town without enacting tobacco legislation--a tobacco agreement, a comprehensive approach--we will have turned our back on a golden opportunity for families across America to help pay for child care. 
In the area of medical research, it always puzzled me that this area of research, which is so popular among the American people, didn't receive the kind of investment that it was due. I will give credit where it is due, within the last year or two my colleague from Illinois, Congressman John Porter, and others, have moved forward to increase NIH funding. 
We can do better. We can do more. With this tobacco agreement and the proceeds from it, through this budget, we will finally start making the kind of investment in health research which every family cares for. Now, people may not come up on the street and say, `Senator, I hope you will do something about health research,' but I say just visit a hospital. Visit a hospital where some family member is seriously ill and sit around for a few minutes, and you know what they will say. `I hope that the people working in Washington and all across the country can help spare my family or at least some other family what we have gone through with this health problem.' 
The last point I will make is critically important. There is a lot of talk about what to do with our surplus. There is kind of a surreal quality to this--a surplus? It was just a year ago that if you came to the floor of this U.S. Senate you would have found several Members--one parked at this desk right over here--with a stack of books higher than his head, all the budgets that have been submitted that were not in balance. And what was his suggested solution and the solution of many of my colleagues? An amendment to the Constitution. 
It is fortuitous that on the floor waiting to speak next is Senator Robert Byrd. Senator Byrd of West Virginia has led the fight against this notion for a long, long period of time. Senator Byrd will recall the speeches, `If we don't amend this Constitution, if we don't put a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution, we will never reach balance. We have to change the Constitution.' Senator Byrd had the wisdom and the leadership to stand up and say, `You are wrong. This can be done with political will. It need not be done by changing the Constitution of the United States.' 
Here we are 12 months later, I say to the Senator. I don't hear the hue and cry on the floor anymore from our friends on the other side of the aisle about amending the Constitution. They pick up the paper in the morning and say, `You've reached a balanced budget.' We didn't have to put that travesty in our Constitution. I think there is a lesson there. We certainly owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator Byrd for his leadership in reminding us that we ought to step back and take a look at the course of American history before we jump and run and add things to that great document. 
Now today, I say to the Senator, there are people who say we don't have to worry about the deficit anymore, our biggest problem is trying to figure out how to spend this surplus. All this extra money, what can we do? Can we declare a dividend for the American people? Give them tax breaks and become the most popular politicians in a generation? I suppose we could do that, but I think that is shortsighted. We don't know where this economy will be 6 months or a year from now. We don't know where Federal revenues will be. It is far better for us to take a cautious course. 
I think President Clinton was right in his State of the Union message. Our first stop on that course should be Social Security. Let's make certain that if there is a surplus that we can count on, that we invest it back into Social Security so that it is there not just for generations to come but for the next century. We can do that, and we can do it if we don't rush to judgment here, if we don't spend this phantom surplus, if we don't overinvest. 
As we were caught up a year ago in the idea of amending the Constitution, let's not get carried away in 1998 with overspending this surplus that may be illusory or only temporary. 
I stand today happy that this administration has brought forth the first balanced budget in 30 years, but understanding that within that budget are important priorities for the working families of America, priorities which will never see the light of day unless this Senate and the House of Representatives work together to make certain that we keep your eye on the goal. The goal is making sure that we have a better standard of living for families across America. 
I thank Senator Byrd for giving this opportunity to speak and I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am completing my first year in the Senate. I will be the first to confess I have a lot to learn, but it has certainly been a rewarding experience serving in this great body. Having had the opportunity to serve 14 years in the House, I was no stranger to Capitol Hill, but this is a much different institution. The dynamic of 100 men and women working together as opposed to 435 is substantially different. I have been impressed with the volume of work that each Senator is asked to shoulder. I have also been very impressed with the leadership, and I join my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, in noting the fine work of Senator Daschle as the Democratic minority leader. It is a tough job. He is lucky to have a good staff to have the energy and talent he brings to it. We are fortunate on the Democratic side to have him.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment I would like to make reference to what happened in the Senate Judiciary Committee today relative to the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. 
Bill Lann Lee is a Chinese-American who was designated by President Clinton to head the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. It is probably one of the more controversial jobs in the Federal Government. 
Civil rights, of course, throughout our history has evoked great emotion. Bill Lann Lee is a person, the son of Chinese immigrants, who came up the hard way, faced challenges which many of us have never faced, overcame them, and then devoted 23 years of his life serving with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. It is interesting; he filed some 200 different civil rights lawsuits in his public career, settled all but six of them--settled all but six of them. 
As the mayor of Los Angeles, a Republican, Richard Riordan, said, Bill Lann Lee is the mainstream of civil rights law. He is a person who looks for practical and pragmatic solutions to civil rights challenges. 
Mr. President, in my estimation, he is exactly the right person for this job, and I am glad the President nominated him. What happened to Bill Lann Lee today in the Judiciary Committee was a very sad situation for Bill Lann Lee. Unfortunately, he did not have the votes and had his name been called, he would not have been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and sent to the floor of the Senate for confirmation. So as a result, there was a parliamentary tangle, and when all was said and done very little was done after 2 or 3 hours of speeches. 
It strikes me as sad that we have now reached a point in this debate over race and civil rights in this country where we are headed in the wrong direction. It is sad that the leaders of both political parties do not look for opportunities to bind the wounds of this country, wounds of several centuries over the issue of race, but instead continue to look for flash points, buzz words, bringing up issues like quotas and preferences and such. 
Bill Lann Lee was asked directly, what is his position on quotas. He said, unequivocally, decisively, `I am against them.' Bill Lann Lee said, `I am against quotas.' But if you would listen to his critics in the Judiciary Committee today, you would think his answer was exactly the opposite. They won't accept yes for an answer. Bill Lann Lee said, `Yes, I am opposed to quotas,' and yet they continue to badger him and say, oh, that isn't what he really means. 
It is ironic, too, when they quizzed him about the important Supreme Court decisions in the area of civil rights, he gave what I thought were very cogent, thoughtful answers and complete to the best of his ability. In fact, his answers, as the New York Times reported this morning, were virtually identical to the answers of Seth Waxman, a man who sought the position of Solicitor General, who was well qualified for the job, and was approved by the Judiciary Committee and by the Senate without much of any kind of resistance. But along comes Bill Lann Lee, and for some reason, giving the same answers to the same questions, he is being rejected. 
I said today in the Judiciary Committee that I wasn't certain that if Thurgood Marshall's name had been submitted today to head the Civil Rights Division, he could have made it through that committee. In fact, I will go beyond that; he could not have made it through that committee because, you see, Thurgood Marshall, who distinguished himself in the field of civil rights throughout his lifetime and went on to serve this country with distinction on the Supreme Court, was an activist, a man who actively pursued the cause of equal rights in America. And I have to tell you that the political sentiment in the Senate Judiciary Committee is not open to that sort of individual. 
So now President Clinton faces a dilemma, what to do. After the Senate Judiciary Committee action today, or failure to act, should the President walk away from Bill Lann Lee and try to find some other for the job? I hope he doesn't. I hope he doesn't. I hope the President will appoint Bill Lann Lee, as he has the right to do, as a recess appointment to this job that will at least give him 1 year to serve in this position. He deserves it. And in that service he will prove to a lot of his detractors that he is up to the job. 
In addition, I might add, if Bill Lann Lee won't make it in this position, if Republicans are opposed to him, I am afraid there isn't a person the President could send that they would approve because, you see, they are not looking for someone who represents the philosophy of the administration, the philosophy of the Department of Justice or the philosophy of the President. They are looking for someone who represents their Republican philosophy. But if I understand the Constitution in its basic form, the people of America spoke last November and said that Bill Clinton was to be the President. They endorsed his philosophy over Bob Dole and other candidates, and now when he tries to appoint people to positions to carry out that philosophy, they say, no, we are not going to let that happen. 
That is a sad situation, sadder still when you think about how this has developed to a point where what was a bipartisan consensus on the issue of civil rights is starting to deteriorate very dramatically. Today in the committee only one Republican Senator, Arlen Specter, of Pennsylvania, said he would vote for Bill Lann Lee. We needed one more out of the remaining nine, and we could not find them. So Bill Lann Lee's nomination languished. 
What is sadder still is that this fine man and his beautiful family are now left with uncertainty about their future. When he could have been preparing to serve this Nation in an important capacity and make life better for so many people, his future is in doubt. 
Those who argued that this is just a question of race looked beyond the issue of civil rights in its entirety. 
The issue of civil rights goes beyond racial questions into questions involving gender, questions involving people with personal physical disabilities, questions of ethnic background. The Civil Rights Division makes us feel uncomfortable as Americans because time and again it forces us to focus our view on things we don't want to talk about. We don't want to talk about discrimination at a major corporation against African Americans. We don't want to talk about discrimination at a major city's police department against women. We don't want to talk about meetings of Federal law enforcement officials, as happened several years ago, where there were outright racist comments being made time and again. Yet we must. Because if this Nation really stands for what we believe it does, if it is truly committed to equal rights, we have to face the reality that there are times when we have strayed from our goal. 
Bill Lann Lee, I hope, will ultimately be confirmed by this Senate, I hope not only because he would be the highest ranking Asian American in the history of this country but also because, with his life, he has set out to prove that having been the son of Chinese immigrants, having been someone who is a recipient of an affirmative action program at Yale University and also at Colombia Law School, that he could prove himself to be up to the task. 
I had a moment this evening, so I took out a card in my desk and wrote a personal note to him because I have been thinking about him a lot recently. I still remember his wife, his family. I especially remember his mother, his mother who is I am sure up in years but I won't even try to guess what her age might be. She was a woman who worked in a hand laundry in New York for years, and there she sat at a confirmation hearing seeing her son who used to run around this little hand laundry in New York now being nominated for one of the highest positions in the Federal Government. I am glad she got to see that nomination, but I am sorry that she had to witness what has happened since. She came to this country as an immigrant with hope. Her husband, who Bill Lee identified as his greatest inspiration in life, was a man who was totally committed to this country. 
During World War II, at the age of 36 when he could have escaped the draft, he volunteered, went into the Army Air Corps and served with real distinction. When he came out he said to his sons, `It was the right thing to do. They treated me like I was an American--not a Chinaman living in America.' 
That lesson was not lost on Bill Lann Lee. It hasn't been lost on any of us. I sincerely hope that when we return, some of the rancor and some of the negative feelings have abated and that people will consider once again the need to look at this important nomination. If there needs to be a national debate on affirmative action, the debate should take place right here on the floor of this Chamber. Democrats and Republicans can argue the merits or demerits. They can talk about changes, as we should in any law. But to make this one man the focal point of this debate and to literally say that he cannot have an opportunity to serve because we as a nation are divided on the question, I think is fundamentally unfair. 
So, as we adjourn and go off for another 10 or 11 weeks back in our districts and other places, back in our home States, I hope we will not forget that we have a responsibility when we return, a responsibility not just to Bill Lann Lee but to many others who hope that in a bipartisan fashion we can continue to address the issue of civil rights in a civil manner. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I thank my colleague for his statement on the future of Social Security. He is recognized in this Chamber as one who has studiously addressed himself to this and many other challenges. 
I hope that next year my colleague will lead a bipartisan effort to take a serious look at the future of Social Security and Medicare, and so many entitlement programs that we worry about, in terms of long-term solvency. I thank my colleague for his remarks. Though I may not agree with every particular, I certainly do respect the fact that he continues to stick with this issue through thick and thin, as he should. The Senate should address it, and, hopefully, we can do it together in a bipartisan fashion.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am, as you know, concluding my first year in the U.S. Senate. Within a few days, we may be able to go home, and the sooner the better. 
As I reflect on my first year, I think back on one particular issue, which I didn't anticipate being of great importance and now has turned out to be of major importance on my legislative agenda. I was appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee and, as a result of that appointment, I decided to really focus on the issue of crime, particularly juvenile crime, in the United States. 
This past year, I made my visits back to Illinois coincide with an effort to study the problem of juvenile crime. During the course of 1997, I visited jails and prisons, detention centers, have met with judges and law enforcement officials, have been to drug rehab facilities, have been to many, many schools in the State of Illinois, have met with young people and their parents, and I have tried as best I could to come to grips with some of the problems that we have in this Nation as it relates to crime. 
I find it very curious to consider the following: The United States has one of the strongest economies in the world. I daresay that you could not travel across the world and find another country so widely admired as the United States. No matter where you go, people talk about us--the way we live, our music, our art, our culture, our economy. We should take great pride in that. We also know for a fact that, if we were to lift all restrictions on immigration and say the borders of the United States are wide open, we would be inundated with people from all over the world who would walk away from their cultures, their families, and their traditions, many of them just hoping they would have a chance to come to America and be part of this great democratic experiment. 
Having said that, though, the one thing that is curious to me, despite all of these positive things, is, why is it that the United States of America has the largest percentage of its population imprisoned, incarcerated, of any country in the world except one--Russia? Why is it, over the last 10 years, we have seen such a dramatic increase in incarceration and imprisonment in America? Is there something genetic about living in America that leads more people to commit crime? I question that. I don't think that's true. But what is it about our country that is engendering more imprisonment and more incarceration? 
Now, let's be fair and look at both sides of the ledger. We have found that, as incarceration rates have gone up and the State and Federal prisons have grown in size, the crime rate has gone down. 
So there is a positive side to this. If people who are committing crimes are being taken off the streets to make those streets safer for our families, our communities, and our neighborhoods, that is a positive development. I do not want to suggest at all that we should step back from that commitment. If someone is guilty of crime, they should do the time. It is not just the slogan; it is a fact. And in America, more and more people are doing time. 
But is there an answer to this dilemma, or challenge, which goes beyond the obvious, the enforcement of crime, the imprisonment of criminals? Can we as a nation aspire to a goal where we see a continued reduction in crime and a reduction in incarceration? Because imprisonment is a very expensive undertaking for a society. First, we measure it in dollar terms. In the Federal prison system it is probably $20,000 a year to keep a prisoner there. Roughly the equivalent of what it takes to go to some of the best colleges and universities we spend each year to put men and women in prison and keep them there at the State level. It goes as high as $30,000 in my own State of Illinois. It is an expensive commitment. 
Don't forget this important fact. There is not a person in prison today who didn't get there because he or she created a victim. So in order for that process to work its way through, someone was victimized. Someone may have been killed, assaulted, raped, or burglarized--whatever it might be. 
So when we talk about reducing prison populations, it is more than saving money. It is also a question of sparing victims, but doing it in a way that still reduces crime. 
I have taken a look in my State at some of the things that are being discussed. I have talked to some of the leaders across the Nation. I have come up with some things that I hope this Congress can address on a bipartisan basis. Let's start at the very beginning. 
We now know through research, which has been proven time and again, that one of the most critical areas in the life of an individual is the very first few months of life. We used to think that those gurgling, babbling little kids were so cute. We would diaper them, feed them, laugh at them, try to guess who they looked like in the family, and we didn't realize that while we were doing that, this child's brain was developing at a rapid pace. In fact, in the first 18 months of life, some 75 percent of a child's brain has developed. 
The reason I raise that is because I think there is a link between the development of our children, how well they develop, and what they turn out to be. My parents believed that. I believe that. My wife and I did, as do our children. I think it is a fact. 
When I visited the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center about 6 months ago and saw the hallways filled with teenage kids, mainly boys, walking back and forth, it looked like a high school with 14- to 15-year-olds filing back and forth in uniform. But, of course, these weren't just high-school-age kids; these kids had been convicted of a crime. 
I asked the prison psychologist. I said, `Who are these children?' He said, `Senator, these children I could describe in about four or five characteristics.' First, they come from broken homes, almost invariably. Second, they have a learning disability. They were falling behind in school. They weren't learning as well, either because of poor nutrition before they were born in their mother's womb, or poor nutrition after they were born, exposure to narcotics, exposure to abuse. These children are basically `unattached.' That is a term that is used in psychology about which many people would just shake their heads and say, `How could this be?' But it basically means a child coming into this world does not receive the most fundamental and basic emotional bonding with a parent or a loved one. 
How many parents automatically, instinctively grab that baby, pull the baby up to their arms and cradle it while they are feeding the baby, nursing the baby, feeding it with the bottle, with the warmth of the mother, or even the father, and a little communication going on there as part of this bonding attachment? These kids missed that. These kids didn't go through this emotional maturation that leads to a normal functioning adult, and, as a sequence of this, they are missing a piece of that. 
He said there is something else about these kids, too. He said these kids `don't know how to resolve conflicts.' You `Dis me, I kill you. I've got a gun to do it.' In America everybody has a gun to do it, unfortunately. 
So when I started looking into these `problem children,' as we might call them, and then back to the beginning, I started thinking about what we can do as a society to address it. Clearly, we have to start at the beginning. 
Now, with more than half of the mothers in America working and relying more and more on custodial care, whether it is day care or babysitters, shouldn't we be asking a very fundamental question as to what kind of care our kids are receiving when they are in custodial care? 
I don't think it is any accident that this au pair case in 
Massachusetts attracted so much national attention. It is a sad reality that we lose children in America every day to abuse and neglect. Yet, this case, which was so prominent in the headlines, captured America's attention for weeks, I think, because more and more people instinctively are worried about their own children in custodial care. You leave them there 8 or 10 hours a day. What is happening to them? Are they safe? Are they being treated right? 
So, when the President calls a national conference on child care, I hope that we will look beyond the fact that it is a political setting to the fact that this is a very real family challenge. It is interesting in this Nation that we decided that public education was so important to the future of this country that we are going to make a public commitment to it. We understood that some wealthy parents could afford to educate their own children, but most parents could not. So we said, if we are going to have well-educated children who become good citizens, we as a nation will commit to them. We will commit at every level--local, State, and Federal level--to make sure we have a system of public education. 
We have a new challenge, my friends. What about the years before kindergarten? What about these developmental years? What commitment are we prepared to make as a nation to make certain that those developmental years are right? 
Some children are blessed to have a parent who can stay home and raise them. I count myself as one of the fortunate parents. My wife was able to do that. I don't think we could have given our children a better gift than to have her there every day while they were growing up, reading to them, living experiences with them, teaching them. But in some homes that can't happen for economic reasons and other reasons that a parent can't stay home. 
So, that parent wants to make sure that his or her child also gets good care. You look at day care in America today, and it is a very mixed bag. There are some extraordinarily good day care centers--some private, some public. But let's be honest. There are some that aren't very good at all. There are some that are mere babysitters--diapers, bottles, and little more. 
You look at the training requirement. In Illinois, for example, a day care worker needs 2 years of college--an associates degree. That is good, but it could be a lot better. We could be making sure that the men and women in day care really understand what is going on in that young mind and bring these children along as they should be. But it will cost money. You can't bring people in for that kind of professional training and professional care without paying. Working families say, `That is great, Senator; a great idea. Who is going to pay for it? Who will pay? What is the bottom line?' Honestly, we expect the families to contribute, and they do--many of them making great sacrifices for day care. But clearly there must be more. We as a nation must make a contribution to this, too, to make certain that these children have a fighting chance. 
There is another element that I think is important, too. As I traveled around Illinois, I visited a program called Lincoln's Challenge. It is in 15 different States now. The National Guard in Illinois runs this program and invites in 400 students who are high school dropouts in the State of Illinois. They must come voluntarily. They must be between the ages of 14 and 18. They must be drug free and not pregnant. If they then come into the program, they are in for 10 weeks of military style training. They are in uniforms. They shine their shoes every morning, make their beds. It is `yes, sir'; `no, sir' and they go to class. These high school dropouts that other people have given up on are brought into classrooms. In the course of 10 weeks, 71 percent of these kids, high school dropouts, earn the GED degree--in 10 weeks. All of a sudden, they are out of the neighborhood. They are focused. They are in a disciplined environment. And they have people who care around them. It works. 
Kids who would have been casualties on the streets of Chicago, or Springfield, now have a chance because of one other factor. One of the important features of this program is one that I have come to believe is essential if we are going to deal with reducing crime and saving our kids. When those young men and women finish this program, they go back to their hometowns, but with one important difference. Each one has an adult mentor. Each one has an adult outside their family that they can call on for advice or encouragement or support, for counsel. `How am I going to get a job? Can I get into the Army? What should I do next if I want to go to the community college?' So there is somebody who cares. Of all of the programs I have seen, the most successful I have run into time and again--whether government programs or private sector--are mentoring programs. 
We had a juvenile court judge from the State of Georgia, from the city of Atlanta. I am sure Senator Wellstone remembers when she spoke to our conference of Senate Democrats. She told the story of coming out of private law practice and becoming a juvenile court judge and going back to the big law firm in Atlanta and saying, `I want you lawyers, whether you are 
corporate or criminal lawyers, to volunteer to come to my courtroom and represent these kids.' She knew the kids would get better representation. She also knew something else. Relationships would begin. Attorneys meeting young men and women would start to care. Those young men and women, sensing that caring, would finally have a voice that they could listen to, someone they could talk to. 
So, I have come to believe that, as we talk about reducing crime and helping kids, it is not just early childhood development, but making certain that kids, particularly those facing problems, have an opportunity for mentoring. 
We also need to think about some basics. Why in God's name do schools quit at 3 in the afternoon? This might have made sense 50 years ago when kids went back to Ozzie and Harriet settings, and mother was home with milk and cookies. But, boy, that is the exception, not the rule. Most kids who are turned loose at 3 in the afternoon have two options: television or trouble. We have to start thinking about school days that reflect the reality of America's families. 
Most American families come in at probably 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock, if they are lucky, weary from a day of work. That is the time when they can finally give their children a little bit of attention and, hopefully, have some good time with them. But what happens between 3 and 6? What is happening with these kids? In more communities, more and more that I visit, schools are doing things after the regular school hours: some recreation, some arts and crafts, and music, and some, of course, regular school activities, but a safe environment. Shouldn't that be the first rule that we as a nation adopt? Our kids are going to be safe all day long? 
One of the last points I want to make is about prisons themselves. I visit a lot of them. In fact, I went down to the Marion Prison in southern Illinois. It is rather infamous--or famous, depending on your point of view--as having been in a lockdown for almost 5 years now. Two prison guards were killed, and, as a result, most of the prisoners who are brought there spend most of their time in their cells. In fact, the only prisoners there have, first, committed a violent crime to get into prison, and, second, broken a law once they were in prison. So these are a pretty tough bunch of characters. 
Listen to what they do when they come to the Marion Federal Prison. The first year of their life there is very predictable. The first year of their life, out of a 24-hour day they will spend 23 hours of that day in a cell alone. They get 1 hour to come out of their cell, but with no socialization. They don't speak to anyone. The guard watches them as they walk around the yard. If they get through that year and they have not broken the rules, then they start bringing them out and giving them a chance to take a little course here on this, or go to a prison industry, or maybe eat in a room with some other prisoners. 
They have a dramatic success rate. You can imagine this is pretty tough. It is one of our toughest Federal prisons. 
As I talked to the warden and the officers there--and I want to give high praise to them because I think they run a very good operation--and talked to people in other prisons about who these prisoners are and whether they are likely to come back, there is one factor that just comes roaring through at you. That factor is this: If you invest in educating these prisoners while they are in prison, the likelihood that they will return to prison is cut dramatically. There is one in four chances that they will be recidivists, commit another crime and come back, if you educate them. 
Unfortunately, we as a nation for whatever reason, budgetary or otherwise, have not made this commitment to education. We somehow think that we are punishing the prisoners by not making education classes available so that they can become literate, so that they can develop a skill. I am not so sure we are punishing the prisoners as much as we are punishing ourselves. These prisoners, most of them, will be back on the street and without an education and without basic skills, I am afraid they are destined to commit crimes. In fact, statistically we know they are, by a rate of 4 to 1, from those prisoners who pick up education and skills. We have not made that commitment in our prison system and we should. It is absolutely essential that we do it. 
I went to the juvenile maximum prison in Illinois and met with the principal of the high school there. And I looked at all of the young men who were in the classrooms at this prison, and I said, `How is this working out?' He said, `Well, amazingly well. Most of these young men'--all men at this prison--`missed something in their basic education and became so frustrated that they basically dropped out; they stopped paying attention and fell behind.' He said, `We test them to find out what they missed. We go back,' he said, `and fill in that gap and they come roaring forward toward a GED.' To many of them, it is sad that it took this track for them to reach this fulfillment, but it is a fact and one that we should reflect on, how time spent in prison, if it is done constructively, can start to turn a life around, can make this a safer America and reduce the number of victims that we might see. 
People think that in an age where all we talk about is balancing the budget many of us in Washington really don't reflect enough on some of the important social goals we should have in this country. I don't think there is anything more important than our children, and if it means making certain that we have quality day care for childhood development, if it means making certain that we are committed to a school day that reflects the reality of our families, if it means making certain that the kids who need someone to talk to have an opportunity, whether it is through Big Brother, Big Sister, the Boys and Girls Clubs, whatever it happens to be, if it means making certain that our prison system now starts to be more responsive to real human needs, I think those are things we as a Senate and a House should address. 
I hope that next year, even in a busy election year, we have the time to do just that. 
I want to address two other topics very quickly. I see my friend from Minnesota is here. I just want to address them very quickly because they are important and I hope somewhat timely.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, late this week we will have an executive committee meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We will return to a nomination made by President Clinton, one that I think has become a source of major controversy. The gentleman's name is Bill Lann Lee. Mr. Lee has been named by the President to be head of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
I had never met Bill Lann Lee until about a month ago when he came by my office. He made a very positive impression in the short time we had to speak to one another. Then I read his background and sat through his confirmation hearing, and I want to say that I hope Mr. Lee will get the chance he deserves. 
Bill Lann Lee is the son of Chinese immigrants who came to this country to New York virtually penniless. His mother and father started a hand laundry. He and his brother, who is now a Baptist minister, worked in that laundry with their parents. His mother sat, as he said, in a front window of the laundry every day at a sewing machine. His father was back doing washing and ironing, refusing, incidentally, to teach his sons how to iron. That's the major skill in a hand laundry. He didn't want his sons to know how to iron. He didn't want them to work there. He wanted them to think beyond the laundry. 
When World War II started, Bill Lann Lee's father, who was 36 years old and could have escaped the draft just by claiming an age deferment but did not do it, volunteered and went in the Army Air Corps and had a very interesting experience because he came back from the war to his family and said, `That was a good thing to do, not just for the Nation but good for me.' 
For the first time, Bill Lee's father said, he was treated like an American, not like someone from China living in America. But when he came back from the war, as a returning veteran after World War II he found that job discrimination and housing discrimination was still very, very strong against Chinese-Americans. So he returned to his hand laundry but more determined than ever that his sons would have a better chance. 
When Bill Lann Lee reached college age, it happened that Yale University decided they wanted to diversify their student body. They gave him a chance and said come to Yale and see if you can prove yourself. Well, he sure did. He graduated from Yale with high honors and then went to Columbia Law School and graduated with high honors. 
With that kind of background, Bill Lee could have easily gone with a major law firm in New York, Los Angeles, wherever he happened to want to live, but he didn't. Bill Lee had learned a lesson in life, a lesson from his parents, and he decided that he wanted to fight discrimination. So for 23 years he has worked for the NAACP legal defense fund filing lawsuits when people are discriminated against. 
The interesting thing about it is, when you think of these lawsuits, many times they are the most controversial lawsuits you can imagine. You know the headlines in the papers when they start talking about housing questions and school questions and questions involving gender or race or religious persuasion. Those are tough cases. But out of 200 cases that Bill Lee handled, only six ever went to trial. He was able to work out agreements in all the other cases. 
In fact, one of his leading opponents, Richard Riordan, who is the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, wrote a letter about Bill Lee and said, `I was on the other side of a lawsuit, and I want to tell you something. We never would have settled it without Bill Lee there. He practices mainstream civil rights law.' 
I tell you, my friends, he is exactly the kind of person we need serving in the Department of Justice as the representative of the Office of Civil Rights. But I am sorry to report to you that in the last week some extreme political folks have set their sights to try to nail Bill Lee. They are trying to stop his appointment as the head of the Civil Rights Division, and that is an unfortunate development. It is unfortunate because, first, all he is asking is to be judged fairly. That is all he has ever asked in his life. And second, the things they are saying about him really do stretch the truth. 
One of the leading conservative columnists in America, George Will, a man whom I really respect not just because he was raised and went to school in Illinois but because I think he is a pretty bright fellow, wrote a column in the middle of October and said we should turn down Bill Lee as `a payback'--his words, `a payback'--because the Senate Democrats, when they controlled the Judiciary Committee, turned down one of the civil rights appointments of a Republican President 10 years ago. 
Please, let us not do that to Mr. Lee. Let us not do that to the Senate. Let us give him his chance to stand on his own feet and have an opportunity to serve this country. And so I hope those of you who think that when the Senate goes home and the House adjourns our work is done will realize there are still many men and women waiting for confirmation and one of the most important and highest is Bill Lann Lee. He would be the highest-ranking Asian American ever appointed, and I am glad that the President has named him and I hope that we can find just two, just two Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee who will join the Democrats in supporting his nomination.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced with Senator Torricelli a bill, which I hope the Senator from Minnesota will join me in sponsoring, that would consolidate all of the food inspection services of the Federal Government in one independent agency. 
Mr. President, 33 million Americans each year have some sort of a foodborne illness, and out of that number some 9,000 will die. You read about the cases, whether it is E. coli or salmonella. We have a good food inspection system but it can be much better. Our food inspection system evolved from Upton Sinclair's novel `The Jungle,' when we decided the Federal Government had to step in and make sure the food, meat in particular, that came to our table was safe for our families. But now I am afraid we have gone overboard. We have 12 different Federal agencies involved in food inspection--12--6 in a major way. 
I am joining with Congressman Vic Fazio of California to consolidate these into one independent agency which will be guided by the best science in keeping food safe for Americans. I hope that this, too, will be part of our agenda next year when we return to Washington, DC. It is an important issue, not just for the industries that are affected but for every family that wants to be certain when they buy that meat or poultry, fish or whatever product it might be, fruits and vegetables and beyond, it is safe for their family to consume. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from the State of Iowa, Senator Harkin. I also thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. 
This is a good bill. It is not an easy bill to write. Having been a member of the Appropriations Committee in the other body, I know some bills are tougher than others. This is the toughest. 
The committee empowered with writing this legislation entertains literally hundreds of witnesses who ask for help in this bill. Some are the most touching and amazing stories, as people come before this committee with a variety of different medical problems and ask for help in funding research at the National Institutes of Health. I am really encouraged that this piece of legislation increases spending on Federal medical research projects by 7 percent. I wish it were a lot more, and I bet the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees. Not too many years ago, we found that the NIH was only approving a fraction of those good research projects which should have been funded. There just wasn't enough money there. 
Anyone in this body, any member of our family, anyone listening to this statement, either in the galleries or by television, understands how vulnerable we all are to medical illness. There are times in each of our lives when we pray that someplace at sometime someone is investing enough money to make sure that the cures for these illnesses are found. This is the bill that invests the money. 
People say, what do these people do in Washington that has any impact on my life? We invest money in the National Institutes of Health to try to find ways to cure cancer, heart disease and a variety of diseases that are not as well known. I commend my colleagues who work hard on this committee to make it happen. 
Another contentious issue in this bill is the whole issue of education testing. I don't particularly like this bill's provision on education testing. I see it a lot differently. I understand at some point the debate has to end, and we have to move forward to pass the legislation. 
I believe in local control of education, but I think it is naive for us to believe that we should live in a nation where 50 different States set 50 different standards for scientific educational achievement. For example, the kids graduating in Illinois may go to work in Iowa. The kids graduating in Iowa may end up going to Nebraska. The kids in Nebraska may end up going to California. 
The education standards we are espousing and the ones we are trying to make certain we achieve should be nationwide goals. Understanding the achievement levels of our schools is the first step toward appreciating the good schools and improving those that aren't as good. 
The city of Chicago is going through a dramatic change in reforming its public education system. The city of Chicago voluntarily signs up for national testing to make certain that the kids coming out of those schools can make it wherever they happen to live. As a result of that testing, the public school system of the city of Chicago virtually closed down seven high schools within the last few months and said those high schools just aren't meeting the basic requirements for the kids. They demanded that the teachers in those schools basically step aside and only those who were competent were rehired. Others were told they had to do 
something else with their lives. That is what testing can give you, some objective standard to make a tough decision. 
The final point I will make in conclusion, I especially thank the conferees for including a provision that I added to the Senate version of the bill. Section 608 of this conference committee report includes the provision which I added on the floor of the Senate which basically nullified the $50 billion setoff that was given to tobacco companies in a tax bill that was passed a little before our August recess. It turned out the vast majority of my colleagues agreed with me that this was a bad provision, and we eliminated it. The conference committee has honored that and kept it in the bill. 
Let me say in closing that I hope as part of the tobacco settlement agreement, with the leadership of Senator Harkin and so many others, that we cannot only do the right thing in reducing kids smoking, but come up with the revenues to put it into things that are critically important, such as medical research, so that maybe next year when this appropriations bill comes to the floor, we won't be talking about a 7-percent increase in medical research but a dramatically larger increase paid for by the tobacco settlement agreement. 
I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania for their fine work on this bill. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would replace the current fragmented Federal food safety system with a consolidated, independent agency with responsibility for all Federal food safety activities--the Safe Food Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Torricelli in this important effort. 
Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. However, we can do better. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 33 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the next decade. The annual cost of foodborne illnesses in this country may rise to as high as $22 billion per year. 
According to a Princeton Research survey conducted last summer, 44 percent of Americans believe that the food supply in this country is less safe than it was 10 years ago, while another 30 percent feel it is only `about as safe.' The survey also found that 48 percent of Americans are `very concerned' about the safety of the food that they eat. 
Currently, 12 different Federal agencies and 35 different laws govern food safety and inspection functions. Of these 12 agencies, six have major roles in carrying out food safety and quality activities. With so many bureaucrats in the kitchen, breakdowns can more easily occur. With overlapping jurisdictions, Federal agencies many times lack accountability on food safety-related issues. A single, independent agency would help focus our policy and improve the enforcement of food safety and inspection laws. 
At a time of government downsizing and reorganization, the United States simply can't afford to continue operating multiple systems. In order to achieve a successful, effective food safety and inspection system, a single agency with uniform standards is needed. 
The Safe Food Act would empower a single, independent agency to enforce food safety regulations from farm to table. It would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. Research could be better coordinated within a single agency rather than among multiple programs. And, new technologies to improve food safety cold be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency. 
With incidents of food recalls and foodborne illnesses on the rise, it is important to move beyond short-term solutions to major food safety problems. A single, independent food safety and inspection agency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to the frustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety. 
The administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--from working with Congress to enact HACCP to increased funding to improve surveillance and monitoring to last week's announcement on the `Fight Bac--Keep Food Safe From Bacteria Campaign' initiative. I commend President Clinton and Secretaries Glickman and Shalala for their commitment to improving our Nation's food safety and inspection systems. A single, independent food safety agency is the logical next step. 
Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together to eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at times characterized our food safety efforts. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to consolidate the food safety and inspection functions of numerous agencies and offices into a single, independent food safety agency.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy and Lautenberg in proposing sweeping new legislation that fills in many of the specifics relating to children and the public health that must be included in any future legislation related to the proposed tobacco settlement. 
The tobacco companies have made billions of dollars addicting and exploiting our children. Now, they seek to protect themselves from existing and potential lawsuits. This legislation brings us back to the fundamental issues that must stay at the top of the public health agenda. Reducing the devastation and disease caused by tobacco should be our number one goal, not an afterthought. 
This legislation is our effort to start filling in the blanks on any tobacco measure. It's time to stop speculating and start laying down markers we feel must be part of any comprehensive agreement. 
Under this legislation, the tobacco tax would be raised $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. This kind of increase is a proven deterrent to underage smoking. 
Of the additional revenues that would be raised beyond what was proposed by the state attorneys general, one-half would be used to fund medical research into illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The other half of the additional revenues would fund an expansion of the Head Start program, child care grants, and other child and family initiatives. 
The legislation seeks to ensure a significant decline in underage smoking by establishing tough performance smoking reduction targets. The reduction targets--modeled on legislation I introduced earlier this year--set a goal of a 40 percent reduction in youth tobacco use in four years, 60 percent in 6 years, and 80 percent in 10 years. If the goal is not met, penalties of up to $1 a pack will be imposed on the sale of tobacco products manufactured by a company whose products are consumed by underage users, with steeper penalties for repeated failure to meet youth tobacco targets. 
In addition, we are offering some new incentives for the tobacco companies to meet the targets. If a company fails to comply for three or more consecutive years, the company will be required to stop selling cigarettes in single packs--the size kids buy--and start selling them only in cartons, whose price might cause kids to reconsider their desire to buy cigarettes. If this step was not sufficient to bring a company into compliance, another year violating the performance standard would trigger a requirement that the product be sold using generic packaging, without catchy logos. 
As far as kids are concerned, it's time for the tobacco companies to put their profits on the line. Under our legislation, every new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit tobacco will become an economic loss to a tobacco company. We must hold each company individually responsible for its sales to minors. 
In addition to setting performance standards, the legislation provides for a national tobacco use reduction program which includes smoking cessation programs, media-based advertising about the dangers of tobacco use and aggressive public education. 
The bill also compensates states for Medicaid expenditures resulting from tobacco-related illnesses; affirms the authority of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to regulate tobacco as a drug and delivery device; mandates strong warning labels and ingredient disclosures; reduces exposure to secondhand smoke; prohibits tobacco companies from deducting any settlement liabilities as a business expense; and provides assistance for tobacco farmers. 
I commend this legislation to my colleagues and urge them to support it.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Vermont. This is a sad day. I have only been a Member of this body for less than a year. 
I cannot remember, though, any nominee who has come before the Senate Judiciary Committee who had a more compelling personal story about his life and his family. Bill Lann Lee is an extraordinary man, the son of Chinese immigrants. His parents came to this country penniless and started a hand laundry in New York. 
His mother, who sat with him at the confirmation hearing, sat in the window of that hand laundry her entire life in front of a sewing machine. His father, working in that hand laundry, refused to teach Bill Lann Lee and his brother the skill of ironing clothes because he was determined they would not follow him in his footsteps in that laundry. 
As Senator Leahy has said, Bill Lee's father, who could have been deferred because of age from serving in World War II, volunteered, put his life on the line, and came back with the experience of being treated, as he said, `as an American.' That is what Bill Lee told us. 
Then Bill Lee, given a chance to attend Yale and Columbia Law School, graduated with high honors and, instead of going with a prestigious law firm and making a lot of money, he devoted his life to finding opportunity and education and employment for everyone in this country. 
That this Senate--that the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a small group in that body, would turn down this opportunity for such a fine man to serve this country is truly disgraceful. 
I believe that we owe it to Mr. Lee to give him a chance to serve, as he has already served this country in so many ways. To take out on Mr. Lee some feelings about President Clinton is totally unfair. I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will give him this opportunity to serve. 
Just last week or so, we all queued up to talk about human rights to the President of China. Now we have a chance to vote on human rights in putting a well-qualified person in the job as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. We are going to determine whether those speeches that were given by Republicans and Democrats were only tourist fare for President Jiang.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of enlarging the NATO alliance to include the current invitees of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic during this round, and the Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia during the next round. For the past few weeks, various Senate committees have been reviewing the costs of bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO. The administration estimates the entire cost for this first round of NATO enlargement at $27-$35 billion in the 13-year period from 1997 to 2009. Opponents suggest that the actual costs might actually be much higher, although we will really not have a clear picture until after new estimates are made early next year based on a commonly agreed-upon set of military requirements that NATO ministers will decide on in December. In any case, two things are clear. First, most of these costs would have to be paid anyway--even if NATO did not enlarge. Second, the U.S. share of the total costs will be relatively small. 
As part of the present effort to enlarge NATO, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic must restructure and modernize their armed forces. However, they would need to do this in any case and the costs of doing so would probably be much higher without enlargement, since they would have to rely entirely on their own resources to protect themselves. Additionally, current European NATO members must reconfigure their forces so they are more flexible and more easily deployed; but these changes result from the requirements of NATO's New Strategic Concept agreed on by all alliance members in 1991, and not from enlargement as such. These enlargement costs will be paid for by our allies and not by us. From our perspective, these enlargement costs should really be seen as benefits--improvements to NATO's security paid for by our allies, not by us. 
The only extra costs of the current round of NATO enlargement are the so-called direct costs of enlargement, which include such things as upgrading communications, air defenses, and infrastructure for rapid reinforcement. These costs would be borne jointly by all NATO members with the United States paying roughly one-quarter of the cost. This means that for every dollar we put toward these direct costs, our allies, old an new, would put in three. You can't get better value for your money than that. Thus, the range of costs the United States would have to pay for the present round of enlargement over the next 13 years would be somewhere between $2 billion--if you believe the administration's figures--and $7 billion--if you believe the recent report by the CATO Institute. Given the millions of lives lost in World War I and II, and the billions of dollars spent during these conflicts, the cold war and now in Bosnia, NATO enlargement is the cheapest single investment we can make. 
Aside from the costs, we get real benefits from NATO enlargement. As Secretary Albright and other administration officials have repeatedly and convincingly pointed out, NATO enlargement will deter future threats, prevent the development of a dangerous power vacuum in the heart of Europe, make border and ethnic conflicts far less likely and solidify democratic institutions and free markets in Europe. Just as importantly, the United States will be gaining strong new allies in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, who between them will add 300,000 troops to the alliance. The costs of enlargement will fall heaviest on them, but these countries know the 
price of freedom. Each country has been invaded more than once this century and each suffered under Communist domination for over 40 years. They understand that their own security is indivisible from that of the rest of Europe and have already expressed their commitment to be producers of security, and not merely consumers, by cooperating with NATO forces to implement the Dayton accords in Bosnia. 
If we refuse to enlarge NATO, we would have told these countries that despite their epic and inspiring struggle to liberate themselves from communism, the West had once again turned its back on them. Even worse, we would leave Central Europe without an effective security system, creating a heightened sense of insecurity in these countries, forcing them to devote more resources to military expenditures, and lowering their potential for economic growth. Under these circumstances, a backlash against Western values might very well develop, yielding a vicious cycle of authoritarianism, militarism, economic stagnation, and greater conflict between neighbors--a pattern this region has seen in the past. This would inevitably bring more problems for the United States in Europe. 
Some have asked what's the hurry over NATO enlargement. Surely, the end of the cold war gives us plenty of time to contemplate so momentous a decision. However, if we don't enlarge now when it's relatively easy and inexpensive, how can we be sure that we'll be ready to respond to a crisis in time? We were slow to respond to World War I, World War II, and Yugoslavia out of the fear of the costs. If we wait until a crisis develops, our capacity to deal with it early on will be less, the costs will be higher and our reluctance will be greater. Let's make the decision to enlarge now. 
I would remind my colleagues that as the debate over this issue draws near, we must also look beyond the present round of enlargement. In particular, we must pay especially close attention to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 
Given their geography and history, the Baltic countries are a weather vane indicating which way the winds from Russia will blow. Any ambiguity in our commitment to the Baltic countries can only encourage those forces in Russia which have not reconciled themselves to the transformation of the Soviet Union. We must make it clear that Russia is welcome to cooperate with the undivided, free, prosperous, and secure Europe that is being built. However, it can only do so if it is prepared to recognize one of the cardinal principles of the new Europe, articulated by Secretary of State Albright during her visit to Lithuania last July: that all States, large and small must have the right to choose their own alliances and associations. 
By their actions, the Baltic States have clearly made their choice known. They have applied for membership in NATO and the European Union, they participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program and they are contributing directly to NATO's security by cooperating on a regional airspace initiative. By providing troops for NATO-led operations in Bosnia and by participating in the Vilnius Conference on good neighborly relations hosted by Lithuania in September, they have shown their willingness to be producers, not just consumers, of security. Having been invaded by both Stalin and Hitler and having suffered 50 years of Communist occupation, the people of the Baltic countries, no less than the people of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, know the price of freedom and are willing to pay for it. 
If we are serious about our commitment to create a Europe that is whole and free, than the Baltic countries must be included. For that reason, the United States must make it absolutely clear at the earliest possible moment that it supports NATO membership for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act of 1997. This measure will finally allow us to strike back against `slamming,' the practice of changing a telephone customer's long-distance carrier without the customer's knowledge or consent. 
Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of consumer complaints. In 1995 and 1996, more than one-third of the consumer complaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved slamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming complaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg-- the Los Angeles Times reports that more than 1 million American telephone consumers have been slammed in the last 2 years. 
In my home State of Illinois slamming was the No. 1 source of consumer complaints to the attorney general's office in 1995, and the No. 2 source of complaints in 1996. Slamming is obviously a serious problem that must be stopped. 
Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act of fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of dollars a year and robs them of the right to contract. The Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act will now ensure that slammers are held accountable for their fraudulent acts. 
My measure will help stamp out slamming in two ways: 
First, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act creates criminal fines and jail time for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge and distorts the long distance competitive market by rewarding companies that engage in fraud and misleading marketing practices. This measure's criminal penalties will guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity. 
Second, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act charges the Attorney General with the duty of conducting a study on the fraudulent and criminal behavior of telecommunications carriers and their agents in the solicitation, marketing, and assignment of telecommunication services. The Attorney General's study will examine the fraudulent methods by which a telecommunications consumer's local, long distance, and other telecommunications services are changed without the consumers knowledge or consent. Through this study, Congress will gain a better understanding of how slammers operate. With this knowledge we will be able to draft a well crafted, all encompassing law that will finally put a lid on slamming. 
Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act in order to protect the rights of telephone consumers.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, to introduce the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1997. This sensible and bipartisan piece of legislation is designed to check many of the serious abuses in the Bankruptcy Code while maintaining a workable system. 
Neither Senator Grassley nor I can ignore the evidence that there are some people who are taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Code. Their numbers may not be great, but every abuse undermines confidence in the code. As with all systems, the Bankruptcy Code is subject to abuse. People can and will manipulate it. Senator Grassley and I have introduced this legislation to attempt to curb many of these abuses. We have worked hard to craft a bill that is balanced--that corrects creditor and debtor abuses. It also attempts to catch abuses without being so harsh that it makes the system unworkable and without turning its back on the fundamental principles and good of the Bankruptcy Code. 
Hovering in the background of all that we attempt to do in this legislation is the persistent news that personal bankruptcy filings are steadily increasing. Last year, personal bankruptcies broke the 1 million barrier. And this year will be worse. No one sitting in this room today can help but shudder at the prospect of 1.3 million personal bankruptcies this year. 
The odds are that almost every American knows at least one person who has declared bankruptcy. Both Senator Grassley and I vividly remember the farm crises of the 1980's when good, hard-working people came to the end of the line and were desperately trying to save their homes and their children's future. So they declared bankruptcy. We also remember the floods that swept through our States not too long ago that left a financial catastrophe as deep as the natural catastrophe. We must not lose sight of these people. 
This jump in personal bankruptcies in good economic times is distressing, in large measure because it is a sign that many people--people we know--are in trouble. 
As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains that we need the system. We cannot dismantle or radically alter it without doing serious damage to our economy, to creditors, and to millions of individuals. The cold hard fact is that the bankruptcy system does not just help individual debtors. It helps the creditors too. And by and large, it works. 
To see how, imagine a world where people could not declare bankruptcy when they were in financial straits. In this world, each individual creditor would have to file suit in State court when the debtor defaulted. Only the first unsecured creditor to the courthouse door could get garnished wages to pay off the debt. The secured creditors could repossess all of the secured property. Meanwhile, all of the remaining creditors would get nothing, and the debtor would be left without an automobile, a home, or any assets and with next to no money after wage garnishment. There would be very few winners in that situation. 
In stark contrast, the Federal bankruptcy system offers creditors and debtors a comprehensive system--paid for at public expense--which attempts to protect the creditors while also giving the debtor a chance to restart his life. Without our system, each creditor would be clawing his way through the State court system, racking up legal costs, achieving virtually nothing, and turning millions of debtors into financial outcasts. 
Some people credit our voluntary individual bankruptcy system to the English author Daniel Defoe, who in 1697 proposed something akin to our current chapter 7. Defoe made some very wise distinctions. He felt there was a difference between the `honest debtor, who fails by visible necessity, losses, sickness, decay of trade, or the like' and the `knavish, designing, or idle, extravagant debtor, who fails because wither he has run out his estate in excess, or on purpose to cheat and abuse his creditors.' 
He also had something to say about creditors, praising the `moderate creditor, who * * * will hear reasonable and just arguments and proposals' while warning against the `rigorous severe creditor * * * without compassion, full of ill language, passion, and revenge.' 
It took almost 150 years for the American Congress to implement Defoe's suggestion, although many individual States had acted before then. In 1841, having experienced the Panic of 1837, Daniel Webster introduced and passed a bill that allowed individuals to voluntarily file for bankruptcy and discharge their debts. It is not surprising that the central subject of debate 156 years ago was whether debtors who could actually pay their debts would nevertheless try to avoid them by declaring bankruptcy. Some things never change. 
Even as we focus on the Bankruptcy Code and its possible abuses, however, we should be very careful that we do not obscure a far more important and dangerous feature of our consumer economy--the proliferation of risky credit. Merely making bankruptcy abuse harder to get away with is only a small part of the equation. Another part is preventing bankruptcies in the first place by encouraging more responsibility from banks as well as consumers. 
Let me make this clear, I am happy to root out abuses in bankruptcy and to encourage people to repay as much as possible within the bankruptcy system. But I insist that I be met half way--that banks and consumers do all they can to encourage healthy lending patterns and responsible money management. 
Mr. President, we may never be able to fully understand why bankruptcies have jumped so much. But a few things are clear. First, personal bankruptcy rates are tied to increased consumer debt burdens. The higher the level of credit card debt a person has, the greater the chance that the person will declare bankruptcy. And individual consumer debt is very high. In 1996, consumers charged more than $1 trillion on credit cards. According to the Consumer Federation of America, an estimated $374 to $396 billion in debt was being revolved or incurring interest obligations. 
To most people, accumulating credit cards seems easy and problem free. The waters look awfully enticing when someone sends you a credit card. But there is a dangerous undertow. And as people move further from the shore, they risk getting caught by the undertow. Essentially people are placing themselves on the edge and not leaving enough of a margin for dealing with an unexpected fiscal calamity. 
Yet rather than trying to blame anyone for bankruptcies, let us try to find a way to avert future bankruptcies. Both halves of the bankruptcy equation can and should act more responsibly. For creditors, that means providing consumers with enough information to assess the risks. For debtors, that means taking a hard look at what they can and can't afford. 
People need to know about the deadly undertow associated with credit card solicitations. Right now people know more about what is in a box of cookies by looking at the nutritional label than they know about their credit cards. We need something like nutritional labels for credit cards. 
I have previously proposed four important changes to the way people get and use credit. 
First, companies should include in each bill to current cardholders information that details how long it will take that person paying only the minimum to pay off the credit card debt. In addition, the information should indicate how much of the overall payment would be interest. 
Second, companies soliciting customers should provide the potential cardholders with an easy-to-understand worksheet to help them determine whether they really can afford more debt. Such a worksheet might include calculations of a person's expenses--current unsecured debt, home mortgage, rent, and other costs--and a simple formula to help people see whether they can or can't afford another card. 
Third, companies should tell people the basis of the offer of more credit. When a person gets a preapproved credit card, he or she should know that the credit card company has not fully evaluated how more consumer debt could affect their overall financial health. 
Finally, credit card companies should provide people who accept their card a free copy of their credit report. 
These simple things might help quite a bit. Too many people are walking into consumer credit counseling bureaus, bankruptcy lawyers' offices, and bankruptcy court without any real understanding of their financial situation. 
Mr. President, let me conclude on this note: I am proud to join Senator Grassley in introducing this bill and in trying to prevent abuses of the Bankruptcy Code. But I believe that we must also work on something infinitely more constructive--we must try to help prevent financial catastrophes. What I propose is a small step in that direction which works on the principle that a well informed consumer is best able to protect himself.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to the Committee of 200, a distinguished professional women's organization headquartered in my home State, on the occasion of its 15th anniversary the week beginning October 20. 
The Committee of 200 is dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship and corporate leadership among women of this generation and the next. The committee is comprised of 370 members from the United States and abroad, representing 70 different industries. Each member is an accomplished businesswoman, including entrepreneurs whose companies generate annual revenue of $10 million or greater and U.S. corporate executives who manage divisions that produce more than $50 million in annual revenue. 
Recognizing the needs of young women who will soon be entering the business world, the Committee of 200 established a foundation in 1986 to enhance its outreach activities. This foundation provides important assistance and scholarships for women business students and provides grants to foster entrepreneurship among young women. 
The Committee of 200 exemplifies the spirit of American business, promoting entrepreneurship, corporate innovation, and community awareness. It supports the careers of young women by giving them the tools to complete effectively in an intensely competitive environment. 
Mr. President, the Committee of 200 has provided critical support services over the last 15 years to business leaders and business students. It has distinguished itself as a preeminent professional organization for women. I am confident that over the next 15 years, the committee will continue to be a credit to American businesses and women corporate leaders. I want to congratulate all the members of the Committee of 200 as they celebrate this important milestone in the organization's history.

He continues to contribute to the national debate as the director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. 
Paul recently authored the foreword for the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal on the subject of ethics in law and politics. While the Senate continues to investigate and debate the conduct of our federally elected officials, Paul's foreword to this journal provides valuable insight about political ethics and the public trust which I would like to share with my colleagues.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, to mark the celebration of World Food Day on October 16, I rise today to recognize the work of the United Nations' World Food Programme. The U.N.'s World Food Program is the largest international food aid organization in the world. Last year alone it fed over 45.3 million people in 84 countries, transporting 2.2 million tons of food by ship, canoe, river barge, on the backs of donkeys and elephants, and by parachute drop in remote areas. 
The World Food Programme distributes food at hospitals, clinics, and schools to fight malnutrition, which kills 11,000 children under the age of 5 every day and stunts the physical growth and intellectual development of those it does not kill. 
When disaster strikes, the World Food Programme is there. When severe droughts threatened North Korea and Southern Africa, the World Food Programme helped prevent famine by feeding millions of people, especially children. The World Food Programme has also provided food to ensure the stability of the peace process in Mozambique and to assist refugees when war hit the Caucasus. 
The World Food Programme helps people escape the poverty trap by promoting economic self-reliance. In exchange for food, workers repair dykes in Vietnam, install irrigation systems in India, replant forests in Ethiopia, and construct mountainside terraces in Peru which prevent topsoil erosion. 
As an essential element of its strategy of combating hunger, the World Food Programme encourages the empowerment of women. In places like rural Pakistan, the World Food Programme promotes female literacy by giving vegetable oil to parents who send their daughters to school. 
In war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Guatemala, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, and Bosnia, the World Food Programme trains local people to carry out demining operations which clear roads and land, allowing the delivery and production of food and the safe return of refugees. 
Americans can take special pride in the accomplishments of the World Food Programme. Not only is the United States the program's single biggest donor, it also played a central role in its creation, when President Kennedy committed the resources and leadership necessary to make it a reality in 1963. 
I urge you, my fellow colleagues, and all my fellow Americans to support the work of the World Food Programme.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky for yielding. I only have a short period of time here, I say for the information of my colleague from Maine, and I appreciate this chance to rise and speak on this issue. 
It has been said in debate that the columnist, George Will, has pronounced this as the most important debate in American history. I didn't want to miss it and that is why I came to the floor today. I will not question Mr. Will because he was reared and his early education took place in the State of Illinois, and somewhere or another he got off the course shortly afterwards, but at least we attribute his early training to Illinois' educational standards. 
Is this the most important debate in American history? It may be, because what is at stake in this debate is not the amount of money that is being spent in a campaign, it is really not about the conduct of campaigns, it really doesn't have much to do with political action committees or labor unions or corporations or associations. What is at stake in this debate is the future of this democracy. 
If that sounds hyperbolic, let me tell you why I say it. I am honestly, genuinely, personally concerned as a Member of this great institution, about the fact that the American people are losing interest in their Government. The clearest indication of that loss of interest is their participation in elections. 
Now, why is it at this moment in time when the United States of America is obviously one of the most attractive places in the world to live, where we have to almost construct a fence and a wall around our borders to keep people from other nations from coming to the United States, why is it that at a time when our economy is booming, at a time when we are so proud of what we have achieved not only in this Nation but around the world, that the people we serve, the American voters, have decided they are not interested? And they have demonstrated that, unfortunately, in that quadrennial forum where we asked people to come forward and name the leader of this Nation. 
Let me show you what I am talking about. I think it is interesting in this debate about campaigns and money and voters to take a look at what has happened in the United States of America in the last 36 years. This bar graph shows the amount of money that has been spent on campaigns at all levels, Federal through local. If you look it was a rather meager sum, $175 million, in the earliest years, and then skyrocketed up to $4 billion here in 1996. 
So to entice people to vote, to interest them in candidates and interest them in campaigns, we have raised money in record sums and spent it on television, radio, direct mail, bumper stickers, emery boards, pocket combs and everything we can dream of, to say to the voters, `Look at me. Get interested. I'm running. I need your vote.' Is it working? As we plow more money into this system, is it working? Well, the sad truth is, it is not. 
Look at this percentage of those who vote in Presidential elections: Starting in 1960, 63.1 percent of the American people said the Kennedy-Nixon election is one that we consider critically important, our family is going to vote. Look what happened in this last election in November: 49.1 percent of the American people turned out to vote. We spent record numbers, dramatically increasing the amount of money on political campaigns, and the voters voted with their feet and stayed home. Isn't it curious that the more money we plow into our campaign system the fewer voters turn out? 
Now let me just suggest something. If you happen to own a company selling a widget and say to your marketing department, `We are going to double our advertising. Next quarter we want to see what happens to sales,' and you gave them twice as much money for advertising your widget, and they came back after the quarter was finished and said, `We have the report.' You said, `What is it?' `Advertising went up 100 percent.' `How about sales?' `Sales went down.' 
What? Advertising went up and sales went down? Well, you could draw some conclusions. There was something wrong with the advertising or there may have been something wrong with the product. That is what this debate is about. 
There is not only something wrong with the advertising, it has become so negative, so nasty, so dirty, that people are disgusted with it. There is something wrong with the products. Candidates for the House and Senate are losing their reputation or seeing their integrity maligned because we spend so much time grubbing for money. People believe that we are captives of special interest groups. And because they are sick of the style of campaign and because they have little or no confidence in those of us who wage the campaigns, they stay home. 
The turnout for the Presidential election last November was the lowest percentage turnout in America for a Presidential election in 72 years. Now if Jay Leno and David Letterman pronounced this election over in July, as they probably did, I don't think that explains it. I think there was something else at work here. The American voters are at best indifferent, and at worst, downright cynical about the system we use to elect people in the United States. 
Let me also show you something that makes the case even more. I guess some people would argue, well, back in 1960 there must have been a higher percentage of people who were registered to vote. Well, that was not the case. Our figures start on this chart in 1964, and there were 64.6 percent of Americans were registered to vote; if you remember, 63.1 percent of those turned out to vote. 
Now, we have increased the franchise by making it easier to register to vote. You can register when you go to get a new license for your car or driver's license renewal, that sort of thing. So, more and more Americans are getting registered to vote. There is more participation. I think that is a healthy thing. I backed motor-voter. We are now up to 74.4 percent of eligible voters registered in America in the 1996 election. You can be proud of that. 
People have said, `Yes, I will sign the form. I'm willing to go out and put my name on the voter rolls' knowing they may be called for jury duty or something else. They did it anyway. 
Then look what happened. Despite this dramatic increase in the people who are registering to vote, remember November 1996? Fewer than 50 percent of the American people then exercised their right to vote. 
I think that is a telling commentary on this debate. If you listen to the arguments of my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and Senator Bennett from Utah, who was on the floor the other day, and Speaker Newt Gingrich and others, they have analyzed the situation and said, clearly, the major problem with the American political system is, in their words, `We're just not spending enough money. We have to put more money in these campaigns. We have to get on television more and radio more, and mail more things to the American people. Then they will know we are out here.' 
Well, they know we are out here. They just aren't buying what we are selling. They are staying home. Those who argue that the best way to reform the system is to plow more money into the system have missed the point completely. Nine out of ten Americans--90 percent of them--believe that we spend too much in political campaigns, not too little. 
Isn't it an oddity that we are at this point in our history where we are actually engaging in an argument as to whether or not a person's wealth should determine their ability to participate in a democracy? This is not a new debate. We have been through this one before. In the 19th century, the debate was cast in a different tone. If you wanted to vote, would you have to be a property owner? That is an evidence of wealth and stability, and some of our Founding Fathers said, well, that is a good indicator, and we should not let people vote unless they own property, and the States can determine the qualifications of electors. Let them put that in as a qualification. 
We rejected that over 100 years ago and said that isn't what America is all about. Your participation with a vote should not have anything to do with whether you are wealthy or poor. If you are an American citizen, you are entitled to vote. Since the early part of this century, whether you are a man, a woman, black, white, or brown, whatever your ethnic heritage, whether you are poor as a church mouse or as rich as Donald Trump, you get the same one vote when you come to the polls. 
Listen to this debate today. The debate today says, let's change this system and say that if you are wealthy in America--let's say you are a middle-aged, crazy millionaire who decided he wants to be in the House or Senate or a Governor, then you go out and spend your money, exercise your constitutional right, show your freedom of speech to go forward and ask for votes. If you happen to have more money than the next guy, your likelihood of winning is that much better. What I just said is not breakthrough; this is established fact. Candidates with more money and political campaigns usually win. That is a fact of life. 
So my Republican friends who say, `All this system needs is more money,' are basically saying, `If we can just get wealthier people interested in running for office or people who are drawing money in from wealthy interests, special interests, that is good for America, that is endorsement of our Bill of Rights, and that speaks well of our freedom of speech.' 
I don't buy that. I don't think the American people buy that. 
As amendments are produced on the floor during the course of this debate which try to enshrine wealth as the keystone for American citizenship, I will oppose them. I hope Members on both sides will join me. It is a sad state of affairs in America if we have reached the point where, in fact, a person's wealth is a determinant as to whether they can be a successful candidate or be directly involved in our political process. That is what this debate is all about. That is why it could be historic in nature. 
Let me address one particular example used in the debate Friday about a good friend of mine who passed away a little over a year ago. His name was Mike Synar. Mike was a Congressman from Oklahoma. He was proud to characterize himself as an `Okie from Muskogee.' 
You have never met a political renegade like Mike Synar. I loved him. I loved his politics. He used to drive people crazy. He would vote on issues and know that, if he went home, people would be angry with him. He would get involved in issues that made everybody squirm and uneasy in their seats. That is just the way he was. He also decided to stack the deck against himself because he announced when he came to the House of Representatives, representing Muskogee, he wasn't going to take PAC money. Mike said, `I am going to take money from individuals, and I will rise or fall based on my friends supporting me, and so be it.' He managed to survive for a number of years. 
Then came 1994. All of the special interest groups that had been opposing him in the Halls of Congress decided to team up against him back home. In 1992, they had spent $750,000 to defeat Mike Synar. Who were these people? The National Rifle Association, the tobacco lobby, the western grazing interests. They came in, and did they debate Mike Synar on gun control in his district? No. Did they debate him on tobacco regulation? No. Did they debate him on whether or not we are too generous in the subsidies to western grazing? No. They came in and literally plowed hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign against him with negative ads on a variety of other subjects--and it was perfectly legal. Mike escaped it in 1992, but not in 1994. 
The illustration on the floor made by one of my colleagues last Friday that somehow or other `Mike Synar, with $325,000, could not defeat an opponent who only had $10,000 and, therefore, money is not the determinate in an election,' really overlooked the obvious. Mike Synar's money alone wasn't at risk. It was the money of a lot of special interest groups. He was defeated. He worked very hard for campaign finance reform and a lot of other issues that I have the highest respect for. 
Let me just also say that I have heard a lot of argument from my colleagues on the Republican side that this debate is really about labor unions, and we have to get our hand on the fact that labor unions in the last election were so vocal and involved and spent so much money. Some estimate $35 million. That is an interesting premise for this debate because, if you look at the totals that were spent by labor and business, the business community dramatically outspent labor organizations in that campaign. Yet, many of the amendments which we will be considering have nothing to do with the business community being restricted, only labor unions. 
I think some of my colleagues should take care to watch out for what is characterized as poison pills, or those amendments that will be put in the bill in the hope of killing the bill. It is an old legislative ploy. Take an amendment adopted on the floor, which you are certain could never be part of the final legislation, show your heartfelt concern about campaign finance reform, knowing in your heart of hearts that it will go nowhere with a poison pill amendment. We are going to see a lot of these, I am afraid, during the course of this debate. 
Let me address an issue that I think is critically important--television time. In the McCain-Feingold, as originally introduced, which I and 44 other Democratic Senators endorsed, which three of my Republican colleagues have joined in endorsing, including my colleague, the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins. I think the number may be up to four now, we have, in that original bill, provisions that would say to a candidate that we know what is costing money in campaigns. We know where you are putting your money. 
When I ran for the Senate in Illinois and raised literally millions of dollars sitting on a telephone day after day calling strangers and begging them to contribute, the money that was coming in was going right out the front door for television. That is where I spent my money. Most major State candidates do the same. My colleague, Bob Torricelli of New Jersey, spent 84 percent of all the money he raised on television. Think about that. Try to buy a 30-second TV ad in New York City that costs $100,000, and you 
will understand very quickly how that could happen. In Illinois, over 80 percent of our money went into raising money and spending it on television. 
I think it is a good illustration that if we don't address the reason campaigns are so expensive, we are not going to see any real reform. Now, the people who represent the television industry say you can't do that; you can't take away time that this station can sell to a private advertiser and give to it a political candidate. But they forgot something very basic. The people who own television stations and make a very handsome profit do it because they are using our airwaves--not the Senate's airwaves; the American people's airwaves. We own these airwaves. We license these companies, at no charge, to use our airwaves and make a profit. It is not unreasonable for us as a people to go back to these television stations and say we want to take a slight and tiny percentage of those airwaves and dedicate them to cleaning up the American election process, to make sure that the time is available for incumbents and challengers alike on a reduced level--or even free in some circumstances--so the voters can hear legitimate messages and we will clean up the message in the process. It won't be the drive-by shooting ads you see in campaigns. It will be informative. People will know where Durbin stands on Social Security and where his opponent stands on Social Security. Things like that. That is not unreasonable. For the stations to say, `don't even touch it; we own the airwaves, not the American people,' I think they need a reminder as to how this got started. They are licensed by this Government, representing the American people, to make their profits. Now the argument that we are going to take away reduced costs of TV time is troubling to me. If you don't reduce the cost of television, you will in fact continue to have political campaign costs skyrocketing. You will have men and women running for election and re-election to seats, spending the majority of their time raising money to pay for television. 
So I think the original McCain-Feingold provision is absolutely essential. I think we should continue on not only to eliminate soft money, not only to reduce the cost of television, but also to go after issue ads that are actually candidate ads. Political candidates and those who work around us watch television more closely than anybody, because we search that screen during a campaign cycle to find the tiniest of print on the bottom of the TV commercials, which identifies who paid for it. 
On the Saturday night before the election last November, bone weary, I pulled into my apartment in Chicago, and I was going to relax a little bit. It was in the closing days of the campaign. So I slumped down in a chair, grabbed the remote control to listen to Saturday Night Live. Somewhere between the news and Saturday Night Live, up pops four television commercials, one after the other, and every one of them blasting me. What a treat that was to sit in the chair and get pummeled by four different commercials. 
The most unique thing was that not a single one was paid for by my opponent, the Republican Party in Illinois, or the National Republican Party. They were paid for by committees and organizations that most people never heard of. These are organizations which mushroom up during campaigns, take some high-sounding name, collect millions of dollars, undisclosed and unreported, and run ads, the most negative ads on television, against politicians. That is an outrage. It is an outrage that I have to account for every dollar I raise and spend and I have to identify the television commercials that I put on, either comparing my record with my opponent or speaking about something I believe in, and these groups can literally run roughshod over the system, spending millions of dollars without any accountability. 
McCain-Feingold addresses that. Thank God it does. If we don't put an end to this outrage, most of these other reforms are meaningless. To eliminate soft money and to allow special interest groups, whether on the business or labor side, to continue to spend money unfettered in issue advocacy and the like is outrageous. The McCain-Feingold legislation is an idea whose time has come. 
I hope that a number of my colleagues will step forward, as my colleague, the Senator from Maine, has done already. We have 49 votes, ladies and gentlemen, for McCain-Feingold. We need one more. Every Democrat has signed onto this bipartisan legislation. We now have four Republican Senators. We need one more. Who will it be? Who will step forward and say, `This is the most important debate in American history and I want to be on the right side of history'? I hope we can come up not only with that 50th vote, but with enough votes procedurally to keep this issue alive. The rules of the Senate, like cloture and filibuster and the like, allow people who in the name of good government, or whatever, can stop an issue in its tracks. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope we can debate this to its conclusion and have a real vote on real reform. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for recognition this morning and the resumption of our consideration of this important bill. 
Amendment No. 1140, which I have offered, is an amendment that I think is absolutely essential if this bill is to be airtight. We are giving to outside laboratories the authority to review and approve medical devices, medical devices which literally could mean life or death for millions of Americans. 
When these approvals are given, these companies stand to make substantial profits because of FDA approval. The Durbin amendment corrects a serious error in this bill by making certain that there will be no conflict of interest by the third-party reviewers. We say in specific terms that those reviewing the medical devices cannot receive gifts from the company that is the owner of the medical device, they cannot receive or own stock of the company that they are reviewing, they cannot have been offered a job or solicited a job from the company that they are reviewing, and there must be a full financial disclosure. 
If we are going to maintain the integrity of the process, protect American consumers, and avoid this sort of conflict of interest, I urge my colleagues to adopt the Durbin amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you buy a car in America the manufacturer keeps a record of your name and address, or if there is a defect they can recall the car. This bill removes the requirement for medical device manufacturers to keep a record of those people who receive pacemakers and heart valves. Why is that important? Because, if there is a defect in that lifesaving medical device, they can't find the patients. What results? 
Just a few years ago 300 Americans died. They had the Bjork-Shiley heart valve that was defective and they couldn't be found. Does it make sense for us to remove this responsibility of medical device manufacturers? 
Take a look on your desk at a letter from 27 different organizations representing patients across America who say it is only sensible to make certain that we track and keep track of those who are receiving these medical devices. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is not too great a burden on a medical device manufacturer to keep a record of those receiving pacemakers and heart valves.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the bill before the Senate is one of the most important we will consider during the course of this Congress. I don't believe that is an overstatement. This bill addresses the future of the Food and Drug Administration, an agency which we literally entrust with the safety and efficacy of thousands of drugs and prescriptions which we keep in our home and give to members of our family. 
This agency has to be above reproach, it has to be efficient and responsible. This amendment No. 1140 that I am offering is an attempt to make certain that the integrity of the Food and Drug Administration is not compromised by this bill. I think overall this is a good bill. There are some areas Senator Kennedy and I and others feel need to be addressed. But the one part of this bill that I address with this amendment is one of great concern. 
We are now going to say that we will take outside of this Federal agency, outside of the Food and Drug Administration, the review of medical devices. We will say to third parties, which are hired for the purpose of making these reviews, that they will decide whether or not a medical device is safe for the American people and whether it's effective; and having made that decision, that company will then have an opportunity to sell that device across America. We as consumers will believe, as we should, that we can trust that judgment. 
The purpose of amendment No. 1140 is to address the question of whether or not the third-party reviewers are credible. This bill dramatically expands the ability of medical device companies to purchase their own third-party reviewers. Senators Feingold and Johnson and I are offering this amendment so that it's clear that it's only reviews and not approvals themselves that can be bought under this system. 
Up to 60 percent of medical devices going through the premarket notification process could utilize the outside reviewing system. A program of this magnitude will not permit the same level of close monitoring and oversight by the FDA as is currently undertaken. There are fewer than 10 firms that are credited for this purpose. That is why explicit anti-conflict-of-interest standards need to be laid out in the law. We should not cut corners when it comes to the question of conflict of interest. If we are going to give to these companies the authority to review and approve medical devices to be used across America, let us have no question that they are doing it in a professional way. 
The Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan, nonprofit Government watchdog group, described the bill's provisions in this area as grossly inadequate, and the Government Accountability Project, which is another watchdog group, described the current FDA regulations for their pilot program as `inadequate to guard against conflict of interest.' Both groups, along with a long list of consumer and patient groups, urge the Senate to adopt this Durbin amendment. 
Given the importance to the public of keeping the approval process untainted by monetary influence, we must ensure that there are strict anti-conflict-of-interest standards for product reviews. 
Only the vaguest language possible on the issue of preventing conflicts of interest is currently contained within the bill. Let me tell you what it says on page 16:  
The Secretary shall adopt methods of accreditation that ensure that entities or individuals who conduct reviews and make recommendations under this section are qualified, properly trained, knowledgeable about handling confidential documents and information and free of conflicts of interest. 
Nowhere does the bill mention what we mean by `free of conflicts of interest.' What are the standards that we will use? No reference point is given for a basic minimum that would satisfy and ensure unbiased review. 
Senator Harkin was successful in adding language that allows the FDA to look at contractual arrangements between an outside reviewing laboratory or entity and the company whose product is being reviewed. We would like to go a step further and add more protections against approval peddling. 
FDA employees themselves are subject to a wide range of anti-conflict-of-interest regulations. This amendment seeks to establish basic requirements, and it is very simple. It merely asks that outside reviewers not be allowed to have a financial interest in the company they review. 
Think about what I just said. The outside reviewer, which 
will decide whether a medical device should go on the market, should not have a financial interest in the company that he is reviewing. That seems rather simple to me. Nor should they be allowed to receive gifts from a company that has products being reviewed, and they should not be actively looking for a job with that company while they are in the process of making their review. No gifts, no job offers, no stocks. It seems simple. 
It is amazing to me that we are arguing over this provision. I would have thought this would have been accepted long ago by the majority. But instead, there is a fight as to whether or not we are going to demand the highest level of integrity and honesty when it comes to these third-party reviewers. 
Let me tell you why this is critically important. The approval by the FDA of a device can have a dramatic positive or negative economic impact on a company. If the FDA rejects a device and doesn't approve it, a stock can languish for months, if not years. If the FDA approval goes through, it is the seal of approval, and that company knows that there is money to be made. 
Look at this chart indicating what happened in four different instances with medical device companies when there was an FDA approval. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc. Look at how the stock shot right up with FDA approval. ATL Ultrasound. After FDA approval, it skyrockets. Thoratec Laboratories Corp., the same story; the stock is moving along slowly, and then, after FDA approval, it climbs dramatically, 50 or 60 percent in 1 day. It was the same thing with Integra LifeSciences Corp. 
What we are trying to say is, the people making the decision on behalf of us, as consumers, should make that decision without any concern about the bottom line of that company. Would you think twice about giving to a reviewer the decision to approve a product if you knew that reviewer owned a thousand shares of the company that made the product? I think most of us would. What if that reviewer and his family had just come back from a Caribbean vacation, paid for by the company that submits the medical device for approval, or if that reviewer happens to have sent his resume to that company a week before, saying, `I would like to have a job with you and, incidentally, I am working on your FDA approval,' with a wink and a nod? That doesn't make me feel any better about what we are dealing with here. 
The Durbin amendment basically says, let's get rid of the doubt as to whether or not people are going to use the highest professional standards. We should not cut corners here when it comes to conflicts of interest, when it comes to these outside laboratories. We have to demand the highest standards of professionalism. 
Time and again, companies have been shown to make dramatic profits with FDA approval. Dr. Kessler, a former head of the FDA, said, `Make no mistake, they talk a lot about approvals in Europe and in other countries. They can be lucrative, they can be profitable. But if you can get the approval of the Food and Drug Administration of the United States of America, it is a seal of approval recognized worldwide. The product you are trying to sell becomes a winner overnight.' Shouldn't the people making the decision as to whether or not this product is safe and efficacious be doing it on the basis of science, rather than on the question of their own financial interest? 
The medical device industry produces over $50 billion annually in sales. In fact, in a recent article in Medical Economics entitled `Why Medical Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio,' the medical device industry was described as `a hot market that's only getting hotter.' It doesn't take much imagination to see why we would not want to allow a reviewer to have stocks in the company they were reviewing. The connection between FDA approval and stock gain is just too clear. The money stakes are high for investors; however, the stakes are even higher for the patients who rely on these devices. 
The approval of an unsafe drug or device can have a devastating impact. Doctors, hospitals, nurses, and families rely 
on these decisions. If a corner is cut, if this reviewer has a financial interest and decides, well, I am just going to tip it a little bit toward my own stock portfolio here, the losers ultimately are the innocent people. Reviews must be of the most stringent nature and must be carried out without any outside corrupting influence. 
Surely, it is not too much to ask that a reviewer be prevented from accepting a gift or a loan from a company that he or she is reviewing. I can't imagine we are debating this. Should we allow the reviewer to take a gift from the company he is reviewing? That is an obvious conflict of interest and one that we can address explicitly. The language in the bill, unfortunately, is loaded with `weasel' words--weasel words about what a conflict of interest might be. We should make it crystal clear. It would give this bill more stature. It is an important bill and it should have that. 
Furthermore, a reviewer or their spouse or minor child should not be allowed to have a financial interest in the company being reviewed. That means owning stock or a mutual fund that has more than 10 percent invested in the company. This is all laid out in subpart H of the regulations that we refer to in our amendment. A final restriction that we are asking for is that the reviewer may not be actively soliciting future employment within the company they are reviewing. 
Our amendment, which sets out guidelines to prevent tainted reviews, allows the Secretary to modify such guidelines where it would be appropriate for outside reviewers. 
Therefore, if any provision included in these regulations would clearly not apply or not be appropriate, the Secretary can modify it. We have that flexibility built into our amendment. 
I have heard some of my colleagues argue for more flexibility. I believe our amendment gives enough. It sets out specific standards. I challenge any of my colleagues to suggest that a gift ban or a financial interest ban would be unreasonable. It would be a sad day in America if reviewers expect a gift, or a job offer, or some other financial gain in order to review a medical device and, worse, that we were not willing to categorically repudiate a potential for such `approval peddling.' 
This industry and their products are too important to the American people. These are literally life-and-death products. We should take a firm stand and specifically enumerate these basic standards within this legislation to prevent even the potential for the corruption of this process. 
Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time on this amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the conflict of interest provision which we have just discussed is a very important one, but the one which I am addressing with this amendment may be even more important. 
Consider this possibility. On Monday of next week you go out to buy a Pontiac. On Tuesday when you go to the doctor, he says, `You are going to have to go to the hospital, and you are going to need a pacemaker.' In 1 week you have a Pontiac and a pacemaker. What is the difference? When you bought the Pontiac, General Motors took note of your name and address. If anything went wrong with the Pontiac, they would contact you in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or even later, and say, `Bring it in. It needs to be fixed.' It might not be safe, if you didn't. However, under this bill the pacemaker that you are going to have implanted by the surgeon perhaps a few days later doesn't have the same kind of following. Why? Because we let that exist. 
Why would we let people have lifesaving devices implanted in their bodies and not keep track of that fact? That is what this amendment is all about, because this bill, as good as it is, takes away the mandatory requirement that we have surveillance and tracking of these high-risk devices that can be implanted in people. 
I am glad to be joined by Senators Harkin and Senator Johnson in offering this amendment which strikes the sections of the bill that undermine many of the patient protections for medical devices put in place by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. 
This act of 1990 instituted a mandatory surveillance program to identify quickly any potential problems with approved high-risk devices. A mandatory tracking system to locate patients in the event a safety recall was also added. 
Sections 605 and 606 in this act are nothing more than a backdoor attempt to eliminate these programs that industry considers burdensome. Yes, they are burdensome. To keep track of the name and address of each person who is given a pacemaker is a big burden on industry. But what kind of burden is it on the patient when the pacemaker fails and the patient can't be found? I would suggest that it is a much greater burden. That is what this amendment addresses. 
Proponents of sections 605 and 606 say that the FDA has not been vigilant with respect to overseeing these vital programs. Does anyone imagine they are going to be more vigilant in enforcing these safety protections when they are relegated to an optional or discretionary status? Especially given CBO's high estimate of this bill's additional costs to the FDA without any corresponding increase in funding. Pressure can only increase on the agency to curtail its efforts in discretionary programs. 
Opponents of this amendment will point to the fact that the administration went along with this change. This point is in fact even more worrisome when you look at what types of devices we are talking about, and the tragedies that may occur. 
Many of us remember the tragedies that resulted from the Bjork-Shiley heart valve failures. Extensive congressional hearings were held in the late 1980's examining what had gone wrong and how we might prevent future repeats of these terrible tragedies. 
Over 300 people died in the United States from these heart valve failures, and over 1,000 worldwide. 
After it was concluded that these heart valves were defective--after they realized the product had failed--over 50 percent of the patients with these heart valves couldn't be located. 
One widow testified--and this is a tragic story--about how her husband, who had a Bjork-Shiley heart valve implant, suffered chest pains but had no idea that the heart valve was the cause of the problem. She was in a position to choose from two hospitals. 
She quickly raced to one hospital, and made the wrong choice. She went to the hospital that didn't specialize in heart surgery when her husband needed to live. She didn't know. Why didn't she know? She wasn't on the list. Her husband's name and address were not on the list to be notified that the heart valve he carried in his body was failing him. 
What does tracking actually involve? It involves a patient--this is I don't think a burden from that perspective--filling out a registration form with their address so they can be located if there is a recall of a pacemaker, or high-risk device. Most companies make this request already. 
What kind of devices are we talking about? Just about anything? No. There are 17 specific types of devices that require mandatory tracking. We are talking about heart valves; pacemakers and pacemaker leads; vascular stents; jaw, shoulder, and hip joint replacements; windpipe prosthesis; breathing monitors and ventilators. 
It is hard to imagine the tracking of these high-risk devices could ever been made optional, and yet that is exactly what this bill does. 
FDA has already complained that they find it extremely difficult to enforce this provision, and yet, instead of making it stronger and helping them with enforcement, this bill weakens it. It weakens the FDA's ability to make this kind of adequate tracking and surveillance available. 
Automobile manufacturers are required to have a tracking system to notify those who buy cars. It even happens with motorcycles. Look at this. What a coincidence. In the Phoenix Gazette of Friday, January 11, 1991, there are two articles next to one another. Harley-Davison recalls its motorcycles. We have a problem here. It turns out that their brake calipers are defective and could cause their front wheels to lock while driving. 
Right next to it, on Consumer Watch, jaw implants. It is found that the implants of Vitek of Houston caused bone degeneration. If we cannot track the people who bought the jaw implants through their surgeon, we can certainly find the owners of the Harley-Davidsons. Does that make sense?

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, another key aspect of the Safe Medical Device Act, which this bill undermines, is the mandatory surveillance program for high-risk medical devices. 
These surveillance programs are extremely important for early detection. 
In some cases, the initial breakage of a device may not cause instantaneous harm. For example, in the case of the Telectronics Heart Pacemaker `J' Leads which are found to be defective in 12 percent of the patients with them, breakage didn't result in any harm until the next bout of heart arythmia. Surveillance of these leads identified problems in some patients. And this led to the notification of patients with these leads of the need to have them checked. 
Likewise, in the case of the Bjork-Shiley heart valves, 300 Americans died when this tiny heart valve no bigger than a pen turned out to have a structural defect. 
This is a blowup of a photograph of a heart valve. And it shows a crack in one of these struts on this heart valve. This crack alone wouldn't be lethal. But when the strut next to it cracks, it is too late. You are going to die unless you have immediate surgical relief. 
We believe that once you know that the heart valve is in danger, you should know the people who have received it so that you can notify them so that they can go to a doctor and have the necessary test to see if they are in danger. 
Early detection and correction could have prevented many of the 300 deaths that occurred when this Bjork-Shiley valve failed. 
Let me tell you about another case, teflon jaw implants. People with the temporal mandibular problems--TMJ--have turned to these implants as a way of dealing with a maddening situation, and a very painful one. 
In the case of the implants made by Vitek in the 1980's, early detection unfortunately wouldn't help. These implants splintered and caused massive corrosion of jaws and skull due to the triggering of inflammation and other immune responses. By the time the patients suffered pain, for many of them it was too late. Many of the patients required the removal of much of their jawbone structure because this implant had failed. Even some of their skulls were exposing their brain because of this subsequent surgery. 
If a surveillance program had been in place prior to the Vitek jaw implant defect, many of the patients would have been able to have their implants removed prior to the full deterioration of their jaws. In fact, many individuals would have been saved altogether from ever having the implants inserted in the first place. 
Vitek jaw implants were first marketed in 1983, but it wasn't until 1990 that FDA sent out a safety alert, and in 1991 issued a recall. 
Think about that, 7 or 8 years later we finally realized that there was a problem with this implant. 
At that stage, between 25,000 and 26,000 patients had received these implants. The rate of failure was nearly 100 percent. 
Here on these charts you see some of the sad stories of the victims. These are troublesome to see, but think about these poor people and what they went through. Asking these companies to keep track of the people who received these implants is not unreasonable when you take this lovely young lady in this picture and look how she deteriorated after these implants started to fail. And the same thing, this lovely lady in this picture and what happened to her face as a result of the implant failure. On this one, look at this. After the implant failed, look what happened. It actually emerged from the skin. 
Is this something that we want to think twice about? I would think that as a matter of just decency we should include in this bill tracking and surveillance to try to avoid this from happening to anybody in the future. 
Some may try to argue we still have the medical device reporting system. That is no substitute for company surveillance. The medical device reporting system is basically a body count program. We hope that we could have a strong program to detect problems before death and injury. That is exactly what a surveillance program does. Many medical devices on the market are approved on the basis of data from trials of shorter than the lifespan of the device. Vascular stint, approved by the FDA this year, was approved on data after 6 months of use. FDA requires surveillance to check if the device will be safe for a longer period similar to the life expectancy of the device. 
I would like to also bring to the attention of my colleagues a recent GAO report on the inadequacies of the medical device reporting system before anyone starts arguing that it is a substitute for surveillance programs. This report from the GAO states that between March 1994 and April 1995, a backlog of about 48,000 malfunction reports from manufacturers accumulated at the FDA. Many of the malfunction reports, according to GAO, were not entered into the adverse event reporting system until 1996--almost 2 years in some instances. In fact, the House device bill suggests eliminating even this report because of its inefficiencies. 
In contrast to that system, the tracking and surveillance programs which I am pushing for are much more effective. This January a good example of this was seen in the case of a runaway pacing implantable cardioverter defibrillator manufactured by Ventritex. Due to their surveillance programs, Ventritex realized the clock in the defibrillator was running radically. 
For those who are not familiar, it is a situation where a person has a heart problem where the heart beats irregularly. The defibrillator feeds a shock to the heart to stop the defibrillation and save the person's life. The company realized it was not working right. That kind of problem could be fatal for individuals with these defective devices implanted. On January 15, the company met with FDA and proposed a temporary fix that could set these devices straight. Within less than a month, over 97 percent of the 5,600 patients were found and their devices were reprogrammed. Thousands of lives may have been saved by this effective tracking and surveillance. 
Shouldn't this be the case for every lifesaving device? Why does this bill water it down? Why does this bill take away the tracking and surveillance that would give us the necessary information to track this very sort of thing to save people's lives. 
In the pretracking days, before we started doing this, I have a letter from a lady named Charlotte Evans. She only discovered this year that her teflon jaw implant might be defective even though the product has been off the market for over 7 years, but no tracking program had been in effect when she bought it. For 11 years since she had this device implanted, her jaw had been undergoing deterioration due to this defect, but she had no notice of any problems with the device. 
I think the final chart says it all. Mandatory surveillance leads to early detection of problems, which results in fewer deaths and less serious injuries. Mandatory tracking gives us effective recall and saves lives. To rely only on the medical device reporting system is to treat American people as though they were lab rats while we wait for the body and injury count to mount. 
Let me tell you who supports my amendment: Victims Against Lethal Valves, the TMJ Association, the National Breast Implant Task Force, NORD, AARP, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, AMFAR, the AIDS Action Council, DES Action, Center for Medical Consumers, Committee for Children, Human Rights Campaign, National Women's Health Network, Public Citizen, and the Treatment Action Group. 
I hope that it will also be supported by a majority of my colleagues. If any of us believed for a moment that someone we love, a member of our family, was about to undergo a surgery and have a device implanted in their body and then be lost so that if something is found wrong with that device later on and their lives are in danger, we would think twice about this provision in the bill. 
Let us keep tracking and surveillance in the bill. The medical device manufacturers must accept the burden of keeping track of the people who receive these devices. If something goes wrong, it is literally our only way to avoid injury and save lives. 
Mr. President, at this point I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding. 
We can all remember 2 years ago when there was a debate on Capitol Hill about closing down the Federal Government. Rush Limbaugh and people like him went on the radio and said, `Go ahead and do it, no one will notice. No one will notice if you close down these Federal agencies. They are just a drain on the Treasury and our tax dollars.' 
But the agency that we are talking about today is an agency you would notice immediately--immediately--because the Food and Drug Administration, as small as it is by Federal standards, is one of the most important. There is not a single thing you buy in the drugstore or look at in your medicine chest at home that the Food and Drug Administration has not taken a look at to make sure it is safe for you, your kids, and your family. 
That is why this FDA reform bill is so critically important to this Nation to make sure we make this agency more efficient. I want to salute the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. They have had their differences on issues, but I think most Senators, Democrats and Republicans, agree reform is needed. This bill is a step in the right direction. 
It is in that spirit that I will offer several amendments. Let me tell you about two that I think people should take notice of. If you went out today and decided to buy a car for your family--a few years ago I went out and bought a Ford--you will have your name and address entered into a computer. If at some later date something is found wrong with that car, the brakes are faulty or there is some mechanism on the door that is not safe, they will notify you, they will track you down, and they will send you a notice. A lot of Americans have received them, `Come on in to our shop, and we will fix your car.' That is reasonable. None of us want to drive an unsafe vehicle. 
My amendment says is it not now reasonable, when it comes to heart valves and pacemakers and items like that, that we do the same thing? If you or your loved one is told by the doctor you need a pacemaker, you think long and hard about it but say, `Doctor, if you think that is what I need to live, so be it.' You go through the surgery, and everything works out just fine. Wouldn't you like to be on a list somewhere so that if a defect is found in that pacemaker 6 months, a year, or 2 years later, that you can be notified? That is what my amendment says. Track and surveillance, find the customers that use the products. If there is a change, let the customers know, let the people know, so they can go back to their doctor, back to the hospital. I don't think that is unreasonable. 
The second thing is we want to move some of the drug surveillance, for example, and drug approval off the Food and Drug Administration campus and take it to third-party reviewers. Now, this is being done in Europe and other places. It is not unreasonable that we would go to a laboratory and say, `You do the testing, you read the results; you tell us whether this drug is ready for the market.' I think that is a reasonable thing for us to try to do, under supervised circumstances. 
But my amendment says let us make certain, absolutely certain, that this third-party reviewer does not have an economic interest in the drug company seeking approval. Would you trust a reviewer who just happened to have a thousand shares of stock of the company making the product that he is deciding whether it will go to market or not? Would you have second thoughts if that person was being offered a job by the same company whose drug he is reviewing just happened to get a vacation in the Caribbean last summer at the expense of the same company? 
Conflict of interest statutes are important here. If we are going beyond the Federal Government and we are going to have private laboratories doing this, for goodness sakes, let's be certain that their judgment and decisions are based on sound science and not on financial gain. That is what my second amendment will do. 
I think these will move us along toward making the FDA an even better agency. There are a lot of critics of the Food and Drug Administration. I have worked closely with this administration for over 12 years. Some of the finest people in Government are working out there. Sometimes they are frustrated that we wish they would bring things to market more quickly. Did you read the newspaper this morning? Occasionally, things are moved to the market that aren't safe. Thank goodness, the FDA can say it is time to take the item off the market, or decide the benefits are not outweighed by the problems this drug creates. We have to keep this agency strong and independent and above political criticism. The two amendments which I will be offering on the floor are an attempt to do that. 
I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation on behalf of Mr. Sylvester Flis, a permanent resident alien from Poland, now living in Chicago. This bill would grant immediate citizenship to Sylvester by waiving the mandatory 5-year waiting period required of all permanent residents wishing to become U.S. citizens. Out of great respect for what U.S. citizenship stands for and the privileges it bestows, the Senate has rarely granted this kind of request, and only in cases that it deems to be uniquely compelling. After hearing Sylvester's story, I am confident my colleagues will agree with me that this request fulfills this high standard and is therefore deserving of their support. 
Sylvester entered this country as a permanent resident in July 1994 after learning that his grandmother, by virtue of having been born in New Haven, CT and being a U.S. citizen, could sponsor her family to be in the United States. He now lives in Chicago with his parents, Czeslaw and Lucja, his sister, Anna, and brother, Ireneusz. 
Like many young Eastern Europeans who grew up during the final years of Soviet domination, Sylvester, now 23 years of age, is eager to take advantage of the opportunities offered by his new found freedom. He currently takes English classes and is working toward his GED, general equivalency diploma. Sylvester works for his uncle's carpentry business and hopes to eventually find a job in electronics, which is what he studied as a student in Poland. Like the millions of immigrants who have preceded him, Sylvester has left behind the security of friends and familiar surroundings to come to the United States to share his talents and make our Nation a stronger one. 
Two things, however, make Sylvester very different from most immigrants. First, he suffers from a disease known as spina bifida. Spina bifida is the failure of the spine to close during the first month of pregnancy. This results in varying degrees of paralysis, loss of sensation in the lower limbs, difficulty with bowel and bladder management, and learning disabilities. As a result of his condition, Sylvester is confined to a wheelchair. 
The second thing that distinguishes Sylvester from most immigrants is that he is a world class athlete. Despite his condition, Sylvester has developed into one of the top sled hockey players in the country. I imagine most of you are unfamiliar with sled hockey, as was I until I became familiar with Sylvester's story. Sled hockey is a variation of regular hockey that is played by disabled individuals on a regulation rink. Sled hockey has all the same rules as regular hockey except that players use sleds, rather than ice skates, to maneuver around the ice. 
Last Spring, Sylvester competed with the United States National Team in international sled hockey competitions in Sweden and the United Kingdom. He hopes to compete with the United States in the 1998 Paralympics in Nagano, Japan next March. The Paralympics are an international athletic competition for individuals with mobility disabilities held every 4 years. They begin soon after the completion of the regular Olympic Games and are held in the same city and country as the Olympics. Sylvester is considered a lock to make next year's team. 
To make that dream a reality, however, Sylvester needs to be a U.S. citizen by the end of this coming January, which is when the final team will be selected. While the International Olympic Committee allows Paralympians to represent countries with which they have permanent residency, the U.S. Olympic Committee [USOC] has very strict rules which require citizenship for all U.S. competitors. Sylvester was eligible to participate with the United States team in Europe last Spring because those competitions were not sponsored by the USOC. By granting Sylvester citizenship and waiving the mandatory 5-year-waiting period, he will be eligible to compete for the United States in Japan. Without a waiver, Sylvester would become a citizen in July 1999, which would be too late for the 1998 games. Poland will not be competing in sled hockey at these games, making the United States team Sylvester's only chance to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime event. 
As I mentioned at the outset, Sylvester is more than just a good athlete who wants to compete for the United States. He is a young man of tremendous character who has worked hard to become part of our community. I've spoken to several people who have worked with Sylvester and they all attest to his work ethic, his character, and his enthusiasm for helping others. This spirit is best demonstrated by the active role he has played in the Chicago community to help other disabled individuals overcome the obstacles they face in their daily lives. His volunteer activities include teaching sled hockey at the Chicago Park District to disabled and nondisabled individuals. He also volunteers with Wheelchair Dance Chicago, an organization that, as the name suggests, helps disabled individuals learn to dance. Through his association with the Spina Bifida Association, Sylvester has provided a positive role model to those with disabilities who wish to excel. 
Being disabled can be hard. It's even harder when you live in an unfamiliar country where you have to learn a new language. Sylvester has overcome these obstacles to not only build a new life with his family in the United States, but to become an accomplished athlete and a valuable part of his community. He is a true American success story. The waiving of the mandatory waiting period for Sylvester would grant citizenship to a young man who has much to offer our country, both inside the rink and out.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud Lithuania and Poland for their efforts in promoting peace and security in Central and Eastern Europe. This past weekend, Lithuania and Poland hosted an international conference in Vilnius on the subject of coexistence between nations and good neighborly relations. The conference brought together the leaders of 11 countries--Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Belarus, Finland, and Russia--to discuss practical ways to promoting peaceful relations among their peoples. Lithuania and Poland pointed to improvements in their own relationship as a model for other nations. I also commend President Clinton for recognizing the leadership of Lithuania and Poland on this issue, by sending the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs as the United States representative to the Vilnius conference. 
In convening this conference, Lithuania and Poland stressed the essential connections between democratic institutions, free markets, and peace. Democratic institutions are founded on the values of tolerance and respect for individual and minority rights; values which promote good relations between neighbors. Free markets are providing the people of that region with unprecedented opportunities to improve their lives in material terms, giving them an incentive to put aside old animosities and differences. And of course, peace provides an environment in which democratic institutions and free markets can flourish. The work of the Vilnius conference advances major American foreign policy goals: security in the North Atlantic region and the expansion of democratic institutions and free markets. 
Lithuania and Poland are meeting their responsibilities in the new Europe. They are leading the way in forging a new pattern of politics in Europe, as Secretary of State Albright called for during her trip to Lithuania last July. During her visit, Secretary Albright stated that any new members of NATO must be producers of security, not merely consumers. Mr. President, by reaching out to their neighbors--including Russia--Lithuania and Poland are showing themselves to be producers of security. They are, in short, excellent candidates for NATO membership. We in the Senate should do all we can to encourage Lithuania and Poland in their efforts to promote security in the North Atlantic region and to support their membership in NATO.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for taking the floor on this issue. It is a very timely issue. 
I am a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and we have been engaged in months of preparation and weeks of deliberation on the question of campaign finance. Over $4 million will be spent on this investigation. Seventy lawyers have been hired. We have issued hundreds of subpoenas for documents, and we have brought before our committee dozens of witnesses, most under oath, and some with grants of immunity, and yet it does not seem what we are doing has resonated. 
I think what it suggests is that, if this committee had started off with the premise that when their deliberations had been completed we would come forward with campaign finance reform, the 1998 election would look different to the American voters and I think the public interest would have been heightened in our effort. 
Unfortunately, if we just find ourselves recapitulating the sins of the past instead of talking about real reform, it does not strike a resonant cord. The recent vote in the primary in New York City, which was very low, and the vote last November, the lowest percentage turnout for a Presidential election in 72 years, should be a signal to us and to every politician: The more money we spend on campaigns, the fewer voters turn out to vote. 
Now, that is a message, unfortunately, of a growing cynicism about this system. Those of us who believe in this democracy and believe in this Government and believe that we as a democracy have the capacity to change in the right direction, have to move forward in a positive way. 
I want to congratulate the minority leader, Senator Daschle. Forty-five Democrats coming together behind us, with three Republican sponsors, puts us within striking distance. Within hours--within hours--we could have two Republican Senators this afternoon say, `That's it, we have decided we will join.' 
It is time for campaign finance reform. We could achieve it before we leave at the end of this year. If we do not, I suggest that it is only going to add to the public's cynicism. I certainly hope that is not the case. 
I salute the Senator for his leadership and thank him for bringing this matter to the forefront.

Mr. DURBIN. I believe the point by the Senator from Alabama is his covers the expenses but does not cover the legal fees. So the expenses of literally physically collecting all these documents would be covered, but to have the first attorney sit down and try to read them is going to be limited. So it is one thing to have a warehouse full of documents, but if you want to have competent legal minds reading those documents, deciding what is important for the lawsuit, the Senator from Alabama says that is fine, but we are going to put a ceiling on this, there is just so much money to spend.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
Why are we here today? Because the tobacco company lobbyists, at the last minute, in our tax bill, which we considered several weeks ago, managed to sneak in a provision that was not debated on the floor of the Senate, nor on the floor of the House. It was never brought to public light. It wasn't discussed by the leadership, by anyone. And this provision, which is 46 words at the end of the tax bill--a provision which they hoped no one would notice--gave to the tobacco companies a $50 billion setoff against any tobacco settlement. The tobacco companies that came to us and said, `We have learned our lesson, we are a new industry, we are sensitive to the public health problems we have created,' managed to sneak in in the dead of night and put in this provision, which gave them a $50 billion setoff. 
Outrageous. When it was discovered and when we went about Capitol Hill, from office to office, saying, `All right, who is going to claim pride of authorship here?' Not a soul would admit they authored this provision. After weeks of investigation, finally, a staff member came forward and said to the USA Today that it was prepared, word for word, by the tobacco companies. They put this provision in the law. They put it at the tail end of this bill, and the leadership on Capitol Hill looked the other way, at best. As a result, this $50 billion outrage is now in the law. 
Senator Collins of Maine and I have offered an amendment to repeal that. Now, the tobacco companies don't like our amendment. They have already said publicly that if the Durbin-Collins amendment is adopted, it is going to jeopardize the settlement. They want a $50 billion windfall. Well, I sense from the debate today that when this is over, that provision is going to be repealed. But I have learned from over 10 years of fighting these tobacco companies never to assume a thing. They always have one trick left in the bag. Unfortunately, that trick is the Sessions amendment. 
Let me tell you this. I don't, for a moment, question the sincerity of my colleague from Alabama. Nor do I suggest that he is a cat's-paw of the tobacco companies. But make no mistake, if he ends up winning his amendment, you will see a smile on the grizzled mug of Joe Camel, because the Sessions amendment will achieve what the tobacco companies have failed to achieve. The Sessions amendment is the effort of the tobacco companies when they can't stop the lawsuits to stop the lawyers. 
Oh, how they must despise these plaintiffs' lawyers--this army of lawyers who joined with attorneys general across the United States in 40 different States and said, `We will join with you in suing the tobacco giants. We understand each State is hard pressed to have the resources to bring the lawsuits. We will be involved in the lawsuits on a contingent basis. If you win, if your State wins, then we get a fee. If you don't, then our fee is reduced.' 
It is a contingent-fee basis. It is a basis for many lawsuits. There is nothing inherently evil or outrageous about it. Many people come to lawyer's offices every day without the resources to prosecute a lawsuit, and a lawyer says, `I will take it on a contingency. If you win, I win a fee. If you lose, I don't win a fee.' There is nothing sinister about this. It is a contingent fee. 
So that is what we are debating here today. The Senator from Alabama calls it jackpot justice. I have heard him in committee and on the floor. And he has very strong personal feelings about contingent-fee lawsuits. That is his point of view. I don't share it. But consider what his amendment would do. 
First, it would limit the total attorney's fees paid in the United States of America to all the plaintiffs' lawyers assisting all the attorneys general to $250 million maximum--a huge sum of money, is it not? But in the context of a tobacco settlement of $368 billion, how big is it? It is one-tenth of 1 percent. That is the contingency fee which the Senator from Alabama thinks is a reasonable amount. I would suggest to him that he shouldn't prejudge what each State attorney general faced when they were asked by their taxpayers and consumers in the State to bring a lawsuit against these giant tobacco companies and entered into agreements with the various attorneys to help them do that. 
In fact, I think quite honestly the Sessions amendment is designed to stop one lawsuit in particular--the Minnesota lawsuit. Attorney General Skip Humphrey of Minnesota said he is going to try it. Unlike the States of Mississippi and Florida, which have settled, the State of Minnesota has said we are going to take this to trial. The tobacco companies dread that prospect because, if, in fact, Minnesota goes to trial, then the documents which they have secreted, the documents which they have concealed for decades, will finally come to light. 
I went to a meeting a few weeks ago, Senator Daschle's task force on this subject. And a representative of the tobacco companies came in, and said that if the Minnesota case goes to trial there will not be a tobacco settlement. They dread so the prospect that the things which they have secreted away from public scrutiny will come to light that they, in fact, have said, `Stop the Minnesota case.' 
I believe the Sessions amendment wittingly or unwittingly will stop the Minnesota case. Is that fair? Is that fair after the State of Minnesota and so many other States have invested so much in this effort for us to step in at this moment, and say, `We will void your agreements, we will void your contracts, we are the Federal Government, after all, and we will second-guess you?' 
Some people even question whether Senator Sessions' amendment is constitutional. They wonder if we, in fact, under article I, section 10, of the Constitution can impair the obligation of contracts already entered into. But I don't know that we will resolve that constitutional question on the floor. 
What we can accept as a reality is that if the Sessions amendment goes forward it will at least put a damper on any future lawsuits and perhaps stop them in place. They will be jumping for joy on tobacco road, if the Sessions amendment is successful. In aiming at the attorneys and their contingency fees, the Sessions amendment hits the public health community, which has had the courage to step forward with 40 attorneys general and sue the tobacco companies. The Senator from Alabama may think that he is sending a message to the attorneys of America about contingency fees. He is sending a message to tobacco companies that they still have a chance on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I hope my colleagues will not support this amendment. In fact, I would like to let them know that if, in fact, my motion to table prevails and the Sessions amendment is not agreed to, that I will then offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment of my own. 
I would like to read it.  
It is the sense of the Senate that attorney's fees paid in connection with an action maintained by a State against one or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco related costs affected by Federal tobacco settlement legislation should be publicly disclosed and should not displace spending in the settlement legislation intended for public health. 
The bottom line of my substitute would require each State, each attorney general, to make a public disclosure of their fee arrangement with any attorneys that have been brought into this lawsuit, and no moneys paid to those attorneys will be at the expense of the public health initiatives that are part of this settlement. Then in each State the attorney general, in most cases elected, will have to be held accountable as he or she should be for their decision. 
I don't think that is unreasonable. And I think, as they come forward to explain to the taxpayers of their State that they entered into this contingency fee arrangement knowing that they might or might not recover, that the attorney's fee ultimately paid will be justified by the money coming back from the tobacco companies to the taxpayers of the State. Public disclosure--I don't think that is unreasonable. 
But I do believe the Sessions amendment is unreasonable. What it seeks to do is begin to draft the national tobacco settlement agreement. And I don't think that is fair, and I don't think this is the appropriate time to do it. 
The purpose of the Durbin-Collins amendment is to go back to where we started--to that point in time where the tobacco companies' offer of $368.5 billion, through the State attorneys general, came to Capitol Hill to be debated. It wipes off the books the $50 billion set-aside--the $50 billion giveaway--and it says we are back to the starting point. 
If we adopt the Sessions amendment, I think we are going to jeopardize not only the active prosecution of these tobacco companies but jeopardize this settlement agreement. 
I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I want to clarify something that has been said during the course of debate. First, is it the intention of the amendment of the Senator that the limitation on attorney's fees would apply in those cases where States decide to go forward and prosecute a case as opposed to those that are involved in the national settlement agreement? 
</TEXT>

Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator is saying--I am trying to reconcile his section (b). He applies this limitation to court orders as well as any settlement agreement. It would seem his limitation on attorney's fees would apply in either instance, whether the State decides to prosecute the claim and ignore the possibility of a national settlement or in fact reaches a settlement agreement. It would appear that his limitation on the attorney's fees would apply in either case.

The second point I would like to raise, in section (e) where you provide for funds for children's health research, if in fact attorney's fees are not to be paid out of the $368.5 billion and in fact are to be paid separately, from what source is the Senator drawing these funds that would go to the National Institutes of Health?

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let my say in conclusion, I was really captivated by this closing argument. Now the tobacco companies, after all these years of exploiting children, come in with this `God bless Tiny Tim' amendment which says if we can just stop these mendacious lawyers, we are going to find money for children's health research. I think the American people have seen through this before and will see through this amendment. There is no money in here for children's health research. The $368.5 billion settlement does not include attorneys' fees. So, any money saved, according to the Senator from Alabama, is not going to be there for us to appropriate to the National Institutes of Health. 
No, I think this is window dressing on an amendment which is very clear. It is late in the ball game. The score is very heavy on the side of public health and very heavy against the tobacco companies. So, on the last play, as the quarterback or the State attorney general tries to down the ball, in come the tobacco boys trying to sack him. They are angry. They hate to lose and they hate to lose big, so they come in with this amendment, this amendment to get even with these plaintiff lawyers for having brought these lawsuits to try to limit any State attorney general's authority to regulate a fee. 
I agree with others who have spoken. I am not sure this is constitutional, but it is certainly not fair. It is not fair at this moment in time to presume, on every attorney general who brought this lawsuit, that they were, in fact, making a bad bargain for the taxpayers of their State. I think they should be held accountable. My substitute amendment, when this is defeated, will say there will be a public disclosure and none of the attorney's fees will come out of the money for the public health aspects of this settlement. But make no mistake, the Sessions amendment is an amendment which the tobacco companies want. It will put a damper on lawsuits. It will give the tobacco companies the upper hand in the settlement negotiations. And it will completely discount the sincere and good-faith efforts of 40 different States that had the courage to step forward and sue the tobacco companies. 
The Senator from Alabama says their decision to go forward was a wrong one; their decision to pay the attorneys was a wrong one. I do not think he should presume to make that decision. It is a decision made by each of them, and we should respect it. 
At this point, I move to table the amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I support the Wellstone amendment. Make no mistake, what Senator Wellstone is proposing before this Senate is the other side of the argument of the Senator from Alabama. The Senator from Alabama came before us and basically said, even though we are not talking about any Federal dollars here, even though we are not talking about any action in any Federal court, we as a Federal legislature will dictate to the State of Minnesota, the State of Illinois, I suppose even the State of Alabama that they cannot enter into an agreement with any attorneys to proceed with tobacco litigation unless it meets the Federal guidelines proposed by the Senator from Alabama. 
Well, I am sorry, but I do not believe that that is our responsibility. I think it goes beyond our constitutional responsibility. I think what the Senator from Minnesota has offered is reasonable. How can we ever presume to judge what are the appropriate attorneys' fees and arrangements in a State like Minnesota where Attorney General Humphrey has probably gone to greater lengths than any attorney general in the United States bringing these documents together, filing a creative lawsuit, being assertive, making certain that the people of Minnesota are represented. For any Senator from Illinois, Alabama or anywhere to stand up and say, I am sorry, Minnesota, this is not yours to decide, this is to be decided by the Federal Congress, even though there is no Federal money, no Federal court. We are dealing in State courts, we are dealing with tobacco companies making payments. I think it is entirely presumptuous for us to go along with the premise that we in the Senate will decide attorneys' fees case by case and State by State. 
I stand in support of the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I might say at this point neither the Senator from Alabama, the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from Minnesota knows how this story is going to end. We don't know what this global settlement will say and how it affects the agreements heretofore entered into by other States, whether it's Minnesota, Mississippi, or Florida. I think it is presumptuous of us today to suggest we are going to set the guidelines. 
The Senator from Alabama stood up repeatedly and said, `I don't know what these legal agreements are. They could be awful.' If the Senator doesn't know what they are, then how can he suggest they are awful? I don't know that some of those agreements might say if a case is settled either by global settlement or otherwise, the attorney's fees will be dramatically reduced. The Senator doesn't know, but he went forward with his amendment. 
The Senator from Minnesota has hit the nail on the head. These attorneys general who had the courage to come forward in the lawsuits but didn't have the resources to prosecute them, entered into agreements to bring in other attorneys to help. They fought a big battle in Minnesota; $125 million spent by the tobacco companies, yet they fought on valiantly and they are going to bring this case on to trial in January. And for us to close the door today and say it's over, no more agreements in terms of attorney's fees--I think it's presumptuous. It's exactly what the tobacco companies are praying for.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-durbin-il-27-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment gets to the heart of the question. What are these agreements? Are they generous? Are they reasonable? Each attorney general, under my agreement, will be forced to put it on the table in front of the people and say, `Here is what I agreed to. If I agreed to pay 25 percent of the settlement then I have to explain to the taxpayers of the State why that was a sensible thing to do at the time.' If it is a reasonable agreement, so be it. If not, the public official will be held accountable. And none of the money paid in attorney's fees will come out of the amount to be spent for public health purposes. I think this gets to the heart of it. 
The Senator from Alabama, in his amendment, says $5 million a State is more than enough to prosecute the tobacco companies; $5 million a State. It sounds like a princely sum until we hear the Senator from Minnesota stand up and tell us the tobacco companies spent $125 million in that State to defend themselves, 25 times as much. All of a sudden you step back and say maybe $5 million doesn't give you the resources for a fair fight. 
The Senator from Alabama has repeatedly said he doesn't know what these agreements consist of in other States. I think that is the reason why his amendment is flawed. 
Also, I think we should know in a State like Florida, which recently entered into an agreement, the question of attorney's fees was necessarily set aside. It is not part of the agreement that was announced. It is another amount to be paid by the tobacco companies, separate and apart from what is going to be paid to the taxpayers of Florida. 
Finally, let me say in virtually every one of these cases, in every State, not only will the court of public opinion decide whether attorney's fees are fair, but the courts will decide. Ultimately they have to rule on any order of settlement and any kind of agreement which might, in fact, bring it into a lawsuit. So they will have to ultimately rule on these attorney's fees. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, we don't have a settlement agreement. We are not talking about legislating one today. There is a good question, whatever we add to this appropriations bill, whether it is going to have an ultimate impact on that agreement. 
Let me also say, on the question of expenses, I think the Senator from New Hampshire would acknowledge expenses are specified costs of a lawsuit and don't get to attorney's fees. So, I would quarrel with him on that. 
Let me end by saying, there is on old poem: 
While I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. 
I saw that man again today. 
I wish that man would go away. 
The man that many of the people on this floor would wish to go away is a $50 billion tax credit. That is the underlying issue, and that is the important part of this debate.

Mr. DURBIN. Senator Levin will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that complements this amendment. I want to commend him for his hard work in this area since 1979 when he succeeded in instituting directives aimed at increasing the number of military organ donors. Senator DeWine's staff has also been most helpful in suggesting modifications to improve this amendment and we have incorporated all their suggestions into this amendment. 
More than 50,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplants and hundreds of thousands more need tissue transplants. Every year, thousands die needlessly due to lack of donors. In 1996 alone, 3,916 people on the transplant waiting list died because no organs were available for them. Nearly one-fifth of all heart and liver transplant candidates die while waiting for organs. Every 18 minutes another person is added to the waiting list for organs. Each day, eight people die because an organ was not available. Yet since 1986, hospitals that participate in the Medicare or Medicaid Program are required to have in place policies to offer eligible families the option of organ and tissue donation. Last year at an HHS hearing on liver allocation and organ donation, Michael Evanisko, president of the Partnership for Organ Donation testified that at least half of the solution to the organ donor shortage could be achieved by focusing on hospital practices. The partnership's research with 11 organ procurement organizations and over 130 hospitals nationwide, in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, estimated that:  
* * * if hospitals adopted optimal organ donation practices, an additional 5,000 donors would result, bringing the effectiveness of the donation system from one-third to nearly 70%. 
The major impediments to donation, according to Evanisko, are whether families are approached about donation and how the request is handled. 
Last year, Senators Dorgan and Frist here in the Senate joined forces with myself and Dave Camp in the House and we added a section to the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Portability Insurance Act, which resulted in taxpayers who were receiving a tax refund this year, at the same time received an organ donation request card. An estimated 70 million Americans received this solicitation. Those of us who worked hard to incorporate that provision into the bill, certainly hope that it will increase the number of organ donors. However, increasing the numbers of individuals with organ donor cards alone will not save lives, if hospitals do not effectively identify these eligible donors. Approaching families in a sensitive manner about organ donation is also extremely important. 
My amendment would ask HHS together with GAO, to survey 5 percent of the donor hospitals in order to ascertain how the program is working nationwide. This information could be used to determine best hospital practices. This amendment complements our previous efforts to maximize the numbers of lives saved for those in need of organ or tissue transplants.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President. 
It is my understanding that there is an agreement that in 25 minutes or so a vote will be taken which will interrupt this debate. And during this pending period, I am sure that others will be joining us to discuss the amendment which I have called up. It has not only been my intention to call up this amendment, but any amendments thereto this evening. I hope we can dispense with this matter. I have waited all day for this opportunity. 
I think it is an important amendment. It is one that has received a lot of attention, but it was an amendment which people almost missed because, you see, in the tax bill that we considered just a few weeks ago, it was not until the final hours before the vote that someone discovered a provision buried deep in this tax bill, which literally gave a $50 billion tax break to tobacco companies in the United States. 
The reason why amendment came as such a surprise was it was not in the House version of the tax bill, it was not in the Senate version of the tax bill. No committee hearings were heard on this issue. No debate was held on the floor of the House or the Senate on the wisdom of this issue. But in fact we have come to learn that the tobacco companies, through their lobbyists, inserted this provision in the tax bill at the last minute. 
It was a provision which I have called a `legislative orphan,' because for weeks afterward, after it was discovered, no one would claim parentage of this poor little $50 billion amendment--no fathers, no mothers, no living relatives. People said it appeared mysteriously, that it was approved by the leadership but no one could quite tell us where it came from. 
Well, finally, after weeks of investigation, the USA Today reported, through a staff member, that it was a product created expressly by the tobacco companies and slipped into this tax bill at the last minute in an effort to deal with some of the politics of raising the tobacco tax. 
The tobacco companies have come before us time and again and said, `It's a new day. We have learned our lesson. We are no longer the oppressive industry, ignoring the reality of public health. We now want to sit down and settle. We want to work with our legislative leaders in Washington.' 
Well, it was a new day when it came to the speeches, but not when it came to propose this amendment to the tax bill. In fact, it was an old day, old politics, old time religion. Wait for the dark of night, and in that stealthy atmosphere come in with an amendment worth $50 billion. 
Here is what it said. We were going to raise the tobacco tax, over several years, 15 cents. That money was to be raised to provide health insurance for uninsured children across America so that States could invent their own programs and create their own approaches to cover these children. And the tobacco tax revenues would help defray that cost. 
Well, the tobacco companies have decided that they want the value of this tobacco tax increase to be set off against anything they would have to pay in a final settlement, the so-called 
universal or global settlement. 
So, at the last minute, they come in with this provision, a $50 billion setoff, or break, for the tobacco companies, without a minute of hearings, without any consideration in the House or the Senate, without any deliberation. They said, `Let's make this part of any tobacco deal. We get a $50 billion break.' It is no wonder that cynicism grows across America when this sort of thing is done. It really raises a question about whether we are doing our job right. 
Some of the tobacco companies have come back and said, `Now, wait a minute. This is nothing unusual. A $50 billion setoff against our offer of $368.5 billion--it is a natural thing.' Well, I am afraid it isn't. It turns out State attorneys general, including Michael Moore of Mississippi, sent a letter on behalf of this group, and they said that `. . . [the] recent action by Congress to use revenues raised by new taxes as a credit toward our settlement is unacceptable. . .' This comes from Michael Moore of Mississippi. `As you know, this concept was discussed and rejected by us during our negotiations. This industry'--the tobacco industry--`has agreed to specific dollar amounts in the settlement, and we will not agree to any diminution of those amounts not specifically set forth in the agreement.' 
Attorney General Moore, who led this effort of 40 different States to bring an action against the tobacco industry, has in fact said that this is not part of the agreement. It was expressly rejected. 
So the tobacco companies, having lost in their negotiations with the State attorneys general, came up to find some friends on Capitol Hill. And they clearly must have found them, because now in fact we have this amendment as part of the tax bill, signed into law. 
The amendment which I propose today repeals it. It says that the tobacco companies cannot sneak in here in the dark of night and put this kind of provision in the law. I tried to attack this provision in the closing hours before the tax bill was voted on. Some of my colleagues told me later they were not sure what I was doing, and it was late, and they were not certain what the point of order was setting out to do, but they want a chance to vote on it again. Well, we are going to give them that chance today, I hope, if we do not get muddled down by the efforts of the tobacco companies again to pull a fast one. 
I am reminded of a story because of what we are setting out to do here. An Irishman was seen digging around the wall of his house. He was asked by his neighbor what he was doing. He said, `Faith, I'm letting the dark out of the cellar.' That is what we are trying to do here. We want to let the dark out of the cellar in the tax bill. That section of miscellaneous provisions which was supposed to be innocuous, not costly, noncontroversial, turned out to include this $50 billion break for these tobacco companies. 
I think that what the tobacco companies are trying to do here is to start writing the tobacco liability settlement legislation even before Congress gets its chance. And they want this $50 billion break to start with. 
The tobacco company provision in the tax cut bill says the increase in the tobacco excise taxes collected as a result of the balanced budget law will be credited against the total payments the tobacco companies would make as a result of Federal legislation implementing the settlement. 
The tobacco tax increase in the final version of the balanced budget bill raised $5.2 billion in the first 5 years, and a total of $16.7 billion over 10 years. Projected out to the 25-year life of the proposed settlement, we can estimate that the revenues at stake amount to around $50 billion over 25 years. I do not know if there was another provision in that tax bill of this magnitude. One small section that will literally cost the taxpayers of this country $50 billion that was put in this bill without a minute of 
debate or hearing. 
That means the new balanced budget law, as amended by the tax cut bill, would give the tobacco companies a $50 billion credit in any future settlement. Boy, that is a good day at work if you can come home as a lobbyist for the tobacco companies, and the spouse says to the lobbyist, `How was your day at work?' 
`I had a great day.' 
`What did you do?' 
`I just saved the tobacco companies of America $50 billion without anybody noticing. We stuck it in the bottom of the tax bill, and now no one will ever know.' 
Well, that isn't what happened. It was discovered. And today it will be addressed directly. 
The revenues in this bill were not intended to set off the liability of the tobacco companies. They were in there to provide health insurance for low-income kids. They should not be used to lessen the financial liability of the tobacco companies. 
Moreover, if this provision is not repealed, the tobacco industry is going to argue that $50 billion should be taken out of the money the settlement envisions for public health initiatives. Keep in mind, these tobacco companies sat down with 40 State attorneys general and said, `We are willing to reach a settlement. And we are willing to invest money in public health initiatives to reduce children's smoking, for example.' 
Now they have said, `We won't give you $368.5 billion as promised over 25 years. We want a reduction of $50 billion.' 
So what will be at stake here? Enforcement of this agreement, public information campaigns, smoking cessation programs, industry liability payments. We should not give the tobacco industry this $50 billion windfall. 
I am pleased that Senator Collins is joining me. I see she has come to the floor here. Senator Collins of Maine has agreed with me that we should repeal this sweetheart deal for big tobacco. American taxpayers should not be subsidizing the tobacco industry to reduce its liability for past misconduct. 
The amendment is very simple. It simply says that subsection (k) of section 9302 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as added by section 1604(f)(3) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, is repealed. Or, in plain English, the tobacco industry credit added to the balanced budget bill by the tax cut bill is repealed. 
The groups that have joined me in support of this effort grow by the hour. I am very proud of those who are endorsing the Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal that $50 billion tobacco credit. 
I will read the groups for the Record: Action on Smoking and Health; the American Association of Critical Care Nurses; the American Cancer Society; the American College of Preventive Medicine; the American Heart Association; the American Lung Association; the American Medical Association; the American Public Health Association; the American Society of Addiction Medicine; Children's Defense Fund; the HMO Group; the Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco; the National Association of City and County Health Officials; the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids; the National Council of Churches; the National Education Association; the National PTA; the National Women's Law Center; Partnership for Prevention; Public Citizen; Taxpayers for Common Sense; U.S. Public Interest Research Group; and the Women's Legal Defense Fund. 
Some have argued we should just let this provision stand and then try to adjust the settlement accordingly, by adding $50 billion to the required payments. We should not have to expend valuable energy trying to increase the settlement price just to return to where we stood before July 31. 
We should repeal this provision now, clear the decks, and start from a level playing field in deciding what the settlement price would be. Many of us think the final settlement price should be higher than $368 billion. 
I might add that my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, is offering an amendment in the second degree to this. He suggested at one point he thinks $368.5 billion should be the total that is in the settlement. Though I will not oppose his amendment as written, I disagree with that particular aspect. But whatever the price, it should not have to be artificially adjusted to fix a provision added in the dark of night that almost no one knew about and almost no one agreed to. 
Some have also argued that the settlement provision has no meaning and no effect. When I brought it up on the floor some of my colleagues said, `Well, this is not binding. It is not a matter of law.' 
I said at that point, `Then take it out of the bill.' 
`No, no, we have to keep it in the bill.' 
Clearly, the people fighting for it in the bill wanted a strong bargaining position. They wanted to say when the tobacco settlement came down, we will start with a $50 billion credit for the tobacco companies. I do not think the tobacco industry would have worked so hard to put the provision in the bill if it was not important. 
In fact, news reports have indicated that the provision was supposed to have been put in the Balanced Budget Act and was added to the Taxpayer Relief Act after being inadvertently left out of the budget bill. If it had no meaning or effect, no one would have bothered to write it into the tax cut bill. 
But make no mistake about it, this provision is very meaningful. Although it was originally characterized as an `orphan' provision because no one would own up to having written it, the truth finally came out that the tobacco industry provided the language directly to the Joint Tax Committee staff which put it in the bill at the behest of certain congressional leaders. The provision is very meaningful to those who wrote it, namely, the tobacco companies. They stand to gain $50 billion for 46 words of legislative language. That is more than $1 billion a word. 
When you think about the history of Washington, DC, and all that we have done on Capitol Hill, we have literally reached the point where an effective lobbyist working in the stealth of the night can come up with a provision which saves his clients more than $1 billion a word. What an effective lobbyist that must be. 
Regardless of whether we support or oppose the details of the proposed settlement, we should all be able to agree that the 
taxpayers should not be underwriting the cost of the settlement. 
Some have argued we should not adopt this amendment because it might slow down this appropriations bill, and it is a very important appropriations bill. But I believe the American people and most Members of Congress don't support this tobacco giveaway. We must not pass up this opportunity to eliminate it. It is a bad law and it needs to be changed. 
Those who want to derail the Labor-HHS bill will try to do so regardless of whether this provision is in it. We must not let a threat to slow down the bill turn courage into cowardice. If we stand up to the forces behind this amendment they will shrink away. They don't really want to try to defend the indefensible. 
The question also comes up as to whether, if the amendment is adopted, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill could be `blue slipped' by the Ways and Means Committee in the House, pursuant to the origination clause, article I, Section 7 of our Constitution. 
As a practical matter, the answer is no. Of course, the House could do whatever it wishes. It is a sovereign body. But as a practical matter, it wouldn't have a good case for blue slipping this bill over this amendment because it is not a revenue measure. 
We talked to the House Parliamentarian's office. They agreed. The subsection of the budget bill that would be repealed by this amendment does not amend the Internal Revenue Code. It does not impose or remove a tax. It does not even change the tobacco industry's current obligations. It addresses only a possible future credit against the payments the tobacco industry would make in a settlement. That credit is not a tax credit. It is simply a reduction of the tobacco company's payment obligations under a settlement, if there is one. Therefore, this is not a tax revenue measure subject to that objection. 
Any Member of the House could try to offer a privileged resolution claiming that the provision was a revenue measure subject to the origination clause and asking the House to reject the bill and send it back to the Senate, but they would have a hard time convincing the majority in the House to reject this important appropriations bill on the grounds this amendment was supposedly a revenue matter, even though the amendment, as I said, does not affect the Tax Code nor anyone's tax liability and does not even affect the tobacco industry's obligations. 
Tobacco products in the United States kill more than 400,000 Americans every year. The U.S. economy suffers a tragic and unnecessary loss of $50 billion each and every year from tobacco-related health costs and another $50 billion from tobacco-related loss of productivity. 
Historically, the tobacco industry was unwilling to admit to any damage caused by its products. Even today, tobacco company executives choke on statements that their products `might have' caused some instances of cancer. 
But the settlement currently being discussed was agreed to by the tobacco industry. 
This secret credit should never have been written into the tax bill. It should be repealed immediately. 
Madam President, I say to my colleagues, they may have had an excuse for not voting to strip this provision from the tax cut bill on July 31. Perhaps many of them genuinely did not know it was there. I only learned about it a few hours before the vote. But there is no excuse today. There is no excuse for the Senate to leave this provision in law. 
Now my colleagues have a chance to vote straight up to rectify the situation. The American people do not want this credit to remain on the books. It is time for Congress to agree and to vote to repeal it. So, I say to my colleagues, don't let the tobacco companies take $50 billion out of taxpayers' pockets to reduce their settlement liability. 
I hope they will join me in voting for the Durbin-Collins amendment. This amendment, to paraphrase an old literary quote, 
`shines and stinks like rotten mackerel by moonlight.' We are now bringing it to the attention of our colleagues to let them know that this rotten mackerel should be excised from the Federal law, that the tobacco lobbyists, as effective as they were in placing this provision in law, did the wrong thing. They played old politics under the old rules. 
I am happy now to yield the floor to my cosponsor on this amendment, Senator Collins of Maine.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, if the Senator from Alabama would be kind enough to show us a copy of his amendment, we may be able to enter into this agreement very quickly. 
I would like to see the amendment, if he wouldn't mind. I have seen Senator Ford's amendment. I believe the time allocation we have been talking about is a reasonable one. But I wonder if the Senator from Alabama is asking for 30 minutes for his amendment in the second degree. Is that my understanding?

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, speaking to the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, he and I have been in disagreement on this issue in the short time I have served in this body, but I stand today in support of his second-degree amendment. Though I may disagree with one or two provisions in it, I believe the central element of his amendment is a suggestion that tobacco growers should be protected in any settlement agreement, and I certainly think that is a worthy goal as part of the settlement negotiations. For that reason, though I may disagree with some other particulars, I will support his second-degree amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I have just seen this amendment this evening for the first time, but I know the Senator from Alabama has offered it in the regular order of business. 
I have had a few minutes to read it over. I commend to my colleagues the suggestion they should read this very closely. This amendment is the dream of the tobacco companies. The Senators who have risen to speak on behalf of this amendment from the tobacco-producing States I think have given evidence of the fact that this is another one of the last gasps of this industry. 
Let me tell you why what appears to be so reasonable on its face is, in fact, a loaded deck for the tobacco companies again. 
My friend, the Senator from Alabama, wants to limit attorney's fees and to take any excess and put it into health research for children. Now, who in the world could oppose that? 
But look closely. He does not want to limit the attorney's fees for tobacco company lawyers. No. He just wants to limit the attorney's fees for those on the plaintiffs' side, the States that have brought this action. Now that is curious. If he is afraid that the attorneys, who will ultimately all be paid by tobacco companies when this is all over, are going to charge too much money, he only wants to limit the hourly rate to $250 an hour to attorneys representing the plaintiffs in this action. So he protects these fat cat law firms that have represented the tobacco companies forever, who can charge $500 an hour, $1,000 an hour, he does not care. His interest is only the attorneys for the plaintiffs. 
That does not make any sense. All of the money is coming out of the same pot. If he wants to make this a reduction in the lifestyle of attorneys, why does it not apply to defense attorneys? Why does it not apply to tobacco company attorneys? No, his only interest is the attorneys who stepped forward and filed these lawsuits on behalf of the States. 
Now, they have been characterized by their critics this evening as a pretty motley crew. Remember that 40 different States decided through their own elected attorneys general that they would bring these lawsuits under fee arrangements so that they 
would have the legal talent to be able to process the most complicated litigation in the history of the United States.

Mr. DURBIN. I am pleased to be interrupted with that good news. 
Isn't it curious that this effort to provide research funds for children's health, funded by excess attorney's fees, would only apply to attorney's fees in excess for the plaintiffs, that the law firms representing Philip Morris and RJR and all the tobacco companies can charge whatever they care to charge. 
Now, I think that pierces the veil of what this is all about. 
But let's read on. What else is the Senator from Alabama setting out to do here?

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. I think that is an improvement, but let me read on. 
The reason why this amendment should not be considered, why the tobacco companies will jump for joy if it is adopted, is that it will discourage any State from bringing its lawsuit against the tobacco companies. 
The Senator from Alabama, for reasons I do not understand, has decided that no State of the 40 that filed suits, no matter how deeply they are involved in this litigation, can pay outside attorney's fees beyond $5 million, which sounds like a huge sum of money until you consider States like Minnesota. 
Minnesota has been preparing for trial on January 19, has now collected millions of documents from these tobacco companies, has warehouses in London and in Minneapolis. They have attorneys scouring through the documents and processing them. They are preparing to go to trial. 
In my home State of Illinois, I do not think we have made nearly that progress in moving toward litigation. But the Senator from Alabama does not care that the attorneys in Minnesota have been working overtime for months and the attorneys in Illinois may not have been. 
He says, we are going to pick an arbitrary figure--no State can pay their attorneys no matter how much work they have put into this, any more than $5 million, period. 
Now, that is fundamentally unfair. It really does not reflect the effort that has been put in by these attorneys in these States. 
Let me tell you what else he is doing, and I think this is a pretty crafty move by the tobacco companies. By putting this provision in the law to limit attorney's fees, he will have the attorneys come forward in these States and say to the attorney general, `Well, listen, if we cannot, after all of this discovery and all of this preparation even recover the amounts that we have expended in attorney's fees, we certainly cannot take this to 
trial,' so the tobacco companies will have their way. The tobacco companies do not want these cases to go to trial. They want to discourage that from happening. 
In fact, representatives of those companies have told me point blank if any case goes to trial there will be no global settlement. The Senator from Alabama is offering them a great improvement here in saying that they do not have to worry about a trial now because attorney's fees are going to be strictly limited. 
Well, they will be jumping for joy at RJR and Philip Morris if this Senator's amendment is adopted this evening, because by limiting the attorney's fees and saying that there will be a strict limitation of the amount that can be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys he is, in fact, discouraging, if not stopping litigation and trials. 
You will have accomplished with your amendment what the tobacco companies have been unable to accomplish to this point. You will have stopped these cases and they cannot move forward. 
I do not think that is what the Senator set out to do when he explained this amendment. But I think that is the net result of it. 
It is interesting to me as you look into it, what will happen to the States that have settled, Mississippi and Florida, what will happen to their attorney's fees? If I read this correctly, this may or may not apply to it. 
It is not clear. This amendment is not drawn in a way that can tell you it definitely applies in the case of Mississippi and Florida. The Senator offers it for prospective payment of attorney's fees. Yet, we already have two cases settled and they are not addressed. 
And then this whole question of the amount to be paid attorneys, a $250 rate. I don't know what a reasonable rate is in the Senator's home State. I don't know what attorneys might charge in any State, whether it is New York, Minnesota, Illinois or Alabama. But I think the Senator has chosen a rate that is unrealistic--unrealistic in terms of what these attorneys general face. 
Keep in mind that most of the attorneys general in the United States looked to these lawsuits and said right off the bat, `We don't have the resources to sue these tobacco giants. We have to bring in the resources and services of attorneys who will, in fact, represent us.' Of course, those attorneys coming in to file those lawsuits expected to be compensated if they won --only if they won. Contingency fees are based on that. I know from my experience with the Senator in the Judiciary Committee, he doesn't think very kindly of contingency fees, particularly in his own State. But I think, quite honestly, this is a clear illustration that if a contingency fee was not awarded to an attorney, the attorney general would not have had this army of lawyers to go forward. 
When I heard comments from some of the Senators from tobacco-producing States, it is clear that they resent these lawyers, these attorneys general, for bringing these lawsuits and they want to get even with them, they want to nail them and say, `We are going to limit your fees. You thought there was money in this, but there won't be any money in this. We will limit you as to how much you can recover.' 
I don't think that is fair. It is curious to me at this time, when we are talking about whether or not the Federal Government is going to impose its will on the States, that we have an amendment from a Senator from Alabama, which suggests that we in Congress should impose on 40 different States, 40 different attorneys general, a fee arrangement that we happen to think is reasonable. 
Well, let me tell you what this is all about. The tobacco companies were embarrassed when the amendment was disclosed that gave them a $50 billion windfall in the tax bill, an amendment which we hope to repeal. They had hoped to initiate the negotiations in the tobacco settlement by saying: Before we sit down at the table and reach an agreement, give the tobacco companies $50 billion. 
I think the public sentiment and the votes of this Senate will see it another way. Now the tobacco companies come in with this amendment. They want to see this amendment adopted because now they come to the table and say to each of these States: There is a new arrangement. You can't pay your attorneys. You can't go to trial. We have you where we want you. We don't care what your contingency fee agreement is going to be. You are limited to what we in Congress think attorney's fees should be and how much they should be paid. 
Well, I think this amendment should be defeated. I think this amendment is one the tobacco companies will enjoy, one that the American people will regret. The States, including my own, that had the courage to step forward and file these lawsuits against the tobacco companies should not be penalized at this point in time. They have done a great service to this Nation. Each attorney general--Democrat, Republican or Independent--who decided to enter into an agreement with attorneys to represent them did it with the understanding that they will be held accountable for this. The Senator says that these are secret agreements. Well, in my home State, I can tell you that whether there was a secret agreement or not, the gentleman who entered into it, our attorney 
general, will be held accountable for it. Can he justify it? Did he say to the taxpayers from Illinois we have recovered enough money to justify the contingency money paid the attorneys? Of course, and he is held accountable. 
The Senator suggests this is done in secret with no accountability. I think he is wrong. I hope when this is all said and done, we will defeat this amendment, and that we will not give the tobacco industry a victory this evening or tomorrow when we vote, such as they secured at the close of debate on the tax bill. These tobacco companies have to be told, whether they are trying to stop the States from bringing these actions through this amendment by the Senator from Alabama, or recouping $50 billion in the stealth of the night, that the party is over. The tobacco companies just can't have their way anymore. I think we have to stand up for the people who are best represented by these lawsuits--the consumers, the children, those who unfortunately are going to be the losers if this amendment is adopted. 
At this point, I would like to move to table this amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address the motion pending before the Senate at this time on the FDA reform bill. 
I have listened very, very closely to the statements by my colleague and friend, the Senator from Indiana. I note that his comments are heartfelt about a very important agency. The Food and Drug Administration is by Federal standards a small agency. The annual appropriations is in the range of $1 billion, and by the standards of Washington, DC, it might be ignored by many. But those of us who are familiar with the important mission of the Food and Drug Administration, those of us who have worked closely with that agency and with its Commissioners over the years, and in my particular case, those of us who have had the opportunity to literally fund this agency through the Appropriations Committee of the House, understand the critical importance of this agency. Though its resources and budget may be small by Washington standards, its responsibilities are immense. There is not an American living who is not touched by the work of the FDA. They regulate things as diverse as the radar guns used by police, microwave ovens used in airplanes, and virtually all of the drugs and medical devices for sale in the United States. We count on them every day. And they are an agency, as you can tell from the previous Senator's remarks, which is not above criticism. This is an agency which has a very difficult mission. On the one hand, a person who is ill seeking a new drug or medical device wants the FDA to issue approval as quickly as possible. That is a natural reaction. 
By the same token, a company with a drug or a medical device which they want to see approved is anxious for the FDA to give approval as quickly as possible. The FDA approval on a drug or medical device is better than any Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It is literally a ticket for sales, confident sales, worldwide. Once the Food and Drug Administration of the U.S. Federal Government gives its approval, you know that your medical device or your prescription drug is going to have an opportunity for a worldwide market because that approval means something. 
There is another side to this ledger. The Food and Drug Administration, with the pressure to approve drugs and medical devices by not only consumers but also by manufacturers, also has an awesome responsibility to make sure that those approvals are done in the right way, so that the American consumers know that what they purchase is safe and effective. 
Those are the two criteria. So the scientists and those working at the FDA put in long hours, days, weeks, months, sometimes years, to make certain that a product, before it goes on the market in the United States, is safe. While they are in the process of evaluating, there are people on the sidelines saying, what is taking so long? Why hasn't this agency moved to approve this drug or this medical device? 
I have been frustrated myself when people in my old congressional district or in my State have come forward and said, it has taken months, sometimes years; why don't we have the FDA's final approval? I am sure some of that may be associated with bureaucratic slowdown, and if this bill addresses that, then I think it is a very important step forward. But do not minimize the fact that many times the evaluations by the Food and Drug Administration are careful reviews of clinical trials to make sure, before a drug or device is released in America, it is safe and effective. Not a single one of us would want to take a drug prescribed by a doctor uncertain as to whether or not it was safe. No one would want to do that. The Food and Drug Administration tries to give us that confidence. 
There has been a reference made earlier to Dr. David Kessler, the last Administrator of the Food and Drug Administration. The previous speaker obviously shares a different opinion than some about Dr. Kessler's performance and contribution. I think he is one of the most extraordinary public servants I ever had the opportunity to work with. The only holdover from the Bush administration, Dr. Kessler was reappointed by President Clinton and I think did an exceptional job. Of course, we are kindred spirits on the tobacco issue, but beyond that I think his job at the Food and Drug Administration will set an example that others will have to try to emulate, and they will find it difficult to do so. I am sorry we lost him, but he gave so many good years of service to the Federal Government we can be thankful he did. 
Let me also say that this is an agency which has fallen under criticism politically. When the Republican control of the House occurred after the 1994 election, I was amazed that one of the first lines of attack by Speaker Newt Gingrich was on the Food and Drug Administration. He made arguments, many of which you have heard this morning, that this agency was stopping those devices which would save lives, this agency was stopping the approval of drugs which would save lives. And he went on at great length about how they were going to dismantle the Food and Drug Administration, literally to turn out the lights at this agency. 
Thank God that didn't occur; saner minds prevailed, came forward and said that would be a serious mistake. A lot of the references to a more responsible approach came from the same industries that are regulated by the FDA. They realized that when you drop your guard, when you get into a no-holds-barred strategy when it comes to the approval of drugs and medical devices, the reputable companies will be the first to lose when consumer confidence is destroyed. 
Let me give you three examples of what I have seen in a short period of time, of the work of the Food and Drug Administration. Some of these are forgotten, and they should not be. 
There was a counterfeit infant formula on the market that was discovered by the Food and Drug Administration. It turned out that some group of individuals had decided to take one of the most popular brands of infant formula in the United States and to literally copy its label and to put contents in a can and sell them as if it was the product that it was advertised to be. In fact, it wasn't. It was a phony. Luckily, the FDA caught them and in catching them stopped the sale of this infant formula product which was grossly deficient, which if it had been given to infants across America could have caused serious health problems. The Food and Drug Administration was vigilant, caught them and stopped them. 
Let me make reference to one that most people remember. It was only a few years ago that they discovered these syringes in Diet Pepsi cans. Oh, every nightly newscast told us about this discovery. What did it mean in the wake of the AIDS crisis to find a hypodermic syringe in a can of soda? Well, luckily the Food and Drug Administration stepped in and determined that this was only an isolated example and a hoax. It was important for the consumers across America, but it was equally important for Pepsi Cola. Their stock had plummeted when this occurred. But the Food and Drug Administration stepped in and said this is something the consumers do not have to worry about. We have it under control. And because they have the respect of the American people, the product went back on the market without a problem and the stock resumed its climb. I think it is important for us to make sure that we talk about what this agency brings to us. 
I also took a trip to the State of Massachusetts, to review the Food and Drug Administration programs there, in particular, to review one particular company that was making heart catheters. Most people are familiar with them. Those who are not should know that they are tiny little threaded lines that the surgeon will insert in your body and then it will course through your veins to your heart, and they can literally take samples as well as photographs of the interior of our bodies--a critically important medical device. Yet, as it turns out, this company was making defective heart catheters that literally broke off inside people's bodies and then, of course, surgery was necessary to remove them. That is the type of thing the Food and Drug Administration must be constantly vigilant to watch out for and to protect us against. 
I could go on--and I will not--for hours about what the Food and Drug Administration does and how important it is when we reform this agency to remember their enormous responsibility to consumers across America. 
I agree with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, that there are portions of this bill that should be reviewed and I hope changed during the course of the floor debate. I think it is wrong for us to remove from the States the authority to review cosmetics and to put warning labels on them, if a State decides it is in the best interest of its citizens. We do not have sufficient personnel at the FDA right now in the Cosmetic Section to take responsibility for complete Federal oversight of this large industry. Senator Kennedy has made a compelling argument that we should allow the States to continue to have this authority, to put those provisions in place which will protect the health and safety of consumers. 
I have three amendments which I am going to offer, and I hope that they will be amendments approved on a bipartisan basis. One seeks to reverse an area of this bill which I am afraid will weaken the strong safety protections put in place by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. Many of us remember the tragedy resulting from the Bjork-Shiley heart valve failure. Extensive congressional hearings were held in the late 1980's examining what had gone wrong and how we might prevent future repeats of those terrible deaths when this heart valve failed. 
In the United States alone, over 300 people died because this defective medical device was implanted. Worldwide, almost 1,000 people have died as a result of fractures in this valve once it was put in place. After it was concluded these heart valves were defective, over 50 percent of the patients with these heart valves in their bodies could not be located. One widow testified before Congress about how her husband had a heart valve, suffered chest pains and the couple had no idea that it was because of the defective heart valve. They had not heard about it. They had not been notified. They lived at the time equidistant between two hospitals, only one of which was capable of performing open heart surgery. They made a mistake; they went to the other hospital. Her husband died. She didn't realize that he might need open heart surgery because the heart valve in his body was defective. 
The Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 set up a system for mandatory tracking of these high-risk devices so that if problems were found, the patients with the devices could be located and notified. That is a basic protection. 
There are only 17 types of devices that require mandatory tracking. They are all extremely high-risk medical devices--heart valves; pacemakers; vascular stents; jaw, shoulder, hip joint replacements; windpipe prostheses; breathing monitors and ventilators. 
It is hard to imagine the tracking of such high-risk devices could ever be made optional, and yet that is exactly what this bill does. The FDA has already complained that they find it extremely difficult to enforce this provision, and yet instead of helping them with enforcement, this bill weakens their ability further by making tracking discretionary. 
Isn't it curious that automobile manufacturers are required to have a tracking system so that if a safety problem is identified with your car's model, they know where to find you. It seems unthinkable to have a lower standard of consumer protection for a pacemaker or a ventilator as compared to a seat belt. 
The second aspect is surveillance. This is a key part of this Safe Medical Device Act which this bill undermines. The mandatory surveillance program of high risk medical devices is especially important for consumers. These surveillance programs are important for the early detection of potential problems with medical devices. In some cases the initial breakage of a device may not cause instantaneous harm. For example, in the case of Telectronics' heart pacemaker J leads, which were found to be defective in 12 percent of the patients, breakages did not result in harm until the next bout of heart arhythmia. Surveillance of these leads identified problems in some patients. This led to the notification of patients with these leads of the need to have them checked. Such early detection and correction can prevent a health crisis. 
Let me give you another example. Early detection, unfortunately, was not seen in the case of Teflon jaw implants made by Vitek in the 1980s. These implants, once put inside of a human being, were found to splinter and cause massive corrosion of jaws and skull due to the triggering of inflammation and other immune responses. By the time the patient suffered the pain, extensive damage had already been done. Many of these patients required complete resection and removal of their jaws, even some of their skulls exposing their brains. 
Donna Fennema from Ames, IA, testified here late last year at an FDA hearing of how she needed 30 hours of critical major medical surgery to rectify her splintered jaw implant. She needed a rib graft to rebuild her jaw on both sides. To this day, she suffers pain from both her jaw and her rib cage. If a surveillance program had been in place prior to the Vitek jaw implant defect, many of these patients would have been able to have the implants removed prior to the deterioration of their physical conditions. This terrible tragedy that we have seen is one of the major catalysts, along with the Bjork-Shiley heart valve, for the passage of mandatory surveillance and tracking of implantable high-risk medical devices. 
Yes, it is true that these programs of surveillance and tracking are burdensome to industry. Make no mistake about it. But the cost to society, the cost to each of us, the cost to American families of weakening them is far too high for us to be undermining them. 
The second issue I would like to raise is one that is very typical and one that I have worked on for a long time. It is the issue of tobacco. I am concerned that section 404 of this bill, this FDA reform could undermine FDA's ability to regulate tobacco. This section attempts to limit FDA's ability to look at anything other than the manufacturer's label to determine the intended use of the product and to determine whether the product is safe and effective for this labeled use. 
This section has much broader implication than just tobacco regulation. It provides a generally huge loophole through which device manufacturers can attempt to avoid FDA regulation through imaginative labeling. However, it is most worrisome for tobacco regulation given the long history of tobacco companies and their deception. 
In the early seventies when there was a ban on TV advertising of tobacco products, the industry devised every imaginable way to circumvent this ban. They would purchase bill-board space at sport's events which were placed in such a manner and location, that they knew they would be televised during the sport's event. For example, they would purchase billboards behind homeplate of a baseball game or near the scoreboard. They would purchase racing cars with advertisements along their sides. No stone was left unturned, looking for ways around the ban. 
Around the same time of the television ban on advertising of tobacco, the industry passed a voluntary code that none of them would use models that appeared to be under 21, and yet many of the models which were used could pass as high school students. 
All this suggests to me at least that we do not want to jeopardize any type of tobacco settlement with this FDA reform bill. I suggest a very simple and straightforward fix, and I hope that the sponsors of the bill will consider it. It says as follows: Nothing in this entire bill shall be construed to alter any authority of the Secretary to regulate any tobacco product or any additive or ingredient of a tobacco product.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. Another item I would like to address on which I will be offering an amendment that I hope Senator Jeffords will consider is that of removing any possible money taint of the external review process. 
This bill expands the ability of medical device companies to purchase their own third-party reviewers. Given the importance to the public of the approval process remaining untainted by monetary influence, it is extremely important we ensure that there are very strict anticonflict of interest standards for product reviews. 
In laymen's terms, if we are going to hire companies to review medical devices to determine whether or not they are safe enough for sale in America, devices such as the heart catheter that I mentioned earlier, we want to make certain that the reviewers are truly objective; that they do not have any conflict of interest or any monetary gain associated with what they are doing. 
This bill, as currently drafted, has only very limited language on the issue of preventing conflict of interest. Senator Harkin was successful in adding some strength to that language. His amendment which was accepted after the markup of this bill in committee, allows the FDA to look at the contractual arrangements between an outside reviewing entity and the company whose product is being reviewed. 
FDA employees themselves are subject to a wide range of anticonflict of interest legislation for obvious reasons. If you are an employee at FDA, if you can purchase stock in the company of the device you are about to approve, you are in for a windfall. We don't want that to occur, and we certainly don't want it to occur when we talk about third-party reviewers. 
Senator Feingold and I will be offering an amendment that would codify into law basic requirements for outside reviewers. We don't seek to impose all the FDA employee regulations on outside reviewers, merely the most appropriate. We would be happy to work with Senator Jeffords' staff to tailor these very basic requirements specifically to outside reviewers. 
Our amendment is simple. It merely asks outside reviewers not be allowed to have a financial interest in a company that they review. It further demands that no outside reviewer may receive a gift from a company whose product they review. To monitor and prevent such activities, the amendment allows FDA to require financial disclosure. 
It should be obvious to all of us why it is necessary. 
The money stakes are certainly higher with respect to getting FDA approval. Every day we read of how the stock market soars for a company whose product has just received FDA approval. For instance, on May 7 this year, FDA announced approval for a laser system made by a company called Premier Laser Systems, Inc., that treats tooth decay painlessly. There is something we all would like to see. Within days of this approval, the company's stock price more than doubled, and for the first time since going public in 1995, Premier hit the top 10 in trading volume on Nasdaq, far surpassing even Microsoft 5 days in a row. That is what FDA approval means. 
As we farm out this responsibility to third-party reviewers, it is important that they make decisions that are objective and honest. 
Failure to get approval of a product can have the opposite effect. For example, recently an FDA panel voted 9 to 2 that FDA reject an approval for a heart laser made by a company known as PLC Systems. Trading in the stock had to be halted after this announcement. Shares of PLC had risen dramatically in recent weeks on the expectation of a more favorable result. FDA denial of approval shattered the stock's profitability. 
The medical device industry produces over $50 billion annually in sales. In fact, a recent article in the journal Medical Economics, entitled `Why Medical Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio,' the medical device industry was described as `a hot market that is only getting hotter.' 
Not only are the money stakes high for investors, however, the stakes are also high for patients who have to rely on these devices. 
Reviews must be of the most stringent nature and must be carried out without outside corrupting influences. 
The approval of an unsafe drug or device, as I have already mentioned, can have a devastating impact. Surely, it is not too much to ask that a reviewer be prevented from accepting gifts or loans from a company they are reviewing and that they not be allowed to designate another person for acceptance of such a gift. 
Furthermore, a reviewer or their spouse or minor child should not be allowed to have a financial interest in a company whose product they are reviewing. That seems basic and fundamental. I hope Senator Jeffords and others on the committees would consider agreeing to the Durbin-Feingold amendment. The products are too important to the American people. I believe we should take a firm stand and specifically enumerate basic standards within this legislation to prevent even the potential for corruption of this process. 
Let me say, I was one of the five this morning who joined with Senator Kennedy in suggesting that this bill should be debated at length. I hope that some of the items that I have raised during the course of this debate will give Senator Jeffords and others an indication of my concern. But let me say also that I respect what Senator Jeffords and the committee has accomplished here. FDA reform is needed, and I think what you are setting out to do, to make it a more efficient process, is a very worthy goal. 
I find most of this bill to be very positive, and I am anxious to support it. I hope that during the course of the debate on my amendments and others, we can rectify what I consider to be a handful--but only a handful--of very important items which still need to be debated. I hope to be able to vote for final passage of this bill, and I hope Senator Jeffords and others will be open to these amendments. They are offered in good faith, and I hope we can work together to resolve some of the concerns I have. 
Let me close by saying that those who are critical of the FDA often pine for those countries overseas where it is so easy to get approval for drugs and medical devices. I recommend to some of them that on their next trip to Mexico that they drop into a pharmacy and look at what is for sale on the shelves of those Mexican pharmacies. You will find products that are openly advertised as being cures for cancer and AIDS. Many countries, which have a much easier process, have little integrity in that process. We want to maintain that integrity to make sure the American consumers know that they still are getting the very best. I yield back my time.  
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Iowa. 
I rise in strong support of this amendment. Think about this for a moment. Have you ever met a parent who said, `I had the greatest news last night; I went home and my daughter came home and announced she had started smoking.' 
I have never heard that. I never heard a single parent say how proud they were to learn their children started smoking and yet statistics show us across America the fastest growing group of new smokers is children, and particularly young women, who decide in high school or sometimes earlier to start buying this product illegally to start smoking, to develop a nicotine addiction which can haunt them for a lifetime, leading to disease and sometimes to death. 
What Senator Harkin is doing is just eminently sensible. If there is such a thing as a family value, this is a family value amendment because what Senator Harkin is doing with this amendment is to make sure that the Food and Drug Administration has the resources to enforce existing law. It is not a new imposition of law from the Federal Government. It is just common sense. Keep this dangerous addictive product out of the hands of children. And the people who want to sell it to kids illegally have to be stopped. 
If we are going to do that, it takes more than a speech on the Senate floor. It takes a commitment of resources. I am sorry that Senator Harkin's effort lost last time by a handful of votes. There were a lot of speeches given and a lot of reasons given. I hope my colleagues have had a chance to go home during this break and talk to a number of families, as I have. They should realize, as I do, how critically important it is to pass the Harkin amendment and give the FDA the resources to make sure that our kids are not lured into this dangerous addiction.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have reached a historic juncture. Our Nation has not had a balanced budget since fiscal year 1969, the last budget year of President Lyndon Johnson's tenure. The budget deficit began to grow under President Nixon, rose to $74 billion during the recession we faced under President Ford, dipped and then steadied under President Carter, until recession hit again and pushed the deficit to nearly $80 billion. Then it ballooned to more than $200 billion after the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980's. It declined to around $150 billion, then skyrocketed during the recession under President Bush. Quite a roller coaster ride; all of it in red ink. 
Many of us believed we could meet our responsibility to live within our means while helping our economy to move forward. What we needed was leadership, not only in the White House but on Capitol Hill. When President Clinton arrived, the deficit stood at an all-time high of $290 billion. The economy was in stall. It was not mere luck which has given us 7 years of economic growth and a declining deficit. Many circumstances are beyond the control of any political leader, but leaders can make a difference. 
President Clinton set a course for economic growth and spending reduction and invited the Nation to follow. It was difficult medicine: Tax increases for those who had benefited most from the tax breaks of the 1980s, spending reductions in programs most Americans support, targeted tax relief for working families, and targeted investments in programs that would strengthen the Nation. 
Congress took the decisive and difficult step of passing President Clinton's deficit reduction and economic growth package. It was a politically costly step. It cost many Members their political lives. Unfortunately, not a single Republican supported the President's plan and it passed in this Chamber only when Vice President Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. But it laid the groundwork for the budget package before us. 
The difficult votes some of us cast in 1993 helped to produce a strong, growing economy with a Federal budget deficit that has declined steadily. The deficit was $290 billion when the President took office. It is conservatively estimated to be $67 billion this year, and could end up below $40 billion. Deficit reduction and targeted investment stimulated economic expansion, which created more revenue and produced more deficit reduction, so that now some people really anticipate the possibility that we will achieve a balanced budget as early as next year. When we considered President Clinton's plan, it was called a deficit reduction plan. No one dreamed that it would end up being a balanced budget plan. To the surprise of most economists, that possibility is within our grasp, even this year. 
All of this occurred because of President Clinton's leadership and the support of the Democrats in Congress in 1993. We can be proud of these achievements. We can take some satisfaction in knowing that our hard work in 1993 made it possible for another exercise of leadership in 1997, to produce this balanced budget resolution. We can also take some satisfaction in knowing the economy is strong. Look at the report card. Unemployment and inflation, the combined rate, 8.7 percent, the best since President Lyndon Johnson.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I was speaking before the call of the quorum about the economic report card that we can point to with pride that we have 2.8 percent annual average inflation, the best since President Kennedy; 12.1 million new jobs in this period of time, the best ever; 1.1 million new construction jobs, the best since President Harry Truman; a 14-percent increase in consumer confidence, the best since President Eisenhower. The list goes on and on. 
This budget agreement that we consider today continues the fiscal responsibility that we have shown since 1993. It includes the spending cuts we need to balance the budget by 2002 and sets the stage for continued balanced budgets beyond 2002. 
What this budget package shows is that the two parties can work together to make the necessary choices to balance the budget and address the needs of the American people. 
Is this the budget that I would have written? No, I would have changed a lot of the provisions. This is probably not the budget that any single Member of this body would have written, but it is a credible effort, a reasonable compromise. It is worthy of our support. No compromise is perfect, but this package will give many Illinois working families much-needed help in paying for the cost of raising kids and sending them to college. It addresses today's economic needs and realities, whether it is paying for day care, braces, health insurance, for kids or college tuition. 
In addition to providing fairness for working families, it provides fairness for seniors, extending the Medicare Program with reforms that protect the most vulnerable. It eliminates some provisions adopted on the Senate floor which would have raised, for example, the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 over a 20-year period of time, and it addresses the concern that farmers and small businessowners should be able to pass on their business and their farm to their children without a great estate tax responsibility. 
The spending bill that we consider preserves the budget and strengthens the Medicare Program. The Republican Contract With America, which was considered several years ago by Speaker Gingrich and many Republicans Senators supported, would have cut $270 billion out of Medicare over 7 years, a massive cutback in Medicare that would have imposed excessive new burdens on our Nation's seniors. This budget package cuts $115 billion over 5 years, without excessive new burdens on seniors. 
It extends the solvency of Medicare for 10 years, keeping our word to seniors to keep this program strong. It limits the increased burdens on our elderly seniors who live on limited incomes and are already paying a large portion of their incomes in medical costs. 
It allows for increased numbers of Medicare health plan choices for our seniors, especially in rural areas. It includes a new package of preventive benefits, including annual mammograms, diabetes self-management, and prostate colorectal cancer screening. 
It also includes nearly $1 billion in new spending for rural health initiatives. 
When it comes to Medicaid, this is also a good agreement. The Republican proposal in 1995 would have cut $163 billion from the Medicaid Program over 7 years. That would have risked the health of seniors, children, and pregnant women who count on Medicaid for basic health care and for many seniors' long-term care. This budget cuts only $13 billion from Medicaid over 5 years. We have balanced the budget without jeopardizing the safety net for Americans who lack health insurance. 
This agreement marks a historic commitment to our Nation's children. The package sets aside $24 billion for children's health insurance. Over 10 million of our children are currently uninsured. This bill could help up to 7 million of these children become insured. I am certain that in so doing, it will take a great burden off the minds of many working families who don't earn enough money to be able to pay for health insurance today or don't have a benefits package at work that provides health insurance for their families. 
The one thing this budget package does, which I think is long overdue, is it provides funding to restore the unfair welfare reform provisions that would otherwise cut off SSI legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and paying their taxes but have become disabled or may become disabled in the future. Without this budget agreement, over 22,000 elderly or disabled legal immigrants in my State of Illinois would face the loss of their SSI in October. For many of them, this is their only form of support. I supported the welfare reform bill, but I agreed with President Clinton that this was one provision that needed to be corrected. This agreement, this bill, will correct it. 
This agreement also commits $3 billion to assist welfare recipients to move into work slots. The basic principle of welfare reform was that able-bodied adults should be put back to work. This assistance helps the States accomplish that goal. The Republican budget in 1995 would have imposed devastating spending cuts in education, environmental protection and crime prevention, but this budget protects the President's priorities in those areas, and the agreement on which this is based calls for a substantial increase in education funding. 
The tax-cut bill offers valuable tax relief to millions of working families, with a net tax cut of around $95 billion over the next 5 years, tax cuts that are direct dividends of the 1993 budget bill. 
This package includes a $500-per-child tax credit for children under the age of 17, beginning in 1999, with a $400 credit in 1998. The credit will be calculated before the earned-income tax credit to maintain the valuable work incentives associated with that credit, and it would be refundable against the payroll tax for larger families that face the great expense of raising the next generation. 
This credit, which costs $85 billion over 5 years, is the largest tax cut in this package and one of its most important investments. An estimated 13 million children in families earning less than $30,000 will receive this valuable assistance which they can use to pay for day care, braces, or any other expenses the family faces, or to save for the future. This child credit begins to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and couples making $110,000, higher than the President sought. More importantly, some families earning as little as $18,000 who pay payroll taxes but little or no taxes would also qualify, which Republicans have resisted. 
Education tax credits: This tax cut package also includes the President's education tax credit proposal, which I strongly supported. With a value of $40 billion over 5 years, it constitutes the largest increase in Federal education assistance since the GI bill after World War II. 
This package contains everything President Clinton asked for in educational tax benefits. If we as a society want to show our youth the value we place on education, we need to invest in education. This package does that, with tax relief for college tuition costs and increases in spending for scholarship grants, literacy programs, and student loans. 
This measure includes $31 billion over 5 years that will allow middle-income families to receive up to $1,500 in tax credits to offset the cost of the first 2 years of college. Families will be able to take the credit against the first $1,000 of costs, plus half of the next $1,000 of costs. Juniors, seniors, and part-time students can take a credit of 20 percent of the first $5,000 of costs, to help families afford the continuing costs of higher education. 
In addition, there are $9 billion of other education tax incentives, including an extension of the exemption for employer-paid undergraduate tuition, which allows companies to help their employees improve their skills and knowledge. 
Estate tax: The estate tax exemption for farmers and small businesses will be increased to $1.3 billion next year. This would allow family farmers and family-owned businesses to pass down the fruits of their hard work to their children and grandchildren. The estate tax will also be raised gradually for all other Americans, to $1 million over the next 10 years, which recognizes the effects of inflation on the existing exemption. 
Capital gains from home sales: For many families without children or whose children have grown, the most important tax break in this bill may be the capital gains exclusion for up to $500,000 in profits on the sale of a home. This will help retirees who want to move to a smaller home without adverse tax consequences. 
Improvements: There are a number of improvements in this bill over the original Republican plans: The extension of the airline ticket tax has been improved. Capital gains will not be indexed for inflation, a GOP proposal that would have mainly benefited the most wealthy of Americans and would have created enormous pressure on the budget in future years. Also gone is a GOP demand to pay less than the minimum wage to people who move from welfare to subsidized public and nonprofit jobs, and to deny coverage under worker-protection laws. 
Flaws: Unfortunately, the tax cut bill has a number of flaws. 
The bill waits far too long to increase the tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed people to 100 percent. I have worked to give farmers and small businessowners parity with the corporations they compete with. Corporations can take a 100-percent deduction for health insurance premiums. The self-employed should be able to do the same. This bill does not move the deduction to 50 percent until the year 2000 and waits until 2007 to provide a 100-percent deduction. We can do better than that. 
The conferees also dropped the extension of the ethanol excise tax incentive. I will continue to work for this important measure as part of the highway reauthorization bill. 
The cigarette tax increase--which would discourage our young people from beginning a lifelong tobacco addiction--was reduced and delayed to the year 2000. 
And we must be vigilant in monitoring the impact of some of the tax cuts in future years beyond 2002, because some of the provisions that primarily benefit investors and the wealthy could explode in costs in the coming decade. We could have better used that money for provisions like the self-employed health insurance deduction and the ethanol incentive.  
CONCLUSION 
On balance, both the spending cut package and the tax cut package are worthy of support. They will balance the budget without putting an undue burden on our most vulnerable people, take some important steps to address problems such as the lack of health insurance among our children, and give tax relief to working families who need it most. I am pleased to support this package.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act of 1997. This measure will hold employer-sponsored health maintenance organizations accountable for patient injuries that result from their decisions regarding a patient's medical care. 
Due to a loophole in the Employer Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA], employer-sponsored health plans can escape responsibility for the effect their treatment decisions have on their patients' health. Many courts have held that ERISA preempts State lawsuits against the entities that provide employee benefits and retirement plans. This includes medical malpractice suits against an employer-sponsored HMO. 
There are two primary victims under the current system. The first victims are the patients who are injured, because they are wrongfully denied treatment services by their employer-sponsored HMO's. Let me tell you just one story: 
Due to her history of high-risk pregnancies, Ms. Florence Corcoran's physician determined that she should be hospitalized during the waning weeks of her pregnancy. Her employer-sponsored HMO disagreed and only authorized 10 hours a day of home nursing care. While the nurse was off-duty, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child suffered distress and died. Ms. Corcoran sued her employer-sponsored HMO, but the court held that ERISA preempted her claim. Ms. Corcoran, therefore, will never obtain proper redress for the death of her unborn child and her HMO will never be held accountable. She can only sue her doctor--not her employer-sponsored HMO--even though her doctor was not at fault. 
Ms. Corcoran and others like her cannot bring suit in State court where they should rightfully receive redress for their losses. Instead, they are forced to sue in Federal court where they can only receive the cost of the medical benefit they were denied. In short, Ms. Corcoran's unborn child died needlessly, and the only penalty to the HMO is the few hundred dollars it would have cost to properly hospitalize her. 
As Newsweek observed, if `there's no financial penalty when [employer-sponsored] health plans are negligent, what's to stop these profit-driven creatures from delivering inadequate medical care?' 
The other victims of the current system are the doctors who end up in court and are left holding the bag for the actions of the employer-sponsored HMO's. To quote the Chicage Tribune, `[HMOs], which care for more than 60 million people, are telling courts across the country that they cannot be held responsible for medical malpractice in cases involving patients who receive care through an employer-sponsored health plan* * *. HMOs are shifting virtually all of the risk of patient care to physicians, even though the HMO's can force doctors to change their clinical decisions.' 
Again, let me demonstrate with a real life example: 
Mr. Basile Pappas was suffering from numbness in his arms and was unable to walk, so he sought treatment at a local community hospital at 11 a.m. The emergency room doctor on staff made a difficult diagnosis and determined that Mr. Pappas had a cervical epidural abscess, a condition that was compressing his spinal cord. The emergency room doctor correctly concluded that unless Mr. Papas was treated immediately by a spinal cord trauma unit he could suffer severe paralysis. 
At 12:30 p.m. the emergency room doctor made arrangements to transfer Mr. Pappas to a local university hospital, the only hospital in the area with such a trauma unit. Mr. Pappas' employer-sponsored HMO, however, would not allow Mr. Pappas to be transferred to the university hospital because it was not part of his service plan. Even after the emergency room doctor explained to the employer-sponsored HMO the urgency of the situation, the HMO refused. Indeed, the employer-sponsored HMO's physician who denied the treatment request refused to even speak to the emergency room doctor. 
The emergency room doctor expeditiously made other arrangements to transfer Mr. Pappas to a hospital with the appropriate facilities that could admit Mr. Pappas. Nonetheless, Mr. Pappas was not treated until 3:30 p.m. and now suffers from permanent quadripliegia resulting from compression of his spine by the abscess. A court determined that the employer-sponsored HMO was immune from liability due to ERISA, but the hospital and Mr. Pappas' physicians were left paying for Mr. Pappas' injuries although they had little to no culpability. 
Congress clearly never intended ERISA to remove all consumer protection nor for it to be used as a tool by employer-sponsored HMO's to shirk their responsibilities. My bill, therefore, amends section 514(b) of ERISA to clarify that State medical malpractice suits against an employer-sponsored HMO are not preempted by Federal law. 
The Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act resolves the current problem by doing three things: 
First, the measure holds employer-sponsored health insurance plans accountable for the consequences of their treatment rules and coverage determinations. This will increase patient protection, and create a powerful incentive for employer-sponsored HMO's to provide necessity care. 
Second, the measure provides patients with legal redress when their employer-sponsored HMO's treatment rules and coverage determinations cause them harm. Victims like Ms. Corcoran will no longer be left without the opportunity to seek just reparations for their injuries. And 
Finally, the measure reduces the likelihood that doctors will be sued for coverage determinations beyond their control. They will no longer face lawsuits simply because injured patients cannot properly hold their employer-sponsored HMO accountable. 
Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support the Employee Health Insurance Accountability Act in order to ensure that employer-sponsored HMO's can no longer escape liability for their actions.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Slamming Protection Act of 1997. This measure enables long-distance telephone consumers and the States to strike back against `slamming,' the practice of changing a telephone customer's long-distance carrier without the customer's knowledge or consent. 
Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of consumer complaints. In 1995, more than a third of the consumer complaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved slamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming complaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Moreover, the Los Angeles Times reports that more than 1 million American telephone consumers have been slammed in the last 2 years. 
Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act of fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of dollars a year. 
Let me give you an example. This January, Ms. Geryl Kramer, a small business owner in Chicago, was surprised to open her phone bill and find it noticeably more expensive than usual. After numerous phone calls she discovered that without her knowledge or consent, her long-distance carrier had been changed--she had been slammed. Her long-distance telephone service became a ping-pong ball bounced among various long-distance carriers for their profit and at her expense. 
Ms. Kramer spent countless hours attempting to resolve the situation, going back and forth between four different long-distance carriers who were involved in the slamming which had quadrupled her small business' long-distance bills. Although she was slammed in November last year, she still has not been able to track down how she was slammed or who was responsible. 
Ms. Kramer was understandably upset and frustrated. Beyond being exasperated by the audacity of the slammer, Ms. Kramer was left feeling powerless by her inability to hold the slammer accountable for its fraudulent actions. Having explored every other avenue, Ms. Kramer came to me seeking a solution to the problem of slamming. I believe the Slamming Protection Act is that solution. 
The current protections against slamming are simply inadequate. Although long-distance telephone consumers can currently bring an action in Federal court or file a complaint with the FCC, these measures have been largely ineffective in reducing slamming. The economic damages suffered by consumers are often relatively insignificant--it would cost more to sue for recovery than the consumer would ever recover in court. 
Moreover, if a long-distance telephone consumer files an FCC slamming complaint, the only redress is to be excused from paying the additional cost of the long-distance bill, if the bill is more expensive than it would have been under the original long-distance carrier. Thus, the consumer who is slammed must take the time and effort to file the complaint and participate in the investigation. Yet, when all is said and done, all the consumer can get after being defrauded is to be excused from paying the additional costs. Not surprisingly, slammers are undeterred by this system. And, it turns out, they have little to fear from broader FCC investigations. 
The FCC does have administrative enforcement procedures against slamming. Although the FCC's efforts are a step in the right direction, they are too slow moving and seldom result in more than a slap on the wrist. Last year the FCC processed roughly 13,000 slamming complaints. This is only a fraction of the number of slamming incidents. And only rarely do the FCC's efforts result in changes in industry practice. 
Since the FCC began investigating slamming in 1994, it has only moved against seven long-distance carriers and has only entered into consent decrees with eight long-distance carriers accused of slamming. Moreover, any fine or settlement agreement achieved by the FCC is paid to the U.S. Treasury, not the long-distance telephone consumer who was slammed--not to the party who was harmed. 
Mr. President, we need tougher laws on the books. Long-distance telephone consumers should be able to stand up for themselves and fight back against slammers to let them know that their actions will not pay. 
The Slamming Protection Act will help stamp out slamming by providing individual long-distance telephone consumers with the right and the power to strike back against individual slammers and by establishing penalties that will make slamming too risky and too expensive for the practice to remain profitable. 
This measure will help end slamming in three ways: 
First, it creates a right of action for long-distance telephone consumers to sue the slammer in State or Federal court. The Slamming Protection Act establishes minimum statutory damages of $2,000--or $6,000 if the slamming was done willfully and knowingly. These substantial penalties are designed to have a significant deterrent effect and to be large enough to encourage consumers to bring such actions; 
Second, the Slamming Protection Act provides State attorneys general with the right to bring suit against slammers on behalf of the citizens of their States. Currently, in some jurisdictions the States are virtually helpless in their fight against interstate slammers. There is no existing Federal right of action to allow the States to hold slammers accountable. And a number of courts have held that similar State laws are preempted by Federal law. Some States, therefore, are left without recourse to prevent their citizens from being injured by slammers; and 
Finally, the Slamming Protection Act creates criminal fines and jail time for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge and distorts the long distance competitive market by rewarding companies that engage in misleading marketing practices. The Slamming Protection Act's criminal penalties will guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity. 
Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to introduce this important initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and support The Slamming Protection Act in order to help long-distance telephone consumers and the States to fight back against deceptive and fraudulent slammers.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Women's Business Development Center for the vital role it has played in accelerating women's business ownership and strengthening the impact that women have made on our economy. 
The Women's Business Development Center is a nationally-recognized not-for-profit center devoted to providing services and programs that support and increase women's business ownership. Founded in 1986, more than 30,000 business owners in six States, including my home State of Illinois, have benefited from the program. The services range from counseling to workshops to entrepreneurial training. 
Today, thanks to efforts by organizations such as the Women's Business Development Center, there are over 7.7 million women-owned businesses in the United States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. Women business owners now employ one in every four U.S. company workers. There is no doubt that women in business today are playing a prominent role in stimulating economic growth both at home and abroad. 
On September 12 of this year the Women's Business Development Center will celebrate its 11th anniversary. As the Center moves into its second decade of service to women business owners, I am proud to recognize its impressive achievements.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the people of India on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of India's independence. 
Independence days, like birthdays, are for celebrating. And we have much to celebrate in United States-India relations. The friendship between the Indian and American people today is stronger and more deeply rooted than ever--deeply rooted because it is based on shared values, and strong because it is shared by more Indians and more Americans than ever before. 
The friendship between the United States and India is a friendship that goes back to the beginnings of the American Nation. In fact, the first Asian Indian-American is said to have come to the United States 200 years ago. 
It is a friendship that was strengthened when the United States supported Indian independence in 1947. It was strengthened again when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi during the American civil rights movement. And it was strengthened most recently when India embarked on its bold strategy of economic openness. 
It is a friendship based on mutual respect and understanding--understanding that the problems we face are mutual problems. In a shrinking world, India's challenges and India's successes are also those of the United States. Because radicalism and terrorism threaten all civilized countries, especially democracies. Because in a world economy, one nation cannot long prosper while its neighbors do not. 
India and the United States stand on the threshold of a new era. In just the past few years, India has flung open its doors to the world, and emerged as a rising star on the world scene. We should commit ourselves to continue the progress of recent years. 
We have a great advantage in this effort. It is the Indian-American community. Indian-Americans are the magnet that will keep India and the United States moving closer together, making our friendship worthy of the world's largest and oldest democracies. 
Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of a resolution in the Senate designating August 15, 1997 as `Indian Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Indian and American Democracy.' This resolution reaffirms the democratic principles on which the United States and India were established, and it requests that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And to the people of India, Indian-Americans, and all those who support the ideals of liberty and democracy, I wish you a happy independence day!

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to improve the efficiency and protect the integrity of Federal procurement and assistance programs, by ensuring that the Federal Government does business with responsible contractors and participants. 
The United States General Accounting Office [GAO] has found that billions of dollars in Federal procurement contracts and assistance are going to individuals and corporations which are violating our nation's labor and employment laws. In 1995, the GAO reported that more than $23 billion in Federal contracts were awarded in fiscal year 1993 to contractors who violated labor laws. That is 13 percent of the $182 billion in Federal contracts awarded that year. Part of the reason for this, the GAO found, is that the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces our nation's labor laws, does not know whether violators of the law are receiving Federal contracts. And the General Services Administration, which oversees Federal procurement, does not know the labor relations records of Federal contractors. 
Last year, the GAO reported that $38 billion in Federal contracts in fiscal year 1994 were awarded to contractors who had violated workplace health and safety laws. That is 22 percent of the $176 billion in Federal contracts of $25,000 or more which were awarded that year. The GAO found that 35 people died and 55 more people were hospitalized in fiscal year 1994 as a result of injuries at the workplaces of federal contractors who violated health and safety laws. These contractors were assessed a total of $10.9 million in penalties in fiscal year 1994--while being awarded $38 billion in Federal contracts. 
The GAO concluded that, although federal agencies have the authority to deny contracts and federal assistance to companies that violate Federal laws, this authority is rarely used in the case of safety and health violations. The GAO found that federal agencies do not normally collect or receive information about which contractors are violating health and safety laws--even when contractors have been assessed large penalties for egregious or repeat violations. 
The Federal Government should not ignore the health and safety records of companies that apply for federal contracts and assistance. A report published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine concludes that job-related injuries and illnesses in the United States are more common than previously thought, costing the nation more than AIDS, Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. The report, which analyzed national estimates of job-related illnesses and injuries in 1992, states that more than 13 million Americans were injured from job-related causes in just one year--more than four times the number of people who live in the City of Chicago. The report concluded that the cost to our country from workplace injuries and illnesses was $171 billion in 1992. 
The Federal Government has a responsibility to taxpayers, working Americans and law-abiding businesses, to ensure that federal tax dollars do not go to individuals and corporations that violate safety and health, labor and veterans' employment preference laws. About 26 million Americans are employed by federal contractors and subcontractors. They deserve to know that their Government is not rewarding employers who violate the laws that protect American workers and veterans. 
The legislation I am introducing today will improve the enforcement of our nation's health and safety, labor and veterans' employment laws, and provide an incentive to contractors to comply with the law. This legislation will allow the Secretary of Labor to debar or suspend a person from receiving Federal contracts or assistance for violating the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act or the disabled and Vietnam-era veterans hiring preference law. It will require the Secretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board to develop procedures to determine whether a violation of law is serious enough to warrant debarment or suspension. And, as recommended by the GAO, this legislation will require ongoing exchanges of information among Federal agencies to improve their ability to enforce our nation's laws. This legislation is identical to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Lane Evans of Illinois, and it is similar to legislation introduced in previous years by former Senator Paul Simon. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that the vast majority of Federal contractors obey the law. This legislation is only directed at those who are violating the law. It will deny Federal contracts and assistance to individuals and companies that violate the law and ensure that Federal contracts are awarded to companies that respect the law.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the people of Pakistan on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of their independence. In August of 1947, Pakistan gained its independence from the British Empire. For the past fifty years, the people of Pakistan have shared with the people of the United States a common interest in the establishment of democracy. In recent years, Pakistan has reasserted its committment to democratic government and is deserving of both our recognition and our support. 
The friendship between the United States and Pakistan goes back many years. In the mid-1950's, Pakistan and the United States joined together in a security agreement to resist Soviet expansion in South Asia. In late 1955, Pakistan joined the South East Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, demonstrating Pakistan's committment to the Free World. This commitment proved invaluable during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, as our two nations united in opposition to Soviet aggression. Without a doubt, a close, constructive friendship between the United States and Pakistan has been essential to the security of both nations. 
Beyond the affairs of state, there are the economic and cultural exchanges which spur growth and development and enrich the lives of our nations. In 1996, the total value of U.S. trade with Pakistan was $1.3 billion. Pakistan has recently embarked on an ambitious economic reform program to jumpstart the economy of Pakistan and provide the necessary foundation for free and fair trade. The United States should support these efforts, as Pakistan has the potential to one day become a model for the newly independent states of West and Central Asia. 
Pakistani-Americans are a vibrant part of American cultural and economic life. Across the nation, Pakistani-Americans share their knowledge and heritage with other Americans, contribute to our economy, and create homes and neighborhoods which are a vital contribution to the American dream. 
And so, on this the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of Pakistan, I rise to honor the people of Pakistan and their commitment to forge a free and democratic society. I look forward to many years of continued friendship between the people of Pakistan and the United States.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, in a brief colloquy regarding the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation--Metra. I commend both Senators Shelby and Lautenberg for their tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's transportation systems. And I congratulate them on bringing this bill to the floor. 
Mr. President, as Senator Shelby knows, Metra is the second largest commuter rail system in the country, carrying over 270,000 riders a day. Metra's 12 rail lines serve more than 100 towns and municipalities with 238 stations and a stop at O'Hare International Airport. It maintains a 97 percent on time performance while operating over 500 route miles. In short, Metra is an effective, first-class transit system that fills an enormous commuter need in the Northern Illinois/Chicago region. 
Metra anticipates that by the year 2020, the population of its service territory will grow by 25 percent and employment in that area will increase 37 percent. In order to prepare for this growth and meet additional needs, Metra plans to expand and upgrade service on three lines. Specifically, Metra plans to upgrade and expand North Central Service and the Metra Milwaukee West Line; upgrade and extend the South West Service to Manhattan, Illinois; and upgrade and extend the Union Pacific line to LaFox and Elburn, IL. The total cost of this project is $301 million over 6 years. 
The House included $5 million in the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill for engineering and design on tracks, signals, bridges, and earthwork associated with this project. 
Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Shelby if he considers Metra to be a priority new start transit project and if he and Senator Lautenberg would be willing to work to include the House language in conference.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to say at the outset that I have the highest respect for the Senator from Vermont. The Senator has done a great deal of work on one of the most important pieces of legislation which we will consider during the course of this Congress. Although I am not a member of his committee, I have an abiding interest in the Food and Drug Administration. For 12 years in the House I was a member of the subcommittee which funded the Food and Drug Administration. I was called on many times to get involved in issues related to this important agency. 
It is an extraordinary agency. By Federal standards it is tiny. About $1 billion each year out of our $1.6 trillion budget is spent on the budget of the Food and Drug Administration. Yet every one of us, every American family, depends on the Food and Drug Administration. Many of the products which we take for granted are reviewed by them for safety so that our families can use them and feel confident that the product is safe for that use. Thus, when there have been efforts to reform the Food and Drug Administration, I have been very attentive. Some people are looking to reform the Food and Drug Administration for selfish reasons. Others are looking to reform the Food and Drug Administration for the right reasons. I believe the Senator from Vermont falls in the latter category. I believe he is trying to reform the FDA for the right reasons. 
He and I may have a few differences of opinion, I think very few, and I hope that we have a chance, when this bill comes to the floor, to actually address them and perhaps, in the quiet of an off-the-floor conversation, we may come to an agreement on each of these items that I would like to discuss. But I salute him for the hard work which he has done in a bipartisan fashion to bring this matter to the floor. 
It is my understanding, perhaps the Senator from Vermont could enlighten us, that the bill itself was not ready for consideration, was actually in draft form for Members' offices to read, until this weekend. And, if that is the case, although I would like to see us move on it this week, I'm sure we would all like at least a few moments to go through it and to reflect on the different changes that are proposed and the impact that they would have on this important agency.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, one of the most common questions asked of Members of the House and Senate at town meetings or in casual conversations across America is the following: `Senator, if the Federal Government tells us that tobacco is so dangerous for Americans, why does the Federal Government continue to subsidize tobacco in America? 
A variety of answers are given to that question. These answers reflect, in some ways, our wishes and, in some ways, misinformation, but the honest answer is, there is no answer. It is almost impossible to explain to America's taxpayers why we are subsidizing the growth of a product which we tell every American is dangerous when consumed. 
How did we get in this predicament where we are subsidizing the growth and cultivation of tobacco in America? I would like to give a little history. 
In the midst of the Great Depression in 1933, Congress responded to the plight of farmers facing declining prices by passing the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. This was part of the New Deal legislation. When that legislation did not help halt the devastation spreading throughout the vast rural areas of our Nation, Congress in 1938 passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, and in that act, tobacco price support programs were born. The legislation also created farm programs for a wide variety of other crops. 
Over the years since then, we have changed and, in effect, totally overturned those supply control programs for almost every crop. Only a few crops continue to enjoy a program that looks like the 1938 bill. One of those select crops is tobacco. 
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 also created the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. By 1945, tobacco and a number of other program crops enjoyed Federal crop insurance to protect farmers from unexpected crop losses. The Crop Insurance Program has gone through many changes over the years. The modern version of the program began in 1981, with a major reorganization, which I was part of, in 1994. 
This year, for a farmer who has a typical crop insurance policy covering up to 65 percent of the crop's anticipated revenue, the Federal Government, the taxpayers, will pay 41.7 percent of the total premium. That is the direct subsidy to the Crop Insurance Program. In addition, the administration of the program is subsidized. 
Finally, if losses exceed what is anticipated, the Federal Government is, in fact, the insurance company of last resort, paying, for most crops, the difference. This subsidy may make sense for many crops. It helps bring some stability to the production of food and fiber that Americans rely on. But this is the most important element. 
Tobacco is not like any other crop in America. Tobacco is neither food nor fiber. Tobacco is the only crop grown in America with a body count. It is time we consider the health effects of tobacco in deciding whether our Federal Government should continue to subsidize insurance for this crop. 
How different is tobacco? The tobacco crops that receive Federal assistance are processed into cigarettes and smokeless spit tobacco products that kill more than 400,000 Americans every year of cancer, heart disease, and a variety of other illnesses. These products also disable hundreds of thousands of other Americans with emphysema and other respiratory illnesses. 
Many of my colleagues will argue, `Why do you single out tobacco? For goodness sakes, these farmers are growing crops just like other farmers.' These are not crops like other crops. Tobacco is different. Every day, 3,000 children in America become regular smokers for the first time. During their lifetime, around 30 of these 3,000 kids will be murdered, around 60 will die in a car crash, and around 1,000 of these kids, one in three, will die of smoking-related diseases. 
Supporters of the tobacco program will argue that cutting off Federal crop insurance isn't going to stop kids from smoking. Well, that is true, but the issue really goes beyond children and smoking. We have a product here that has no benefit to human health. None. Not even if used in moderation. Every other crop insured by the taxpayers of this Nation and subsidized by this Government offers benefits, nutrition, protein, calories, fiber, every other crop except tobacco. 
We are talking here about a product that the owner of one of our Nation's cigarette companies finally admitted this week under oath is addictive. Bennett LeBow, owner of the Liggett Group, admitted--finally admitted--that smoking causes cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and smoking is addictive. 
This is not a news flash for most Americans, but we all remember, with a sense of shame, the seven tobacco company executives testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives, standing under oath saying that their product was not addictive. 
Well, we have come a long way. Because tobacco and the nicotine in tobacco is addictive, many tobacco users find it almost impossible to quit. They are then set on a path for life that often ends in death. 
So the issue before us today is: Should the Federal Government be subsidizing this crop? Should we, with our tax 
dollars, subsidize tobacco? 
Last year, the Government spent $97 million on a variety of taxpayer-supported tobacco subsidies. This chart illustrates the Federal tobacco subsidies. When my colleagues argue there is no Federal subsidy, they should consider the real evidence before us. 
In 1993, Federal taxpayers gave $65 million of Federal tax money to the growers and cultivators of tobacco. 
In 1994, the figure was $60 million. 
In 1995, $51 million. 
In 1996, $97 million. 
And it is estimated this year that we will spend $67 million to subsidize tobacco. At a time when we are gripped in a national debate about the devastation this product causes, we continue, through our Federal Treasury, to send millions of dollars to the tobacco growers. At a time when we are cutting back on basic education and health programs in the name of balancing the budget, for some reason, we can find the wherewithal and the political strength to divert $67 million to the cultivation and growth of tobacco.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this may surprise my colleague from Kentucky. I may support his amendment. 
When I was chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, I was considered by many to be pretty tough on the Crop Insurance Program, even though, as the Senator from Kentucky has noted, I come from a corn-growing State, a State with soybeans, a State which avails itself very much to a great extent in the Crop Insurance Program. I don't disagree with anything that my colleague from Kentucky said about the Crop Insurance Program. There are indefensible subsidies in this program. 
I think, if he is going to address an overall reform of crop insurance, he may be surprised to find me as an ally. I had an amendment which I offered 1 year in the appropriations subcommittee. If I recall it correctly, it said that if you have sustained losses in 7 out of the last 10 years on your crop, you would be ineligible for crop insurance. I have this basic theory that if you couldn't grow a crop for 7 out of 10 years, God was telling you something about your land, that crop, or your talent, and that Uncle Sam and the Federal Government shouldn't be talking back to God in this instance and saying we will continue to insure the crop. 
There were a lot of people critical of my amendment because they had worked out a very sweet deal where they would plant crops that could never grow. It wasn't a sufficiently long growing season. But the crop was eligible. They would make their application. Lo and behold, the crop would fail again, and the Federal taxpayers would be asked to make up the difference. 
So, if the Senator from Kentucky is suggesting some basic reform of the Crop Insurance Program, I think I might be his ally. And if he is talking about limiting crop insurance to smaller farms, I think he might be surprised to find that we can work on that as well. But I think, in all honesty, that this amendment might never have been offered if I had not started an amendment on tobacco crop insurance. 
That is what this is about. It is not about reform of the crop insurance. It is about tobacco. And the two Senators from Kentucky, whom I respect very much, in defense of their State and its crop, have stood up and said, `Why are you picking on us? Why do you single out tobacco?' As one Senator from Kentucky said, tobacco is perfectly legal. That is true. But tobacco is also perfectly lethal. Tobacco is a killer. You have to eat an awful lot of corn and soybeans to die. But you start smoking, get addicted, the chances are 1 out of 3 that it is going to kill you. 
So, to the farmers who are growing it, who, for all intents and purposes and all appearances, look like any other farmer, what they are harvesting and what they are selling is devastating. For us to turn our backs on it and to say it is just another crop is to ignore the obvious. 
Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today--No. 1. Sure, we are concerned about AIDS. Certainly we are concerned about highway fatalities. Of course, we are concerned about violent crime. But if you want to save American lives, the first stop is tobacco. Take a look at what it does to us. 
For my colleagues to stand up and say, `It is just another farmer, it is just another agricultural product, why do you single us out,' it is because it is the only crop, when used according to the manufacturer's directions, will kill you. You can't smoke in moderation. You start this addiction, and you will end up generally as a statistic. 
So, when I bring this amendment to the floor to talk about crop insurance for tobacco, I can understand my colleagues from tobacco-producing States. I can understand it completely. I have represented a congressional district and a State which has its own interests, and I have try to defend those interests. I think that is part of my responsibility. 
But I say to my colleagues who are viewing this debate and making up their own mind: Make no mistake, tobacco is not just another product. Crop insurance for tobacco is a blatant contradiction that we would piously pronounce through the Surgeon General's office and the Department of Health and Human Services that this crop is a killer, that these tobacco products 
are claiming lives--even innocent victims like these flight attendants who are now suing down in Florida who happened to be exposed to secondhand smoke. Their lives were in jeopardy, too. We know this. We concede this. We advertise this. We spend millions of dollars to police this industry because we know what they are doing. They are addicting our children, and they are killing our fellow citizens. 
That is why it is totally inconsistent for us to be in a position where year after year we are plowing millions of taxpayer dollars collected from people across the United States into the subsidy--underline the word `subsidy'--of tobacco growers. 
I just marvel when my colleagues get up. We can argue a lot of this on the merits. But it takes my breath away to hear these colleagues stand up and say that there is no tobacco subsidy. 
Let me go back to this Federal tobacco subsidy chart. 
There is this tobacco subsidy: $65 million in 1993; $60 million in 1994; $51 million in 1995. In 1996, when I first took on this issue, they estimated our losses would be about the same--$50 million. They went to $97 million, and then in 1997 the estimate was $67 million.

Mr. DURBIN. I want to eliminate crop insurance for tobacco. I will concede to my colleague that the overall subsidy for crop insurance, as I said at the outset, is an issue well worth addressing. The fact that we would spend--perhaps the Senator from Mississippi has more current figures--we would spend in the neighborhood of $200 million subsidizing crop insurance in America is an issue which I will happily join with my colleague from Kentucky and other States to address. 
But lest we forget, this debate started on the issue of tobacco, and although many of my colleagues want to raise a variety of other issues, we still have to face the reality that when this debate is over, we are going to face this question time and again when we go home: Senator, what's going on here? I can't pick up a newspaper, a news magazine, turn on the radio or television and I am not being told how bad tobacco is for America. Why do you keep plowing millions of my tax dollars into the subsidy of this tobacco crop? How can you justify it? 
I cannot. That is why I am offering the amendment. And I would say to my colleagues from the tobacco producing States, it is time to accept reality. And reality will tell you this. The day when the Federal Government rushed to the rescue of tobacco is over. I do not know if I will succeed with this amendment today, but tobacco's days in the U.S. Department of Agriculture are numbered. They know it, the tobacco farmers know it, and the tobacco companies know it. They know full well, as they have watched the course of events over the last 5 or 6 years, that each year we have eliminated another Federal program relative to tobacco--research, export assistance, market promotion program. We have closed those doors, and those doors have remained shut. 
The tobacco growers and industry realized long ago that if they wanted an allotment program that gives them the advantage of making the kind of money we are talking about, they would have to pay for their own program. And they did it. And yet now we are in a part of this debate where they are saying we want to hang onto this last Federal subsidy. 
Make no mistake; this second-degree amendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, does not just reform crop insurance. It strikes our prohibition before inserting his addition. So he is not adding to my amendment. He wants to get me out of the way. He wants to talk about crop insurance programs. He does not want to talk about tobacco. That is a delicate subject. But it is a delicate subject I have been talking about for 10 years. 
And I want to tell you, too, I think the tide of history is on my side. I hope I am around to see that tide hit the shore. I hope I am still standing when it does. But a little over 10 years ago, I offered the first amendment in my long and checkered career on this issue to ban smoking on airplanes--10 years ago. Every leader in the House of Representatives, Democrat and Republican, opposed me, every committee chairman, and we went to the floor. They said we were meddling with tobacco, and they did not care for it, and tobacco lobbied. Folks, I want to tell you, the monsters of the midway are not the Chicago Bears. The monsters of the midway are the tobacco lobbyists in this town. They came down like a ton of bricks on this amendment. But you know what. We won. By 5 votes we won, 198 to 193, and I was the most surprised Member of Congress standing in the Chamber of the House when it happened. 
What it told me then and tells me now is that we are going to win this battle--maybe not today. I hope we do. Maybe not today, but we will. And the tobacco growers and tobacco companies have to accept the reality that if their product is to remain legal, if it is to remain legal, they have to change the way they do business. They have to stop asking for this Federal subsidy. They have to stop selling tobacco to our kids. 
If they do not agree to those two things, they are going to continue to face this kind of opposition year in and year out, and it will continue unabated. Those who are here in the Chamber, my colleagues, and some who are in the gallery who have taken the time to tour this beautiful building--and it is magnificent. I am very proud to be a Member of the Senate and to be able to practice my profession in this building--they will take a look around at the columns as they walk through the corridors and they will find at the top of these columns a curious leaf. 
What could it be? Well, you know what. Many of these columns are adorned with tobacco leaves. It tells you something 
about the history of the United States of America and the history of this Congress. When the President of the United States comes for an address to the Joint Session of Congress, State of the Union Address, for example, he stands in front of a wooden podium. Carved in the side of that wooden podium are tobacco leaves. It is part of America and it is part of our history. And there are some people who do not want to give up on that piece of history. They want to hang in there one more year for tobacco: Oh, we can do it. We can survive. We can offer perfecting amendments. We are going to fight for 1 more year. 
But the tide of history is not on their side. It was not that long ago, even in my lifetime, when doctors used to advertise the healthiest cigarettes to smoke. It has not been that long ago that you could have a smoking and nonsmoking section on an airplane and create the fiction you were protecting people, knowing full well that you were not. 
Those days are over. And as these tobacco companies come in here ready to negotiate, not because of a guilty conscience, because of their additional efforts to make money, we can see the tide changing. And yet we hang onto this vestige of the old school, this relic of history which for 60 years has said that the Federal taxpayers will defend and subsidize tobacco. That has to come to an end, and it has to come to an end sooner rather than later. 
Let us take the money we save with my amendment and use it for valuable, positive things that will help all of rural America. Let us use it for programs that are beneficial, health assistance to everyone across this Nation. The amendment that has been offered by my colleague from Kentucky is an amendment which seeks to win this battle today, put it off, at least the overall issue, for another day. But that is not good for America. It does us no good as a nation to turn our back on this reality. 
I say to my colleague as well, although he may question this, I will tell him in all sincerity, I understand his concern for his farmers. I give him my word now as I have in previous debates that if he is prepared to offer an amendment as part of this tobacco agreement to help his farmers, either phaseout of tobacco growth, move in other areas, I will be there, I will help him. Tobacco companies owe a great deal to the American tobacco growers, and I don't run into too many tobacco farmers who defend them, incidentally, because they know full well these same tobacco companies haven't treated America's tobacco farmers very well. They continue to import cheaper tobacco from overseas. They turn their backs on the very farmers whose tractors and skirts they have hid behind for decades. It was not fair the tobacco growers were not at the table. 
If the Senator from Kentucky or anyone on that side of the debate wants to suggest a change in this overall agreement to provide assistance to those tobacco growers so that they can phase in to a different type of production or phaseout of tobacco growth, I am happy to join him in that effort. My war is not with those farmers. My war is with what they are growing in their fields, because what they grow in those fields is deadly. It is lethal. It is something that can't be ignored or swept aside as just another agricultural issue. 
I can recall during past debates on this people have stood up and said you can't single out tobacco when it comes to America's export policy, and yet we have done it. People have said you cannot single out tobacco when it comes to research. Basically, we have done it. People have said time and again that you cannot separate tobacco as a crop. But I believe the American people know the difference. They know the difference between a bushel of corn that may be used for a variety of positive things. They know the difference between a bushel of soybeans that may be used for a variety of things, positive for American families, or a bail of cotton. You cannot say the same thing about these tobacco leaves. 
So, Mr. President, I oppose this amendment, not because of its underlying wisdom but because it is offered only, exclusively, solely for one reason--push the tobacco debate off for another day. I believe, and I believe my colleagues will join me in this belief, that you cannot wait another day. You have to move forward with this debate and address this issue now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the Federal subsidy for tobacco. How many times have we faced that question? 
Senators, the Federal Government says that tobacco is dangerous. Why do the taxpayers continue to subsidize it? We subsidize it in the form of crop insurance. 
Senator Gregg and I are offering this amendment to eliminate once and for all crop insurance for tobacco. Some Senators have said that is unfair. Every crop gets insured. Right? Wrong. Sixty-seven crops are presently ensured. Sixteen hundred are not. 
The list goes on and on and on. I am about to drop them. 
What is this about? It is about a crop that is perfectly legal and perfectly lethal. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. 
Let's get our public health policy and our subsidies straight. 
So, to vote against the crop insurance for tobacco, the appropriate vote is `no' on the motion to table and `no' on more subsidies.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would help improve our country's aging Interstate System--the Interstate System Improvement Act of 1997. My colleagues, Senators Moseley-Braun and Reid have joined me as original cosponsors. 
This bill is simple. It would fund the discretionary Interstate 4R [I-4R] program at a level of $800 million annually, a significant increase from the current level of $66 million in fiscal year 1997. I believe that the I-4R program is one of the most crucial aspects of the upcoming Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA] reauthorization. And, I hope to work with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to incorporate this important measure into ISTEA legislation later this year. 
The I-4R program is critical to the resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of our country's vital infrastructure. This year, the program is funded at $66 million. However, demand for funds has outpaced available money by more than 9 to 1. For example, in fiscal year 1997, 25 States requested $1.2 billion in I-4R funds under the discretionary program. Only six States received assistance, most at greatly reduced levels. Nineteen States will receive no I-4R discretionary funds in fiscal year 1997 and over $1 billion in funding requests have gone unanswered. 
States with major interstate projects would benefit greatly from this legislation. In Illinois alone, the State faces a highway funding shortage because of crucial projects like the Stevenson Expressway in Chicago and I-74 in Peoria. These projects are simply too important to delay. A healthy I-4R discretionary program is necessary in order to rebuild this vital infrastructure. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this important legislation.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I have serious concerns about our current trade relations with China. Last year, our merchandise trade deficit with China grew to $39.5 billion, which is an increase of more than 213 percent over the past 5 years. This year, our trade deficit with China is expected to reach $50 billion. 
It is clear that, in many cases, goods from the United States are locked out of China's markets, while goods from China are allowed to enter United States markets at nondiscriminatory tariff rates. Last year, the United States imported $51.5 billion in goods from China, while China imported only $12 billion in goods from the United States. More than one-third of China's exports are sold to the United States, while only 2 percent of total United States exports are sold to China. 
The piracy of intellectual property rights in China cost the United States economy $2.3 billion last year. It is estimated that as much as 97 percent of the entertainment software sold in China is counterfeit, and pirated goods produced in China have been found in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North and South America. 
At the same time, the Government of China continues to sell weapons of mass destruction, and abuse the human rights of its citizens. China has sold missiles, missile technology, and chemical and biological weapons to countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. These weapons threaten U.S. military personnel overseas, and our allies and friends around the world. And the State Department report on human rights in China describes widespread human rights abuses which violate internationally accepted standards. The report states that all public dissent against the Communist party and the Government of China has been silenced by intimidation, exile, prison terms, and other forms of detention. 
The legislation which the Senate is considering today is not the appropriate vehicle for this amendment. The Trade Act of 1974 already provides a thorough mechanism for the consideration of MFN renewal for nonmarket economies such as China. This amendment is being offered without consideration by any committee of the Senate, and with limited opportunity for debate on the Senate floor. 
In addition, this amendment would have no legal effect. The decision to renew MFN for China has already been made for this year. The President renewed MFN for China in May, and the House of Representatives rejected a joint resolution of disapproval. This amendment would have no impact on that decision. 
Mr. President, the Government of China should not expect the United States to continue to provide nondiscriminatory tariff rates to goods from China, if China continues to restrict the access of United States products to markets in China. If the renewal of MFN for China is considered by the Senate next year under the Trade Act, I may be compelled to continue to oppose MFN for China unless there is a substantial improvement in China's trade practices, proliferation policies, and respect for human rights.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I applaud the authorization of $15 million for the DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program. Authorization of these funds will guarantee the continuation of this laudable research effort. 
The DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program supports important research that contributes significantly to the health missions of both DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. Since 1987, the VA medical and prosthetics research appropriation has been supplemented by funds transferred to VA under a cooperative agreement with DOD. The DOD-VA research program has become a truly collaborative effort and one that is mutually beneficial to both DOD and VA. The work performed under this program addresses conditions affecting both active duty personnel and veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, the consequences of exposure to environmental hazards, wound repair, brain and spinal cord injury, and skin and vascular repair. No other program supports this type of mission-relevant cooperative research. 
I expect that with this funding, areas of mutual interest to DOD and VA in the fields of medical and psychological research will continue. Specifically, this funding encourages innovative endeavors in accordance with the five jointly established programs: the DOD-VA environmental epidemiology research center; research on psychological diseases and post-traumatic stress disorder; cardiovascular fitness; research in prostate cancer and emerging pathogens; and casualty care enhancement. 
It is imperative for the health and well-being of our veterans and active-duty military personnel that Congress continue to fund this important initiative by authorizing $15 million for the DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program. This is the least that we can do in recognition of the invaluable service rendered by our veterans and military personnel.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would extend the current excise tax incentive for ethanol use. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Moseley-Braun, Johnson, and Wellstone in this important effort. 
We are moving forward with this extension today for several reasons. Last month the Senate included extension language in the reconciliation bill. I believe this sends a strong signal that ethanol enjoys wide, bipartisan support on this side of the Capitol. Based on that action, now is the appropriate time to pursue extension through any and all avenues. Reconciliation is one avenue. Reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA], the vehicle used in this legislation, is another. We would prefer that it be done sooner in the reconciliation bill, rather than later in the ISTEA reauthorization. But we want to make it clear that, one way or another, we will not rest until this extension becomes law. 
I stand in strong support of the Senate's reconciliation language that would extend the program through 2007. I commend my colleagues, Senators Grassley and Moseley-Braun for their tireless efforts to include an extension in the Senate language. And, I urge Senate conferees to hold fast to that position. 
Despite strong support in the Senate, the House Ways and Means Committee voted last month to cut, cap, and kill this important program. Even with a moderation of the Committee language in the House and the action by the Senate, the House Committee action has caused considerable uncertainty about the future of the ethanol program which will no doubt affect the growth of this renewable fuel program. 
The ethanol program has been an excellent example of a program that works. At a time when we are laboring to enact a balanced budget, I believe that programs, like ethanol, that pay for themselves and provide important benefits should be maintained rather than summarily eliminated. 
Ethanol's benefits are well documented--it strengthens the economy, improves the environment, and decreases our dependence on foreign oil. A recent study conducted by the Midwest Governors' Conference concluded that the ethanol program produces a net savings to the Federal budget of more than $3.6 billion, adds over $450 million to State tax receipts each year, increases total U.S. employment by 195,200 jobs, and boosts net farm income by more than $4.5 billion annually. The Federal Government gains $1.30 for each gallon of ethanol sold in America--more than double the 54-cent-per-gallon cost of the incentive. 
The increased use of ethanol helps offset the greenhouse gas emissions that result from the burning of fossil fuels. Ethanol-blended fuels reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and air toxics. Also, ethanol reduces the demand for imported gasoline and imported oxygenates by more than 90,000 barrels per day. 
Clearly, ethanol is not a favorite of many of the big oil companies. But just as clearly, ethanol use is good for America. Each gallon of ethanol production capacity not built due to uncertainty about ethanol's tax status represents a loss of revenue to the U.S. Treasury as well as to our Nation's farmers. If investors are scared away because of legislative attacks on ethanol, the taxpayer loses. 
That is why we are introducing legislation to reaffirm and extend our national commitment to this domestic, agriculture-based, renewable fuel program. We need to give this important sector of our economy the stability that will allow it to keep expanding. We need a solid, long-term commitment to help ensure that the demand for home-grown ethanol continues. 
It is a critical time for ethanol. Instead of debating how to cut, cap, and kill the ethanol program as a number of legislators on the other side of the Capitol have done, supporters, whether from rural or urban areas, should be discussing the most appropriate way to extend the program. A program that works. 
Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to send a signal that Congress will keep its commitment to renewable alcohol fuels.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. There is a quotation attributed to Vladimir Lenin. I am not sure he said it, but it has been repeated often enough that it is possible he did. It is illustrative of the challenge we face in this debate. It is reported that Lenin said: `A capitalist will sell you the rope that you use to hang him.' 
The suggestion from this founder of communism was that countries like the United States with a passion for capitalism and sales will occasionally get too overheated and end up selling the very product that can be used against him. Lenin's quotation goes back almost 80 years; yet, it is apropos of the debate today in 1997. We are talking about the sale of a supercomputer to a country that can use it against us. How should we take care to prevent that from happening? What safeguards should we establish? 
You have read in the newspapers over the last few years the sad commentary of people entrusted at the highest levels of Government in the United States with classified and secret information, with access to technology, who have literally betrayed the United States and have sold that information to one of our adversaries. Ultimately, many of them have been caught and prosecuted and have served time, as they should, for betraying their Nation and giving away something very critical to the defense of this country to one of our adversaries. 
At the basis of this debate is this same question: Are we giving away, through sales, a precious resource that can be used against us? Are we handing over a capability to a country that may not have the same interest or the best interest of the United States at heart? 
That is why Senator Cochran and I have offered this amendment. Let me say at the outset for those who are critical of the amendment, we are not saying that the United States cannot make sales of these supercomputers to any country, Tier 1, 2, or 3; but we are saying, if you are going to sell these supercomputers to one group of countries that we want to take care do not misuse them, then please come to the Government, come to the Department of Commerce and make certain that the party buying the computer in that country, whether it is China, Russia, or another Tier 3 country, is an end user or party that will use it for peaceful purposes.  
Is that some outrageous suggestion--that before we sell this great capability, this supercomputer capability, to some entity in China or Russia that we take care not to sell it to the wrong person? I think most Americans would say, `Why would we have a Government, if you aren't going to do something that basic to protect us?' Is there reason to be concerned about this? 
Think about what we are selling. One supercomputer that was sold to Russia increased their computer capability 10 times. We took our genius, our technology, put it up for sale, and they bought it. And with that purchase they not only bought the technology, they bought a new capability--I am sorry to report capability which can be used for negative reasons, for reasons inconsistent with American policy, and as easily for peaceful reasons. 
Some have said, `Don't do the Cochran-Durbin amendment. It just involves too many sales. It would restrict too many supercomputer sales.' 
Senator Cochran made this point. When you look at the sales to Tier 3 countries, which are the only countries affected by this amendment, there were 91 sales in the 15 months of new trade policy by the Clinton administration; 6.3 percent of the computers in question are at issue here. Is that too much to ask? That when we start to sell 6.3 percent of our computer sales to certain countries, we say, `Pause. Hold back. Let's review and make sure that the entity buying them in the other country is a peaceful entity, that in fact it won't be used against the United States.' 
We have sold 47 supercomputers to China, another 20 to Hong Kong, and many to Russia as well. What have we learned about these sales? 
I am sorry to report that four silicon graphic machines that were sold to Russia are now being used at Russia's nuclear weapons labs; one silicon graphics machine in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which on its face sounds harmless but it is a key part of China's nuclear weapons complex; one Sun Microsystems machine we sold, we learned last week, is now running in a Chinese military facility after being diverted from Hong Kong. 
What Senator Cochran and I are saying is, is it worth our effort and time to take care not to let these computers fall into the wrong hands? But, if you listen to the voices of business and the supercomputer industry, you would think that our suggestion was to stop sales of supercomputers. But it is not. In fact, it wouldn't affect 93 percent of the sales already, and for the other 6.3 percent all we are asking is for time for review. 
We received a letter in opposition to our amendment from the Secretary of Commerce, a man whom I admire very much. But I would have to say to the Department of Commerce and to the Department of Defense that it is not unreasonable for us to ask you to set up a mechanism to make sure these computers don't end up in the wrong hands. 
I have received a publication from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Not surprisingly they don't want any restrictions on this trade. They want U.S. companies to be able to sell whenever and to whomever they choose, and they don't want the restriction of the Cochran-Durbin amendment. But I would say to my colleagues that it is a little disingenuous for them to argue that if we do not allow the sale of supercomputers which can be misused against the United States that we endanger American jobs. There is something larger at stake than American jobs. What is at stake here is American security. I would think that every worker in the computer industry or outside would want to make certain that, No. 1, we provide for the common defense. If I recall, that is part of a document that all of us consider to be illustrative of the goals of America. 
Let's address this issue about whether or not the Cochran-Durbin amendment in going after the 2,000 MTOPS model is talking about a garden variety of PC's which people can pick up at the corner computer store and are today available in Senate offices. As one of my colleagues said, it is a common thing that shouldn't be restricted. From what we are told 10,000 MTOPS is not common to them. The computers that are being sold right now are at a level of 200 MTOPS or 250 MTOPS. And even assuming that this industry, which is burgeoning and increasing its capability dramatically, should continue to increase the capability of these computers, Senator Cochran and I estimate that it will be more than 4 years before they all reach the end of the MTOPS stage. At least until that time shouldn't we take care, be cautious, and be concerned about the danger of selling this capability? I think we should. I think it is a serious mistake for us to assume that if we do not sell these computers to our potential enemies some other country will. 
When we asked the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense this question they said, `Well, the only country likely to step in, if the United States doesn't sell the computers, is Japan.' Incidentally, Japan has more restrictive export controls than the United States. So I wonder if we are really thinking very seriously about the potential ramifications. 
It is very shortsighted to celebrate the sale of a computer to a country overseas, to celebrate the jobs that are created, and to ignore the reality that that computer may give a potential enemy capability--capability to manufacture, capability to test through computers nuclear weaponry, chemical weaponry, and biological weaponry. All of these things I think should be of great concern to all of us. 
With all due respect to my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, I would say that his amendment does little to address the core problem here. To call for a study? Well, we have been at this for 15 months. If you want to know what has happened, we can give you the statistics. We can tell you what has occurred in terms of the sales actually made to China, to Russia, and through Hong Kong back to China. We know things have happened that we never wanted to happen. The idea that we can somehow evaluate this and then let those know who are interested really strikes me as a very weak approach. 
Let me just say that the bottom line is that I know industry is in the business of selling. I think our Government and the Senate should be in the interest of not only encouraging sales but encouraging responsible sales. 
When Senator Cochran and I come forward and say that for 6.3 percent of computers we want to make certain there is a review, that the end users cannot use that technology against us, I think that is a reasonable request. 
I sat through the hearing. I wish some of my colleagues who oppose this amendment could have sat through it as well. I think they would have come away with the same impression that I did. The current liberal trade policy of supercomputers is going to create a situation which could one day come back and haunt America. We are giving to those in China, Russia, and other countries capabilities which we have worked hard to create and capabilities which unfortunately they may misuse. 
We spend so much time in this body discussing the proliferation of weapons. We watch every move that the People's Republic of China makes for fear that they are proliferating these weapons around the world. We have classified and unclassified briefings on the subject. And when it comes to the sale of hardware and technology, we step aside and say it is another story. It is not. It is the same story. It is the same concern, and should be expressed as such. 
I hope my colleagues will take a hard look at this. It is not often that I break with the Clinton administration on foreign policy. But I think Senator Cochran is right. I think this policy should be subject to thorough review, and I think his amendment, which I am happy to cosponsor, is a step in the direction to make sure that we don't turn loose to the world supercomputer technology and one day come to regret it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment has been reviewed by both sides. Senator Thurmond, as chairman of the committee, and Senator Levin, as the ranking minority member, have accepted this amendment. It relates to the issue of burdensharing. It is an amendment which would not withdraw any troops, but would ask that our allies assume greater responsibility in helping to defray the expenses of the American troops which have been positioned overseas. 
The amendment, I think, accurately reflects the postcold-war environment and the budget challenges which we face.

Mr. DURBIN. I rise to speak on behalf of the same amendment which my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, has just described. 
I am happy to join him as a cosponsor on this important amendment. I only wish my colleagues and many others who are listening to this debate could have been there when Senator Cochran's subcommittee met just several weeks ago and really talked in depth about what we are doing. 
For the average layman, the average person in the United States, there are some very technical terms involved in this debate. But the purpose of this amendment is very clear and very straightforward. We understand that if we give to another country certain information or technology, they are able in many ways to use it for positive reasons. We fear however that if that same information and technology is given to a country which might use it for negative purposes, that it is inconsistent with the national security of the United States. 
The Cochran-Durbin amendment is an effort to make certain that we continue to sell technology around the world, but take care not to sell it in those countries where it may be misused. 
Unfortunately, the Clinton administration over the last years has had a change in its policy, with a more expansive, more liberal trade policy when it comes to supercomputers. It has been my fear, and the fear of the Senator from Mississippi, that some of these computers which are being purchased for nominally peaceful reasons are in fact going to be used for military purposes. 
One of the examples which the Senator from Mississippi used in closing was the whole question of weapons testing. Some 35 years ago when President Kennedy spoke to the Nation, he challenged us as a world to reduce nuclear arms testing so as to make this a more peaceful planet. I think President Kennedy was right. And I support a weapons test ban. I think the United States should continue to show leadership. 
But we live in a different world some 3 decades later where a country with a new computer, the supercomputers that we are describing, that country may have the capability to test a nuclear weapon without ever detonating it. They can set up all of the parameters within the computer, test the weapon, and show its impact. 
So if you are talking about reducing the proliferation of dangerous weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--you must necessarily get involved in this debate, which Senator Cochran has initiated and I have been more than happy to assist in. 
Some questions have been raised. And I wonder, just for purposes of clarification, if I could ask Senator Cochran a question or two for the record here. I know the Senator has covered most of this in his opening statement, but I think we ought to make a clear record for our colleagues on the amendment. 
One of the first things that is said is, well, you set the standard too low. If a company wants to sell this computer, which we describe as a 2,000 MTOPS computer, you have set it too low, set it at a standard so that the computers that are going to be licensed, there is going to be surveillance at such a level. It will not hit the ordinary business computers. 
I would like you to respond. And I know you did respond in the course of your opening remarks to that particular criticism. If you would, please, I yield to the Senator.

Mr. DURBIN. If I could pose another question to my cosponsor on this amendment, Senator Cochran. 
There have been others that have said, well, why is the United States doing this? If we stop selling computers around the world, whatever their capability, some other country is going to sell them. So we are tying the hands of American business in a futile effort to stop this march of technology. 
I would appreciate it if my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, would address that particular complaint.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague. 
I think he noted in the course of his remarks that last week or perhaps the week before the administration said, well, let us put out a list of 13 or 14 different entities that we think we should take care not to sell to. And I agree completely with the Senator from Mississippi that it is hardly a comfort in this argument that we are protecting the interest of the United States with this list. 
It is hard to believe that our intelligence operations would make a complete disclosure of every potentially bad purchaser around the world without in fact disclosing very sensitive classified information. It is far better to take the approach which the Cochran-Durbin amendment does, which says that on a case-by-case basis there will be a license issued by the Government to determine whether the would-be purchaser in any way raises a suspicion that this technology is going to be misused, used against the United States. 
I think our approach to it gives the Government the power it needs to police the sales, says to the seller, the computer company, you can come to the Government now and entrust that decision to an entity which should know as to which purchasers should not be trusted. And that I think would give the industry some peace of mind. It has to be a major embarrassment to these companies to realize now that they have sold these supercomputers in China and in Russia and that they may be used for military purposes against the United States. 
Certainly, these companies in the United States value our security, they are as patriotic as many others, and they would want to do the right thing. The Cochran-Durbin amendment sets up I think a good framework for the right decision to be made. I certainly hope that when this amendment comes up for consideration that many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will stop and pause and reflect on it. Because I think it in a way takes a look at the world as it currently exists and says we do not want to sell to potential enemies or to suspect nations that power that might come back someday to haunt us. It is important to increase trade, but not at the expense of the security of the United States. 
I thank my colleague from Mississippi for his leadership. And I am happy to join him in this effort. 
I yield back.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call upon my colleagues to support a bill to close the School of the Americas. 
The School of the Americas is an institute that has outlived its usefulness and its purpose. SOA was established over 50 years ago. Its mission is to provide military education and training to military personnel of Central America, South America, and Caribbean countries. The training provided at the school in tactical intelligence, infantry tactics, combat skills, and battle planning was designed in accordance with U.S. strategy of a bygone era: to create a Latin and South American staging area to thwart the Communist threat. But times have changed and there is no longer a Soviet bloc threatening to attack the United States. Unfortunately, SOA has not successfully adapted to the great changes in the world since the 1992 breakup of the Soviet Union. Despite attempts made over the past couple of years to update the curriculum and improve the selection process for students and the quality of the teaching staff, SOA remains an anachronism. 
In the post-cold-war era, we need to strengthen civilian institutions in Latin America and help these countries continue to reform their militaries. This region contains some of the most fragile democracies which need our support in encouraging democratically elected governments, the role of civilian institutions and economic stability. Our focus should be on supporting these nascent civilian governments and helping them shift authority away from their militaries. 
I also believe the school should be closed because of its past links to numerous military personnel who have committed some of the most heinous crimes of recent memory. SOA graduates include: Panamanian dictator and drug dealer, Manuel Noriega; 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked to the 1989 murder of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter; El Salvador death squad leader, Roberto D'Aubuisson; Argentinian dictator, Leopoldo Galtieri; three of the five officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of four United States churchwomen in El Salvador; and 10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village, El Mozote. These criminals, multiple murderers, and rapists are former students and graduates of the School of the Americas where they received their military and counterinsurgency training.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment was offered last night. It is an amendment which I think most Members are conversant with because it is not a new issue. This is an issue which has been literally before Congress for almost 50 years. 
It is an issue of rank discrimination. It is an issue of unfairness. It is an issue of inequality. And it goes to the heart of protecting American families. 
The issue at hand is the deductibility of health insurance premiums. 
Those Americans fortunate enough to work for corporations, employees and management, enjoy a 100 percent deductibility of all health insurance premiums. I think that is good policy. It encourages health insurance protection. It protects families. 
If you happen to be one of the 23 million Americans who are self-employed and you buy health insurance for your family, your tax deductibility is 40 percent. What does that mean? It means, unfortunately, a higher percentage of self-employed people and their families are uninsured. It means that the children, of course, of these self-employed do not have health insurance protection, and it basically means a discrimination in our Tax Code which should have been removed long ago. 
There are those who have argued for gradualism. Let us very, very slowly, in a glacial-like pace reach the day when we have equality and parity, 100 percent deduction for all Americans. 
I am happy to be joined by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Kit Bond, and also my other colleagues who have said that they think as I do, that it is time for us to end this inequality and to give real parity and fairness so that both the self-employed and those working for other businesses have the same opportunity for 100 percent tax deduction. 
I ask unanimous consent Senators Bond, Dorgan Daschle, Harkin, Boxer, Mikulski and Johnson be added as cosponsors of my amendment No. 519.

<DOCNO>105-durbin-il-19-19970626</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at this point, too, it is easy to come before this body and to propose new tax benefits. We know the difficult part, the offsets--how do you pay for them? 
I have come up with a means of paying for this which I think you can detect has some controversy attached to it, but I think it is reasonable. It would impose an additional 11-cent-per-package tax on cigarettes sold in America and a parallel percentage increase on spit tobacco and snuff. 
Now, the bill proposed by the Senate Finance Committee already raised the Federal tax on tobacco and cigarettes, for example, from 24 cents to 44 cents. This bill would add an additional 11 cents. Make no mistake, it is a tax. For those who have told me, as I have spoken to them, `Oh, I never vote to increase the tax,' I remind you if you are voting for the Senate Finance Committee bill, you are voting for an increase in this very same tax. 
I ask you to consider whether or not it is worth 11 cents on a package of cigarettes to extend this kind of protection to over 20 million Americans. I think it is. I hope you will agree with me. 
If we do not make this move this evening, if we do not finally grasp this opportunity, seize this opportunity and increase the deductibility of this health insurance for self-employed, they will languish for 8, 9, or 10 years before ever approximating or reaching parity. That is not fair. It is not fair to the self-employed. It is not fair to the Americans who are disadvantaged by this provision in the Tax Code. 
I might also add that many of my colleagues are interested in small business. They believe, as I do that small business is the real engine of economic growth in this country. One of the largest associations of small businesses is the National Federation of Independent Businesses, over 600,000 businesses. When they surveyed their members nationwide, they learned last year that the No. 1 issue--the No. 1 issue--on the minds of their members was the deductibility of health insurance. Business Week magazine recently noted that this was one of the two top obstacles to success for many small businesses. So if you want to encourage small business and the creation of jobs, I urge you to support this amendment. 
Let me speak for a moment about this tobacco tax. I know that my colleague and friend from the State of Kentucky feels very passionately about this issue. I might tell him that I do as well. I will tell you what will occur if you increase the cost of tobacco products. Children will be less inclined to buy them. As these products become more expensive, children cannot afford them. It is a fact that has been proven over and again. It was recently shown just a few years ago in Canada when they had a dramatic increase in their tobacco tax. So we know that by increasing this tax by 11 cents, we end up making over 20 million Americans who are self-employed, give them a position of fairness when it comes to tax treatment, and we reduce the likelihood that children will end up using these tobacco products. 
Now I know there will be a lot said about tobacco farmers in opposition to my amendment. I want to make this a matter of record. I have said from the beginning I am prepared to work with those Members who want to help transition tobacco farmers into other crops and other livelihoods. I believe that is the wave of the future and it should be part of any comprehensive change in tobacco policy. 
I will conclude and then defer to my colleague from Missouri. An estimated 4 1/2 million American children and teenagers smoke cigarettes and another million use smokeless tobacco. Every 30 seconds in America a child smokes for the first time--3,000 a day--and a third of them--1,000--will die with this addiction to nicotine. And teenage smoking has risen by nearly 50 percent since 1991. 
So I say to my colleagues, I think this is a balanced approach. It helps those who truly deserve it. It says to the tobacco industry, we will make your product a little more expensive and take it out of the hands of children. This is a reality. If you look at the State taxes around the United States, some of them range as high as $1 a package and they are going up. The States understand this is a source of revenue which is a reasonable source to turn to for legitimate reasons. We should turn to the source of revenue, turn to it this evening. 
I yield for purposes of debate, but do not yield the floor, to my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond.

Mr. DURBIN. I will not use that, I guarantee you. 
Let me say this. I want to respond to some of the points raised in this debate. I have been involved in this debate for over a decade and have heard many of these arguments, and I disagree with them. But I do respect my colleagues both in the House and in the Senate who make these arguments. I believe they are heartfelt and sincere. I believe they are speaking for the people that they represent. 
I believe I am speaking for the people that I represent not only in Illinois but across the Nation when I talk about the need to have some fairness when it comes to hospitalization insurance premiums and to stop all of the promises that have gone on for more than a decade that we are going to give these people fairness. `Oh, we love small business. Oh, we love the family farmer. We are going to get around to helping you on health insurance matters in the next year 2 years.' Senator Nickles said maybe 10 years from now we are going to get around to it. 
Please. I have been involved in that debate. Senator Dorgan has. Senator Conrad has. This has gone on for more than a decade. 
All of these promises we can deliver on tonight. 
Listen to the arguments. Again, I find it incredible. 
One of my colleagues from Kentucky stands up and says this busts the budget deal. What? There was a provision in the budget deal that I voted for on this floor that limited the tobacco tax to only a 20-cent increase? I missed that provision. I don't think it was in there. If you will read it closely, that wasn't part of the budget deal. 
I might say to my colleagues. This is meddling strange--that you can impose a 20-cent increase in the Finance Committee, and it has no impact on employment in Kentucky or North Carolina, but Durbin wants to put 11 cents on, and all of a sudden we have thousands of people out of work. My goodness. Twenty cents has no impact, and 11 cents more we have tipped the scales, and it is all over for tobacco? Give me a break. Give me a break. 
What we are talking about here is an 11-cent increase on an item which is going to cost you $2, $3, or $4 a pack anyway. 
You know, they talk about it being a regressive tax. Poor people smoke. Yes, they do. Yes, they do. They are correct in saying that. Eighty-five percent of the people smoking today--poor and rich, it is the same thing--`I wish I could quit. I really wish I could quit.' Some of them say, `You know, if the tax gets too high, I might not be able to afford these darned things.' 
So you are talking about helping poor people. You are going to help them quit smoking, and help them live a little longer. That is a real help. 
Again, one of my colleagues said, `Why don't you go around and tax corn? You have corn in Illinois. Why are you taxing tobacco from my State?' 
There is a big difference. The corn in Illinois and the 
corn in Missouri can be used for nutritious purposes. When it comes right down to it, tobacco is neither food nor fiber--neither food nor fiber. 
And let me add this. Tobacco is the only crop regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture which has a body count, the biggest single preventable cause of death each year. Don't stand up and tell me this is another agricultural product, another farm commodity. This is an item which, used according to manufacturers' directions, will kill you. That is what tobacco is all about. It is not another agricultural product. 
So when you talk about imposing a tax on this, we are talking about the health of America and the health of children. Oh, yes, in that low-income group, that regressive tax, that tobacco tax--the low-income group includes a lot of Americans who live on allowances they get from their parents. Those are the low-income Americans, too, kids going and buying tobacco on the corner.

You know it as well as I do. You can't make light of the fact that a product, if used as intended, kills people. You can't make light of the fact that when you follow the manufacturers' directions, you die when you use that product.

Mr. DURBIN. Let me tell you this in closing. 
I have heard a lot of arguments tonight made about the defense of tobacco. I say to my colleagues on both sides, if you are ready to vote for this tax bill, you are already imposing a tax on tobacco of 20 cents. I am saying to you that 11 cents is going to buy a lot of good for America--not only keeping the products out of the hands of kids but finally keeping our promise to small business and family farmers. 
I urge you to look beyond some of the arguments that you have heard tonight, that you have heard over and over again, and think about the bottom line when this is done. Thirty-one cents on a package of tobacco is not going to break the tobacco industry. But it is going to save a lot of small businesses which will have a chance to survive. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I might say to my colleagues in the Senate this amendment seeks to right a wrong. It seeks to provide food stamp coverage for the children of legal immigrants to the United States. The welfare reform bill cut off food stamp protection for children--deserving qualified children--and really relegated over 200,000 children across the United States into a position where they do not have adequate nutrition. 
It does not do our Nation a bit of good to deny these children food at a moment in their lives when it is important to their development. These kids are likely to become American citizens. They are likely to be our neighbors. They are likely to be our future workers. 
Let us resolve that although we are trying to eradicate welfare as we know it, we will not take it out on the kids. The money that is used to pay for the food stamps for the children of these legal immigrants is an offset that comes from the administrative costs sent to the States. This is money that should be dedicated for the better purpose of feeding hungry, deserving children. 
I ask my friends, regardless of your position on welfare reform, to make sure that we are dedicated in America to healthy children, not hungry children. I hope you will consider voting to waive the provisions of the Budget Act and approval of this amendment.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the people of Bloomington-Normal, IL, for their efforts to stem the growth of hate crimes and racial intolerance. Their commitment to taking proactive measures to prevent division and promote understanding serves as a model for communities across the Nation. 
Inspired by the film `Not in Our Town,' which tells the story of how Billings, MT, joined together in response to rampant hate crimes, the citizens of Bloomington-Normal created their own `Not in Our Town' program. They were not, however, responding to hate crimes or clear racial unrest. Instead, these Twin Cities chose to create a vehicle for awareness and prevention, to stop hate crimes before they started. This type of program is without a doubt ahead of its time. 
Designed to increase public knowledge about the threat of racial violence, the program is carried out in a variety of ways. Adult and youth discussions and forums are regularly held. All city entrances are marked with `no racism' signs. Many city workers wear `Not in Our Town' buttons, and all city vehicles are marked with `Not in Our Town' bumper stickers. Clearly, it's difficult to be in Bloomington-Normal without knowing that prejudice and violence will not be accepted. In addition to these efforts, the city has also sponsored two anti-racism marches, which give citizens the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the program and its goals not only to each other, but to surrounding communities as well. 
Perhaps most vital to the program's success are its youth discussion groups. As one teen noted, `History is going to repeat itself if the youth aren't taught about the Holocaust and slavery * * * they won't know any better.' `Not in Our Town' provides young people a way to learn how local events are part of national issues, and more importantly, how community action can really make a difference for people everywhere. 
As President Clinton begins a new initiative to have a national conversation about race and diversity, Bloomington-Normal has truly taken the lead in providing a model that all Americans can follow when organizing their home towns to discuss and confront what is perhaps our most important issue.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our friend and former colleague in this body, Paul Simon, has always been outspoken in his leadership on national issues. He continues to contribute to the national debate as the director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. 
Paul recently gathered together a number of former Senators to consider the issue of Social Security. The group developed a Social Security proposal which they believe will provide a solvent Social Security system for the next 75 years.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I would like to respond to my colleague from Pennsylvania. 
I voted for the welfare reform bill, and I thought it was long overdue. The welfare system in America definitely needs to be changed, reformed, and in many areas just plain abandoned. It was a system which had sustained many families, but it also captured many families and ensnared them in welfare dependency, and we knew it. And that is why on a bipartisan basis we voted for welfare reform. But I do not believe that it is accurate to assess the success of welfare reform strictly on the wisdom of that legislation. 
Fortunately, we live in a time of an expanding economy that is creating jobs, creating opportunities for small businesses, for new housing starts. We are seeing the lowest controlled inflation in a long, long period of time. We are seeing the deficit come into control. And I have to say to my friend, the Republican from Pennsylvania, I don't think you can take any credit for that because, unfortunately, not a single Republican Member of this Senate at the time supported the President's plan for deficit reduction. It passed with all Democratic votes and the vote of the Vice President and passed by a scant margin in the House of Representatives with no Republican support. And because of the President's plan, we have had 5 straight years of deficit reduction and economic expansion, something the other party speaks of a lot but something the Democrats delivered. 
And so when we talk about opportunities to come off welfare, what opportunity would there be if we were in a recession with fewer jobs for people who are searching for that first-time job opportunity. I am afraid very, very few. And I also have to take exception to the idea that this welfare reform was somewhere hammered into marble, Holy Writ, that should not be changed or addressed. The success of a man like Franklin Roosevelt as President of the United States was his recognition that he was not perfect. He would come up with good ideas and he would try to implement them. Some turned out to be wildly successful, like Social Security, others fell on their face. He had at least the good sense to come forward and say there are times when you should abandon a program or change it. The same is true when it comes to welfare reform. 
I might remind my colleague from Pennsylvania that even this year the Republican leadership in the House and Senate acknowledged the shortcomings of our welfare reform bill, particularly when it came to those who are legal immigrants to the United States. That was a very unfair provision, to force people off of disability income because they were here strictly on the basis of being legal immigrants. These are not illegals but legally here in the United States. I offered an amendment today. I tried to correct another failing, as I see it, in the welfare reform bill and it relates to food for children, food stamps for children. These are children of legal immigrants living in the United States who were cut off their food stamps in April of this year. I will tell the Senator from Pennsylvania the decision of this Chamber today I think was the wrong one, to deny food stamps to these children. It is one that we will pay for over and over and over again. A hungry child in this country without appropriate nutrition is a child who is likely to have more medical problems, likely to fall behind in school, 
more likely to become a future welfare or crime statistic. 
I cannot understand why this Congress, like so many businesses, and I guess so many people, cannot look ahead beyond the next budget. We live in a country where the biggest growth industry is the construction of prisons. There are 19 cities in my home State of Illinois competing right now not for a new business but for the latest prison to be built by our State. We have more people under lock and key in America than in any country other than Russia. Why? 
Is it because we are just more violent, more prone to criminal activity? I think it is a much deeper question. It goes to our children, whether or not some of these kids can be rescued, can be saved, can be put on the right path in their lives. It involves a commitment. Yes, I believe in three strikes you're out, but I also believe in taking the necessary action to avoid the first strike. Give a child a chance with prenatal nutrition, with appropriate infant nutrition, with Head Start, with education, with mentoring, the kind of community support that counts. And yet this body I am afraid considers that to be squandering of national assets. We have all the money in the world to build a prison. We do not have all the money in the world to improve our schools. When my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, comes forward with the crumbling schools proposal that says let us make sure the schools our kids attend are safe, that they have appropriate care for the children there, we find out that there are many people particularly on the Republican side of the aisle who say that is something that our Government should not worry about. I disagree. The shiniest new building in many cities across America is a prison; the one that is crumbling down is a school. What message does that send to children, to families and to our Nation? 
When this Senate decided today to defeat my amendment not to send food stamps to these children, I am afraid it is a decision we will pay for for years to come. These kids are likely to become citizens of the United States. They are likely to be our neighbors, kids seeking jobs in the future. We are penny-wise and pound-foolish when we do not provide the basic necessities of life like food and health care and education for children. 
So, yes, I supported welfare reform. I think the economy has sustained the kind of growth which has given welfare reform an opportunity to flourish but, for goodness sakes, why aren't we investing in our children? Why has this become so partisan and so strident that when we stand up with the Levin amendment and talk about more time for vocational education so that kids can get off welfare and go to work, it becomes a partisan vote? The Republicans say no; the Democrats say yes. Nothing happens. For the kid, the young man, the young woman who needs a chance at education, that was an important vote. And this Senate said no. That does not make sense. End welfare but end it responsibly. Make an investment in America's kids, an investment that will pay off for many generations to come.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, simply put, this amendment which I have offered asks that we move toward more equitable tax treatment for the self-employed with respect to the deductibility of their health insurance premiums within this budget process. I believe this issue enjoys wide support among my colleagues in the Senate. 
I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to a letter which has been sent to the Senate Finance Committee signed by over half of the membership of this body. A total of 53 Senators have urged that there be movement in this legislation toward the equitable treatment for the self-employed with respect to the deductibility of health insurance premiums. 
Today, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to helping the self-employed afford health insurance and receive parity with their corporate competitors who can already deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums by passing this amendment. 
Let me say at the outset, the term `self-employed' is a term of art used in the Tax Code but for those who are following the progress of this debate, they may be interested in the people who fall into the category of the self-employed. Those would include, of course, entrepreneurs, small business people, family farmers and the like. It is the fastest growing segment of the American economy. 
More and more people are starting businesses. More and more people aspire to own their own businesses. More and more women are getting involved in entrepreneurial endeavors. So this amendment addresses a problem which exists and one which can only become worse as more people get into self-employment categories and still do not enjoy the same positive tax treatment as corporations and their employees. 
There are over 23 million self-employed in the United States today. Unfortunately, over 5 million of these people have no health insurance. The rate is higher for self-employed people than the rate for salaried and waged workers. On the average, salaried and waged workers have only 16.8 percent of their membership uninsured, as against 25 percent of the self-employed that are uninsured. 
The simple fact of the matter is there is a 50 percent higher likelihood that a person is uninsured--without health insurance--if they are self-employed, as opposed to being a salaried employee. Not only are the self-employed less likely to have health insurance, but those that do pay on the average 30 percent more for their health insurance premiums. They do not have access to group health insurance. They pay some of the highest rates in the Nation. 
For those who follow closely the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which as I understand it is the largest organization of small businesses in America, they might be interested to know that when their membership was surveyed nationwide last year and asked their No. 1 issue for Washington, it was not capital gains; their No. 1 issue was the cost of health insurance. When I traveled across Chicago last year and met many entrepreneurs and small business people, I asked them the challenges they face, and time again they said, it is such a great concern to us and to our families that once having left the protection of a group health insurance plan and having moved into self-employment, into small business, or in many cases to family farms, they found themselves unable to afford health insurance. 
I can recall a telephone call to my congressional office, when I served in the House. A woman called when she heard of my interest in this issue and said, `I want to tell you my family story.' It is one that is repeated many times on farms across America. She said, `I was at home as a farm wife raising our children, raising the family. Then I decided I had to go to work in town.' She said to me, `Congressman'--I was a Congressman--`Congressman, the reason I work is because the salary I earn pays for two things: Day care for my children, which otherwise I would take care of at home, and the premiums for health insurance for our farm family.' That story is repeated many times over, across the United States, where people are struggling to come up with the resources to be able to afford health insurance. 
Currently, the self-employed in America may only take a tax deduction of 40 percent for the cost of health insurance premiums. However, corporations and their employees enjoy a full 100 percent deductibility. This is not fair. 
I once asked some of the older Members of the House who had been around during many, many years of debate on tax bills why this disparity existed, why would we take one group of Americans working for businesses and give them full deductibility of health insurance, and say to self-employed people, you can only deduct 40 percent. I was certain there had to be some rationale behind this dichotomy. I spoke to Sam Gibbons, now retired Congressman from Florida, who served on the House Ways and Means Committee for many years. He said there is no good explanation for it. It came about sometime after World War II when corporations and unions asked for this advantage and it was given to them. The self-employed did not speak out. Health insurance was not a major issue, and as a consequence this dichotomy, this divergence in the deductibility of health insurance became enshrined in law. 
Scheduled increases in current law for the deduction of the self-employed will slowly, slowly increase from the current level to 45 percent by 2002. We are talking about waiting 5 years for it to go up 5 percent more for deductibility, and then even by 2006, almost 10 years from now, under current law the deductibility for self-employment will only be 80 percent--never reaching 100 percent deductibility of a corporation or big business. That is a very long time for self-employed people to wait. 
We should make progress on this issue on increasing deductibility this year within this budget package. Farmers and many other hard-working, self-employed individuals, including many women who recently started small businesses in record numbers, deserve help in this area, sooner rather than later. 
You might take into consideration this fact: Of the 10 million uninsured children in America today, 1.3 million of them live in families where there is at least one parent who is self-employed. These children comprise approximately 13 percent of all uninsured children. So for these families, for the breadwinners who own the small businesses, for the family farmers and for their children, this is a very critical amendment. 
Now, the obvious question to be asked of myself and others who come to the floor with changes in the Tax Code is this: How are you going to pay for it? How will you provide the resources to offset the cost of giving this new deduction to the self-employed? I will tell you, upfront, we raise the tobacco tax, the Federal tobacco tax. 
The current cigarette tax is 24 cents per package. The current tax on smokeless tobacco is about 2.7 cents, for snuff; and 2.3 cents for a pouch of chewing tobacco. This bill increases the cigarette tax by 20 cents per pack to 44 cents. That is the bill that comes out of the Senate Finance Committee. It increases the tax on smokeless tobacco products by the same 83 percent. That will raise the tax to around 5 cents for 
snuff, 4.2 cents for chewing tobacco. 
The amendment I offer to provide the deductibility, full deductibility for health premiums for the self-employed, is paid for by adding about 10 cents to the tax on cigarettes, about 10 cents, a tax--maybe a fraction higher that might be necessary to make certain that it meets this budgetary requirement. Ten cents, 10 pennies for a person buying a package of tobacco. 
What will we buy as a Nation for these 10 pennies? We will buy protection for millions of Americans who today do not have it, health insurance that they can afford, giving them fair treatment under the Tax Code, saying to people who buy tobacco products you will pay a few pennies more for those products. We, as a Nation, will see great benefit coming to many families and many children across America. 
We are waiting for a formal revenue estimate from the Joint Tax Committee. We have been in negotiation with them. We are told that the amount of the tax on a package of cigarettes may be slightly over 10 cents, but we are in this range of between 10 and 11 cents. 
What happens when you raise the price of a package of cigarettes, as this bill does, by 20 cents already? Fewer children buy them. As you make tobacco products more expensive, kids stay away. Now, isn't that a good idea? Don't we all agree that to have 3,000 children start smoking for the first time every day in the United States is a bad idea? Shouldn't we discourage this addiction of our children? I think we all agree on that. I think even the tobacco companies have come to acknowledge that they are a major part of the problem that we have today in addiction to nicotine and tobacco. 
In addition to taking care of a lot of children who are uninsured and a lot of self-employed and their families by increasing the tax on tobacco products slightly, by 10 cents or a few fractions beyond that, we will discourage children from using tobacco products. Is that a critical problem in our country? I think we all know that it is. Teenage smoking in America has risen by nearly 50 percent since 1991. 
I will close with just a few brief remarks about the sales tax and just say to my colleagues it would be foolish, foolish, for us to ignore the reality that tobacco taxes are going to increase. We have asked for a survey of State existing tobacco taxes as of today. What are the taxes in each State imposed by those States and their legislatures on tobacco products? I say to my friends and colleagues if you will take a look here, you will see that more and more State legislatures are dramatically increasing tobacco taxes as a source of revenue. 
For example, let me give you a few. In the State of Hawaii, the State cigarette tax will go from 60 cents to 80 cents in just a few weeks. In the State of Maine, the cigarette tax is going to double from 37 cents to 74 cents by the end of the year. In the State of Alaska, the tax rate on cigarettes and tobacco products will move from 29 cents to $1 dollar by the end of the year. In the State of Utah, from 26 1/2 cents to 51.5 cents. State legislatures understand this is a good source of revenue. The Senate Finance Committee understood that when it added a 20-cent tobacco tax. 
So I ask my colleagues to seriously consider a very minor increase of about 10 cents a pack to tobacco and measure it against what we will win as a Nation. We had this long debate a few years ago about universal health care. I certainly believe in it and subscribe to it. We did not finish that debate with a work product that achieved results. I hope with this amendment, though, we can move forward on the path toward moving more people into the protection of health insurance. The 5 million uninsured self-employed people deserve that type of protection. Those self-employed and their children will benefit greatly from this amendment. 
I know that this may be a tough amendment for the Senate Finance Committee. I have watched the course of this debate over the last couple of days and it is clear that they do not always warm up to suggestions of change. Maybe this time there might be an exception. Maybe with the bipartisan support of some 53 Senators, the members of the Senate Finance Committee, the leadership, might consider this amendment. It is one which would greatly enhance the tax package which they offered. 
I yield back the floor and offer my amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is this all about? Well, you say the word `Medicare' and senior citizens start listening. `Medicare, wait a minute, that is my mother's health insurance protection, it is my grandfather's health insurance. What are they doing to Medicare?' 
Let me tell you for a moment, if you are 65 years old or older, listen with interest; if you are 59 years old or younger, listen to this debate with great interest. It is about you and when you will be able to retire. It is whether or not you will have the protection of health insurance in your old age. 
This is the committee print for the bill we are considering, a very interesting document. There is a provision in here that we are now debating which you might overlook, but it is so important that virtually everyone under the age of 59 years in the United States of America, because of a handful of sentences here, may have to change their plans as to when they are going to retire. That is how important this debate is, that is how important this issue is, because buried in this committee print on page 161 at the bottom of the page is a Texas two-step for America's working families. A Texas two-step--step, step, slide, slide, and guess what? It raises the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67. 
What does that mean? It means if you were counting on retiring at age 65, taking your Social Security, taking your Medicare, guess what? You now have to wait a couple of years, or at least retire without the protection of Medicare. 
Is that important to people? I think it is very important. Do you know how many people now at the age of 65 have health insurance in America? Thirty percent; 70 percent do not. They are people who count on Medicare to protect them. And the Senator from Texas offers an amendment which says, `Oh, you can count on Medicare to protect you, just wait 2 years, wait 2 years, and then we will start protecting you.' 
What if you should retire at age 60, what if your employer says to you, `Oh, take your retirement, we'll give you health insurance protection,' and changes his mind? Have you ever heard that story? I have heard it plenty. People who retired say, `I'm taken care of, the company I work for gave me a watch, they gave me a health insurance plan, this is going to be great, I'm going fishing.' Then what happens? The company is sold two or three times, a couple mergers, a couple cutbacks, and the next thing you know, they are saying, `Sorry we have to send you a letter and tell you the bad news. No more health insurance, Mr. Retiree. Thanks for working for us for 35 years.' And there you sit at age 61 without health insurance. 
What does it cost you? I know what it costs in Chicago because we checked. About $6,000 a year if you are healthy. If you are not healthy and in your sixties, 10,000 bucks a year. Did you count on that when you decided to retire? I don't think so. And if you get stuck in that position, you know what you start doing? You start counting the days to when you will be eligible for Medicare. How many more months before I reach age 65 and Medicare is going to come in and protect me and my family and my savings? You count the days. 
The Senator from Texas, who offers this amendment, wants you to keep counting for 24 months more, wants you to hang on until you are 67. Then he says we should make you eligible for Medicare. 
I think that there is some question as to the statement in the committee print about its voracity. I know we are not supposed to say that, but let me just tell you why I say that. The committee says we are changing Medicare so that it tracks Social Security and, in their words, they say, `The committee provision will establish a consistent national policy on eligibility for both Social Security, old age pension benefits and Medicare.' 
Let us concede the obvious. The age to retire under Social Security in the next century is going to go up from 65 to 67. This is true. It is the basis for this amendment. But it is not the whole story, I say to my friends. The whole story is this. You can draw Social Security at age 62. You won't get as much, but that is your option. `I will take a lower retirement, I'm leaving at 62, that's it.' But you can't do that on Medicare. You can't draw Medicare benefits at age 62. Right now you wait until you are age 65, unless you are disabled, and the Senator from Texas wants you to keep on waiting for 2 more years to the age of 67. I don't think that is an accurate statement when they say they are going to track Social Security. 
They don't track Social Security. 
The Senator argues this gives people time to adjust. He talks about compassion and courage. How much courage does it take to say to a senior citizen who now has developed a serious heart problem, `Keep drawing out of your savings accounts to pay for your health insurance.' 
You know what will be compassionate and courageous, not raising the age to 67. What would be compassionate and courageous is universal health care. To say no matter how old you are, rich or poor, where you live, black or white, regardless of your ethnic background, you are insured in America. You are not going to be stuck in the situation we are creating with this bill, you are not going to be stuck in the position with a terrible medical problem at age 62 and no health insurance, waiting and praying for the day when you are eligible for Medicare. That would be compassion and courage. That would be responsive to the 40 million Americans stuck today without health insurance. 
Let me tell my friends, my opposition to this provision to raise the eligibility age for Medicare comes, of course, from the Democratic side, but I have some interesting allies in this battle. Eighty different corporations have written to the Members of the Senate and said, `Please, do not do this, do not accept Senator Gramm's proposal to raise the eligibility age for Medicare to 67.' Among them, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
What is a Democrat doing arguing the position of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here? I will tell you why. These companies and their associations now offer to their employees health insurance protection until they are eligible for Medicare. That is written in the contract. If you make eligibility for Medicare age 67 instead of 65, these companies have a new liability that has been dumped in their laps by the Texas two-step, and it is a disincentive for any other company to offer this benefit to their employees. They know it costs more, and they don't know what the Senate is likely to do next year when it comes to Medicare eligibility. That is what this battle is all about. 
When I look at the number of people currently covered by health insurance at age 60 and 65 in America, it is clear. Fewer companies are offering protection. More people are on their own. The expense of health insurance when you reach age 60 goes through the roof, even without any kind of medical problem. That is what this debate is all about. 
You want to save Medicare? There are lots of things we need to do on a bipartisan basis. There is a Commission created by this bill to study those ways, to make sure that we do it in a sensible, fair, compassionate way. But instead, my colleague from Texas and his friends on the committee have decided, let's just take a flier, let's throw one of them out there. And the first one they throw out there does not impose any new liability on health care providers, it imposes a new burden on seniors in years to come. 
Those who retire after the year 2003 have to start waiting longer and longer and longer. I say to my friends, I don't think that is what Medicare is all about. Many of the people who proposed this, frankly, don't care much for Medicare. That came out in the last campaign. Some of the candidates stood up and said, `Yeah, I voted against it, and I'd do it again.' I am not one of them. I didn't have the opportunity, the rare 
opportunity, to vote for this program. But I will tell you this, I am going to vote to protect it. I am going to vote to protect it because of what it has meant to my family. Medicare has meant to my family that you can retire not only with the dignity with Social Security, but with the protection of Medicare. 
Parents don't want to be burdens on their children. They want to live independently, enjoy their lives because they played by the rules and they have paid in. To change the rules at this point, to say we are going to raise the retirement age for Medicare really reneges on a promise that was made over 30 years ago. It is the wrong way to go. We can make Medicare solvent in the long term, and we can do it in a sensible way. 
At this point, I yield, for purposes of debate, to my colleague from California, Senator Boxer.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey. 
So it is understood what we are debating, there is a provision in this bill which would raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67. There are those of us who think that is 
unwarranted and are opposing it and there are those, of course, who are defending it. 
It is interesting to me to consider what we are debating here. Five years ago, we debated on Capitol Hill the premise that not enough Americans had health insurance. Forty million Americans uninsured, millions underinsured, what would we do as a nation? Would we rise to the challenge? Would we come to the rescue of these families and individuals? We debated it long and hard, and we failed. 
When it was all said and done, nothing was done. A lot of ridicule and scorn was heaped on the White House and the First Lady and nothing happened. 
So 5 years later, we return to the debate of health insurance coverage, but this time with a different premise. Instead of helping more people receive insurance coverage, we now have in this bill a proposal to take more people off insurance coverage. 
Have we come full circle? Five years later, there is a proposal to increase the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67, and the younger Members of the Senate stand over there and say, `People can prepare for it, people can get used to it, people can save for it.' 
Think of the real-life challenges. Someone I know personally at age 60 retired from management in a company in California with health care benefits and a gold watch. Along came some changes in management, a little downsizing, and guess what? They sent him a letter saying, `Sorry, no more health insurance for you as a retiree from the management of our company.' As he received the letter, he started having heart problems, two different heart surgeries, and this individual who had derided big Government programs overtaking your lives started counting the days until he would be eligible for Medicare, realizing that uninsured and uninsurable, he had no protection. 
What is the proposal in the Finance Committee? Let him hang out for another 24 months, let him count another 24 months and days wondering if he can live long enough to be covered by Medicare. It is shameful. It is shameful that we have not preceded this debate with a discussion about how we will provide more coverage for people across America. 
They want to create a commission in this bill to study the problem, and we should. One of the provisions the commission is supposed to study is whether or not to extend Medicare to those age 62 and beyond. But before the commission comes back and reports, the Finance Committee would say to us, before we know what the fix is for Medicare, let's start with the premise that we are going to raise the retirement age, let's start with the premise that people will pay more out of pocket, and then let's talk about reform of Medicare. 
Excuse me; excuse me. This program was designed to help people in their retirement. It has worked. It is successful. Some of my friends on the other side resent it because it is a Government program that people respect and admire. For them to now have a shot at raising this retirement age to age 67 is unfortunately going to put more people in the lurch. People who have made their plans and want to make them cannot anticipate whether they will be wealthy enough to pay for hospitalization insurance, whether they will be healthy enough to take care of themselves. Instead, we should be providing protection. What we are doing is putting more and more people into jeopardy. I think that is shameless. 
Look at this, too. This comes to us as part of a debate about a tax cut. This was supposed to be a tax cut that families across America would cheer. Which family will cheer the prospect of 2 more years of uninsurability under health insurance? You and I know we value this as much as anything. 
When my young daughter, fresh out of college, got a new job, the first thing her dad asked was, `What about health insurance, Jennifer?' 
`Oh, dad, I have a little bit of this and a little bit of that.' And I worry about it every step of the way. She is a healthy young woman, but think about a situation where you are 60 or 62 and you are not healthy, you don't have insurance, and it costs $10,000 a year out of your pocket. 
The folks in the Finance Committee say this is part of reform, this is responsible, this is compassion, this is courageous. I'm sorry, this is just plain wrong. 
Let us have a national debate to make sure that Medicare is there for decades to come for everyone who needs it. Let us say to the high school classes that are skeptical, yes, you have to sign up to help your parents and grandparents, as your children will sign up to help you. It is part of America. It is part of our responsibility as a family in America. Instead, we have these potshots at Medicare to raise the retirement age to 67 without so much as a suggestion of what it will mean to the American family. This is wrong. We should defeat it. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the motion to waive the budget agreement.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know the hour is late but the subject is very important and in a few moments I would like my colleagues to consider what this amendment would do. During the course of passing the welfare reform bill, we made many changes in many programs in an effort to move people from welfare to work. There were several aspects of that bill--even though I supported the bill in its entirety--there were several aspects of that bill which were troubling, not the least of which was the reduction in nutritional assistance for children in the United States. The purpose of this amendment is to correct what I consider to be a very serious error and a serious problem in this legislation, because with this amendment we will restore food stamps for the children of legal immigrants. 
Keep in mind that I have said legal immigrants. These are children legally in the United States who are in poverty and have been denied the protection and sustenance of the Food Stamp Program. It is a significant problem nationwide. Over 4,000 immigrant children in Illinois have lost their food stamps because of this welfare reform bill; over 283,000 nationwide. According to the Food Research Action Council survey of families living below 185 percent of poverty, hungry children suffer from two to four times as many individual health problems such as frequent colds and headaches, fatigue, unwanted weight loss, inability to concentrate and so on. 
These children--hungry children--are often absent from school. They can have a variety of medical problems arising from nutritional deficiencies, not the least of which is anemia. Hungry children are less likely to interact with other people, explore and learn from their surroundings, and it has a negative impact on the ability of children to learn. We should be focusing on healthy children in America, not hungry children in America. 
This amendment seeks to correct that problem by giving to these children the basic protection of food stamps. 
Just a month or so ago, I visited the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center, a facility which, unfortunately, is doing quite a large business in juvenile crime. I spoke to the psychologist at that center and asked him what traits these kids who committed crime had in common. I would like to focus on one which he said was very common, a learning disability, a neurological deficit. 
I said, `Where does that come from?' 
He said it can come from improper prenatal nutrition, improper infant nutrition. These kids get a bad start, and with that bad start, they don't learn as well, they become frustrated, they fall behind, they become truant, they drop out, they become statistics, crime and welfare statistics which haunt us in this Chamber as we consider all of the ramifications of a child's failed life. 
Many times we overlook the basics. I am happy that my colleagues tonight have addressed children's health. I think that is something that should be a given in America, that we provide basic health care protection to all children. But can we then argue that children should go hungry at the same time? The children that would be protected by this bill would now be qualifying for food stamps. In my State of Illinois, many of the soup kitchens and other food providers have experienced a dramatic increase in demand for services by children since enactment of the welfare reform bill. 
The Reverend Gerald Wise of the First Presbyterian Church in Chicago recently came to tell me that the pantry at the First Presbyterian in the extremely distressed Woodlawn neighborhood and the Pine Avenue United Presbyterian Church in the Austin neighborhood are stretched beyond capacity. 
Fifty-two percent of the cities participating in the U.S. Conference of Mayors' 1995 survey reported emergency food assistance facilities were unable to provide necessary resources, and that is before the welfare reform bill. 
This amendment, which I have been joined in offering by Senator Wellstone and Senator Boxer, restores food stamp benefits to legal immigrant families with children 18 years and under. According to the CBO, it would cost the Treasury $750 million over 5 years. 
We have established an offset in this bill from the administrative moneys being given to the Governors so that they can administer the new welfare reform bill, food stamps and other programs. Our amendment tries to ensure that Federal dollars are being used efficiently to make sure that direct benefits are given to needy children. 
I am going to stop at this point, as I know some of my colleagues are waiting to offer an amendment and others have been here a long time. I hope tomorrow when this amendment comes to the floor that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join in a bipartisan spirit to help the children of legal immigrants. These children are likely to become naturalized citizens in America. We want them to be healthy, productive citizens, good students making this a better nation in which to live. If we are pennywise and pound foolish and cut these children short when it comes to one of the basic necessities of life, food itself, we may end up paying the price for decades and generations to come. 
Let us do the right thing, the compassionate thing, yes, the American thing. Let us make sure that hungry children are provided for. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset I want to acknowledge the leadership role that has been played by my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, who preceded me on the floor. He is calling on us as Members of the Senate and the House to face the reality that entitlement programs need reform. Senator Kerrey has oftentimes been a lonely voice in that effort. It is not altogether a popular position to take and yet it is necessary. I admire him for his leadership and his candor, and I think that we in the Senate should heed his advice that we must resolve ourselves into the business of addressing the needs of these entitlement programs--Social Security and Medicare in particular--on a long-term basis. 
What I am about to speak to today in no way should reflect on Senator Kerrey's effort or the effort of others for meaningful reform with Medicare. But the issue which I address is one included in this reconciliation bill which I feel is fundamentally wrong and fundamentally unfair. It is a provision which is included in this bill which would over a period of time raise the eligible age for Medicare. 
By way of background, many years ago we raised the eligibility age for Social Security. The reason the people still think in terms of Social Security eligibility at age 65 is that this change to age 67 will be implemented during a transition period from the years 2003 to 2027. It is a gradual change adding, over 24 years, 24 months before a person can be eligible for Social Security. During the course of its deliberations, the Senate Finance Committee entertained a motion by my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, to add an amendment which would increase the eligible age for Medicare from 65 to 67. It is said in the report of the Finance Committee--and I am sure this reflects the nature of the debate--that an attempt was being made to find some symmetry between the increase in eligibility age for Social Security and the increase in eligible for Medicare. If there is any parallel or any symmetry between these two programs it is only that they both serve elderly Americans, and there it ends. I think we should view this suggestion of raising the eligible age for Medicare from 65 to 67 in the context of the people who are affected. 
This package that raises that age to 67 for Medicare literally reneges on our promise to provide Medicare to seniors at the age of 65. There is no budgetary impact in this provision. There is no money to be saved, because whatever is going to be saved, if it is ever implemented, will not occur until the next century, far beyond the 5 years when we measure the impact of this bill. 
This change does not parallel the Social Security change which I described. Individuals have the ability now to begin their Social Security benefits at age 62. Of course, those benefits are diminished, but should a person reach that point in life and say, `I'm ready to retire. I do not want to wait until 65. I have talked it over with my spouse. I'm going to retire at age 62.' It is perfectly legal. They can do it. The Social Security benefits start flowing to their family based on what they have paid in. 
There is no corresponding option for Medicare. Medicare begins at 65. Unless you are disabled and thereby qualify for Medicare, you cannot touch this program until you are age 65. 
Currently, 1.6 trillion individuals in America between the ages of 55 and 65 are uninsured. How do people find themselves in this predicament? Well, I bet you everyone listening, those viewing, can probably think of someone in their family or a friend who reached that situation. I have a situation in my own family, a person who had worked for years and years for a major company and decided he would retire at age 60 and the company said, `Well, here is your watch. Here is your package of benefits. Good luck in your retirement.' Within 12 months they notified him there had been a change in the program, and no longer would they offer health insurance to him as a retiree. His recourse? None, zero, no place to turn. Age 60, retired, out of work, no health insurance. Then the trouble began for him personally, heart problems, leading to serious heart surgery. He literally put his life savings into his medical care and counted the days until he reached the age of 65. He had been critical of a lot of `big government' and big government programs, but now a big government program was coming to his rescue and his family's rescue. He finally made it and reached age 65 and reached eligibility. 
Is this an isolated case of one person who did not have good luck when he retired? I am afraid not. A 1997 Commonwealth Fund study indicates in 1994 only 30 percent of retirees had health insurance from a previous employer, compared with 44 percent in 1988. The trend, unfortunately, is in the 
direction of uninsured people at the age of 60 and beyond. Even coverage by larger employers has declined. In 1993, 71 percent of large employers provided coverage. But then again by 1996, this figure had dropped to 63 percent. Many retirees, incidentally, do not retire voluntarily and may not have much chance of future employment. Private insurance for this group of seniors is very expensive. 
In my home State of Illinois, I checked in the city of Chicago, and the average cost of health insurance for a healthy male age 60 to 64 is $6,520--healthy male. What if they had a preexisting condition, a serious medical condition? The cost goes up over $10,000 a year. You are retired, you are going fishing, you are taking it easy, all of a sudden, no health insurance. Where do you turn? You just had a diagnosis that says you have a medical problem--$10,000 a year and you wait, counting the days until you are eligible for Medicare. 
This bill does not help seniors. This bill does not help retirees. This bill does not help working families, and this provision is totally unfair. If we lived in a country where everyone had health insurance, universal health coverage and you did not have to worry about whether you lost it through changing a job or retirement, that is one thing, but we do not live in that nation. We live in a country where any one of us with the loss of a job could be vulnerable to no health insurance coverage, and the suggestion of the majority that we raise the eligibility age for Medicare leaves more people vulnerable--vulnerable, of course, to the cost of health insurance if they can buy it. 
That is why I oppose this provision and why I will make a point of order when I have concluded these remarks. I yield for debate only to my colleague, Senator Reed.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his remarks. I want to really follow up on one of his last points. I say to Senator Reed, I have in my hand a letter signed by some 80 businesses and business organizations objecting to the increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. These are not just a few odds and ends when it comes to the business profile of America. We not only have a letter signed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but also the National Association of Manufacturers, companies like ARCO and Bell Atlantic, Chrysler Corp., Ford, General Motors, and the list goes on and on. Making the point my colleague from Rhode Island made, they have already made a commitment to their employees and it is this: We will protect you with health insurance as a member of our family, our corporate family, after retirement until you are eligible for Medicare. Now, if we raise the Medicare eligibility 2 years, these companies having made that commitment have a new liability that they had not anticipated. It is not only a cost but a disincentive to these and other companies to make that kind of promise. That is the real world. For people to see the simple symmetry between Social Security and Medicare--oh, it is going to 67 by the year 2027 on Social Security, and let's go to 67 for eligibility on Medicare--is to overlook the real world that people live in. The employees who are faced with troubling medical conditions late in their lives who may not have health insurance coverage, who cannot afford to buy it at that point in their lives, where are they? Who speaks for them in this Chamber? Who will stand up and say that these people deserve protection and coverage? Well, we have it today--at least beginning at age 65. 
I hope that, in the name of balancing the budget and having some budget impact in the next century, we will not throw away a basic commitment to those in our country who have worked so long and so hard. I will be making a point of order at this point in the debate, unless others would like to speak.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague. Senator Barbara Boxer of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa could not be here for this debate, but they wanted to have their names joined in support of our effort. 
In conclusion, I will say that my colleague from Rhode Island brings home the conclusion to this debate; that is, if we shirk our responsibilities to these working families, if we walk away from a Medicare promise of over three decades, we will end up with people in unfortunate circumstances, many of them sick, presenting themselves for care without any health insurance, without Medicare. Of course, most hospitals and most health care providers in this country will do their best to treat them anyway. Then the cost of that care will be borne by everyone, borne by those who pay into insurance and those Government programs that insure, as well. Unfortunately, people wait until they are in acute and critical conditions before they come to a hospital under those circumstances. Then the care is more costly, and many times they sacrifice their health and their lives. In the name of balancing the budget, let us not include a provision raising the eligibility for Medicare that creates such a disadvantage and such pain and suffering for so many working families across America. This is not an idea whose time has come. This is an idea that should be shelved until our commission working on the future of Medicare can come up with sensible suggestions that really reflect the reality of the world that many seniors face today. 
Mr. President, at this point, I understand that before I make my point of order I must ask that all pending amendments be laid aside. I make that request.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, as a cosponsor of this important amendment. I think anyone who had attended our hearing within the last 2 weeks on this issue would have been shocked at what they learned. We have expanded opportunities for the purchase of some of the most valuable technology in the world. It is technology developed in the United States, which has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and we are selling it. The fact that we are selling it is nothing new. The United States has done that for years. But this technology is so important and sensitive that the people who buy it automatically acquire a capacity, a capability that they have never had in their history. In other words, our expertise, our knowledge, our technological skill is being sold. 
What makes this particularly important is that this very technology has the capacity to give to the purchasing country the skills and abilities that they have never had before to develop things that are very positive, on one hand, but also potentially very negative. I was reminded of a quotation that is attributed to Mr. Lenin in the early days of his establishment of the Soviet republics. He said that it was his belief that `a capitalist would sell you the rope that you would use to hang him.' I thought about that over and over, as we discussed this question of selling these computers to countries like China and Russia, which have the capacity to allow them to develop extraordinary military capability. 
Recent news accounts about sales of supercomputers to Russian nuclear weapons labs and the Chinese Academy of Sciences--in apparent circumvention of United States export control regulations--have raised troubling questions about the control that the United States exercises over supercomputer exports. 
China has purchased at least 46 United States supercomputers. Of these, 32 are one particular model that is faster than two-thirds of the classified computer systems available to our own Department of Defense, including the United States Naval Underwater Weapons Center, United States Army TACOM, and United States Air Force/National Test Facility. 
The Commerce Department and the Justice Department are investigating the unlicensed sale--unlicensed sale--of four over-2000 MTOPS computers to the Russian nuclear weapons facility Chelyabinsk-70. 
The computers recently sold are 10 times more powerful than anything Russia ever had before, and we sold it to them. 
There is ample room for mistakes and confusion in the current dual-use export control system for supercomputers. 
According to a New York Times article on February 25 of this year, in an effort to circumvent United States export controls, Russia's nuclear weapons establishment obtained a powerful IBM supercomputer through a European middleman and said they planned to use it to simulate nuclear tests. 
I was on this floor 2 weeks ago giving a speech about a test ban, recalling the speech given by President Kennedy before American University in 1963. I came to the floor with Senator Harkin and said it is time for us to have a comprehensive nuclear test ban, moving toward the day when there are no nuclear weapons threatening this world. In the world we live in today, you don't need to detonate a nuclear weapon. If you have a supercomputer, which can simulate that detonation, you can derive the same information--or a lot of it--through this model and through this technology. These are the very same computers and capabilities that we are selling. 
The Nation's export controls for supercomputers `amount to a 
kind of honor system,' according to one U.S. official quoted in the Wall Street Journal. Companies that have doubt about a customer's activities are expected to call the U.S. Government for advice. 
Think about that. You have a computer company and you have a sale worth millions of dollars and you don't know whether it is going to be used for a peaceful purpose or a military purpose. Well, the honor system says it is time to call the Department of Commerce and check it out and see if they have any records or classified information. They may not share the information with you, but they may tell you there is some concern. But it is an honor system. There is nothing built into the law to guarantee this kind of surveillance, this kind of supervision. 
Companies may fail to obtain licenses to sell supercomputers ordered for civilian purposes, such as weather forecasting or air pollution studies or natural resources prospecting and development, but these computers end up in places which do design work for nuclear weapons programs--not a civilian use. Companies may knowingly ignore licensing requirements or, alternatively, companies may unwittingly fail to recognize a suspect end-user. 
The first step toward better export controls is better communication. Increased accountability and interaction between industry and the Federal Government called for by this amendment will help facilitate that interchange. 
Even William Reinsch, the Undersecretary for Export Administration for the Commerce Department, quoted by Senator Cochran with whom I share the sponsorship of this amendment, testified at the Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing last week, agreed that better communication is essential. He invited and encouraged companies to consult with the Commerce Department when faced with challenging sales decisions. 
The current system for supercomputer exports involves controls on high-power computer exports set forth in Federal regulations that divide the countries of the world into various categories, or tiers. 
The licensing policies vary depending on which category the country falls into. There are countries for which no export license is required--tier 1--some countries for which licenses are required for extraordinarily high performance machines--tier 2--some for which licenses are required, depending on whether the end-use is military rather than civilian--tier 3--and countries for which sales are totally banned--tier 4. 
The tier 3 countries include India, Pakistan, all of the Middle East/Maghreb, the former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and the rest of Eastern Europe. 
Under current rules, export licenses are required to export or re-export computers with a composite theoretical performance, known as CTP, greater than 2000 MTOPS to military end-users and end-uses and to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile end-users and end-uses in tier 3 countries. 
However, for civilian end-users or end-uses that don't fall into a military or proliferation category, licenses are not required for export or re-export of computers under 7000 MTOPS to these countries. 
What this means is that for many sales, no Government oversight or decisionmaking takes place at the front end if the exporter determines that he is selling to a company that portrays itself as a civilian user because no license is required. 
Because of the differences in the licensing rules that apply to exports for military and proliferation uses than those governing sales for civilian use, the U.S. Government plays no upfront role in determining whether the end-use of a supercomputer under 7000 MTOPS sold to a buyer in a tier 3 country is indeed to be used for a civilian purpose. 
I know this is involved, I know that it is complicated. Let me try to cut to the bottom line. If a company in the United States seeks to sell a supercomputer, one of great capacity, and the end-user, the company that is buying in another country, says this is strictly for a civilian purpose, it is not going to be used 
for anything of a military capacity, there are virtually no controls on that sale; nor is there much of anything done to track that sale, once it is made, as to where that computer actually ends up. 
The responsibility is all on the shoulders of the manufacturer or exporter to make the determination on whether or not a license is needed, whether or not the computer might be used for military purposes. Exporters run the risk of relying on assurances of the purchasers or their own intelligence information about end-use, rather than the resources of the Government. Either intentionally or inadvertently, exporters have made sales to destinations for which a license should have been obtained, because of end-use, but was not. 
The Cochran-Durbin amendment would require that all U.S. exports of supercomputers above 2,000 million theoretical operations per second--a measure of the computer's speed--to a tier 3 country be licensed by the Commerce Department. 
The presently more lenient requirements for civilian end-use sales in this category would be made identical to stricter ones applicable to sales for military proliferation purposes. 
The amendment would shift responsibility from industry to the Government for deciding the propriety and conditions of the sales. 
By subjecting all such sales above 2,000 MTOPS to licensing requirements, the United States may be able to prevent the uncontrolled flow of technology for unauthorized use or diversion to purchasers in countries who may have vastly different interests than those of the United States. 
Civilian sales of supercomputers above 2,000 MTOPS to purchasers in tier 3 countries would be reviewed and approved by the Commerce Department, using the same standards used in licensing military and proliferation sales to these countries. 
In addition, the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact legislation requiring that any computer exceeding 2,000 MTOPS exported to a tier 1 or tier 2 country shall only be reexported to a tier 3 country, or reexported by a tier 3 country to another tier 3 country, pursuant to an export license approved by the Secretary of Commerce. 
We are trying to track these computers, once sold, and determine where they are going to end up. We are saying to those countries, whom we consider to be our allies and friends, that we are going to ask you to bear responsibility for the end-use of the computer. We don't want you to be a conduit for the sale of a computer to a country where the United States suspects it may be used for military purposes. 
The sense of the Senate would call for legislation that would require any reexport to a tier 3 country would have to be done under U.S. export license. This amendment is clearly necessary. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Cochran and myself. If you had listened to the testimony, as we did, you would have discovered, as I did, that there has been a dramatic increase in technology and expertise in this field. It is estimated that every 9 months to a year most of the computers that we are talking about become obsolete and move on to higher standards. 
The United States is where these computers are made and the country from which they are sold. As we are concerned about the proliferation of those items that can be used for the construction of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, we should also be concerned about the potential that we are selling technology that can also be used for proliferation of military weaponry. If we are truly seeking a peaceful world--and we are--the United States should take care not to sell that technology which allows another country to develop weapons of destruction. 
I think the Cochran-Durbin amendment strikes an appropriate balance. It brings our Government into the decision process. It protects those exporters in the United States who truly are trying to do the right thing and sell for civilian use. But it gives them a backup, and it leaves some assurance that will be another party investigating when it comes to sales of a suspect nature. 
This amendment is an important step toward addressing some of the growing concerns about U.S. export control policies governing sales of dual-use technology and whether those policies may be permitting access to sophisticated American technology to aid in the buildup of nuclear weapons capability of other countries. 
Recall the words of Mr. Lenin: `A capitalist will sell you the rope that you will use to hang him.' 
Let's not have that occur. Not in the name of free trade and good commerce should we forget our responsibility to national and world security. I believe the Cochran-Durbin amendment is a sensible and responsible way to bring some order to what is becoming a very chaotic situation. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Cochran and me in support of this amendment. 
I yield the remainder of my time.  
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dorgan on this issue. There is not a more important topic on Capitol Hill. During the last several weeks we were embarrassed by a debate on the disaster bill. I am afraid that we are going to be embarrassed again by a tax bill that will be disastrous to working families. Senator Dorgan pointed it out. 
Why in the world would we be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, and ignoring folks struggling to get by every day; trying to pay the bills, trying to pay for their day care costs, trying to save a little money for their children, trying to make sure they make the mortgage payment and maybe have enough left over for the utility bills? Why isn't this tax bill helping these families? 
Folks making $100,000, $200,000, or $300,000 are the winners in this tax bill. But the folks struggling to get by? The husband and wife both working two jobs are the ones who don't get a break. Why are we doing this? Because there is a clear difference in values between the people who are arguing this bill. 
For goodness sakes. I believe, as Senator Dorgan has said, that we should be helping working families at this point in our history. Give those folks a break, and make sure that the families which are being nailed with payroll taxes get a chance to make a living and realize the American dream. And give their kids a chance. But to say that we are going to focus the help in this bill on those who are struggling--get this now, struggling-- with the concept of, `How will I pay my capital gains on the stock that has appreciated so dramatically?' Are those the folks that you would loose sleep at night over and the ones that we should have some sort of tinge of sadness in 
our heart for? I don't see it. 
When I think of this tax bill I think of working families trying to hang on to a job, and struggling to get by. 
Take a look at what this does. This really tells the story, unfortunately, about what this is all about. Think about this. The lower 60 percent of wage earners in America--the lower 60 percent--under the bill being proposed by the Senate Republicans get 12 percent of the tax cuts; 12 percent. More than 87 percent goes to those in the upper-income categories. 
The amount of money involved in this is dramatic. If you make over $400,000 a year, we are going to give you a $7,000 tax cut. We want to take care of you. We are afraid you are struggling at $400,000 a year. But if you happen to be making $50,000 a year, I am afraid to tell you that the benefit is going to be about 52 bucks; a buck a week. 
What a heart this Senate has for working families. 
Let's hope that the people who are writing this bill wake up to the reality that we have to do more than just meet the target of cutting $130 million when it comes to tax cuts. We have to be cutting it in the right way so that working families have a fighting chance. 
Let's make sure that when this debate is over that we don't have another disaster bill--a bill disastrous for working families. 
The final point I want to make on this is when you take a look at these tax cuts, don't measure them against just this year, or next year, or even 5 years, but against what they will do down the line. 
The people bringing this bill are very crafty. They start the tax cuts now. They don't look like much. And, all of a sudden, they start mushrooming--it may be a poison mushroom--when you look at the outyears. We have a dramatically costly bill associated with these tax cuts. 
So in the future Members of Congress--the House and the Senate--are going to struggle to balance the budget because of bad decisions and bad policy today. That makes no sense. 
I urge my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and all of my colleagues in the Senate to think about the working families in this country for a change. For goodness sakes, let's have a tax cut bill that is designed to help them. These are families who, with a tax cut, will turn around and make purchases--who will purchase a new washer and dryer, who will purchase a new home, who will purchase a new car--creating jobs and creating opportunities. 
That is what this is all about. 
I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for requesting the floor at this propitious moment in the debate on this bill. I hope that our message will be delivered through the people of this country, and to all of our colleagues.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, and I would like to take the floor for 10 minutes to address an issue of great importance, one that is appropriate to consider as we debate the foreign affairs bill, because this is an issue, to us, of worldwide significance. 
Is there a spot in the world so removed, so distant, so isolated that if you would go there today and say that you were from Chicago, that the people living in this far corner of the world would not immediately respond: `The home of the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan?' I don't think there is a spot in the world where you could find people who are not aware of what happened in the great City of Chicago--for in 5 of the last 7 years, our Chicago Bulls have won the championship of the National Basketball Association. 
We believe, quite modestly, that Chicago has become the world's capital of basketball--of course, our chief of State none other than Michael Jordan. Those who watched the NBA finals, particularly that fifth game, will never forget the contribution made by this great athlete. Obviously suffering from some illness--flu or worse--he managed to muster the strength and courage to lead the Bulls to an important, absolutely critical victory. How many times we saw him running down that court, wondering if he could get from one end to the other, only to perform spectacularly when given the ball. That has been his hallmark, but not just as an athlete, but as a person. He is truly a good person. Unfortunately, in the game of sports, you can't say that about all of the champions. You can certainly say it about Michael Jordan. 
Of course, the chief of intelligence in this world capital of basketball is none other than Coach Phil Jackson. Michael Jordan and Coach Jackson have a rare relationship, and Michael Jordan has made it clear that when he plays basketball, it will be with Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson, along with Jerry Reinsdorf as the owner, and others, can take pride in what the Bulls have brought to professional sports and basketball. 
The Bulls' record of 171 victories and 30 losses over the last two seasons has set a new standard of excellence. Michael Jordan, in the last five full seasons, has earned five championship rings and five MVP awards in the playoffs. The numbers speak for themselves. 
You could go through the list of Chicago Bulls and find the greatness and sportsmanship and the kinds of leadership we in Chicago are so proud of. I would be remiss to not mention the contributions of Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley, and so many others who are part of this great team, and Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the last game made the difference. He had had a tough time up to that moment, but when he was given the ball, he was there. 
Yesterday, there was a big celebration in Chicago. The Sun came out for a few minutes. People gathered for a great rally. I thought the comment made by Michael Jordan was especially appropriate. He said yesterday: 
This championship goes out to all the working people here in the City of Chicago, who go out every day and bust their butts to make a living. 
Well, Michael Jordan reminded us that so many of us who take pleasure in watching professional sports can identify with all of the effort made on the court and on the field. There are no two stronger fans of the Chicago Bulls on the floor of the U.S. Senate than myself and my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. We want to salute the Bulls. We are proud of them. We are proud of the city of Chicago, the city that works. We are looking forward to making it a six pack next year under the leadership of Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, and Scottie Pippen. 
I yield to my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in closing, there are 102 counties in Illinois, and of the 12 or 13 million people in the State, most are Bulls fans. There is one exception. Hamilton County, in southern Illinois, had a banner on its courthouse which said `go Jazz go.' Why would this one county in the entire State be rooting for the Utah Jazz? Because Jerry Sloan, the coach of the Jazz, came from McLeansboro, IL. He played for the Bulls, and we think he learned a lot in that process. 
I join my colleague in saluting the Jazz. What a fine team. They really put up great competition. There were those in Chicago who said, `We are going to win this easily.' Many of us had second thoughts. We knew the Jazz was a talented, dedicated team, and they played very well. I salute Karl Malone and John Stockton, as well as Coach Sloan, and our colleagues, Senators Hatch and Bennett, the best fans the Utah Jazz ever had. `Wait until next year,' they will say, and that is what we say to. Wait until next year for a six pack from the Chicago Bulls.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the outset, let me say this is a serious matter and one in which I heartily concur with Senators Leahy and Hagel over the issue before us. In the recorded history of humankind, there were many instances of conflict leading to wars of devastation and great loss. Most people believe those wars come to an end, and with the end of the war there is at least some finality and some peace. Those who have been injured, of course, carry those scars for a lifetime. Those who lost their lives are remembered. Those who served look back with sometimes horror, sometimes fondness, to the experience. 
We in the United States think at the end of the great wars, and after the tickertape parades, the finality is finally evidenced by something as significant as a memorial. But what we are speaking of today is a legacy of war that does not end. After the decisions are made, the foreign policy decisions which go awry and lead to a war or a conflict, those decisions end up creating situations which live on forever. In this case, we are dealing with a specific challenge and a specific issue of landmines. 
In a visit to Central America about 7 years ago, I went to Costa Rica, to a clinic which was being sustained by contributions from the United States. It was an orthopedic clinic where, primarily children, but adults as well, were brought in to be fitted for orthopedic devices. These are young men, children, young women who walked the streets and the dusty roads in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, and innocently stepped on a landmine and lost one of their limbs. 
These were not combatants or soldiers, these were ordinary people. The wars were over. Yet, for them, the war continued. Each and every day they faced hostilities, hidden hostilities in these landmines. We rallied, in the United States, as we do so often, to provide medical assistance, as we should. 
The decisions of foreign policy that led to those conflicts meant nothing to these people, nothing whatsoever. The important thing is that they had been maimed and had lost a limb because of that war and because of its legacy. Many of us think of someone losing a leg or a foot and, of course, in the United States, assume they will go through rehabilitation, they will be fitted with some type of orthopedic device, and life will go on. But in a developing country, a poor country, that kind of injury can be devastating for a lifetime. People who once had great potential can find themselves at that point relegated to impoverishment, relegated to always being a `cripple.' We take for granted that they will receive help, and many times they do not. 
There are now 110 million landmines in 64 countries around the world. The conflicts which led to the planting of those landmines may have been long forgotten, but they still sit there, waiting for an innocent civilian or passerby to come through and become a victim. The Leahy-Hagel proposal is a good one, to put an end to this devastation and an end to this legacy of war.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution involving a very sad situation. This amendment expresses the sense-of-the-Senate that the Government of Peru should respect the rights of prisoners to timely legal procedures, including the rights of all United States citizens currently being held in prison in Peru. 
This amendment was included in the State Department authorization bill that has been enacted by the House of Representatives. It was offered in that Chamber by my colleague from Illinois, Congressman Tom Ewing. It was accepted as part of the chairman's en bloc amendment. 
The purpose of this amendment is to encourage the Government of Peru to bring to trial two young Americans who have been held in prison in Peru for more than 7 months without being formally charged or brought to trial. These two young Americans have received a lot of publicity in the United States. One from the State of Illinois, Jennifer Davis, and another, Krista Barnes of California, have admitted their guilt to a serious crime. They were arrested in Peru when they were 19- and 20-year-olds, respectively, after being recruited by drug smugglers in attempting to carry powdered cocaine out of Peru. 
These two teenagers made a tragic mistake. They are prepared to accept the legal penalties for their actions. And it will be a harsh penalty. They and their parents are only asking that they be brought to trial by Peruvian authorities and convicted so that they can be extradited to the United States to serve their sentences. 
The physical conditions under which Jennifer and Krista are being held are in violation of the basic spirit and letter of international human rights agreements, to which Peru is a signatory. I have spoken to their parents. The prison where they are being held is extremely overcrowded. Basic health care is not provided. Nourishment is inadequate. There is sexual and other violence taking place. The shared bathroom facilities have no running water and are extremely filthy, and disease is rampant. 
The amendment specifically states that any individual engaged in the export of illicit drugs and convicted in a court of law should face stiff penalties. But the amendment also states that individuals engaging in the export of illicit drugs should have the right to a timely trial. 
I know this is an important matter to many families in Illinois who are friends of Jennifer Davis. They understand the serious mistake she has made. They understand that she will pay a price for it that she will never, ever forget. All they are asking for is humane treatment, that she be brought to trial and, if convicted, we can then apply for extradition to the United States. 
What we are asking of Peru is nothing new. The government of that country has already signed international agreements saying that they will treat all prisoners in a humane way, and that they will bring prisoners to trial. So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in the approval of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution as an amendment to the Foreign Affairs bill which is presently under consideration. 
At this point, I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I hope in designating this amendment, it will designate as my cosponsor Senator Gorton of Washington. He and I are cosponsoring similar amendments, and I think he will be on the floor momentarily to discuss his amendment, but I would like to discuss this amendment directly. 
This amendment designates Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania as eligible to receive assistance to prepare for future NATO membership. 
This amendment does not require that any nation be invited to join NATO. It simply makes Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania eligible to receive assistance to prepare for NATO membership in the future. A similar amendment was in the House-passed version of the State Department authorization bill. 
I say to my colleagues, this last February, I visited Lithuania, the homeland of my mother, for my fourth visit. I found, much to my amazement, that no matter where I traveled in this small country, no matter what official I sat down to meet with, people had on their mind one thing and one thing only: NATO membership. 
The Baltic States, particularly Lithuania and Latvia, believe that NATO membership is crucial to their survival. They are surrounded, in many instances, by questionable circumstances, Russian troops and a lot of question marks that leave them uncertain about their future. 
I said to them at that point that when I returned to the Senate, I would do everything in my power to inform and educate my colleagues about this deep, heartfelt feeling in the Baltics, that their membership in NATO is where they want to be in this next century, looking to the West, looking to democracy, being part of our security alliance which was so crucial for half a century in Western Europe. 
This amendment is consistent with current laws and programs to assist the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to prepare for future NATO membership. It includes, obviously, the Baltics States and Romania. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 authorized the President to establish a program to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to prepare for future NATO membership. The NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 designated Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia to receive assistance to prepare for future NATO membership, and the act directed the President to designate additional democracies in Central and Eastern Europe if they met certain criteria. 
It is clearly in the interest of the United States to support democracy, free-market reform and security in the Baltics and Romania. There is no better way to do this than to help them prepare for NATO membership. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Romania are doing everything asked of them--and more--to prepare for future NATO membership. They should be designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996. 
Examples of how the Baltics and Romania are meeting the criteria established by this act for assistance to prepare for NATO membership: 
They have made courageous choices and painful sacrifices to reestablish their freedom and rebuild their democracies and free-market economies. It is hard to imagine, the Baltic States and other Eastern European countries, once members of the Warsaw Pact, which were subjugated to Soviet rule for 50 years, this blanket of Soviet hegemony virtually snuffed out the initiative, creativity and energy of these great nations, but they survived. And not just survived, they came out of it determined to rebuild, rebuild with a face to the West. 
All of these nations have applied for NATO membership. 
They have made significant progress toward establishing civilian control of their militaries, police and intelligence services. 
They are adhering to the rule of law. 
They are respecting the values and interests shared by other NATO members. 
They are accepting the obligations, responsibilities and costs of NATO membership. 
Their parliaments are making financial commitments, many times at great sacrifice, to prepare for NATO membership, significantly increasing their support for national defense and Partnership for Peace activities. 
My vision, and I hope one shared by my colleagues, is that an enlarged NATO will put Europe in a position to deal with its own problems in a better fashion. We are now deeply committed in Bosnia, as we should be, to bring peace to that region. But if there were a strong NATO encompassing so many more countries in Europe, I think we can envision a day when that sort of a dispute and that sort of a problem will be dealt with primarily, if not exclusively, by NATO members in European States. 
This suggestion of enlarging NATO eligibility is a step on a path that could lead us to that favorable conclusion. 
These countries have demonstrated they are fully committed to sharing the responsibilities of NATO membership. 
They are building their defense forces in accordance with NATO planning standards. 
They are improving their communication and information systems, command and control, and English training. 
They are active participants in the Partnership for Peace Program. 
They have participated in joint exercises, training programs, and peacekeeping operations led by NATO and the United States. 
It was, I guess, incredible to me to consider that a tiny country like Lithuania would send a small group to IFOR in Bosnia to participate in peacekeeping. Tragically, one of the Lithuanian soldiers was one of the early casualties because of the detonation of a mine. The Lithuanian Parliament might, at that point, have had a vigorous debate and decided they made a mistake, that they were not ready to get involved. They decided just the opposite. Even having lost a Lithuanian soldier in a joint effort with the United States and other NATO countries to bring peace to Bosnia, the Lithuanian Parliament voted overwhelmingly to commit even more troops in their peacekeeping effort to demonstrate to Europe, to the world, and all the NATO members they are serious about making this kind of a participation a reality. 
I learned last week from the Prime Minister of Latvia that the same type of commitment was made. They have participated in NATO's peacekeeping mission. They have increased their troop commitments, and it is clear that they are sincere. They are strategically significant to an effective NATO defense, and they are likely to be in a position to further the membership of NATO and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area in the near future. 
I have nothing further on this amendment. I defer to the chairman or minority spokesman as to whether they would like to consider the amendment at this point or wait for Senator Gorton to come to the floor with his companion amendment.

The idea of NATO expansion, the idea of involving former Soviet clients, allies and republics into a new peace-seeking alliance is an idea whose time has come.

Mr. DURBIN. I am a cosponsor of the Senator's amendment. I spoke to this issue before his arrival on the floor, and I will not belabor the point. I will say, for colleagues who are wondering what role the smaller states play, Senator Gorton and I coauthored two amendments. My amendment asks that the Baltic States and Romania be considered in terms of funds for preparation to be part of NATO. The amendment then, coauthored by the Senator and myself and presently pending before the Senate, says--and I think this is important--`upon satisfying the criteria for NATO membership, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to become full members . . .' So it is a two-step process. 
I think both amendments are consistent, coauthored by the same two Senators, because we believe that given the funds, given the opportunity, the Baltic States, Romania, and perhaps Bulgaria added by amendment, could certainly then apply as eligible for membership. 
I join with my colleague from Washington in saying that at this moment I hope the United States will lead the way in saying that the Baltic States, subjugated to Soviet tyranny for half a century, would have that moment they are praying for, full membership in NATO. 
I thank the Senator for yielding and including me in this important amendment.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of CNA Insurance Co., whose headquarters are located in the city of Chicago in my home State of Illinois. 
CNA is one of the Nation's largest insurance companies. It employs over 20,000 people nationwide, 6,000 of whom live and work in Illinois. It has offices in more than 100 cities and is represented by nearly 80,000 independent insurance agents across the country. 
CNA has always prided itself on being an innovator in the insurance industry. When women began to enter the work force in the early 1900's, CNA was among the first to offer them accident and health coverage. CNA also met the concerns of farmers by developing a new product specifically tailored to their accident and health needs. CNA was one of the first companies to offer worker's compensation coverage and was one of the first to provide retirement income annuities for senior citizens before the establishment of Social Security. 
CNA has also played a behind-the-scenes role in some of our Nation's most memorable events. CNA insured Presidential candidates Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their campaigns in 1952 and insured President John F. Kennedy's inaugural festivities. It also insured the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium performance for the Ed Sullivan Show and the Apollo 16 astronauts' 1972 flight to the moon.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, I can, as said by the President, feel your pain here, because in 1993, my congressional district was inundated in a Midwestern flood. 
There are many natural disasters which can befall America and a family. One of the most insidious is a flood. It just never goes away. Some disasters strike quickly, with a tornado or an earthquake or fire, and by the next day, people are starting to reassemble their lives and clean up the mess and put it behind them. A flood lingers, and as it lingers, I have watched family after family in my district reach a level of depression, then desperation. About the only thing that sustains them is not only all of the good neighbors and volunteers who come to their assistance, but the belief that this Nation stands behind them; that, as a family, America says, `We will come to your aid, too. We will assist you.' 
It is interesting to me that during the course of our history, time and time again, without exception, we have said we are going to waive the rules, we are going to drop the politics, we are just going to focus on helping people. We aren't going to ask them whether they are rich or poor, Democrat or Republican, Independent; it doesn't make any difference. They are Americans, they are neighbors, they are in need. 
Let us get on with the business of being a nation of people who care about those in need. Why then are we going through this exercise? Why haven't we passed the disaster bill to help the victims of the flood in North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota, and other places? Unfortunately, it is because some of the leaders here believe that this is the kind of bill that puts pressure on the President. Send him a bill that he has to 
sign, like a disaster bill, and then like a Christmas tree, put on these ornaments, little things totally unrelated to disasters. `Let's send this to him and, boy, we'll force his hand. No President is going to veto a disaster bill with homeless people. We will force him. We will put a provision in there that says we are going to violate the budget agreement, we are going to set up a new standard here for funding agencies.' 
What does that have to do with disaster assistance? If you were out of your home, if you had seen all of your Earthly belongings inundated with a flood, if you and your kids were huddled in some shelter, would you really want the Congress of the United States of America to get involved in this kind of political gamesmanship? 
Even worse, there is a provision in this bill that relates to the taking of the census. Boy, there's a real timely emergency; we better get on this one. Shoot, take a look, it is only 36 months from now that we are going to have to deal with it; 36 months away we are supposed to take the census. The Republican leadership said, `Let's put a provision in this bill that will force the hand of the Federal Government when it comes to taking the census.' 
This is sad. This is really sad for so many people who have been victimized by this flood to now be victimized by politics on Capitol Hill. And it is outrageous. Senator Dorgan is correct, let us not violate the standard which we have established which says when there is a disaster and a need in America, we will rally behind the victims, our neighbors, our fellow Americans regardless of party label, regardless of agenda. 
We are losing it in this debate because the Republican leadership insists on amendments to this bill which have nothing to do--nothing to do--with disaster victims. 
I salute my colleague for his efforts. I tell you, I have been there, and I know what it means to go home weekend after weekend and see these families struggling, looking at homes that have been inundated with floodwater and mud, everything in their life washed away--the wedding pictures, everything, it's gone--and then to have to tell them, `I'm sorry, another week has gone by and Congress has not met its responsibility.' 
I salute my colleagues. Let us hope that just for one brief shining moment that this body will rise above politics and support your effort to bring a clean disaster bill to the table, pass it today, pass it in the House, move it on to the President and get it signed this evening. We can then say to the people huddled in those shelters worried about their future and what they have been through that we have met our responsibility. I thank the Senator.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to an exceptional hometown hero, John Tallman, who is retiring as president of the Bourbonnais, IL, Fire Protection District after 48 years of distinguished service. 
On June 7, 1997 colleagues, friends, and family gathered to celebrate John's retirement after a lifelong commitment to the fire department and the community of Bourbonnais. He certainly deserves such recognition. 
Although a farmer by profession, at age 28, John began his service with the volunteer-operated fire protection district as an appointed trustee and was then elected president. As testimony to his commitment and integrity, John has remained the only president in the fire protection district's 49-year history. 
Over the years, John guided the fire protection district through remarkable periods of growth and modernization. Under John Tallman's tenure, the Bourbonnais Fire Protection District distinguished itself as one of the outstanding all-volunteer fire departments in the State. Improvements to the fire department facilities, equipment, and service instituted under John's direction enabled the department to better respond to the growing number of emergencies and helped save lives and property. 
In addition to his duties with the fire protection district, John has also been a dedicated husband and father, an 18-year member of the Bourbonnais Elementary School Board, a farmer, and a 19-year member of the Kankakee County Board of School Trustees. 
John is a role model for all Americans and I commend him for his selfless service and effective leadership to the citizens of Bourbonnais and of our State. A fellow firefighter once described John as being one of a kind. John Tallman leaves behind big shoes to fill, and his leadership and vision as fire protection district president will be missed.

Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for reminding us of this important and historic anniversary. President John Kennedy's speech to American University in 1963, really I think demonstrated a vision of the future which no one believed at the time was really within our reach. We expect leaders in America to challenge us, to think ahead, and to think of a different world, a better world. Certainly President Kennedy did that at American University. 
In the midst of the cold war, when it was starting to heat up with nuclear missiles being built at great expense in the Soviet Union and the United States, President Kennedy challenged the United States to think of the vision of a world that was a world of peace, a world where the leaders in countries like the United States and Russia would be focusing their resources on good and positive things rather than weapons of mass destruction. 
We have tried through the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to reach a milestone on the road to the total abolition of nuclear weapons. This treaty prohibits all nuclear weapons test explosions or other nuclear explosions anywhere in the world. 
It is verifiable. We have a global network of monitoring facilities and onsite inspections to make sure that each country lives up to its terms. 
President Bush, obviously a Republican leader, initiated a test moratorium in October 1992. President Clinton continued it, and then signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last year, along with 125 other world leaders. It has been endorsed by the United Nations. Now it must be ratified by the United States. The Senate must put its approval on this notion that we are going to eliminate nuclear weapons testing as part of a global plan to bring real peace to this world. Forty-three other nuclear-capable countries must face that same responsibility. 
Why should we do this at this point in our history? Are we not making enough progress? Do we really need this? I think the answers to these questions demonstrate why we are here on the floor speaking to this issue. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would 
curb nuclear weapons proliferation worldwide. 
What does it mean? Not just those nations currently in possession of nuclear weapons, but those that dream--unfortunately dream--of being nuclear powers, they would be held back, too. Our monitoring devices in the test ban treaty will be at least a discouragement, if not a prohibition against their own nuclear testing to become nuclear powers, to join in some nuclear arms race at a new level different from the cold war. 
There is another aspect of this that is so troubling. Fully $1 out of every $3 we spend each year now in the United States on what we call the nuclear weapons program is money spent to clean up the mess, the environmental degradation that is left over from our nuclear program. If we stopped the testing and put a halt to the construction of these weapons, we are going to protect our environment, and future generations will certainly be happy to hear that. It saves taxpayer money. And, it is supported by a majority of Americans. In fact, over 80 percent of the American people think it is time for us to do this.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for more than 5 years now, the tobacco companies have said repeatedly, `We do not want to sell our products to kids.' They have bought full page ads in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, saying that they adamantly oppose the sale of tobacco to kids. 
I don't know many kids who read the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, or the Washington Post. What the tobacco companies have been doing is creating a sham that they are serious about reducing sales to kids. 
Let's take a look at the record. From 1991 to 1996, the percentage of children who use tobacco increased by almost 50 percent. This means that, at the same time the tobacco companies have been saying they are dedicated to reducing the illegal sales of tobacco to kids, more and more children have been buying the tobacco products those companies sell. 
That is not an accident. This multi-billion dollar industry is made up of tobacco companies that design their marketing and advertising to lure new customers into this addiction. The fact that more and more children are smoking is clear evidence that the tobacco companies have failed, once again, to tell the truth. They need these new, young customers to prop up their profits as older customers die or quit using tobacco. And they continue to do what it takes to secure a new generation of young people who are becoming hooked on their products. 
Today, I am introducing, along with Senator Frank Lautenberg and Congressman Henry Waxman, a new piece of legislation that says the only honest way to approach the reduction of tobacco sales to children is to make the tobacco companies put their profits on the line. 
The NO Tobacco For Kids Act says we will do a survey of the tobacco products for sale and find out how many children are using those products and what brands they are using. Then, each year, we will update that survey to see which products continue to be purchased by children. Those companies that continue to sell their products to children will face a fine of $1 a pack on all their sales if they don't reduce the number of children using their brands in steps to reach a reduction of 90 percent over the next 6 years. Since current childhood users will cycle out of the underage population over that time, this measure will give the tobacco companies a chance to show whether they are serious about reducing the use of tobacco products by kids. 
Unless the tobacco companies have their profits on the line, we will continue to get cheap talk from them about stopping sales to kids. This bill puts teeth into the campaign to stop selling tobacco products to children. It sets a very simple standard for the tobacco companies: stop selling cigarettes and spit tobacco to children, or pay the consequences. 
In the past, every child hooked on tobacco was a new profit center for the tobacco industry. This legislation totally reverses the incentives for marketing to children. When this measure becomes law, every new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit tobacco will become an economic loss to the company whose products the child chooses. With that reversal, the tobacco companies will have a strong economic incentive to stop marketing to children. 
Mr. President, this legislation could be one the simplest yet most effective steps we can take to reduce teenage tobacco use. I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the NO Tobacco For Kids Act and help us put in place clear performance standards for the tobacco industry to stop selling their products to minors.

<DOCNO>105-durbin-il-2-19970522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday we had a vote that was very important about health care for children. I thought it was a watershed vote, because it is an issue which very few American families would quarrel with. Children were not insured. They weren't receiving adequate health care. A suggestion was made by Senators Hatch and Kennedy that we have a bipartisan response and raise the cigarette tax, take the money and ensure the children. We lost. We called it for a vote and we lost. Health care for children failed yesterday. 
So we start this morning with another challenge. If you won't provide health care for children, how about education? Let's test that question before the U.S. Senate. Have we provided in this great Nation the resources for education for our children? 
Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois brings that challenge to the floor this morning. She says to the U.S. Senate, let's test this theory. If we are committed as a nation to education, are we committed enough to cut tax loopholes that some of wealthiest Americans enjoy, take the money and put it into building our crumbling schools? She is not talking about carpeting schools in America. Senator Moseley-Braun is not talking about air conditioning for every school in America. She is talking about the basics: safety in the schools and a learning environment so that our children can walk into a clean classroom, heated in the winter, cool in the hot days of summer, and have the ability to learn. 
If you go to your State, whatever it is, and look around, you 
know what you are going to find. The Government is spending money today for that very type of room: A clean, comfortable room for young people. Is it a classroom? No. It is a prison cell. It is a juvenile detention center. We are building them in Illinois at a record pace. And I will bet you that in every State of the country you will find the same is true. 
As juvenile crime increases, we are building more boot camps, more detention centers and more prisons. If you visit them, many of them are not luxurious. But they are a heck of a lot better than the school building just a few blocks away. 
Should we have clean and adequate facilities for the detention of young people? Of course. But think about it for a second. We drive past a high school that is falling down, a junior high school that is totally inadequate, an elementary school where they don't have heating, where the windows are busted out and the ceilings are falling down, and, a few blocks beyond that, see a detention center all brand new and shiny and modern. What is the lesson there for the children, or for us as taxpayers? Where is the priority? Wouldn't we say that we would have at least as high a priority in providing a school building that is good for children? That is what Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has proposed. 
Let me add another element that is very important as far as I am concerned. In the old days, a school building opened up at 7:30 or 8 o'clock in the morning and closed up at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, and that was it. Kids went home to mom and dad in the `Ozzie and Harriet' setting of cookies and milk, or `The Partridge Family,' whatever, you name it--good, old American values. That isn't what the American family looks like today. Those kids coming home at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon are lucky to find anybody at home. The parent or parents are usually out working. And they sit around for 2 or 3 hours waiting for an adult to show up. Their choices in life at that point are television or trouble. Sad choices. 
So we are expanding the concept of schools beyond just learning, to be community centers so that at the end of the ordinary schoolday the kids stay there in a safe learning environment. They would stay there until the parents were home in the evening, and they would have a positive experience.

Mr. DURBIN. If we are going to use our schools so that kids have a better chance in life, don't we want them to be decent, safe buildings? Honest to goodness, if we fail, if these kids go out in the street, get in trouble at the malls, or wherever it happens to be, and get arrested, they are going to head off to a public facility that is better than the school they left. Does that make sense? What does it say about America? 
So, today, we are going to test a new premise. If we cannot afford, as America, health care for children, which we voted yesterday, we will have a chance today on Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's amendment to see whether or not we can afford adequate schools for our children. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. This amendment, so it is understood by the membership, is very straightforward. I can read it in two sentences and describe it as well with these words. 
`A substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided in the tax reconciliation bill'--which is a part of this agreement--`will go to middle-class working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per year, and the tax cuts in the tax reconciliation bill will not cause revenue losses to increase significantly in years after 2007.' 
Senator Boxer and I are trying to establish as basic principles that the tax cut package that will emerge from this budget agreement will do one thing and avoid another. The thing that it will do is to gear more than a majority--a substantial majority--of the benefits to middle-income families. We think, 
if this ends up becoming a tax cut for wealthy people, that it is not in the best interests of sparking this economy and helping working families cope with the expenses of life that they face every day. 
Second, we want to make certain in this resolution that we make it clear that any tax cut package will be measured not only to the year 2002, when we hope the budget will be in balance, and 5 years beyond to 2007. We have great fear and concern by reports that have come out recently from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities that some of the tax cut provisions that are being debated will literally explode in cost in the outyears, causing great dislocation in terms of the Federal budget and a great burden to Federal taxpayers. 
Let us make sure these tax cuts are affordable and they are targeted to families that need them. Then, I think we can say to the American people that we have not only balanced the budget, but we have given you a tax cut that is responsible for the future of our economy. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and it reminds me of a lesson I learned in politics many years ago. The teacher was a fellow who was my boss at the time in Illinois in the Illinois State Senate by the name of Cecil Partee. He was president of the senate. He was an African-American Senator from the city of Chicago. He used to say, when it comes to political decisions, you will always hear a good reason for a decision, but you may not hear the real reason. 
We have heard a lot of good reasons from the other side as to why they might oppose the Hatch-Kennedy proposal, but very few of them are willing to articulate the real reason that they oppose it. Some have said it is a mandate, a Federal mandate. You hear the word over and over and over again. I went through the legislation again, and I have to tell you, they should read it more closely. This is voluntary. Each State will decide whether to participate and under what terms they will participate. There is no Federal mandate, there is an opportunity here for a State to address a problem, a problem which I think both Democrats and Republicans would agree is a serious national health problem: 10.5 million uninsured children in America. These are kids who do not get the appropriate medical care, the children of working families, families that, unfortunately, do not have health care benefits that many of us enjoy. These kids deserve the same level of protection, and it would be voluntary for each State to determine whether or not they want to participate in the program. 
Then, of course, there is this argument that this is not part of the budget agreement. Senator Kennedy made a point very well a few minutes ago that the actual budget agreement before us has a specific reference in every type of program. So if these so-called good reasons--the mandate and going outside the four corners of the budget agreement--are not the real reason, what is the real reason for the opposition to the Hatch-Kennedy amendment? I think the real reason is very obvious. This is the last gasp of the tobacco lobby to stop a 43-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. They know what is going to happen. 
When you raise the price of cigarettes, as has been demonstrated in Canada and so many other countries, children are less inclined to start smoking. They cannot afford it. Look what this means in terms of the impact upon our public health. Increasing the Federal tax by 43 cents a pack is going to mean 16.6 million fewer smokers, 5.3 million fewer children dying prematurely and 835,000 children's lives saved. 
It is going to mean a lot fewer sales for tobacco companies, too. That is what this is about. They know that if we put this Federal tax in place, kids will stop smoking, they are less likely to be addicted to the product, and, down the line, they will not be the steady customers the tobacco industry needs to stay in business. 
It is no accident that over 80 percent of smokers today started smoking before the age of 18, over half before the age of 16. When they are immature and make a rash decision to start using chewing tobacco or spit tobacco or cigarettes, they become addicted to nicotine, an addiction which will claim one out of three of them in terms of lives lost. 
So that is what this debate is about. It is about a tax which an industry is fighting. They will not come out and say it on the floor because, quite honestly, it is not a popular thing to say. Overwhelmingly, the public supports an increase in the cigarette tax. I will tell you that 76 percent of the women, 69 percent of Independent voters, 67 percent of Republican voters, 79 percent of Democrat voters understand that this tax is a reasonable, revenue-raising measure to pay for an important national priority. 
I think it is time to blow through this smokescreen from the tobacco lobby. As they say in the ads here: Take your pick, Senator. Who are you going to stand with, Joe Camel or a little boy named Joey who is uninsured? This is an easy choice for me. It should be for every Member. I think the Senate owes Senators Hatch and Kennedy, because of their leadership, a clear vote on this issue. I think with that clear vote, we will say definitively that the real reason for the opposition to this amendment is not a good reason, that we in fact are going to give to each State the opportunity to participate in a program to insure their children. We will pay for it with a tax on tobacco products. 
Frankly, let me add this, too. For those who say, why do you keep picking on tobacco? Why do you zero in on cigarettes so much? Take a look at this chart. 
In 1993, cigarettes killed more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, fires, cocaine, heroin, murders, and suicides combined. This is not just another issue. This is the No. 1 public health issue in America. With this bill we not only insure the children who need the insurance, we attack a problem which is claiming lives every single day. 
Will the Senate have the courage to rally behind this Hatch-Kennedy bill? I certainly hope so. And for good reason we can stand up and say to the people of America, we are protecting your children, not just with insurance, but also with a tobacco tax which discourages children from taking up tobacco habits. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Red Rock Wilderness Act to protect an important part of our Nation's natural heritage. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act designates 5.7 million acres of the 22 million acres of public, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Southern Utah as wilderness. 
Passage of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is essential to protect a national treasure for future generations of Americans. A companion bill, H.R. 1500, has been introduced in the House by Representative Maurice Hinchey with over 100 original cosponsors. 
America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will protect 5.7 million acres of magnificent canyons, red rock cliffs and rock formations which are unlike any on Earth. The lands included in this legislation contain steep slick rock canyons, high cliffs offering spectacular vistas of rare rock formations, important archeological sites and rare plant and animal species. Each year, almost 8 million people from across the United States and the world visit these lands to see a part of their natural heritage and experience the beauty and solitude of this wilderness area. 
However, these fragile, scenic lands are threatened by oil, gas and mining interests which are willing to sacrifice these lands for short-term economic gain. These wilderness areas are also threatened by off-road vehicle use and proposals to construct roads, communication towers, transmission lines, and dams. 
Because of flaws in the original wilderness inventory conducted by BLM during the Reagan administration, only 3.2 million acres in southern Utah are currently protected as wilderness study areas. The wilderness areas included in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act are based on a careful assessment of BLM lands which meet the criteria for wilderness designation by citizen groups that form the Utah Wilderness Coalition. Unlike other proposals, this legislation does not include special interest exemptions that would undermine the integrity of the 1964 Wilderness Act. 
America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is supported by a broad coalition of environmental organizations and citizen groups. In a national survey conducted by USA Today, over 90 percent of the respondents supported the designation of 5.7 million acres in southern Utah as wilderness. Newspapers across the Nation have also editorialized in support of protecting America's Red Rock Wilderness Area. 
Theodore Roosevelt once stated that, `The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value.' Because of the foresight of leaders like Theodore Roosevelt, national treasures such as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone were preserved for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to protect America's Red Rock Wilderness Area in southern Utah for future generations.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding. 
I am honored to be a cosponsor on this resolution. There are so many things that we vote for in the Chambers of the Senate and House, and I often wonder what the average person in the street would do if they were faced with casting a yes-or-no vote on issues we face in the Chamber. 
I think I know what they would do when it comes to this resolution. If we are talking about a substantial increase in medical research as a major budget priority, I think I know where the American people would end up on that. They would be supportive. They understand, as we do, what is at stake. 
There have been a lot of things said in the Chamber, and I stand behind the statement of the Senator from California, the Senator from Maine and others, and they have recounted the work that has been done by NIH. I will not go on to repeat all those things, the breakthroughs that the National Institutes of Health has initiated. There are so many in the area of hip fractures, as the Senator from California said, breast cancer. The No. 1 leading cancer cause of death among women is lung cancer from smoking, but No. 2 and very serious is breast cancer. 
What is happening at the National Institutes of Health in breakthrough research on bone marrow transplant is giving new hope to women who have learned that they have been diagnosed 
with breast cancer. That is something that every single husband, every father, everyone can identify with in a family as an important breakthrough. 
Diabetes, heart disease, stroke, the list goes on and on. But I would like to ask my colleagues to think about this in a different and more personal context. I would daresay that in the next 12 months some Member of this Senate, someone sitting in the gallery, or someone listening to this debate will be seated in a doctor's office or a hospital when a doctor walks in the room and says that either myself or you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a serious illness. It takes your breath away to even think that it might happen, and yet we know it happens every day. You and I and everyone listening pray to God that the next words out of the doctor's mouth are, `But I have good news. There is a promising new therapy. There is a new surgery. There is a new medicine. We think that we can conquer this.' And your heart starts beating and you realize you have hope. 
That is what this is all about. This is not about a budget resolution. This is not about numbers on a page. It is about the hope that every family wants to have when faced with this threat of a serious illness. This investment in the National Institutes of Health is money well spent, not just because it can lead to new cures and lead to people having longer lives and less suffering, but let me mention one other element that I do not know has been spotlighted. 
Across America today young men and women are deciding what to do with their lives. We hope that a substantial number of them will dedicate their lives to science, to medical science, and to research. But if they fear that their education is not going to lead to a position where they can get involved in research, they are less likely to do so. When we make a commitment to medical research at the National Institutes of Health, we say to that class of young scientists, men and women, we have a job waiting for you. We need you and we need your talent and we need you to stick with it so that you can live through the satisfaction of finding a breakthrough in the field of medicine and in science. 
So it is not just a matter of saving those who are ill. It is a matter of encouraging young people to dedicate their lives to medical research. And that is why the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Florida is so critically important. 
The National Institutes of Health in 1995 funded approximately 2,140 research institutions and over 18,000 investigators. And yet, if I am not mistaken--and I stand to be corrected by my colleagues here--we are funding about one out of four or one out of five eligible research grants. In other words, there are three or four grants there that are very promising in medical research that we cannot fund.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Not being a high priest on the Budget Committee, I am not bound by sacred oath to the agreement, but I stand in opposition to this amendment. I believe that the Senator from Colorado has raised an important issue. 
We can see the fact that the economy has moved forward very nicely over the last 4 1/2 to 5 years. Those on the Democratic side take particular pleasure in saying that, but regardless of the reason, we are happy the economy has moved forward. As the Senator from New Mexico has mentioned, it has generated more jobs, more revenue and, in fact, more economic growth than even some of the experts suggested. 
If I follow the suggestion of the Senator from Colorado, he is saying that if at some future date the economy has a downturn, revenues to the Federal Government decrease, he would want us to cut spending programs to match those cuts in revenue. I stand in opposition to that for one very obvious reason. 
Since the late 1940s, we have noticed a very positive occurrence in the economy of America. As we have gone into recessions, we have not seen those deep spikes that we had in years gone by. The recessions have been milder, there has been less unemployment, less dislocation by businesses and families. It is no accident. It is known as automatic stabilizers, things in our Government and in our economy that step in in times of recession to try to bring us back into a time of economic expansion. 
For instance, if we have a recession and a business lays off workers, there are Government programs available to help that working family get back on its feet. We have training programs, we have education programs, we have safety net programs, whether it is 
food stamps or unemployment compensation, to make sure that family doesn't fall even deeper, but rather to keep them in a position and poised ready for retraining and reemployment, and it has worked. 
With these automatic stabilizers and this Government spending, we have managed to moderate recessions. The Senator from Colorado has suggested we remove the stabilizers. If you have a recession, if you have a downturn, if your Government revenues have been reduced, then cut spending. Well, what about the family that needs a helping hand? `I am sorry, there is not enough Federal money to go around.' 
We are more determined to balance the budget than recover from a recession under the Senator's amendment, and I think that is a mistake. We do not want to see a downturn in the economy become a recession. We certainly do not want to see a recession become a depression. The Senator's amendment would make economic circumstances even worse for the families out of work, worse for the businesses that have had to close, worse for the family farmers who have had to give it up. 
I would think that the Senator would want to go in the opposite direction. We would want to get the American economy moving forward again, help those families back to work, help that business back on its feet, help those farmers, if we can, and the ranchers as well. But the Senator's amendment would have exactly the opposite effect. As a recession hits, revenues go down, the Senator would say spend less and bring the economy back to its feet. 
I think that is the wrong, wrong medicine. 
As important as a balanced budget is, it is more important for America to have an expanding economy, to recover from a recession, and to have the wherewithal to do it. So I respect the Senator for his suggestion, but I respectfully disagree with his point of view. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
There is an old saying that `virtue is its own reward.' I would have to say to the minority leader, Senator Daschle, that when he undertook this project and this responsibility to try to craft a reasonable answer to this national debate on partial-birth abortion, as it is characterized, he truly understood the daunting task which he faced. I have seen the advertisements against the Senator, full-page ads which have called the Senator every name in the book. But I know, having tried to do the same thing, that the Senator addressed this issue in an honest and forthright way, that the Senator worked for months to come up with the right language that was, first, constitutional; second, sensitive to reality; and, third, which addressed a serious national concern about late-term abortions. I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Daschle's amendment. 
When this issue came before the House of Representatives, and I served in that body, I sat in the Chamber of the House and listened to every minute of debate. I have never, ever in my public career viewed a vote on abortion as an easy vote. I have always sat down and thought carefully about what is the right thing to do, and some of the votes have troubled me because it is a troubling issue. Since our national debate on slavery, I cannot think of another issue which has divided America over such a protracted period of time. 
And the reason, of course, is that in this debate we are addressing one of the most enduring debates in the history of man, the appropriate role of Government. At what point do the rights of the individual end and the rights of society and the Government begin? This classic question, pitting individual liberty against the responsibility of Government, is clearly at issue when we discuss abortion. 
Religions and moralists draw clear lines of belief, but where does a diverse society like America draw the line? Where do the rights of a woman to control her body end, and the rights of the fetus, or potential life, begin? The Supreme Court, in Roe versus Wade, tried to draw a bright line on this clouded issue. The absolute rights of a woman in America to privacy and to the control of her body yield when the fetus can survive outside the mother. Thus, viability is the dividing line in this national debate. Before viability, when the fetus cannot survive, then the mother's rights and decisions are paramount. After viability, the fetus is protected except in the most extraordinary cases. 
Senator Daschle, what I find interesting is this: Had you presented this bill 2 or 3 years ago, and said that you wanted to take the Doe versus Bolton case, which said that we would allow abortions after viability to protect the mother's life or health, but you wanted to take that language and clarify it so that the word `health' was better understood and that those violating it would be subject to serious penalties, I would daresay that you would have been applauded by many of the people who are going to vote against you today. 
But they do not accept your sincerity in this, and I do. I share your feeling. I believe that after viability we should apply a strict test as to whether any abortion procedure is going to be allowed. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania, in banning one procedure, previability and postviability does not address this. And he would have to admit, in all honesty, that Senator Daschle addresses the specific procedure he would like to ban and any other abortion procedure after the moment of viability. His ban, his restriction is much more specific, but much less respectful of the Constitution, women, and fetuses, than that being offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
I find it interesting, too, that Senator Daschle's proposal faces criticism on the grounds that the doctor is going to make the decision as to whether there is a possibility of risk to the mother's life or a possibility of grievous injury, which is very carefully defined. If the doctor does not make this decision, who will? The local Congressman? A U.S. Senator? Some Federal employee? I have been to a lot of town meetings, hundreds of them. People have asked my opinion and help in many, many situations, but never, never have they asked me to come to their homes when their family has to make an important medical decision and give them the Government's point of view. Quite honestly, Senator Daschle addresses this in the only way that you can. This is a situation to be certified by a doctor. 
The Republican side has said, well, what if the doctor lies? What if he misleads people? What if, in fact, there is not a threat of grievous injury and he goes ahead with the procedure? And then they quote `Dr. Will,' who says, well, this is a law that can never be violated. But there will be other people in that operating room. There will be other witnesses to this act. If that doctor's certification is fraudulent, I daresay he or she runs the risk that they will be held responsible. So, to say that this is unenforceable is, I think, unfair. 
The problem with this debate, as I see it, is that many times it deteriorates very quickly. There was an advertisement, a full page ad that was bought by a religious group, which listed the reasons a woman seeks a late-term abortion. It was an embarrassment to read that ad. At one point they said, `Some women seek an abortion because they no longer fit in their prom dresses.' Perhaps that is the case. Perhaps not. But for those who are 
arguing this issue, I hope, I sincerely hope that they have taken the time, as I have, to speak to women who faced tragic circumstances, and never made a casual decision. 
I, for one, have met six different women who have been faced with this challenge and have undergone this procedure. They remind me that this debate is not about politics. It is not about legal jargon. It is about our daughters, our sisters, our wives and our friends. It is about families. One woman in my home State of Illinois, when she heard this debate, came forward and said: This isn't fair. The way they are characterizing this procedure and the decision that I faced is not fair. I want to tell my story. My husband and I have decided we have to tell our story. 
This is their photograph. Vikki Stella of Naperville, IL, the mother of two daughters, 32 weeks pregnant with her third child whom she had named Anthony. She had painted the nursery. They were prepared, expectant parents, again, for the happiness of another baby, their first son. And then they learned through a sonogram that Anthony suffered from a serious deformity. Anthony had no brain. Anthony would not survive birth but for a few moments. And, if she continued the pregnancy, she ran the risk of jeopardizing her ability to ever have another baby. 
So her dying infant would be the last child she ever would bear. Vikki Stella tells the story about she and her husband, hearing this tragic news--imagine, 8 months into the pregnancy--and then being faced with the awful decision as to whether to terminate the pregnancy. They prayed over it. They cried over it. They went forward with it. Afterward, she held Anthony in her arms and understood it was the only thing that she and her family could do. And she came back home. 
Last year I had a chance to be introduced to Nicholas. He is in the picture here. He is the little boy in her arms. Nicholas is their new son. I was not really introduced to him because he was asleep in a stroller. But the fact of the matter is, Vikki Stella's story is what this debate is all about. Do you really want to say to this family that we don't care whether or not this family ever has another child; that it makes no difference, the government is going to decide this one for you? Do you really want to say that? I don't think so. This was no casual decision. This was no perfect infant, as some of your illustrations try to prove. This was a sad situation and this family in grief faced a tragic situation and made a difficult decision. This bill that is being offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania would preclude the very procedure which Vikki Stella's doctor recommended. That is not fair. 
If you value life, look in the eyes of Nicholas and understand that life came from this decision. There would not have been more life had she been precluded from ending that first pregnancy. It would have been the end of her ability to bear any children. Six different women I have spoken to on this, each one of them a gripping story. 
Let me just concede a point. Are casual decisions made? Are there some abortions where you and I might agree, oh, wait a minute, come on, that is not a serious case? Yes, I think that is true. But that is what Senator Daschle addresses with his amendment. He says when you are late in the pregnancy you cannot terminate that pregnancy unless you have a serious reason: The life of the mother is at stake, or she risks a grievous injury. We have gone beyond the abstract, we have gone beyond the casual, we are into the serious situations which he has described. And that is why the Daschle amendment is one which I hope those who decry abortion will think about. 
The Senator from Arkansas, my colleague, just said, `Search your conscience and soul.' I would ask you to do the same over the Daschle amendment. What Tom Daschle is offering today is a sensible statement of policy for this Nation. It does not preclude any State from saying we are going to impose a stricter standard. But it says that, for a national policy, we will preclude all late-term abortions except in the most serious situations. 
He does not stand alone here. This is not a political calculation. The American Medical Association stands with him, as does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
We have so many people practicing medicine on the floor of the Senate today, I am sure that those who are tuning in must wonder whether or not we have diverted from passing law. I do not profess to have any expertise when it comes to medicine. But the people who do, the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have said the Daschle amendment is sensible, it is reasonable, it will preserve for doctors the discretion they need to make the very important decisions about a woman's pregnancy, and terminate it. I respect that. I think all of us should. 
Let me also say that, as this issue divides America, it divides this Chamber, it divides political parties, it divides members of our families. I would hope that at the end of this debate, whatever the outcome, we can lower the volume of rhetoric on this difficult issue and try to find some common ground on issues that we might all agree on. How can we implement policies in this Nation to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies? Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, can we try to find some common ground there? Would that not be good for this Nation and good for this issue--whatever your position on abortion? 
How can we make certain that children, wanted children, receive appropriate pre-natal nutritional care during the pregnancy? Should we not all agree on that, pro-choice or pro-life? I think there are so many things which we can address which really speak to our reverence for life. But today I stand in the midst of this long and maybe intractable debate, and urge my colleagues to seriously consider the amendment offered by the minority leader. I believe it is responsible and I believe it addresses late-term abortions in terms that every family can concede are realistic. Yes, we want to reduce the number of abortions. We want to make them rare. But let us never preclude that option, when we have the life of the mother at stake, or the situation that faced Vikki Stella. She had her chance because abortion is legal and safe in America. As a result, she is, in this photo, with her son Nicholas. 
I yield my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has only been a few weeks since this Chamber was the platform and the focus for a debate on amending the Constitution of the United States. Members of this Senate came to the floor, mainly Republican but some Democrats, and argued it was politically impossible for the leaders in this country to reach an agreement on a balanced budget absent an amendment to the Constitution which would require it, which would involve the Federal judiciary, which would have added language to the Constitution, binding language on future Congresses. And yet here we stand today, just a few weeks later, many of us in favor of, some opposed, but speaking to an agreement to balance the budget. Did it take a constitutional amendment? Of course not, it took leadership, leadership from both political parties. 
I voted against that balanced budget amendment. I said then, as I say now, you do not need to amend the Constitution to meet your constitutional responsibility, and my responsibility is to make certain that we live within our means while our economy moves forward. 
And I am happy today that we can stand and discuss this balanced budget absent a constitutional amendment. 
I want to acknowledge on the floor my colleague, Senator Byrd, of West Virginia. If you were to list his accolades, I think the one he would be proudest of is his role as guardian of the Constitution. He carries that Constitution in his pocket every day. He believes in it to his core that it embodies what America is all about. He does not take constitutional amendments very lightly, and he has effectively argued against the balanced budget amendment and others over the years. 
Senator Byrd, this balanced budget agreement is a tribute to your tenacity and your commitment to the Constitution. History has proven you right again. A constitutional amendment was unnecessary. It took the will to bring about this agreement. And today we are debating such an agreement without a constitutional amendment. 
On behalf of myself and those who really are grateful for the contribution you have made on behalf of the Constitution, I just want to acknowledge that today.

Mr. DURBIN. You are certainly welcome. 
How did we come to this day? Make no mistake, if the American economy were struggling, if we faced high unemployment, slow economic growth, few housing starts, businesses failing, trade accounts in the red, we would not be standing here with any kind of an agreement to balance the budget. But that is not the case. 
What propels us into this debate is the good condition of the American economy. Yesterday, the Dow Jones index broke a record, I believe. I cannot keep up with it. Up and down, up and down, but it has generally been up. We have seen the lowest unemployment figures in two decades. We have seen jobs created. People are building homes and starting businesses. America is moving forward. We feel good about it. 
How did we get here? Is this just a matter of good luck? I think it is more than that. I think it goes back to an action taken by Congress in 1993, and not a popular one, I might add, when the President stood up and said, `I think we can move toward a balanced budget and keep the economy moving forward, and I want the support of Congress to do it.' I was a Member of the House at that time. I joined the President, and I might tell you it was a partisan decision--not one single Republican vote in support of the President's plan, and yet we passed it. In the Senate it only passed when Vice President Gore cast the tiebreaking vote to enact the President's budget. We are lucky that he did because with that plan in 1993, we set the stage for this debate to bring the budget into balance. We set the stage for economic expansion, which is creating more revenues, so that we can sit down and talk about tax cuts and more money being spent on education and environmental protection. Absent the President's leadership, absent the Democrats in Congress standing behind him, this day might never have come. And yet it has. And we can be proud of it. 
So let us talk about this agreement for a moment. Is this an agreement I would have written? No. I would have changed a lot of provisions here. It is a compromise. It is a bipartisan compromise. There are things which many Republicans are proud of which I would not have included. There are things which were not included but I think should have been. But make no mistake, this is a good agreement. It is good for this country. It is a good bipartisan compromise. It is one which not only reaches a balanced budget but says we are going to do it in a responsible way. 
First, under the Republican Contract With America, which Speaker Gingrich and many Republican Senators supported, we were to cut out of Medicare $270 billion over 7 years--a massive cutback in Medicare. They said it was necessary; you had to do it. And if you did not do it, Medicare was in peril. The American people knew better. 
That $270 billion went way beyond what was necessary to strengthen Medicare. It created funds for a tax cut for wealthy people. And that was not fair. The President stood up and said, `I won't agree to it.' When he threatened that veto, that particular proposal did not go forward. Where are we today? 
The bipartisan compromise talks about a $115 billion cut over 5 years in Medicare and a guarantee to the American people that, for 10 years, Medicare will be solvent and strong. We have kept our word to the seniors in this country and those about to be seniors. They can rest assured that Medicare will be there. That is good. That is part of this agreement. 
Medicaid. Medicaid is not just health insurance for poor people; it is health insurance for destitute elderly in nursing homes. That is where half the money in Medicaid goes. The elderly person in a nursing home who has spent down and has not a single thing left on Earth turns to Medicaid to keep them alive. 
The Republican proposal originally to cut Medicaid was $160 billion over 7 years. We said it was too much. The President 
said it was too much. In this agreement it is down to $15 billion. We have brought it down to a manageable amount, one that will not endanger the health and security of the disadvantaged and elderly. 
Education. My colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, got up a few minutes ago and talked about all this massive Federal spending. Well, let me tell you, America, families that get up every morning and wonder whether they can pay for their kids' college education expenses, this budget agreement will be a helping hand. We are going to allow you for the first time to deduct college education expenses on your income tax. Oh, it is still going to be expensive, but you are going to get a helping hand for the first time. 
And, students, listen up. Get good grades, go to school, and there is a scholarship in here for you that will pay for most community colleges and some colleges and universities. Too good to be true? No. It is a commitment by the President that is embodied in this budget agreement that is good for this country. 
Visit a couple with a new baby a couple days after the baby is born, and they are home and you go to visit them. You say, `What a beautiful little baby. Looks just like his dad,' or `looks just like his mom. Is she sleeping at night? How is she taking her bottle?' And then, after a few minutes, `Have you thought about how you're going to pay for her college education?' 
It is something we all think about. Next to our home mortgage, for most families in this country, this is what you worry about. `How am I ever going to put this money together?' This bill will help. It will not pay the whole thing, but it is going to help. It is responsive to the real needs that American families feel. 
Middle-class tax relief. Not only when it comes to education to help working families pay for college and training expenses, but a child tax credit of $500 per child. What does it mean? Well, my daughter and her husband have a little baby boy, our grandson. We are so proud of him. He is going to be a year old in a few weeks. 
My wife and I did not think much about this when we raised our kids, but my daughter and my son-in-law talk about day care. `Dad, what are we going to do about day care? It's expensive. We don't want to put Alex anywhere that isn't safe, quality day care. How are we going to pay for it?' They are lucky. They have two jobs, two incomes in their family. Some other families struggle with the same decision with fewer resources. 
This child tax credit in here means a helping hand, $500 per child per year. It will not cover the cost of day care, but it will help. And shouldn't we help? Shouldn't we help working families? That is what this is all about. 
We are finally responding to the real issues that real people talk about. I do not believe real American families sit around the family room and say, `What about campaign finance reform? What's going on with the latest investigation in Washington?' They do sit around and talk about paying for college, paying for day care. This budget agreement will address it. 
The battle is not finished. There is another one before us. I hope we enact this budget agreement. Then we will address a tax bill. I think you are going to see some real differences in philosophy between Democrats and Republicans about whether the tax savings in that bill go to working families or wealthy people. I think they should go to working families. 
I think we ought to, for example, give 100 percent deductibility of health insurance premiums for all self-employed people. All family farmers, all small businesses, those who are self-employed, should have the same benefits of hospitalization insurance deduction as the corporations do. 
So, for American families, this agreement is a step forward. The President's leadership, a bipartisan compromise, has us on the road to a balanced budget in a responsible way. 
I yield back my time.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for far too long, tobacco and baseball have been almost synonyous. Dipping or chewing tobacco has been one of the rituals of baseball. Batters stepping out of the batters box to spit, fielders checking the pouch or tin tucked in their hip pocket, bullpen personnel having spitting contests--the fabric of baseball has been colored by the mix of tobacco juice and spit that accompany the use of smokeless tobacco. 
Unfortunately, even major league baseball superheroes can't avoid the consequences of tobacco use. Players have found themselves addicted. What seemed to be a colorful and harmless ritual turned out to have a deadly undertow. Many ballplayers have had to deal with serious oral health problems caused by tobacco use. Some have lost a jaw when oral cancer invaded. Some have lost their life. 
Fortunately, the tide is turning. I was involved in an effort several years ago to discourage the use of tobacco by ballplayers. It led to the banning of smokeless tobacco use in the field and in the clubhouse at the collegiate level and throughout the minor leagues. 
Only the major leagues remain open to smokeless tobacco use, and even there the glorification of tobacco is subsiding. What the players and owners have been unwilling to mandate is gradually happening through education and the example of ballplayers who have been willing to take a stand. Smokeless tobacco use is on the decline. 
Equally important, ballplayers are beginning to use their positions as role models for our Nation's youth to deliver the important message that you don't have to chew or dip to be successful on the field. 
I attended this year's opening day game at Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox, and was pleased to see a full-page color ad with an important message. Beneath the pictures of one star from each major league team was this message: `We Agree! Chew, Dip, or Snuff Aren't Part of Our Game. Don't Make Spit Tobacco Part of Yours! Just Play the Game.' 
This message was brought to the fans at Comiskey Park as a public service by the Chicago White Sox and the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, a program sponsored by `Oral Health America.' 
The National Spit Tobacco Education Program, or NSTEP, is a multimedia, multiyear campaign to communicate to the American public that spit tobacco is not a safe alternative to 
cigarettes. This year, the initiative includes television and radio public service announcements during baseball broadcasts, an educational outreach to broadcasters and writers, in-stadium outreaches to the fans including scoreboard video messages, and intervention efforts to help current players who need assistance in quitting their use of spit tobacco. 
This program is desperately needed. Spit tobacco leads to nicotine addiction, gum disease, and tooth loss, as well as mouth and throat cancer. Oral cancer is diagnosed in 30,000 people annually and kills approximately 8,000 people annually. 
While spit tobacco used to be used primarily by older men, boys and young men are now the primary consumers of this deadly product. In Illinois, 10 percent of junior high and high school boys have used smokeless tobacco in the past month. Across the country, nearly 20 percent of high school boys are current users of spit tobacco, and the average age at which children first try the product is under age 10. 
Moreover, the link between baseball and tobacco exists not only in the major leagues, but in the little leagues as well. According to a study by the Illinois Department of Public Health, 70 percent of children who report regular use of smokeless tobacco are members of organized sports teams. 
The NSTEP program is an important part of the effort to reverse this trend and help our youngsters and budding all-stars to get off to a healthy tobacco-free start in life. 
I would also like to commend the Chicago White Sox for their refusal to permit tobacco advertising at Comiskey Park. 
The tobacco companies have used stadium billboards for two purposes: to promote their products to the fans in the seats and to get around the television advertising ban to pitch their products to the millions of fans sitting at home watching the game on television. Obviously, many of those fans are children --the very people the tobacco industry needs to hook on its products to maintain a steady base of customers. 
Every year, the tobacco companies lose 2 million American customers. Four hundred thousand die of tobacco-related diseases and the rest quit smoking or die of other causes. To replace those smokers, dippers, and chewers, they must turn to our children, because very few adults start the dangerous practice of tobacco use. 
The decision by the White Sox to forego the profits associated with tobacco advertising is an important step that helps reduce the barrage of marketing that reaches our Nation's children. Both that decision and the ballplayers' campaign against spit tobacco send an important message: that baseball and tobacco don't mix. 
I applaud these actions by the players and the team, and I encourage every player and every team to follow these good examples.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it may be of interest to note why we are here and what we are talking about. Nominally, we are here to consider Senate bill 543, an important piece of legislation and one which I cosponsored in a slightly different form as a Member of the House of Representatives. I commend the Senator for offering this. I think it is an important piece of legislation. I hope that we can have real debate on it and consider some amendments and enact legislation to certainly achieve the goals. They are worthy goals. People who volunteer to help organizations should not risk or fear liability for their acts, unless, of course, they are guilty of something which is wanton or criminal in nature. I think the Senator offers a good piece of legislation. I would like to see some changes, and I hope we reach that point. 
The reason why we are not considering it, the reason why the Democrats have voted on two successive days to continue this debate has nothing to do with the bill directly. It relates to the appointment of a person to serve as Secretary of Labor. We feel this has been delayed for the wrong reasons. We hope the Republican majority will move on Ms. Herman's nomination very quickly. Unfortunately, your bill has become a captive in this negotiation. 
The other measure that came up here today is one I would like to address for a moment, one that I feel an affinity to, the question of disaster assistance. In 1993, in my congressional district, in downstate Illinois, we were literally inundated by the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, and it was awful. 
I feel very badly for families that are victimized by disasters. But I will tell you. Some disasters come and go very, very quickly. In the dead of night a tornado rips through a town, and by the next morning people are picking up the pieces, clearing the rubble, and planning for rebuilding. A fire rips through an area and people the next day are talking about demolition and reconstruction. But a flood lingers and lingers. Mr. President, 125,000 Americans are now homeless in North Dakota and Minnesota because of this flood. The pictures that I have seen make my experience in downstate Illinois almost pale in comparison. That is something I thought I would never see because the flood that we experienced was devastating. 
It is really sad, though, as we consider the response of this Nation through our Government to this disaster, that we have seen other issues extraneous to the issue at hand really take center stage. I hope that the Appropriations Committee will think about the families that have been hurt, businesses destroyed, and the farms inundated when they markup this afternoon. Give us a clean disaster bill that will help these families. There are important issues to debate. But save those for another day. Let's really come to the rescue of the families of this Nation. Let's show compassion for these families. 
I daresay there isn't a Senator in this body who could go up to North Dakota to one of shelters where these homeless people are now waiting and say, `You have to understand. We can't help you out until we have a momentous debate on another issue.' That would be a hard sell. I wouldn't want to have to do it. I hope that Members who have been spared in their own States and districts from this kind of disaster will try to commiserate with those of us who have been through it. It is time to think about those families, and this issue that is tying us up as to whether or not we will endure another Government shutdown. I pray that we will not. The decision about 2 years ago by the Republican majority to send a bill that they knew would be vetoed leading to the shutdown of the Government is a sad experience. I think all involved in that understand that today, and they want to avoid that in the future. That is a goal that I share. 
I don't agree with the approach that is being used because the continuing resolution bill is a complete abdication of responsibility by the Members of the Senate. It was only a few weeks ago that Members came to this floor, and in very convincing and pious tones talked about amending the Constitution of the United States to require the Senate and the House to meet their obligation and their responsibility to balance the budget. We were about to amend the Constitution of the United States because we take that issue so seriously. It failed by one vote. 
Despite all of the fervor and all of the commitment, where are we today? The Republican majority in the House and Senate has failed to meet its statutory obligation to produce a budget resolution which is a blueprint on how you will reach a balanced budget. That was supposed to have been done by April 15. Yet here we are weeks later without a budget resolution. Negotiations continue. 
So now the proposal is that we will amend or add to the disaster bill this blueprint for balancing the budget. Excuse me. The people in North Dakota whose homes have been flooded, whose kids who are out of school sitting in homeless shelters, people who are drinking water out of cans because you can't use the water system--they are gone--folks that do not know what has happened to articles in their lives that have meant so much to them--it is a little hard to explain to them that we have a more important thing to worry about than the roof over their heads or the food that they are going to eat. We have, instead, to worry about this continuous debate about balancing the budget. 
If the goal is to avoid shutting down the Government, I am about to offer a solution. It is one that I guarantee you will make certain that the Federal Government never shuts down again. It has two parts to it. The first part is this: No budget, no pay. If Members of House of Representatives fail to enact a budget, if Members of the Senate fail to enact a budget, they don't get paid. That will focus the attention of this Chamber and the House on getting its business done in a hurry. 
There is a second part. I call this `no dessert until you clean your plate.' Have you ever heard of that one? You did while you were growing up. Mom and dad used to tell you that one all the time. 
It is very simple. It merely says that the last appropriations bill to be enacted, the last spending bill to be enacted, would be the spending bill that covers this Chamber and the House of Representatives. So, if we fail to appropriate the money for the Department of Justice, or the Department of State, we know that the House and the Senate will not continue in business. `No dessert until you clean your plate.' Pass the spending bills for all the agencies of Government, and make ours the last one. And until all the others are enacted we cannot 
enact our own. 
I will guarantee you all of the volumes of debate that we will hear about balancing the budget may lead to a good conclusion and a good ending--that we will finally see Members who have their paychecks on line, and who will realize that the operations of the House and Senate are on the line, decide, `Yes, we had better pass the appropriations bill. Yes, we had better enact a balanced budget instead of a constitutional amendment, and get down to the business of passing bills.' 
It is sad that this Appropriations Committee in the Senate will come back this afternoon and amend this disaster bill, and embroil these poor people--125,000 homeless people who have lost their homes because of this flood--in the middle of this political debate. They really deserve better. America deserves better. 
We are a caring people. And the people in this Chamber--men and women alike, Democrats and Republicans--are caring people as well. Let us not sacrifice what is good about America, and what we are so proud of in the name of a political debate. Let us get down to the business of helping the flood victims, and then let us get down to the business of balancing the budget. 
I thank my colleague for yielding this time. I am sure we will return to this bill in earnest very soon, and his patience will be rewarded. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and join him today in introducing the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, Interstate 55 runs straight through Mississippi to Memphis and St. Louis before veering northeast into Springfield and Chicago. And, in addition to carrying cars with their passengers and trucks with their cargo, I-55 is a firearm freeway into my home State. Gunrunners ship trunkloads of guns up I-55 for use by criminals. 
Two years ago, one of those guns--that probably came into Illinois via I-55--was used to shoot Chicago Police Officer Daniel Doffyn in the head. Officer Doffyn was fresh out of the police academy. He was out on a burglary call, and a Tec-9 from Mississippi killed him. 
The legislation Senator Torricelli and I introduce today lets everyone know that we are committed to closing down the illegal gunrunning operations that put that Tec-9 into the hands of the man who killed Daniel Doffyn. 
And let no one underestimate the deadly impact of gunrunning across State lines. My home State of Illinois has tough gun laws. The local firearms dealers, police, and licensing authorities work hard to make sure that felons cannot go into a store and buy guns. They also work hard to keep the illegal gun market under control. 
But we have learned that one State alone cannot overpower the illegal gun market. Earlier this year we obtained data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms detailing the results of their efforts to trace guns used in crimes. We analyzed that data and produced a report. That report concluded that: 
First, guns used in crimes are most likely to come from just a few States with relatively weak gun control laws. Of the traceable guns used nationwide in crimes, 16,635 of the 47,068, or 35 percent, were out-of-State guns. 
Second, in States with strong gun laws, criminals obtain many of their guns from other States with weaker gun laws. 
Third, in States with lax gun laws, criminals obtain the majority of their guns from their home State. 
Fourth, the trafficking of guns moves primarily in one direction; from States with weak gun laws to States with tough gun laws. 
Fifth, when neighboring States have different levels of gun control laws, the State with lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns. 
In Illinois we can see how these conclusions play out. Illinois is a net traced-guns importer. In 1996, Illinois accounted for a total of 399 crime guns traced in all the other States combined. However, 1,596 guns from out of State were traced to crimes in Illinois. Thirty-five percent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were from out of State. And 10 percent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were from Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. Mississippi is the top supplier of out-of-State guns to Illinois, 306, and Wisconsin, 75. In contrast, Illinois exported only two guns traced to crime in Mississippi. 
In Mississppi, 268 guns involved in a crime were traced right back to Mississippi. In contrast, 306 Mississippi guns were traced to crimes in Illinois. Overall, Illinois pays a heavier price for Mississippi's lax gun control laws than Mississippi does. 
In contrast to the weak gun law States, Illinois has tough gun laws. That's why per capita, Illinois barely plays a role in the gunrunning business. States with laxer gun control laws are acting as exporters to Illinois. Illinois accounted for 2 percent of the gun exports traced in crimes in other States. In contrast, Texas and Florida accounted for almost 14 percent of those gun exports. 
Mr. President, I believe that it is time to shut down the firearms freeway to Illinois. That is why I am happy to sponsor this bill. This measure will let everyone know that we are quite serious about this, that the gunrunning black market is not just a harmless little business venture. People who run trunkloads of guns into another State are doing so for the sole purpose of making money off selling guns to people they know intend to use the gun in crime. This bill provides for a 3-year mandatory minimum for gunrunners. And the penalties will go up with the number of guns. If you run 50 guns, the penalty is 15 years. This legislation also makes gunrunning a RICO or racketeering predicate. With this tool in place, we can shut down entire gunrunning syndicates. 
I believe that we should all easily support this measure. It is aimed at taking guns out of the hands of criminals.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of citizens in Decatur, IL, who noticed a serious problem in their community, banded together to develop a solution to this problem, and then saw this practical solution through with a strong sense of commitment and compassion. 
All over this country, communities like Decatur are responding to the realization that the experiences of the earliest years of life have a powerful influence on how human beings develop. Research indicates that young children are developing brain patterns which will affect everything they do for the rest of their lives. The way they process information, the way they relate to other people, their abilities in every domain--these important human functions are being written on the minds of children at a time in their lives when basic needs often go unmet. We often realize the importance of this time only when it is too late to go back and fill in the gaps--when these children fail in school or commit a crime or become a burden to society. 
The people of Decatur, IL realized that the most important resource every child must have is a loving adult who cares for them, understands their needs, and makes that child a priority. How can we encourage parents to nurture their own children? How can we take advantage of this wonderful window of opportunity for young children by making sure they are loved and encouraged to develop? 
My friends in Decatur pondered these very questions in 1986 and the result is Baby Talk. Baby Talk is a community collaboration that reaches out to all parents of very young children and gives them the support that they need. This project is a joint effort of schools, hospitals, libraries, health clinics, Head Start, literacy projects, and local government. Baby Talk establishes a relationship with every family who has a newborn child in order to offer encouragement and support for the most important task they will ever undertake--raising a child. 
Baby Talk delivers programs where parents and children already are. In this way, Baby Talk reaches the entire population of child raising families casting a net of support over the community. Every parent of a child born in one of Decatur's two hospitals, receives a personal visit from Baby Talk to learn about their newborn's abilities and needs. Parents receive a book and advice about how to read aloud with their child. They also receive a magnet with the Baby Talk telephone number to call for assistance. 
Information about predictable challenges and encouragement for parents are provided at child clinics and through letters sent to families every 2 to 3 months through the child's first 3 years. `Baby Talk Times' and `Lapsit' groups meet weekly at many locations where parents and children play, sing, read books, and share their challenges and achievements. 
Parents who did not finish high school participate in Baby Talk's Even Start program where comprehensive family literacy programming is offered at the health department and Head Start. 
Baby Talk makes 4,000 contacts monthly with parents and children of different backgrounds and income levels. Fortunately, this service does not exist only in Decatur. Professionals from 30 States and Canada have received training and materials from the Baby Talk organization to serve families in their communities. 
Baby Talk has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for meeting Goal One of the America 2000 Strategy: `That by the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.' 
Recently, Baby Talk celebrated its 10th anniversary with the announcement that it has served the families of 20,000 babies. I would specifically like to commend the efforts of Claudia Quigg who was the initial pioneer of this effort and currently acts as Baby Talk's executive director. Through the efforts of Ms. Quigg and many other dedicated Baby Talk staff members, the city of Decatur is investing in its future and putting into practice their belief that a stitch in time saves nine. 
We are looking forward to the years ahead when thousands of Baby Talk children grow up to be caring, successful, and productive citizens. I present Baby Talk as an example of what can be accomplished when a community pulls together and stays committed to an important goal. I am very proud to have this organization performing their good works in my State and I hope others can learn from the accomplishments that Baby Talk has had in Illinois.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the attention of my colleagues a creative and talented journalist from my State--Ellen Warren. I am pleased to announce that Ellen will be inducted into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame on April 18. 
Chicago, as many of my colleagues know, has a reputation earned over many years as a place where the news business is taken seriously, by practitioners and consumers alike. By elected officials too, I might add. 
From the perceptive observations of Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley through the `Front Page' days of Ben Hecht to the latter day insights of Mike Royko, Chicago journalism has been of the highest quality--aggressive, competitive, and literary all at the same time. 
This year, the name of Ellen Warren of the Chicago Tribune will be among those added to the honor roll of journalists who have, over the course of a career, produced the highest quality work in one of the toughest news markets in the country. 
Ellen began her career in 1969 at the City News Bureau of Chicago, a legendary training ground for reporters. At the Chicago Daily News, she was a foreign correspondent as well as the first woman ever permanently assigned to the City Hall beat. At the Chicago Sun-Times, she covered, at various times, Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Carter White House. For Knight-Ridder newspapers, she covered the Bush White House. Since 1993, she has been based in Chicago and has carried out numerous assignments for the Tribune, including that of columnist and political writer. 
Ellen Warren has gone about her job with flair, honesty, and dedication. I happen to know that she also is a hall of fame-level wife and mother. For all of her accomplishments, I wish to add my congratulations to Ellen Warren on this occasion of her induction into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame.

Mr. DURBIN. April 15, we all know that date; 40 percent of the American taxpayers file their returns within the last 48 hours as the closing day comes for filing personal income tax returns. This year, for about the third year in succession, I did my own tax return. I do not know how many of my colleagues in the Senate and House do that. But I think it is a good educational experience. Perhaps we should pass a law that every Member of Congress should complete their own income tax returns. It might urge us on to reform the system and make it simpler so that families across America will have a little easier time of it in paying their taxes and meeting their responsibility to this Nation. 
When it comes to responsibility, there is also a responsibility in this Senate Chamber. April 15 is another deadline. April 15 is a deadline for passing a budget resolution. By this time we are required by law to have passed a budget resolution and started the appropriations process. 
I have been on Capitol Hill, I guess this is my 15th year, and I do not think I have ever seen happen what has happened this year because now April 15 will come and go without even so much as a real debate on a budget resolution. The President sent his version to Capitol Hill. I disagreed with some parts of it. But everyone had to concede that his approach to balancing the budget would in fact balance the budget. He met his obligation. He started the process. Of course, when it comes to Congress, that is not under the President's control, nor should it be. That is the control of the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate. The ball is on their side of the net. It is their time to put together a budget resolution and to spell out for the American people in very specific terms how can we reach a balanced budget. 
Just a few weeks ago we spent 2 weeks, maybe 3, perhaps 4 weeks, in the Chamber here debating an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, an amendment which said Congress has no choice; it must balance the budget. I voted against it. 
I did not think we needed to put into our Constitution an obligation which we all know we must accept. So many people on the other side, my friends on the Republican side, and a few Democrats stood up and said, `No, no, no, we need to have a constitutional imperative to force us to act.' Little did I know that just a few weeks later they would prove themselves true. The Republican leadership has been unable or unwilling to come forward with their offering about balancing the budget. 
The other night at the radio/TV correspondents' dinner the President had an interesting observation about how slow the pace is on Capitol Hill and, frankly, how boring it becomes as we go in, week in and week out, in the House and Senate, without addressing the real issues. The President said that the pace on Capitol Hill is so slow that C-SPAN, the television network which covers our hearings, has decided to play reruns from the previous Congress so people will keep up their interest on Capitol Hill. 
It is an amusing observation. I do not believe it is necessarily true, but it does reflect on the fact that for some reason we cannot get started up here this year. For some reason, Republican leadership has been unable to come forward with their offering for a budget resolution. Why would that be? Why would a party that is so dedicated to a constitutional amendment to force a balanced budget have such a difficult time meeting its statutory obligation to produce that budget resolution on the floor? 
The answer is fairly obvious: Because they have set up certain conditions for a balanced budget which they themselves cannot meet. They have suggested we should include tax cuts in any kind of balanced budget scenario. Coming out for tax cuts on April 15 may be the most popular thing a politician can do. But let's be very honest about it, as Senator Dole learned in the last campaign, just promising a tax cut is not enough. The American people have to understand it is attainable, it is reasonable, it will not in fact blow up our efforts to balance the budget. I think that is the problem that the majority, the Republicans, face here--how to meet the obligation of satisfying all of their rhetoric about tax cuts and still meet their obligation to balance the budget. Unfortunately, it does not work. 
They found 2 years ago when they were pushing a tax cut package even smaller than this one, they had reached such a crisis stage that we shut down the Government. We shut down the Government for the longest period of time in our Nation's history. That worries me, because I am afraid we may be on that same road again. 
I have the Durbin plan for dealing with Government shutdowns. There are two parts to it. The first part is a piece of legislation which says, `No dessert until you clean your plate.' Remember when Mom and Dad used to say that? I think we ought to say that when it comes to the business of Congress. Here is what I am driving at. I do not believe that we should consider the appropriation to keep Congress running on Capitol Hill until every other appropriation bill is passed. So, if there is going to be a Government shutdown of any agency, it will necessarily also shut down Congress. I think that will focus our attention on the fact that we cannot abide by a Government shutdown or impose on innocent Federal employees that sort of scenario. 
Second, the last time there was a shutdown under the leadership of the 104th Congress, three of us, I believe, in the House of Representatives said as long as the Government is shutting down, we are not going to take a paycheck, and we did not. If every other Member of the House and Senate would hew to the same standard, I will guarantee you will never see another Government shutdown. 
But, now, where are we? Where are the Republicans headed? What is their plan for balancing the budget? Will they stick with this massive tax cut package they cannot pay for? Will they turn around and try to cut Medicare again, as deeply as they did last time? Will they make cuts in educational programs like college student loans? Will they cut environmental protection efforts, like toxic waste cleanup? I hope they are not on that course. But I do hope they are on the course of meeting their statutory obligation to produce a budget resolution, as they were required to under the law, today, April 15, tax day.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from California. She and I served together on the House Budget Committee, and I agree with her. In 15 years, I have never seen anything like this. For some reason, the Budget Committee is on vacation when it is supposed to be on the job. The statute says get moving by April 15, give us a budget resolution. We have an appropriations process to get started in the House, to move forward on in the Senate, and it cannot get started until we figure out what our priorities in spending are going to be. That is a very difficult thing to do with the high-flying rhetoric. The Republicans ran for the House and Senate saying, `Let us lead.' And these steely-eyed, styptic-hearted conservatives said, `We know how to balance a budget. Out of the way, bleeding-heart liberals. Give us a chance. We'll get rid of all this red ink. We'll get you on the straight and narrow.' 
Where is the budget? I don't see it. What do we have to do? As the Senator suggested earlier this morning, do we have to send out dogs to sniff out this budget? Where is it? Where on the floor? Is it in one of the committee meeting rooms on Capitol Hill? In one of the think tanks? Does the Heritage Foundation have a budget they want to send up here for us to take up? What are we waiting for? The American people met their obligation today. Some of them are sitting down right now saying, `Oh, my goodness, I have to finish this 1040 form. I have a legal responsibility to do it. My family is going to meet its legal responsibility.' When is this Congress going to meet its legal responsibility to find and prepare a budget resolution which keeps up with the rhetoric which we have heard now time and again in this Chamber and across the Nation? 
I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think the President has at least given us a starting document. Now, to my friends in the majority, on the Republican side, it is certainly your turn.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
I would like to address the issue that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee raised, and I am glad he stayed in the Chamber. I could not disagree with him more. If this really is a contest over the professionalism of Attorney General Janet Reno, I feel very confident to stand by her. On four separate occasions, Attorney General Reno has exercised the right to call for an independent counsel within the Clinton administration, three of those counsel investigating members appointed to the President's Cabinet and a fourth investigating the Whitewater controversy involving the Clinton family itself. It is very clear to me that Attorney General Reno is 
calling these as she sees them. 
Look at the situation that we now have before us. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Gingrich, leaders of the Republican Party, all come forward and say that if Attorney General Reno does not ask for an independent counsel, they are going do drag her up to Capitol Hill, put her before the committee, maybe put her under oath, and demand to know why she has not called for an independent counsel. 
I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate the independent counsel statute itself is hanging on by a slender thread if we try to politicize this process and pressure the Attorney General into calling for an investigation where it is not warranted. 
Keep in mind the creation of this statute came from an era when President Nixon fired Archibald Cox as a special prosecutor, the so-called Saturday Night Massacre. The independent counsel statute was created to try to put in place a third party or a dispassionate or a detached approach to investigations. And now, because those in the majority, the Republican Party, are dissatisfied that Attorney General Reno has not called for an independent counsel, you hear all sorts of comments about we are going to put the pressure on her; we are going to bring her up here and put her before a committee to answer all these questions.

Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield in just a moment. It just may be a fact that there is insufficient evidence to support the charges which the Senator from Utah and other Republicans believe. Now, this Attorney General has been involved in this investigation for a long period of time with 50 different FBI agents. If the newspaper reports are accurate, she has basically said that she will turn to her career prosecutors to make this call. I trust her judgment. I think we should trust her judgment. Applying political pressure at this point on the Attorney General is not in the best interests of a good investigation that may be necessary and may lead to the appointment of an independent counsel. 
I will be happy to yield.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. I want to say this much. If there has been any criticism of Attorney General Janet Reno in the last 6 months, it is that she is too independent. There was a question as to whether this President would even reappoint her because of her independence, the fact she had named four independent counsel. That has been the criticism of Attorney General Reno. She calls them as she sees them. She is a professional. 
She has made a decision today which the Republicans are 
unhappy with; they wanted an independent counsel named in this case. But when she named four previous independent counsel, they cheered--good judgment, good work. Now, when she has decided not to call for one, they want to bring her up to Capitol Hill, put her before the committee, start asking questions: Why won't you bend to this pressure? I hope she does not. I hope she calls it based on the evidence. 
On a show that I was on last night, one of my colleagues on the Republican side said, `Hasn't there been enough time here? Shouldn't she call for an independent counsel?' 
This is not about time. This is about evidence, credible witnesses. If they do not come forward with the evidence and with the testimony to justify an independent counsel, I hope Attorney General Reno will not bow to pressure here. I hope she will stand up for what she believes in. And as a Democrat, I am prepared to accept her decision. I believe she is professional enough that we can stand behind her. But we jeopardize the future of this statute, and I think we ought to think twice about it, by putting this kind of public pressure on the Attorney General trying to push her in one political direction or the other.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just say in closing, on this particular issue, before I move to the other with Senator Hagel, this is a matter of the Attorney General's discretion. Whether that Attorney General is a Democrat or a Republican, under this statute the Attorney General is to gather the evidence, listen to the testimony, and decide whether or not that evidence and testimony crosses a threshold to suggest that a crime has been committed, either by a covered person in the administration or a Member of Congress, or creating a conflict of interest between the administration and the investigation. 
If I listened and heard correctly, the Senator from Utah questions whether or not an Attorney General, appointed by a President, can exercise appropriate discretion when there has been a suggestion that that President or his Cabinet be investigated. 
What the Senator from Utah calls into question is more than the judgment of any specific Attorney General. He calls into question the very existence of the statute. I think there are many deficiencies in this statute. I think we should address those, and perhaps reauthorize it with some changes. Among those changes, I might add, is that if an independent counsel is to be appointed, that independent counsel be truly independent. 
In the history of this statute, 15 independent counsels have been named: 11 Republicans, 2 Independents, 2 Democrats. This process has been loaded to appoint Republican independent counsels. And how? Because the three judges who make the appointment, named by the Chief Justice, have created a daisy chain, where they are appointed for 2 years as the statute calls for and then reappointed for another 2 years. They keep coming back, over and over and over again, the same people, making the same judgments about the appointment of independent counsel. 
I think this statute needs to be addressed. But, if we are going to attack this Attorney General because she has to exercise her discretion, believe me that is what the statute says that she must do. She must look at that evidence, decide whether it is credible, and decide whether to go forward. As unhappy as the Republicans may be with this decision by the Attorney General, I trust her judgment. I trust her professional judgment. If she says at this moment it is not warranted, I think she is right. I will stand by it. 
Should she change her mind at some later date, I will accept that decision, too. But to call her up here and put her under pressure because she has made that decision is a serious, serious mistake. 
At this point I believe there has been a unanimous-consent request for 10 minutes for Senator Hagel and myself to address another issue, is that correct?

It is one of our first bills as new Members of the U.S. Senate and one that is very important, not only to our States but also to the Nation. I think it is extremely fitting that Senator Hagel and 14 of our colleagues have joined me in introducing a bipartisan bill to provide tax relief for a group of hard-working Americans, namely the self-employed. What we are trying to do with this bill, and I think it is appropriate to discuss it on April 15, is to say that people who are self-employed, small business people, farmers and the like, should enjoy the same tax benefits of deduction for health insurance premiums as corporations. This is only simple fairness. 
If I work for a big company, they can literally write off every penny of the cost of my health insurance that they pay. However, if I happen to be a farmer in central Illinois, or a self-employed woman in Chicago working at home at a computer, and I go to buy health insurance, only 40 percent of the premiums could be deducted. That is unfair and it creates a real disadvantage. We should encourage people to take out health insurance. The best way to encourage them to do it is to make it more affordable by providing full deductibility. In my State of Illinois there are over 400,000 people who are self-employed who would benefit from this tax relief. In fact, over 3 million Americans who are self-employed do not have health insurance. That represents 25 percent of the self-employed. That is a high percentage compared to other groups. 
So, what Senator Hagel and I are trying to do with our legislation is to level the playing field, give them all equal treatment and fair treatment. I think this tax relief could be worth $500 or $1,000 for somebody today who could deduct only 40 percent, but in the future could deduct 100 percent under our legislation. 
I thank my colleague for joining me in introducing this bill. It is supported not only by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Farm Bureau, the Pork Producers, the Corn Growers and the Farmers Union, but also by the National Association of Women Business Owners. Between 1987 and 1996 the number of women-owned businesses increased by 78 percent, and about 80 percent of these are individual proprietorships. 
I think this is an issue whose time has come. I have spoken to many of my colleagues and they believe that is the case, too. I hope we can work as part of any budget agreement to include this provision.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators Leahy, Feinstein and Torricelli, legislation dealing with the three-judge panel that appoints independent counsels. 
In the last few days, we have heard a flurry of speeches about the appointment of an independent counsel and about the grasp that the Attorney General has on her job. Recently some Members of Congress have suggested that we should open an investigation on the Attorney General because of her decision not to seek the appointment of an independent counsel. 
This is a new high in the efforts to politicize the independent counsel statute and a new low in bullying tactics. 
And, Mr. President, these tactics have worked insofar as their goal was to politicize this issue. Many Americans now view this statute as just another political football. Here in Congress, we toss about calls for an independent counsel. We threaten to minutely examine every act of the Attorney General in her efforts to carry out her duties under the statute. 
Meanwhile, one of the most important institutions to the operation of the independent counsel statute goes unexamined. The three-judge panel that appoints and oversees the independent counsels wields enormous power. And it has tainted itself through close connections to partisan politics and through the appointment of special counsels who are likewise partisans. 
This panel seems to operate free of any genuine scrutiny. It plays one of the most important roles in the administration of the statute. And it is the most in need of some oversight. 
The last time an independent counsel was appointed, we all saw just how embroiled that three-judge panel is in partisan politics. The head of that panel, the Republican-appointed David Sentelle, had lunch with two Republican Senators just a few weeks before he appointed an independent counsel who was a Republican Justice Department official and who had just recently publicly contemplated running for the Senate as a Republican. As a result of this incident, five former presidents of the American Bar Association issued a letter rebuking Judge Sentelle for his actions. 
A recent article in the Legal Times noted: 
 In fact, with the appointment of independent counsel[s] handled by a highly secretive three-judge panel, named by the chief judge of the United States, it could be argued that one partisan system has simply been supplanted by another. 
Let me explain what the panel currently does and how that contributes to the failings of the statute. 
The first flaw in the statute is in the appointment terms of the judges who sit on this special panel. Currently, three judges are appointed to the panel by the Chief Justice of the United States. The judges are appointed to the division for 2-year terms. 
But David Sentelle is now serving his third 2-year term. Judge John D. Butzner, Jr., is in the middle of his fourth 2-year term. And Judge Peter T. Fay is in the midst of his second 2-year term. 
In short, some judges are becoming entrenched in the independent counsel process. 
A second flaw in the judges' panel is in its consistent failure to issue any rules of procedure and practice. In 1994, when we reauthorized the act, Congress called on the panel to promulgate rules of procedure for practice before it, clarify available avenues of appellate review, and undertake to catalog and preserve independent counsel reports and make public versions accessible upon request. 
They have not done so. Only recently, the panel issued some draft rules of procedure dealing with attorney fee applications, but in 3 years they do seem to have not otherwise complied with Congress's request. 
This special division is like a magician's hat: independent counsels emerge from it. But we do not know how. Are there any criteria used by the panel to appoint an independent counsel? Does the panel make any effort to assure that the person it appoints is actually independent? How does someone get this job--a job with a virtually unlimited budget and a stunning array of powers? 
We do not know because the Court will not tell us, even though we asked them to 3 years ago. 
We need to do a few things about this panel. The legislation I introduce today is intended to remove any taint of partisan politics from this panel. It requires that judges on the panel serve no more than two, 2-year terms. This will ensure that no one judge gets entrenched in appointing independent counsels. And it assures that the division does not get politicized. In addition, it is consistent with current law. Why have 2-year terms if the judges just stay on as long as they want? The 2-year term was clearly inserted with the view that judges would not stay on the division forever. 
In addition to limiting judges on the panel to 4 years, the measure I introduce requires that the division promulgate the very rules that we asked them to issue 3 years ago. 
The special division should not be a mysterious black box. People who practice before it should know the rules. Attorney fee applications are the most common things the Division has to deal with, but this provision also requires that the Special Division have rules governing the appointment of an independent counsel. We should know what criteria and what procedure they use to assure that the independent counsel is indeed independent and qualified. 
Mr. President, I hope we can all agree that this measure is vitally needed. It is simply aimed at improving the operation of the independent counsel statute not tearing it down. It's goal is to take some partisan politics out of the system and to put a little more independence back into the statute.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding. 
What extraordinary symmetry, what exceptional justice this evening that we consider the nomination of Pete Peterson to be our first Ambassador to Vietnam. 
Thirty-one years ago as an Air Force pilot, Pete Peterson was flying his 67th combat mission over Vietnam when his plane was shot down. He told me the story when we were colleagues in the House of Representatives. I will not forget that as long as I live, what he went through as that plane came crashing down and he was parachuting out, with broken bones and beaten up, run through the streets by the crowds and pushed into a prison cell, and then to spend 6 1/2 years--6 1/2 years--of his life as a prisoner of war, to come home finally in 1973 with all of the deserved tribute for his service to his country, to return to his home State of Florida and his family finally and then decide once again to make a commitment to this Nation and to run and serve in the House of Representatives and after three terms to be designated by the President of the United States, President Clinton, to be America's first Ambassador to Vietnam, the same country where his plane had crashed and where he had been a prisoner of war for so many years. 
I say to my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, who really said it so well, the quiet dignity of Pete Peterson will bring a lot to this job, the kind of stature which we need in those who speak for the United States. 
He served this country well for 27 years in the Air Force, 6 years in the House of Representatives, and now once again we have called Pete Peterson into service for his country. To think that he will be returning to Vietnam to speak for this great Nation, to meet some of the people who may have rescued his body and thrown him in prison and today will be greeting him is an amazing turn in history. But it is appropriate. 
I know what his agenda will be--not only to service this country well with honor, as he always has, but also to work 
diligently for a full accounting of the POWs/MIAs who were not accounted for from that conflict and also to bring some new level of understanding between our countries. 
I think Pete Peterson is clearly the person for this task. We are fortunate tonight to have this bipartisan feeling about Pete Peterson and his confirmation as Ambassador to Vietnam. 
I thank Senator Lott as the majority leader, Senator Daschle on the minority side, Senator Smith, particularly Senator John McCain of Arizona, a man who has lived this same experience, who carries those scars, and will for the rest of his life, as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, who worked diligently to bring Pete Peterson's nomination to the floor this evening. My hat is off to John McCain for his extraordinary efforts. 
My colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Reed, will speak as veterans of that war. I am not a veteran of that war, but I feel I am paying tribute to one of the best veterans of that war in Pete Peterson. This is his night and I want to tell him that it is time for the speeches to come to a close and for Pete Peterson's service to his country on a full-time basis to resume as our first Ambassador to Vietnam. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr President, one of this Nation's most pressing national security concerns is the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The case for this treaty is compelling. The CWC treaty was negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, two Republican administrations. It is now being moved to ratification by a Democratic administration. CWC is supported whole heartedly and overwhelmingly by the American people. According to a poll, 84 percent of all Americans support this convention. It also has the unconditional support of the U.S. chemical industry and the U.S. military as represented by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, General Shalikashvili, and Admiral Zumwalt among others. It is endorsed by veterans groups; religious organizations; the intelligence community; peace groups; societies for physicians, scientists, and engineers; and military organizations. It has already been ratified by 68 countries around the world including China, India, Japan, many of the former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries as well as our major West European allies. The fact of the matter is, the treaty is both effective and reasonable. It makes sense militarily and economically. 
Despite this unprecedented support from such diverse groups, the Convention has been languishing, awaiting a Senate vote since 1993. Very simply put, and to quote from an editorial in the Chicago Tribune: `This Treaty Ought To Be Ratified.' This Tribune editorial goes on to state, `In the annals of 20th century warfare, hardly a weapon short of nuclear explosives has produced such loathing and terror as those classified as chemical weapons.' When you are considering outlawing the development, production, transfer, acquisition, and use of chemical weapons, partisanship and obstructionism should not be an issue. 
There are many misstatements and much propaganda against the CWC. The truth is that there is a heavy price to pay if we are not an original signatory: The United States will have no place on the executive council; Americans won't be able to serve as inspectors; American chemical companies will lose significant business to overseas competitors because of mandatory trade sanctions; and U.S. credibility and influence will be undermined. We'll be in the same category as other nonsignatories such as Libya, Iran, and Syria. 
On the other hand, the ratification of CWC will make it less likely that our troops will ever again encounter chemical weapons in the battlefield; less likely that chemical weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists; and less likely that rogue states will have access to chemical weapons. Unfortunately, CWC is not the panacea to remove all threat of chemical weapons, but it is a first important step.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to memorialize 111 miners from the town of Centralia, IL, who died nearly 50 years ago on March 25, 1947, in one of the worst coal mining disasters in U.S. history. 
On that day, 142 men were working in mine No. 5 of the Centralia Coal Co. Only a few minutes remained before the end of their shift when there was an explosion in the mine. The blast raced through the tunnels beneath the town of Wamac on the southern edge of Centralia, leaving debris and poisonous fumes in its wake. 
Thirty-one men managed to escape, but 111 of their coworkers were trapped 540 feet underground. For 4 days, rescuers worked to save them, but they could not reach the miners in time. In a tragic discovery, the searchers found notes next to some of the miners' bodies that they had written on scraps of paper and cardboard as they lay dying. `Tell Dad to quit the mine and take care of Mom,' wrote one miner. `Tell baby and my loving boys good-bye and I am feeling weak. Lots of love.' Together, the men left behind 99 widows and 76 children under the age of 18. 
But the real tragedy for Centralia was that the disaster could have been prevented. As early as 1942--and continuing right up to the time of the explosion--State and Federal inspectors warned about dangerous conditions at the mine. In fact, when the blast occurred, the latest State and Federal reports were thumbtacked to a bulletin board outside the mine's wash house. 
While the inspectors found numerous safety violations, they were particularly concerned about the combustible coal dust which was so thick that it would collect in the miners' shoes as they worked. The miners themselves knew how dangerous the dust could be, and more than a year before the disaster, four of them sent a letter to Illinois Gov. Dwight H. Green warning that it might explode one day. `This is a plea to you,' they wrote, `to please save our lives, to please make the Department of Mines and Minerals enforce the laws at the No. 5 mine, before we have a dust explosion.' 
But neither the governor nor Federal officials nor the Centralia Coal Co. took any significant action. Investigators later determined that one of the main causes of the explosion was the dust the miners had feared. 
Three days after the disaster, Governor Green ordered State inspectors to close all unsafe coal mines. In Washington, Congress held hearings and launched an investigation. But for Centralia, IL, it was too late. 
As we near the 50th anniversary of this disaster, our thoughts are with the people of Centralia and the families of those who lost their lives. We are reminded that too often, we react to disasters rather than taking steps to prevent them. 
The greatest tribute we can give to the Centralia mine explosion victims is to ensure that critical worker safety and health protections are not weakened or destroyed. We must be vigilant in our efforts to make sure workers don't risk their lives simply by going to work.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to America's farm families and those involved, both directly and indirectly, in production agriculture. 
Today, is National Agriculture Day. It is an opportunity for all of America to pause, reflect, and be thankful that we enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. But, this doesn't happen by accident. 
Every day, 77,000 farm families in Illinois go about the business of producing the food and fiber that our State and our Nation needs to survive. To them I say, thank you. 
Mr. President, I am honored to represent the State of Illinois. It is the home of some of the most productive farm land in the world. Illinois farms produce corn, soybeans, pork, beef, wheat, dairy products, and many specialty crops. Our agribusiness community is vibrant. And, our researchers help provide answers to some of the most common as well as the most complex agricultural questions we know. 
Over the last few months, I've traveled my home State and talked to farmers and others involved in production agriculture. The message from my fellow Illinoisans has been clear--health insurance affordability and economic opportunity are priority issues. 
I believe that a 100-percent tax deduction for health insurance premiums is one of the most basic issues to farm families across this country. Because of the high cost of health insurance, especially individually purchased insurance, lack of affordability is a growing problem. Health insurance is particularly important to those involved in production agriculture because farming is one of the more dangerous occupations. Therefore, it is essential that farmers have access to quality health care and that they be covered by health insurance. 
To help with affordability of health insurance, I plan to introduce legislation that would allow farmers and other self-employed individuals to pay for their health insurance premiums with pretax dollars. When it comes to health insurance, farmers and small business owners deserve to be treated the same as corporations. Corporations are allowed to take an income tax deduction for the full cost of the health insurance premiums that they pay. 
The self-employed, including farmers, can only deduct 40 percent of their premiums this year. My bill would allow farmers to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums from their taxable income this year and every year thereafter. A 100-percent deduction for health insurance premiums can reduce the net cost of health insurance for a farm family by as much as $500 to $1,000 annually. This savings can make the difference between whether health insurance is affordable or price-prohibitive. The affordability of quality health insurance is vitally important to Illinois' and America's farm families. 
Mr. President, another important issue for rural America is finding new or alternative uses for our agricultural products to help ensure economic opportunity for farm families. Ethanol, a renewable fuel made from corn, is one of the best alternative use opportunities that exists today. 
Last week the Government Accounting Office released a report, Alcohol Fuels: Tax Incentives Have Had Little Effect on Air Quality or Energy Security.' Unfortunately, this report misses the point. That point is simple: Ethanol has a significant economic, environmental, and energy security impact in this country; one that past GAO reports have clearly recognized. The effect on air quality and energy security would be larger if more of our Nation s gasoline contained ethanol. 
Ethanol should not be a poster child for Government handouts or corporate welfare. The primary incentive--a 5.4-cents-per-gallon reduction in the gasoline excise tax for 10 percent ethanol blends--is not claimed by major ethanol-producing corporations. The incentive is claimed by thousands of gasoline marketers--mostly independent, small businesses--that sell ethanol blends all across the country. In other words, the incentive is claimed at corner gas stations, not in corporate boardrooms. 
On a day like today, it is important to point out the benefits of ethanol. The industry is responsible, both directly and indirectly, for more than 40,000 American jobs. Ethanol contributes more than $5.6 billion annually to our economy. Five percent of our Nation's corn crop goes to ethanol production. Corn growers have seen their incomes increased by more than $1.2 billion because of ethanol. This year over 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be produced. Thanks to the reformulated gasoline program, toxic air pollutants like benzene and carbon monoxide have fallen substantially. And, ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. 
Finally, Mr. President, in order for our country to continue to have a safe and abundant food supply we must support agricultural research. This year, we have an opportunity to reauthorize the research title of the farm bill. Congressional reauthorization will establish national policy for important agricultural research into the 21st century. In these times of constrained Federal budgets, it is vitally important to maintain an effective system for agricultural research. 
Agriculture-related research in this country is currently conducted at over 100 ARS labs, including Peoria, IL, and over 70 land grant institutions, including the University of Illinois. Unfortunately, the United State ranks behind Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in the percentage of total research and development funding that is dedicated to agriculture. From soybean diseases to water quality to biotechnology, agricultural research plays an important part in the safety and quality of our food and fiber system. 
Mr. President, last year Congress passed a comprehensive reauthorization of most farm programs. This year we need to continue that commitment by ensuring affordable health care and deductibility of premiums for farmers and the self-employed, promoting the use of alternative agricultural products like ethanol, and modernizing our agriculture system by continuing a strong and active investment in research. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from rural and urban areas to ensure that American agriculture remains a model of quality and efficiency for all nations.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to address an issue which is one that many of us have labored over for decades, the legacy of the Vietnam war. 
So many people have said and written that the returning veterans did not receive the credit which they deserved for putting their lives on the line for our Nation. Regardless of the wisdom or popularity of that war, so many of those veterans came home and, frankly, found it difficult to start their lives again in America. 
In this Congress of the United States about 12,000 men and women have served in the House of Representatives, and it is my understanding that 1,843 men and women have served in this U.S. Senate. 
It was my good fortune to serve in the House before I came to the Senate and my better fortune to meet an extraordinary individual in the House of Representatives, a Vietnam veteran, who had an amazing story to tell. This colleague of mine in the House from the State of Florida, Pete Peterson, was an Air Force pilot in the Vietnam war. Pete served 27 years in the Air Force. He gave most of his adult life in service to his country. But the most amazing part of his service in Vietnam was not in an airplane in the clouds but on the ground. For 6 1/2 years Pete Peterson was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
He is a very soft-spoken and friendly person. He hardly ever brings up the subject about his military service. But one day over lunch, I said, `Pete, if you are not uncomfortable to talk about it, tell us what you remember about those 6 1/2 years.' For the next hour Pete spoke and answered our questions from his colleagues in the House. I will tell you that my memory of that conversation will be with me for the rest of my life. To try for a moment to envision or imagine what it must have been like to spend 6 1/2 years in a prison camp in North Vietnam is almost beyond any of us. He talked about the deprivations, physical and mental, and how he managed to survive. 
Pete is not one to boast about it. He is not alone in having gone through that experience. Our colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain, had a similar experience as prisoner of war in Vietnam. I have not spoken to my colleague, John McCain about it. But I read about it in a book published recently entitled `The Nightingale Song,' which told the history and the story of others who went through that experience. 
The interesting thing about Pete Peterson is that he came out of that experience, went to work in Florida, and decided that there was more to give to this country. So he ran for the 
U.S. House of Representatives and was elected. 
Then in April of last year President Clinton turned to then Congressman Pete Peterson and asked him to undertake what was a major responsibility, to serve as the first U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam. It was a controversial posting. Some in this body and others really questioned whether or not we should have diplomatic relations. But many, like Pete Peterson and John McCain, believe that we have reached that moment in history where the best thing for both of our countries is to have diplomatic relations. I thought the President made a wise choice. 
Those who watched the program 60 Minutes which was on last Sunday night may have seen the segment about Pete Peterson, once a downed pilot in a rice paddy in Vietnam, pushed away into a prison camp for 6 1/2 years, now with the opportunity to return as the Ambassador from the United States of America to Vietnam and, I am certain, to return to that same village and meet the people who held him at bay and pushed him into that prisoner-of-war camp. 
So Pete Peterson's name was put up and suggested, and the reaction was positive. People said what a fitting choice to take someone who has been through this life experience, who has endured this time as a prisoner of war, and to ask him to serve as our Ambassador in Vietnam. 
Of course, his name was submitted to the Senate at that point for confirmation. Some problems arose and questions about whether or not as a sitting Congressman he could be appointed to a post that was created during his term in office. But after all was said and done, his name was resubmitted this year in January, and he received a favorable hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In fact, his sponsors at his hearing included not only his home State Senator, Senator Graham of Florida, but also Senator John McCain, a man from the opposite side of the aisle who identified with Pete's experience and said that he would be an excellent choice as the Ambassador to Vietnam. 
So we come this evening to the Chamber in the hopes that we can make it clear that his name, Pete Peterson's name, will come before this Senate for consideration and, I hope, confirmation in the very near future. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, and I had a conversation on this subject earlier in the day. He was kind enough to return to the Chamber for this moment to speak to this issue. I thank my colleague for doing that. I will at this point yield the floor so the Senator from Mississippi may make comments on this confirmation of Pete Peterson.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader. This will be good news in Marianna, FL, where Pete Peterson is waiting for word on his new assignment. He has accepted the important assignment for this country. He has given so much more than any of us have ever been asked to give. And this new assignment to Vietnam is one that Pete takes very seriously. 
My colleague and friend from Mississippi, the majority leader, has raised an important critical issue of the unaccounted for POWs and MIAs. I cannot think of a person who will take that responsibility more seriously than Pete Peterson, who knows men whom he served with in the Air Force and other branches who are not accounted for. And I am certain that he will work with diligence to try to establish their whereabouts to the satisfaction of their families as quickly as possible. 
Of course, in terms of our relations with Vietnam, that debate will go on, and our relationship with that country will be decided based on the conduct of Vietnam toward the United States and vice versa. A man of Pete Peterson's stature I think will enhance that relationship, and I am confident that when he is called for consideration on Tuesday or Wednesday after we return, he will receive strong bipartisan support for this assignment. 
I thank the majority leader for coming to the floor. I know he has a very busy schedule, but I consider this an important matter, as I am sure he does. I appreciate his cooperation. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for giving me this opportunity to speak first. 
I yield back my time. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the last several days of debate in this Chamber we have heard those who favored the appointment of a special counsel say that time is of the essence, and that we should move forward and ask the Attorney General to make this appointment as quickly as possible. In fact, they were so determined to pass this resolution as a bon voyage gift to the President as he heads off to the Helsinki summit that we had to vote today. Today, before the President left, we had to make certain that this gesture was made. Many of us felt this was unnecessary and ill-timed and, frankly, unprecedented, that this type of embarrassment would be directed at the President as he left our shores to head off for a critical summit with the only other superpower with nuclear weapons in the world. And yet those who prevailed on the majority side were convinced that time was of the essence: let us move forward and do it now. 
Catching that spirit, I come before the Senate today with the suggestion that we not stop with this resolution but go even further and plumb the depths of the real problem that we are examining here. It goes beyond the 1996 Presidential campaign. It goes beyond the Democratic Party. What we are focusing on is our very campaign finance system itself as used by Presidential candidates, congressional candidates, Democrats and, yes, Republicans. 
And so today I am hoping that that same sense of urgency, that same commitment to truth, and that same perseverance that we find changes to win back the confidence of the American people will be demonstrated when I call a resolution before this body in a few moments. 
You see, Mr. President, those who follow Federal election campaigns know that there have been some dramatic changes over the last few decades. Federal election campaign costs have increased from an estimated $2.65 billion in the 1996 cycle--that is a threefold increase over campaign spending just 20 years ago even adjusting for inflation--$2.6 billion on our campaigns. In the 1995-96 election cycle, the Democratic Party committees raised $332 million, a 73-percent increase over the $192 million raised just 4 years before. The Republicans outdid us, as usual, raising $549 million, a 74-percent increase over the $316 million that they raised 4 years earlier. 
Take a look at congressional races. In 1976, all congressional races in the United States cost $99 million. By 1996, 20 years later, that $99 million had mushroomed to $626 million--more than a sixfold increase. 
Soft money. Well, for those who do not follow this closely, it may be a curiosity to use these terms `hard money' and `soft money,' but politicians know what it is all about. Soft money is kind of the mystery money in politics. And has it grown. Take a look at the fact that since 1992, the amount of soft money in campaigns has tripled, from $86 million to $263 million. 
Stepping aside from the whole debate about the nature of campaigns and whether they are too negative, too personal and too nasty, most everyone will concede that we are plowing more and more money into our political campaigns in America. 
There is a curious thing that has to be noted, though. As political campaigns have become longer, more expensive, and more negative, voters have apparently decided not to participate in elections. Consider this. Between 1948 and 1968, 60 percent of the electorate showed up to vote in a Presidential election. Then from 1972 to 1992, we saw a 53 percent turnout, a decline after Watergate. Listen to what happened in 1996, the most expensive Federal election in our history for congressional candidates, senatorial candidates and Presidential candidates, heaping dollar upon dollar in this election process. The voters out there listened carefully and a majority of them decided to stay home. 
So, for the first time since 1948, we had fewer than 50 percent of the electorate turning out to vote in a Presidential election; 49 percent of the electorate turned out. Is it not interesting that the more money we plow into our election campaigns, the fewer voters turn out? 
Consider if you had a company and you were designing a marketing program and you went to the owners of the company and said, `We have just got the statistics and information back. After we spent millions of dollars on advertising, people are buying fewer products.' It might raise some serious questions. Maybe your advertising campaign is not what it should be--and I think the voters tell us that when they see negative ads. But perhaps the fact that you are spending more on advertising is not helping the low regard people have for your product. In this case, the voters told us, in 1996, in the November election, that they had a pretty low regard for the product, the candidates, all of us. 
I think there is a message here, an important message about the future of this democracy. We can talk about special investigations: Did someone violate the law in 1996, Democrat or Republican, and should we hold them accountable if they did? But if we do not get down to the root cause of the problem here, if we do not address what I consider to be the serious issue of campaign finance reform, I can guarantee the cynicism and skepticism among voters will just increase. So, we have heard a lot of talk today about the sense of urgency and the need to deal quickly with this whole question of campaign finance reform. Some of my colleagues have said, `Oh, don't move too quickly now; let us make sure we make the right changes.' 
Let me show a little illustration. How much time have we spent on the issue of campaign finance reform in the last 10 years? Mr. President, 6,742 pages of hearings; 3,361 floor speeches--add one for this one today; 2,748 pages of reports from the Congressional Research Service, 1,063 pages of committee reports; 113 votes in the Senate; 522 witnesses; 49 days of testimony; 29 sets of hearings by 8 different congressional committees; 17 filibusters; 8 cloture votes on one bill; 1 Senator arrested and dragged to the floor--with bodily injury, I might add--and 15 reports issued by 6 different congressional committees. And what do we have to show for it? Nada, zero, zilch, nothing. What we have to show for it is the call for an independent counsel to determine whether someone has violated the laws under the current system. I think there is a lot more to this. 
I hope my colleagues join me in believing that if this process of investigation does not lead to reform, the American people will be disappointed. It is one thing to be hyperinflated with moral rectitude about the violations of campaign law. But that is not enough. Just cataloging the sins of the current system, that is not enough. The real test is whether we are prepared to change the system, reform the law, and return public confidence to our democratic process. 
There are a lot of options out there. One of those that is frequently spoken of is the McCain-Feingold legislation, I believe the only bipartisan campaign reform bill before us. Two Republican Senators and, I believe, 22 Democratic Senators have come together in an effort to have campaign finance reform. I have cosponsored it. It may not be the best, or the only, but it is a good one. We should consider it as a starting point in the debate. 
Yesterday, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and others announced agreement to introduce a plan modeled after the Maine election law reform. It is a very interesting proposal which would really deflate the money in politics. Senator Wellstone is here to join me in this debate and describe that bill and his own thoughts on that subject. 
There are lots of ideas, good ideas. We have to really dedicate ourselves with the same sense of urgency and with the same passion to reforming the system that we are dedicated to investigating wrongdoing under the current political finance system. 
At this point, I yield to my colleague from Minnesota.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there have been a lot of headlines in the last several weeks of embarrassment to both political parties. There have been a lot of questions asked about the system by which we raise funds at all levels. Questions were raised about the use of a telephone by the Vice President, and I do not know, frankly, what was legal and what was proper in that situation, but we all know that at least two Members of this body have acknowledged that they used their office telephones in campaigns gone by to raise money. They said they will never do it again, as the Vice President has said. But it raises a bipartisan challenge to us in limiting campaign fundraising activities in any public building. 
There was a question raised as to whether or not an employee at the White House was handed a check for the Democratic National Committee which she then turned over to the committee, and whether that was legal or proper. We know 2 years ago a Republican Congressman on the floor of the House walked around handing out campaign checks from tobacco companies to their favorite candidates, and that, of course, raises a bipartisan question about the propriety of receiving or distributing campaign checks in a public building, on the floor of the House or the Senate. These are all legitimate and bipartisan questions. 
This morning's Washington Post raised a question on the front page as to whether a Member of Congress was putting some pressure on a certain group to raise money for him in the last campaign, and the pressure went so far as to suggest that the Ambassador from the country involved was saying, `This is unusual; we have never had this kind of pressure put on us.' The same charges are made against the White House: Did they go too far in soliciting contributions? Again, a bipartisan problem and one we clearly should address. 
For those who have tunnel vision on this and see all of the sins and wrongdoing only on the Democratic side, I think in all honesty, they know better. We are all guilty of this. We are guilty of this at the congressional level, at the Presidential level, Democrats and Republicans, and to merely turn that spotlight on one group or one party really does not get to the real challenge here. And the real challenge is, will we change the system? 
The resolution that I am going to offer says to the Senate, let us make a commitment, both sides of the aisle, that by a time certain, we will bring to this floor campaign finance reform legislation and pass it by a time certain. I do not presume what that might include. I do not presume to suggest that any bill pending might be passed. We might come up with a new work product completely, totally, but I do suggest to you that unless and until we make this commitment to reform the system, the skepticism and cynicism will continue and may increase. 
So, Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan and Wellstone, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 65, a resolution calling on the Senate to commit to bring comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation to the floor by May 31 and to adopt, as a goal, the enactment of such legislation by July 4 of this year; that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of Merrick Garland to be judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is interesting today in this debate that many people have spoken and no one has questioned his integrity nor his ability. He was born in Chicago, graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude, Harvard Law School and, as has been said by other speakers, had a distinguished career both as a lecturer at Harvard Law School and partner in a prestigious firm, and then prosecuting cases in the District of Columbia during the past few years, served as well in the Department of Justice. 
Despite Mr. Garland's obvious and many qualifications for this job, we must vote on whether he will serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Frankly, we should leap at the opportunity to have him on that court. But we are not here today to consider the significant contribution Mr. Garland's appointment could have to the D.C. circuit. Rather, we are focusing on whether the D.C. circuit needs 11 judges rather than 10 judges. 
I submit that this debate is not just about numbers. It is about the administration of justice; the fair, prompt, equitable, and thorough administration of justice is at stake. In all fairness, I must confess that I would rather err on the side of too many judges than too few. I would rather have too many judges doing too thorough and too thoughtful a job than too few judges rushed and careless in frantic efforts to handle their caseload. No one but the most shortsighted argues that the D.C. circuit does not need this 11th judge. Indeed, last year when the debate turned on whether a 12th judge was needed, the Reagan-appointed Judge Silberman was often cited in support of the effort to cut that 12th seat. However, he recently wrote to the Judiciary Committee and said, `I still believe we should have 11 active judges.' So why are we arguing about this 11th seat today? 
Some argue that D.C. circuit judges handle fewer cases per judge than any other circuit. I won't make an analogy to the Supreme Court in the number of cases that they handle. We know they are cases of great moment, and they should have the time to deliberate them in an appropriate manner. But the smaller number of cases per judge is an inaccurate way of measuring the work of the D.C. circuit judges. Let me say, at the outset, that we cannot overlook the fact that this circuit, more than most--probably more than any--has many administrative appeals to consider. As the Federal appeals court sitting in the Capital, the D.C. circuit handles the lion's share of administrative appeals. 
This chart that was prepared gives an idea of the administrative agency appeals filed per judge in all the Federal circuits across the United States. If you will note, D.C. circuit has 56 appeals filed per judge. Most other circuits are in the teens--the eighth circuit, only 8; the ninth circuit is 37. But it is a significantly different caseload that faces the judges in these circuits. 
For those who are not familiar with these administrative 
cases, I suggest that you not dismiss them because of the word `administrative.' Let me show you what I mean. This is a file for one administrative law case that a judge must pore through to come to a good conclusion. 
Let me show you another thing. This is a pro se petition from a prisoner in jail. There are many of these that are filed across the country. But consider the gravity and the challenge of this administrative appeal, as opposed to this rather smaller appeal in terms of volume. So these judges who serve in this circuit really bear an unusually large responsibility in extremely technical cases. Over the last 3 years, for which data is available, 45.3 percent of the cases filed in the D.C. circuit were administrative appeals of the size and complexity that I have just noted, compared with an average of 5.9 percent outside the D.C. circuit. 
Let me also add here that I could go into detail, but I will not because I know it is the intent of the Chair to move this matter to a vote very quickly. I also want to comment for a moment on the period of time that this very able nominee has waited for confirmation. It is unfortunate. In fact, it is sad, and it borders on tragic, that men and women who are prepared to give their lives to public service, who have gone through a withering process of investigation, by the FBI, by the Judiciary Committee, by the White House, by the American Bar Association, and so many others, still must wait over a year, in many cases, for their nominations to be considered by the Judiciary Committee and by this Chamber. 
I will tell you, a few days ago it was my good fortune to speak to a group of judges at the Supreme Court Building. As I walked through that building and saw the busts of great jurists who have served this country, I wondered how many of them could pass the test that we now impose on nominees today, how many of them would be willing to endure that test and to say that their family, friends, colleagues, and others that their lives will be on hold waiting for some decision from Capitol Hill. It does a great disservice to this country and to the judiciary for us to create a process that is so demanding that ordinary people would be discouraged from trying. 
We have, in this case, an extraordinary individual, Merrick Garland, who has waited patiently now for over a year to be considered by this Judiciary Committee and by this U.S. Senate. 
I hope those on the other side will make an effort to overcome the problems that we have seen over the past year. We really have to address the fact that there are so many vacancies on Federal benches across this country--not just in the District of Columbia but almost 100 nationwide--vacancies that need to be filled so that people will be treated fairly. If those vacancies are not filled with honest and competent individuals in a timely manner, it is a great disservice to this country. 
I think we should move and move quickly to approve this nomination of Merrick Garland. I hope that his patience will be rewarded today, as it should be. I am certain, based on his background and all that I have come to know of him and my personal meeting with him, that he will make an extraordinary contribution. 
We need the 11th judge in the D.C. circuit to handle this mountain of administrative appeals. How many people will come to us and complain, `Oh, the case is in court, and it is going to take forever. What is going on, Senator? What is going on, Congressman? Why aren't the courts more responsive?' Part of the problem is that the bench is vacant, the judges aren't appointed, and the caseload that has been imposed on these judges is overwhelming. 
We can take care of one circuit today by the appointment of this fine man to fill this seat. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the 1996 election cycle, unprecedented amounts of money freely flowed into and out of the campaign coffers of candidates for Federal public office. The time required to raise funds is excessive, and increasingly more expensive election campaigns have fostered the view that spending is out of control. 
Campaign finance reform is long overdue. The fact that we are embarking upon an intensive scrutiny of past campaign practices should not impede our effort to move swiftly and concurrently to correct deficiencies in the present system. 
We must do more than just point out the errors of the past. We must make changes for the future. 
Today, Senator Byron Dorgan and I submitted a resolution stating that it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should proceed to consideration, by no later than May 31, 1997, of comprehensive campaign finance reform that reduces spending on political campaigns and curtails the influence of special interest money in Federal elections, and that the Senate should adopt as a goal the final enactment of such legislation by no later than July 4, 1997.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak this morning on an issue of great importance to American foreign policy and to the future of Europe. 
This week, on March 11, Lithuanians and Lithuanian-Americans celebrated the seventh anniversary of the restoration of independence from Russia. Lithuania, for those who are not familiar, is a country of fewer than 4 million people. It is smaller than the State of South Carolina, and it is located between Belarus and the Baltic Sea. Historically, it has been the neighbor, sometimes friendly and sometimes not, of Russia and the Soviet Union. It is a nation that has had to struggle time and again for its freedom. Today, it is struggling to recover from the devastation of a half-century of Soviet occupation. 
The history of this little country is very interesting. During the middle ages, it was one of Europe's most powerful countries. In the 15th century, it was combined with Poland to create a new kingdom. In the late 18th century, when Poland was partitioned, Lithuania was divided between Russia and Prussia. The czars tried to Russify Lithuania during the 19th century, but their attempts to destroy Lithuanian culture gave rise to a Lithuanian nationalist movement supported by the Catholic Church. Ironically, it was this effort by the czars to Russify Lithuania which resulted in my being on the floor of the Senate today, because these efforts by the Russians led my mother's family to pick her up as a small girl and emigrate from Lithuania to the United States. They came here to preserve their Lithuanian culture, their Roman Catholic religion, and, of course, for the economic opportunity that the United States offered. 
In February 1918, Lithuania finally declared its independence from Russia. But, of course, World War II took its toll. 
In 1940, as a result of the Hitler-Stalin nonaggression pact, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement, Lithuania was taken over by the Soviet Union. In 1941, Hitler invaded Lithuania. After World War II, Stalin resumed his brutal repression and Sovietization of Lithuania, forbidding democratic institutions and subjugating the church. Countless thousands of Lithuanians gave their lives during the war and were then subjected to the Stalinist regime and deportation to Siberia. 
But the Lithuanian national movement would not die, and it rose again as the Soviet Union crumbled. Of the many things which I have been fortunate enough to witness in my lifetime, one of the most memorable was the restoration of Lithuania's independence. On February 24, 1990, while still occupied by the Soviet Union, Lithuania held free elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet. I was there on the day of the election, as part of a delegation sent by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The best efforts of the Soviets to keep us out of the country were not successful. The Lithuanian Reform Movement, called Sajudis, won the elections. Keep in mind, this tiny country was still considered by the Soviets to be part of the Soviet Union. 
On March 11, 1990, Lithuania declared the restoration of complete independence from the Soviet Union. In January, 1991, the Soviets struck back. A Soviet coup was attempted in Lithuania, leaving 13 Lithuanian civilians dead. 
After the failed August coup in Moscow, the United States recognized the Lithuanian Government on September 2, 1991. 
Since the restoration of independence, Lithuania and the other independent Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia, have held numerous free elections. In Lithuania's case, there have been three--in October 1992, February 1993, and October 1996. 
If you look at the relationship between Lithuania and the 
United States, it is one of mutual cooperation and support. The United States recognized Lithuania as an independent country in 1922 and never recognized the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement. 
During the years of the Soviet occupation of Eastern and Central Europe, the Senate and the House continued to pass resolutions and proclamations commemorating Captive Nations Week, and asking Americans across the country to join us in recognizing the fundamental freedom and independence of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 
In 1991, the United States recognized the Lithuanian Government, free of Soviet domination. And the United States continued to play a very important role because, even after Lithuania had restored its independence, there were 70,000 Soviet troops still on Lithuanian soil. President Clinton deserves credit for working very hard, through diplomatic channels, for the removal of those troops. When the troops finally left in August 1993, due to the President's good efforts, once and for all, the Lithuanians were free of occupation troops. 
Today, however, we are debating the next chapter, and an important one in the history of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and modern Europe. We are debating the enlargement of NATO, and the question of how much of a say Russia should have in this process. This summer, in Madrid, Spain, the members of the NATO alliance will gather together to consider whether new members will be allowed to join the alliance. 
All of us are aware of the important role that NATO played after World War II. NATO was the bulwark of Western democracy against the expansion of communism. The allies who came together in that alliance not only were setting out to protect themselves but to establish commonality in terms of values and culture--a commitment to democracy, a commitment to free markets. The NATO alliance has been successful. The Berlin Wall came down. The cold war came to an end. 
Now we are talking about a new NATO alliance, and asking ourselves what this NATO alliance would bring to the world. Certainly more than defense, because I do not think that is the paramount concern to Europe. It would be, in the words of Secretary Albright, an effort to `gain new allies who are eager and increasingly able to contribute to our common agenda for security, from fighting terrorism and weapons proliferation to ensuring stability.' 
The reason I have come to the floor today is to speak about the situation in Lithuania and the challenge we face on the question of NATO membership. It is said that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are likely to be invited to join NATO. I fully support that. My visit to Poland, I can tell you, was dominated by discussion about the future of NATO and whether Poland would be a part of it after all that Poland has suffered in the war and since. It is only right that this great nation be brought into an alliance with NATO. I fully support that. Nor do I object at all to Hungary and the Czech Republic being considered. 
What gives me pause, though, is the fact that there has been little mention by the United States or NATO allies about including the Baltic countries--Estonia, Latvia, and particularly Lithuania. 
I hope those who are considering this issue will pause for a moment and reflect on the importance of NATO membership to these small countries. I hope also that they will join me in asking this administration to think anew about the issue of membership in NATO for the Baltic countries. 
The Baltic countries, meanwhile, wonder about our intentions, and they worry that Russia will misinterpret our hesitation to include their countries in the NATO alliance as a signal that we still see the Baltics in some sort of `gray zone.' I can tell you this: the people in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia do not consider themselves in a `gray zone.' They want to be a part of modern Europe. 
There are some who say that including the Baltic countries in NATO might inflame the ultra-nationalists in Russia and destabilize the Yeltsin government. I think we should listen to leaders of the Baltics who have had some experience, in fact, more experience, close at hand, than the United States in dealing with the Russians. They know that any ambiguity in U.S. policy only emboldens the radicals in Russia. They know that if we are firm and fair, Russia will accept NATO enlargement. We should be mindful of Russian views but not fearful of their reaction. 
The Baltics, you see, are very fragile. This map may not be easy to see, but I would like to point out a few things of importance. 
This tiny little yellow area here is still part of Russia. It is known as Kaliningrad. The Russians have held on to it even though, as you can see, it is detached from Russia. It is, of course, a port on the Baltic Sea. But, even more importantly, it is a major military installation for the Russians. The Russians have 40,000 troops in Kaliningrad today, and they frequently traverse Poland, Belarus, and Lithuania with materials and troops going to and from Kaliningrad. 
Then, next to Lithuania you will see this former Soviet Republic, now an independent state, Belarus. There are 60,000 troops in Belarus, backed up by Russian troops. 
So here on its west, directly south and west of Lithuania, there are 40,000 Russian troops, and immediately to its east at least 60,000 troops. While this is happening, Lithuania has a very tiny defense force. It wouldn't even be characterized as an army by most modern definitions. Naturally, Lithuania is concerned about its own security. 
The three Baltic States came together to talk about common defense. They want to make certain that they maintain their independence regardless of the whims of history. They are not seeking to expand their territory. They are looking for peaceful development and only defensive capacity. They are making reforms within their militaries and within their countries to be ready to join NATO. They have provided troops for NATO-led operations in Bosnia. 
Let me tell you one brief story that I think is illustrative of the commitment of Lithuania to becoming a viable partner in NATO. 
When President Clinton and the United States decided to move forward to stop the genocide that was occurring in Bosnia, we created what is known as the IFOR group. These were armies from allied countries coming together to try to bring peace to the Balkans, a daunting task that has challenged generations, if not centuries, of those who live in the region. The tiny country of Lithuania, with 3.7 million people, which has a very, very small army, made an IFOR commitment, sending a small group to be part of this effort. Sadly, one of the casualties in Bosnia, as the result of a landmine, was a Lithuanian soldier who literally gave his life as part of this peacekeeping effort in Europe. A curious thing happened after that tragedy, because the Lithuanian Parliament then had to vote almost immediately on whether to send more troops to IFOR. 
Think about it for a moment. What would that have meant in the Senate of the United States or the House of Representatives if our country had lost proportionately as many as Lithuania had lost in this effort, and we had to then debate whether to expand the force that we had sent in? It would have been tough. Some would have said, `Wait a minute; if it means loss of life and bloodshed, perhaps we should think it over.' 
But the Lithuanian Parliament understood Lithuania's commitment and voted, even after the loss of this soldier's life, to expand its commitment to IFOR--to send even more troops into the area to cooperate with the United States and all of the NATO allies as part of IFOR. I think that says a lot about whether Lithuania wants to be a part of the future of the free world. 
The Baltics have also welcomed the placement in their countries of what is called the Regional Airspace Initiative, which is going to increase NATO's security and be located on Baltic soil. They want to make sure that the Baltics are integrated, through this defense capacity, into all of modern Europe. All three of the Baltic countries have joined the Council of Europe, and all three formally have applied for membership in the European Union, which is important for the prosperity of that region. 
So now we come to the point where we have to ask the hard question about whether or not Lithuania and the other Baltic countries should be members of NATO. I firmly believe they should be. I think the United States should make a clear and unequivocal commitment to Lithuania, to Latvia and to Estonia that they will be part of NATO, and welcome them into this new Europe, a Europe which brings together East and West finally in a combined, peaceful strategy and alliance. 
I am troubled by the fact that we have been at best ambivalent on this issue. Our official spokesmen in the State Department, the Department of Defense and other channels have been careful not to mention the Baltic countries. One of our leaders in Government has said that, `Well, we don't want to make the Russians too nervous. You know they are fearful of encirclement.' 
If you visited Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania today, you would be hard pressed to suggest that any of these countries have any type of motive to expand their territory or to in any way jeopardize the future of Russia. Yet a country like Lithuania, with 40,000 Russian troops in Kaliningrad and 60,000 troops in Belarus, can very well feel threatened by the current situation. 
During my visit to Lithuania and Poland a few weeks ago, I met with many representatives of government from every political party. And I can tell you, Madam President, that this issue cuts clearly across party lines--conservatives, liberals, right and left and center. Those who were formerly members of the Communist Party and now a part of democratic efforts in these countries all believe the same thing. NATO is the key to the future. 
I think the United States can be proud of the fact that it stood with the Baltic countries during those dark days after World War II, when they were forced into the Soviet Union and became, unwittingly and unwillingly, republics that were part of the Soviet Union. We said in the United States that we would never accept that. We viewed them as freedom-loving people. I was proud of that, proud as a Lithuanian-American whose mother was born in a small village in the southwest part of Lithuania, proud that we stood by them during 50 years of Soviet occupation. Then the moment came for their freedom, a moment that was marked with bloodshed. I regretted the fact that the United States wasn't the first in line to recognize their independence. In fact, 32 other nations in the world came forward to recognize a free and democratic Lithuania before the United States did. 
I am sorry that we were 33d, but I am glad that we did it. I am glad that we reaffirmed our commitment to the Baltic countries. 
During the course of my visit to Vilnius, the Capital of Lithuania, I visited a cemetery with a monument known as the Pieta. It is a monument to those who gave their lives during this recent struggle for independence in Lithuania. I was struck by the fact, as I walked along the gravestones of those martyrs to freedom in Lithuania, how many of them were teenagers, or in their early 20's, who lost their lives in the hope that Lithuania would be free. Many of them in their lifetimes had never known anything but Soviet domination, Communist domination, a domination where the Soviets tried to Russify the Lithuanian language, take away Lithuanian culture and traditions, close down Catholic churches and literally close down the press. They saw that. 
I saw as well, when I visited, in Kaunas, the archbishop, His Excellency Sigitas Tamkevicius, who is considered a saint, having spent many years in a Soviet prison for the audacity of publishing an underground journal, how much this country has been through, how much it has suffered. It is not unreasonable for us as leaders of democracy and freedom in the world to understand why Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia want to be part of our peace-loving and democratic alliance. 
I sincerely hope that the United States, starting first with the meeting between the President and President Yeltsin in Helsinki this coming week, and then again in Madrid this coming summer, will really try to show the initiative, to broach this discussion about Lithuania and the Baltic countries becoming part of the NATO alliance. I think it is important for us to say unequivocally that this will happen and we are committed to it, and to say as well, now let us discuss with these countries and with Russia when this will occur and how this will occur. 
It should be a transparent process. By that I mean we should say to the Russians this is clearly defensive in nature. These tiny countries are only looking for the assurance that they will have freedom and great opportunity in the future. 
I will close, Madam President, by saying that one of the more memorable moments in my trip to Lithuania was on Independence Day, on February 16, when on Sunday I stood in the square in front of the parliament in Vilnius and saw the people gathered singing the Lithuanian national anthem and then went to the cathedral for a Mass celebrated by the Cardinal of Lithuania. At the end of this Mass they once again sang the Lithuanian national anthem, and then closed with a Catholic hymn entitled `Maria, Maria.' My brother and I were standing there and looked around and saw men and women with tears rolling down their cheeks. This was the hymn that the Lithuanians turned to in their churches many times in clandestine masses to give them hope that they could survive the occupation by the Russians, the occupation by the Nazis, the occupation by the Soviets. These men and women have suffered so much in the name of freedom and independence, and now they are asking us today as leaders in the free world to invite them into this family of freedom-loving and peace-loving nations. 
I hope I can prevail on my colleagues in the Senate to join with me in encouraging the United States to include the Baltic countries, as well as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and all the other countries that are genuinely interested in becoming peace-loving partners in NATO. I think that will continue the great legacy that really defines America. 
We are not out to conquer territory. We have defied history by being the conquerors in World War II and literally working as hard as we could to rebuild the vanquished, and now we have again the chance to say as we embark on this 21st century that this NATO alliance will guarantee that a new Europe, East and West together, will be a peaceful Europe for decades to come. 
I thank the Chair. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague for yielding, and I join him in this statement this morning. 
For the last several weeks we have listened to the Republican leaders standing next to stacks of budget books in full-throated pride for balanced budgets, the key to America's economic future, the rallying point for this Nation to come together to balance the budget. 
Their call for a constitutional amendment did not pass. It failed by one vote. I voted against it. And what I said then I will say now. The job before us is not to amend the Constitution but to balance the budget. And the two are not the same. Amending the Constitution is no guarantee that we will have a balanced budget tomorrow or the next day. The only guarantee that we can offer the American people is to our actions, actions in this Chamber and the House coming together with the President and reaching an agreement. 
Many years ago, there was a Senator from Illinois whose name was Everett McKinley Dirksen. He served with my colleague from West Virginia. Senator Dirksen, in the early 1960's, made a momentous decision and decided to support civil rights legislation for the first time in his career. When Senator Dirksen was asked why, after years of resistance, he came to the point where he supported this legislation, he said, `There is nothing more pregnant than an idea whose time has come.' 
If the idea of a balanced budget has come, the obvious question is why the Republican leadership in control of the Senate and the House has not met their responsibility under the law to put together a budget, to bring it forward so the American people can see what their priorities are. Why in the name of all that is holy would they hold back from this responsibility? 
I can tell you why. It is fairly clear. They have a serious problem. The Republicans have overpromised. They have promised tax cuts that create serious problems in balancing the budget. These tax cuts that have been promised by the Republicans this year are in excess of the tax cuts promised in the heralded Contract With America, which was presented for 2 years before Congress. Do you remember that scenario? At that time, the Republicans came forward and said, in the Contract With America, we are going to make the following tax cuts. And in order to pay for those tax cuts, we are going to cut programs. 
When you took a close look at those tax cuts, you realized that they primarily went to wealthy people. A lot of us on the Democratic side of the aisle said, now, is that fair, to propose a package of tax cuts at a time when we are trying to balance the budget, when the tax cuts go to the wealthiest people in America? Then we took a look as well and said, well, how will they pay for them? 
The proposals coming from the Republican side suggested deep cuts in Medicare, in Medicaid, in environmental protection programs, and college student loan programs, to name but a few. The President said: I will not buy it; it is not fair; we have to balance the budget, but we cannot do it at the expense of these critical programs like Medicare and college student loans and protection of the environment. So the President vetoed their bill. 
They said, if that is what the President wants, we will close down the Government, and they did--two separate occasions, the longest shutdowns in the history of U.S. Government occasioned because of the inability of Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on balancing the budget. 
After that experience came an election, and the American people, I thought, were given one of the clearest choices in our history--on one side, the Dole and Gingrich approach, and on the other side the Clinton-Gore approach and that supported by many of us as Democrats. 
I think those were two sharply contrasting views of the world, and I expected the American electorate to speak in one voice and say, given this fork in the road, this is the course we want to travel. 
The American people made a decision in the election last November, and they decided they wanted both. They wanted to preserve the Democratic leadership in the White House with the President, but they wanted to preserve Republican leadership in Congress. 
Now this odd couple comes together, a Republican Congress and a Democratic President, trying to divine exactly what is the message sent by the American people. I think the message is easy to divine, and here is what I think it is. Balance the budget. Be fiscally responsible. But do it in a way that does not harm the most important programs to American families. 
I do not think that is an unreasonable request, and I think it reflects where most Americans stand when they look to our future. Now the President has stepped forward and met his share of the burden. He has produced a budget which comes to balance by 2002, a budget which makes cuts and makes changes that he believes and I believe will reach balance without cutting important programs, and the President adds a safety valve. If he is wrong, if 5 or 6 years from now he has guessed wrong and we end up out of balance, the President has a trigger mechanism that comes in and makes an across-the-board cut to reach balance. Even the Congressional Budget Office, which has not been friendly to many Democratic proposals recently, has had to concede that is a way of balancing the budget. It is a trigger mechanism which will, in fact, make certain that the budget comes to balance. 
So the President put his proposal on the table, and if you 
follow recent history, in the natural course of events it is now the turn of the Republican leadership in Congress to come forward with their proposal. As was said by my friend from North Dakota, after viewing for weeks stacks of budget books that were viewed with derision by those who supported a constitutional amendment, we cannot find a single sheaf of paper on the Republican side suggesting how they will reach a balanced budget. 
The reason? They have painted themselves in a corner. They find themselves in an impossible position. They have overpromised on tax cuts for wealthy people, even more than in the Contract With America, and they cannot figure out how to pay for it and balance the budget. So they have stepped back, removed themselves from the fray, and have basically said to the President, give us another budget now. You gave us one. Let us see a second one. 
I am sorry, but the legislation that we have passed involving the budget and the history of these institutions suggests the President has met his responsibility and now it is the responsibility of the Republican leadership to come forward. They understand that if they are going to protect and preserve the tax cuts they have called for, it will force even deeper cuts in Medicare, even deeper cuts in college student loans, even deeper cuts in environmental protection than they suggested 2 years ago. They are in that corner and do not know the way out. 
Let me suggest there is a way out. Reduce these tax cuts to those the President has targeted to help working families, make certain they are tax cuts we can afford, make certain as well that we preserve basic programs like college student loans and environmental protection. Let us work together in a bipartisan fashion to chart a course for Medicare that will bring it not only solvency but stability for years to come, and we can come up with this balanced budget. But it is time for the Republican leadership to step forward and to meet their responsibility.

Mr. DURBIN. But think of what happened when Senator Dole proposed a substantial tax cut as the keystone of his campaign. It fell flat. The American people are skeptical. They want to make sure we keep our eye on the ball, and we have to move toward balancing the budget. Tax cuts are important, but if they are at the expense of balancing the budget, or at the expense of important programs, the American people say, `Wait.'

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senators Kennedy and Kohl the `Durbin-Kennedy Empire State Building Counter-Terrorism Act of 1997.' 
This legislation is spurred by the recent tragedy at the Empire State Building where a man in this country on a tourist visa shot and killed Chris Burmeister, a young Danish tourist, wounded six and then turned the gun on himself. 
But this bill is about much more than that one tragedy. It is an effort to address a real problem and to pass a sensible measure to deal with it. The shooting at the Empire State Building has sadly served to reveal a glaring gap in our laws--a gap that any would-be terrorist could walk through. 
The fact is that any foreign national who is coming into the United States on a tourist visa will probably pass through several airport security checks to determine whether or not he is carrying a firearm. But as we have learned in the tragedy at the Empire State Building, that foreign tourist can slip through our Nation's laws and can probably buy a gun once here in the United States more easily than you or I could. 
The motivation for the killing in New York is not clearly terrorist in nature. But I do not want to wait until a terrorist exploits these loopholes in order to act. Let us close the gap now. 
Let me briefly explain the problem. Currently, more than 20 million people a year come into the United States on nonimmigrant visas. Nearly 1 million of them came in via Chicago last year. And by the way, that number does not include people from Mexico and Canada. There are more than 50 types of nonimmigrant visas, including tourist visas, work visas, student visas, and diplomatic visas. These visas are issued to people who do not intend to reside permanently in the United States and they are issued without any kind of criminal background check of the applicant. 
Under the Brady law, anyone who wants to buy a gun in this country has to undergo a criminal background check. In the last 28 months, this requirement has stopped more than 186,000 illegal gun purchases. Seventy percent of those denied were felons. 
But what the Empire State Building shooting reveals is a gap in this law. Someone who just came to the United States on a tourist visa clearly does not have a criminal record in this country. Yet he or she may have such a record in their country of origin. The Brady bill cannot catch them since we do not search criminal records in foreign countries. So the tourist with a criminal record can easily get a gun. 
It is frightening to anticipate the damage that a foreign terrorist could wreak by exploiting this gap. But closing this loophole is easy. And we should do it now. Not later. 
The measure I propose is straightforward. It bars people who have come to this country on nonimmigrant visas from being able to purchase or possess a gun. 
Let me emphasize that the vast majority of the people who come to this country on nonimmigrant visas do not have any kind of criminal background and do not intend to buy guns or harm anyone. And that is why the legislation has two important and sensible exceptions. 
First, foreign nationals who enter this country on nonimmigrant visas and who are here for legitimate sporting purposes, law enforcement purposes or diplomatic purposes will be exempt. It only makes sense that someone who is here to take part in a shooting competition should be able to bring in their gun. 
The second exception allows people here on nonimmigrant visas to buy a firearm if they have been in this country for 6 months and if they can prove that they do not have a criminal record in their country of origin. 
Mr. President, this is a rational piece of legislation. We are all concerned with the growing terrorist threat in our country. No one who has followed the news in the last decade can be unaware of the fact that our Nation is a terrorist target. Well, we should not be putting guns in the hands of terrorists. This bill will stop that from happening. 
I hope all of us can work quickly to pass this measure.

 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Casimir Pulaski, as we commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth, and acknowledge his exemplary service to our country. 
Casimir Pulaski was born in Warka, Poland on March 4, 1747. Before coming to America in 1777, he distinguished himself in Poland's battle for independence from Russia. Forced to flee his native country because of his activities on behalf of Polish freedom, he became an exile. 
When Pulaski first arrived in America to aid the colonists in the American Revolution, he led a valiant counterattack at the Battle of Brandywine which saved the retreating American army from being cut off by the British. 
At the insistence of Gen. George Washington, the Continental Congress appointed Pulaski brigadier general and the first commander of the American cavalry. His services in the field justly won him the title of `Father of the American Cavalry.' 
On October 9, 1779, at the Battle of Savannah, GA, Pulaski led a daring, but fatal, charge against the heavily fortified British forces occupying the city. 
Today, the people of Illinois proudly remember General Pulaski's courageous sacrifice fighting for our Nation's independence, and his defense of the freedoms that we cherish in America. 
The anniversary of Casimir Pulaski's birth will be celebrated on March 2, 1997, at a special dinner ceremony in Chicago. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chicago Society of the Polish National Alliance for hosting this commemorative dinner, and commend its efforts to help restore the Pulaski Monument in Savannah, GA. 
The Pulaski Monument, whose cornerstone was laid by the Marquis Lafayette in 1825, is currently in a state of disrepair. With the hard work and dedication of the Chicago Society and donations from the people of Savannah, this 55-foot-tall historic monument will soon stand with renewed glory as a symbol of patriotism for all future generations of Americans. 
Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Brig. Gen. Casimir Pulaski on behalf of my home State of Illinois. I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating this heroic patriot and in honoring the many accomplishments Polish-Americans have made throughout history.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point I would like to address the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy to the balanced budget amendment. 
I would like for those who are listening to this debate to consider a possible and likely scenario at some point in our Nation's future. Let us assume the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution passes and is ratified by the States and takes effect. In 1 year we find that the budget for the coming year is out of balance. A group of 48 Senators proposes an across-the-board cut to balance the budget. Another group of 41 Senators favors deeper cuts in military spending to spare education and safety net programs. And then a group of 11 Senators comes forward and opposes those plans and says let us have significant cuts in the growth of Medicare. None of the groups will budge. The fiscal year begins with a budget that is clearly out of balance. The group of 11 Senators goes to court asking the courts to compel compliance with the balanced budget constitutional amendment requirements that outlays not exceed revenues for any fiscal year. 
One day you turn on the television, and you find the Supreme Court has listened to the briefs, has ordered Social Security, Medicare, highway funding, and medical research funding to be cut, and the Court has ordered an income tax increase of 1 percentage point for every group. The Court says the Constitution, as amended by the balanced budget amendment, clearly requires a balanced budget, and since Congress cannot act, the Court is required to step in. 
If this sounds farfetched, think of what has happened in our history in the last several decades where courts have said that Congress has failed to meet its constitutional obligation and that the courts will step in and order, for example, integration of school districts and the imposition of local property taxes to equalize educational opportunity which the courts have decided is not being offered and should be. 
The President, in my hypothetical, responds to this court order and says, I disagree with the Court requirement. I will assume the responsibility to balance the budget. The President says, I will impound funds. I will cut spending on certain programs so that the budget is in balance. 
If this sounds farfetched, I think those who have offered the amendment have not considered the very real likelihood that it could occur. Our Constitution now gives Congress the primary authority to raise and spend Federal funds. James Madison wrote in `The Federalist Papers,' No. 48.  
The legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people. 
This proposed amendment would dramatically alter the balance of power in the Constitution, and this amendment is silent on the issue about whether or not the courts can interpret and enforce the balanced budget amendment. I daresay neither the courts nor the President will stand idly by if the budget is not in balance and this constitutional amendment is in place. In fact, most of the supporters of the balanced budget amendment readily concede this scenario. 
A representative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified before my Judiciary Committee. He said: 
There is a legitimate and necessary role for the courts in ensuring compliance with the amendment. 
Someone from the National Taxpayers Union said: 
We oppose denying judicial review authority and believe it would be more difficult to enforce the provisions of this resolution if Congress were to add such language to the balanced budget amendment. 
The same basic testimony coming from the ultraconservative Family Research Counsel. 
It is not an unusual proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts that we specify the limits of power in interpreting the constitutional amendment and enforcing it. In fact, in 1994, Senator Danforth, a Republican, of Missouri, successfully modified the same amendment in the Chamber today including a proposal very similar to Senator Kennedy's. In 1995, the following year, Senator Nunn, a Democrat of Georgia, did the same. But the current version of this amendment contains neither of those provisions. I stand in support of Senator Kennedy's effort to once again include this sensible language. 
The constitutional amendment eliminates the fundamental distinction which exists between the legislative branch, the executive branch and judicial branch. It invites unelected judges to exercise budgetary powers with no opportunity for the people through the ballot box to affect those decisions. 
The President, of course, as I said, will not stand idly by either. He has a constitutional responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. Just as the courts are loathe to avoid their constitutional mandate, mark well my words: No President will avoid it either. If this Congress is gridlocked, at an impasse with the budget not in balance, a President will step in and the President will make his decision as to where the cuts will be made. And that decision may not be the will of the Congress. 
Legal scholars agree that what I have just described is not farfetched but likely to occur, and without Senator Kennedy's amendment it will occur. The President's powers of impoundment could include across-the-board cuts, specific programs abolished, and targeted expenditures intended for States or other agencies could be impounded. This has been acknowledged by those who have worked on budgetary matters in Washington for many years. 
The Kennedy amendment acknowledges the fundamental ambiguities inherent in the balanced budget amendment's silence regarding enforcement powers of the courts and Presidents. It recognizes that budgetary decisions should be made by the elected representatives of the people, not by the unelected judges or single executive. It avoids a fundamental shift in the allocation of power and authority among the Federal branches of Government and assures that Members of Congress will remain responsible for spending and for balancing the budget. It achieves these important goals by specifying that Congress shall have exclusive authority to enforce the balanced budget amendment unless specifically otherwise provided in implementing legislation. 
I am new to the Senate. This is the first time I have been engaged in this debate in the Senate. I find it incredible that the wisdom of this amendment was recognized in 1994, when offered by a Republican Senator from Missouri, and in 1995, when offered by a Democratic Senator from Georgia, and is not being included today as part of this amendment. The Senate today has an opportunity, through Senator Kennedy's initiative, to make a real difference and to correct this error, to make certain that it is clear we are not ceding a grant of power to either the executive branch or the judicial branch; we are accepting our responsibility to spell out with specificity the responsibility of Congress, the Senate and the House to balance the budget. 
At this point, I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for yielding time. 
I rise in support of the Feinstein substitute. I think that we ought to reflect for a moment what we are about. This is not the passage of a congratulatory resolution, nor is it enactment of a law which can be reconsidered at a later date. We are talking about amending the Constitution of the United States. In the last 205 years of our history we have done that 17 times. We should pause and reflect, and I think reflect on what the Senator from California has noted as the obvious flaws and weaknesses in the balanced budget amendment that is being brought to us today. 
Last night, many Members of the Senate were given the opportunity to visit the National Archives. I have to tell you quite honestly that in all the years I have lived in Washington I have not done that. I did last night, and saw the original of our Constitution. Just stopping for a moment, pausing, and looking at this great document in its original form humbles anyone who would call himself a modern day legislator. If we are to change the words of that great document, let us take care to do it rationally, calmly, and in a way that can be defended for decades to come. 
I am concerned that this whole debate over the balanced budget amendment has taken on a different style, a different life of its own, a different velocity than most political issues. 
We have over the last 10 or 15 years in Washington come to believe that this balanced budget amendment is the answer to America's prayers. Those who support it would suggest if we could just pass the balanced budget amendment, then things will be better--our debt lessened; interest rates will come down; the economy will forge forward helping everyone: businesses, working families alike. 
I do not doubt that some of those suggestions are true, but I think we should pause for a moment and really reflect on whether or not we are exaggerating the impact of this amendment, whether we are overstating the case. We in America have done that many times in our history. We have found what we considered to be those silver bullets, those big fixes that this Congress, many of its supporters, came forward with and said this is what we will do to change America and its future. 
For a moment, as we reflect about the historical impact of this debate, let us consider some of the big fixes in American history. Consider, for example, the battle for free silver. The free silver movement in the late 19th century called for unlimited free coinage of silver at a time when unstable economic factors were causing devastating economic depressions. Proponents of free silver, including the People's or Populist Party, agrarian interests, and silver miners, thought that free coinage of silver would increase the money supply, drive up the prices of agricultural products and help struggling farmers and working families. 
In the famous speech of William Jennings Bryan, of Illinois, `Thou shalt not crucify mankind on a cross of gold' was his basic plea for free silver. He believed, as did many in his time, if we just had free silver, that would be what America's economy needed to prosper. 
We hear echoes of William Jennings Bryan in the Chamber in this debate: if we just have a balanced budget amendment, then our Nation's problems will be solved. But some of us reflect on the fact that without a balanced budget constitutional amendment we are making real progress. We are, in fact, moving toward a balanced budget. We have seen more deficit reduction in the last 4 years than any time in this century. Our economy is moving forward, creating millions of jobs and opportunities for family farmers, for small businesses, for working families. And so as to the big fix of the balanced budget amendment, one has to question whether or not it is truly necessary to put this in our Constitution. 
Of course, after the free silver movement came another solution, the gold standard. This was an idea that had been kicking around for a long time. Unfortunately, it was too simplistic. Changes in the supply of gold were tied to mining discoveries rather than economic progress and caused shifts in commodity prices unrelated to the economy. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 reaffirmed the gold standard of the time, but by limiting the amount of base money in the economy the gold standard failed to allow the contraction and expansion of America's money supply. As the efforts to maintain the gold standard helped deepen the Depression, our Nation was forced to shift away from that gold standard. By 1971, dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold at an official rate. In 1976, the statutory link between the dollar and gold was officially severed. 
I can tell you, after 14 years of service in the House, there were many of my colleagues during that period of time who still believed passionately in the gold standard. They felt that if we returned to a gold standard, America's economy would spring forward--echoes again of debate we hear on the balanced budget amendment: if we can just pass this amendment, this will certainly solve America's economic problems. 
We went through an era of protective tariffs in America's history, too. This was another big fix. There were people who 
pushed for these tariffs, saying they would generate revenue for the Federal Government at the same time as protecting American manufacture and American agricultural production. The worst of these, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which occurred right after the Depression started, is credited, if you can use the term, with driving the American economy even deeper into a depression. 
In the early part of our Nation's history, the second half of the 19th century, the national banking issue was always on the forefront. It was one that was debated long and hard in this Chamber and by many others in terms of whether or not it would be the answer to America's problems. It was unable to fully address the problems of our Nation. Cooler heads prevailed. The idea of a national bank was amended. 
The point of these stories is to show you that in a quick survey of our Nation's history the silver bullets do not always hit their intended targets. Big fixes, like this balanced budget amendment, do not always have the intended effects. 
There is a critical difference between the suggestions of those in the past and what we are dealing with today. These were legislative proposals. If there was a mistake made on free silver or a national bank or the gold standard or a protective tariff, the next Congress could address it, change the law. But in this case, we are enshrining in our Constitution words that we believe will be the big fix. But what if we are wrong? 
And the Senator from California raises questions about the inherent wisdom of the balanced budget amendment before us: Do we really want to put in our Constitution for all times language that threatens the future of the Social Security trust fund? 
I think it has been clearly demonstrated with reports from the Congressional Research Service, with the statement of the Senator from California this morning, that we put our Social Security trust fund at risk with the balanced budget amendment that is before us. 
We also know that this balanced budget amendment does not give Congress or the Federal Government the flexibility to respond to a national economic emergency or a natural disaster. 
Over 1,000 economists have come forward in a rare show of unanimity and said this balanced budget amendment is bad economic policy for America. And yet when I offered an amendment to give more flexibility to respond to an emergency, it was rejected. I hope the Senator from California has better luck today. But her substitute will take care of that problem. 
There is also a concern about gridlock. What the Senator from California is proposing is that an extension of the debt limit be approved by a majority vote and not three-fifths. Those of us who have even a short memory can recall that within the last 24 months we had the two longest shutdowns in Federal Government history because of the failure of Congress to rally a majority to extend the debt limit. This constitutional amendment will up the ante, will increase the responsibility, raise the bar--a three-fifths vote. I think the Senator from California is right in saying that when it comes to extending the debt limit, it should be done by majority vote. 
I also applaud her comments on a capital budget. I would ask my colleagues to reflect on the fact that every business and virtually every State government has a capital and operating budget. At my town meetings people would come in and say: `Congressman, you just don't get it. I balance my checkbook every month. Why can't you balance the books out in Washington?' A good point. 
But I always ask them a question: `Do you have a mortgage on your home?' 
`Oh, sure.' 
`Do you pay it off at the end of every month?' 
`Oh, no. It's a 25- or 30-year mortgage.' 
`What's the difference?' 
`Well, this is a home that we are going to have for a long time. This is an investment, Congressman. This isn't the annual operating costs of our family. This is the annual investment of our family.' 
Families understand that. Americans understand that. The question is whether Members of the Senate understand it because this balanced budget amendment makes no distinction between capital investments for the future of our Nation and the operating expenses. 
And if we should decide, as part of the telecommunications revolution or for some other reason, to make a massive American investment in our future, in economic progress, this balanced budget amendment will tie our hands. It treats the interstate highway system the same way it treats the purchase of paper clips. That is wrong. 
The Senator from California addresses that and gives to Congress, even with the balanced budget amendment, the authority to establish a capital budget. 
Congress can and should balance the budget. I do not believe we need a constitutional amendment to do it. But if we are going to pass a balanced budget amendment, we must do it right. That is why I support the Feinstein substitute. 
I cannot support a balanced budget amendment that jeopardizes Social Security, prohibits prudent capital planning, risks even deeper recessions and unemployment, and invites gridlock and danger of default on Capitol Hill. The Feinstein substitute protects Social Security; it allows a capital budget; it allows a way to provide for economic recessions and avoid the threat of gridlock and default. 
The choice is clear. The Feinstein substitute is clearly the better choice, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Let me say in closing, those who are resisting any amendment to this underlying resolution, to the balanced budget amendment, I think are unfortunately taking the wrong approach. There are possibilities that those who support this amendment are just wrong. And if they are wrong, there is a lot at stake. 
Would it not be better if we could come together with a bipartisan consensus to address the serious flaws in this bill? Would it not be better if there were a little humility on the floor of the Senate and the House, and an understanding that perhaps these words, although politically right, may not be right for America's future? Would it not be better if the Members of the House and Senate could take a little walk down through the National Archives, take a look at that Constitution, and realize the gravity of the decision we are about to make?

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding on this important amendment. It is interesting; if you ask the American people about the balanced budget amendment, they will say in overwhelming numbers it is a great idea. I have to balance my checkbook. Why shouldn't the Federal Government have to balance its books? 
But then you say, well, what if in the process of balancing the books the Federal Government jeopardizes the Social Security trust fund? Whoa. Wait a minute. Let us think about this. The people who were overwhelmingly for the balanced budget amendment have second thoughts, as well they should. 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada addresses that very real concern. In our pursuit to balance the budget, let us not do it at the expense of Social Security. That is simple. The Senator from Nevada offers this amendment in good faith, asking Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, to come together and agree on this basic premise: yes, we will balance the budget but not at the expense of Social Security. 
Some would say this is a pretty simple proposition. Why are you debating this? Frankly, because there is a very serious difference of opinion, and it gets down to the fundamental flaw in this constitutional amendment. We are debating what is its greatest flaw, the failure of this measure to protect Social Security. The balanced budget amendment includes the Social Security trust fund in the calculation of whether the budget is in balance. That means it uses the Social Security trust fund to balance the rest of the Federal budget in the near term and prevents the proper use of the Social Security trust fund surplus to offset growing benefit payments in the long term. 
That is not the way to treat Social Security, a program which for 60 years has taken our parents and grandparents and their grandparents before them out of poverty into dignity. That is why I voted, and I will continue to vote, only for versions of the balanced budget amendment that protect Social Security by excluding the Social Security trust fund. 
We hear a lot of witnesses. We have them come before us to talk about this balanced budget constitutional amendment, as well we should. I say to those listening, in 205 years of this Nation's history we have only amended that great document, the Constitution, 17 times. Let us be careful. Let us listen to the counsel of those who come to speak to us. 
I was particularly struck by the testimony of one gentleman, called by my friend from Utah, the chairman of the committee, as a witness in favor of this balanced budget amendment. This gentleman was a Wall Street financier who holds a senior position in a major investment firm. He didn't see the issue of Social Security quite the same way that I do. He argued that excluding Social Security from the budget calculation--here are his words--`would be like going on a low-calorie diet but not counting chocolate.' 
I was struck by that analogy, that this man decided that, in the scheme of life, in the scheme of things, in the scheme of those programs and those things that are important to American families, Social Security was like chocolate candy. For 43 million Americans, let me suggest, Social Security is not like candy. It is not a luxury; it is a necessity. 
In my home State of Illinois, visit small-town America, find the widows living in town, the senior citizens living in the highrises, and ask them what Social Security means each month. You know what it means. If you have spoken to your parents and grandparents, you know it is the bread of life. It is what sustains so many people. For this witness, called by the majority, called by those who support the balanced budget amendment, to say that it is like chocolate candy really suggests to me that perhaps financiers, or Wall Street, see life a little differently than people who live on Main Street. 
The balanced budget amendment before us--and let me get to the heart of this--includes the trust fund in the budget calculation. It invites cuts in Social Security to balance the budget. That has always been my fear: Down the line the economy goes bad, revenues are decreasing, people are paying fewer taxes because they are out of work, and as a consequence here we are, trying to figure out how are we going to balance this budget next year. We do not have enough money coming in because people are unemployed, for example. So where do we turn? Where is there money? This is serious business. We cannot turn around and raise taxes in a recession. It is not popular at any time; it is very unpopular in a recession. Where do you turn? 
Lo and behold, where is the mother lode of Federal money? Open the door to the Social Security trust fund, billions of dollars being contributed to the fund today by those of us who are working, including Members of the Senate and House of Representatives, to build a balance so when the day comes that this Senator and those of like age turn up to ask for Social Security, the money will be there. Understood. 
Future Congresses should not be allowed to raid the Social Security trust fund, take away the savings that we planned for the rainy day that we know is coming, and use it to balance the budget. That is why the Senator from Nevada offers his amendment. Let us play this game fair. Let us say to the American people, `If you put the money in, in each of your paychecks, for Social Security in hopes it will be there for yourself, for your parents, that it be there.' It seems so obvious. 
Now let us take a look at Social Security in the long term. Those who want to include Social Security in the budget calculation argue that our proposal to protect Social Security would invite future Congresses to run deficits 32 years from now when the trust fund is exhausted. This concern is unfounded. Current law does not allow the Social Security trust fund to run a deficit. If the trust fund runs out of money, it cannot keep writing checks. 
Second, Congress has never authorized the Social Security trust fund to run an extended deficit. For a temporary time, around 1982 when there was a pending bankruptcy in the fund, we got close to that proposition, but only for time enough to develop a bipartisan solution. 
Third, the American people are not going to allow the Social Security trust fund to be depleted. This is the single most popular program in America today, not just for seniors but for their children. It gives peace of mind to me to know that my mother, 87 years old, who is living on railroad retirement, 
an analogous program to Social Security, has a monthly check coming in based on her having worked during the course of her life. And it means, for me and my children, less of a concern about her financial security. 
We are not going to turn away from that. We are never going to walk away from that. We are not going to allow the Social Security trust fund to be depleted. But we are not going to stand still and allow this balanced budget amendment to create a raid on Social Security. That is why this amendment is being offered. It just stops me cold to hear those on the other side say, `We'll never touch Social Security. Trust us.' 
I trust the Senator on the floor. I am not sure I will trust his successor, or his successor's successor, who will be bound by this same constitutional amendment. I don't know who they will be. I don't know what they will face. But at a minimum, let us put in this great document, this Constitution, language which protects our values. The Reid amendment does that. 
The Congressional Research Service is an interesting group because it's a professional organization, neither Democrat nor Republican. They are here to work for us, and if we have tough questions, we often turn to them to say, `What's the honest answer here? Don't give me the spin from the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee; give it right down the middle, black and white, as best you can determine.' They recently identified a critical reason for supporting Senator Reid's amendment. `The balanced budget amendment as currently drafted would prevent the proper use of the trust fund surplus to pay extra benefits that the baby boom generation will have earned but which will exceed revenues when they retire.' 
Here is what it means. We are paying more in Social Security today, and have since 1983, than we need to pay out. As I said earlier, we are building up a surplus because we know down the line, when baby boomers like myself show up for their Social Security, we are going to have more people knocking on the window asking for checks than wage earners paying in. So we are building up a balance, we of this generation, which will inure to our benefit down the line. So this surplus is being built up in the Social Security trust fund. But, if you read this amendment to the Constitution closely, the amendment offered by the chairman of the committee, you will see there is a problem. The problem is you cannot spend that surplus out of the Social Security trust fund without making up for it somewhere else. That is a major flaw. Let me tell you what it means in practical terms. 
Suppose I told you that a number of years from now you will face increasing expenses related to your retirement. You might decide to save up some money now so it will be available when that time comes. You might even decide to put the money in a special account in the bank and say, I am going to keep track of it and I am not going to touch it. I am going to need this when I retire. 
Now suppose I told you when the day came and the expenses occurred, you were welcome to spend the money that you have personally saved but, one condition, in order to spend the first dollar out of your savings you have to cut a dollar out of your spending, a dollar that you would otherwise spend for food or clothing or rent or utilities. 
You say, `Wait a minute, why did I save all this money if when the time comes when I need it I have to cut other expenditures, dollar for dollar, to use it? That is no good. That is no savings. That does not help me.' Let me say to my colleagues, that is exactly what is wrong with this amendment. This amendment says: In future generations, if we pass the balanced budget amendment and want to use the surplus in the Social Security trust fund, we can only do it if we cut other spending, balance it out. 
Is this something that this Senator came up with? Is this something that the Democrats dreamed up, an interpretation of the balanced budget amendment? No. What I have just described to you comes directly from the Congressional Research Service. It is a fatal flaw in this balanced budget amendment. 
You would think that those who would propose an amendment to the Constitution would be open to the possibility--the possibility--that what they want to put in that Constitution is not right and needs to be corrected and changed. But there has been resistance from the start to any amendments to this balanced budget amendment. These are the tablets of Moses, untouched by humans, brought to us, to this floor, to be accepted as is or else. 
I don't like that approach when it comes to amending our Constitution. I certainly don't believe it is fair when we are dealing with the fate of 43 million Americans, and I don't believe that we should allow this flawed version of the balanced budget amendment to go forward. 
I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, makes good sense, and I would predict this: If those who are pushing for this balanced budget amendment would, for a moment, stop, count to 10, perhaps accept a little more humble approach to this whole debate and amend in the protection of the Social Security trust fund, they would find a lot of Members coming forward, Democrats and Republicans, who could support it. To date, they haven't done it. But hope springs eternal. 
I will be voting for Senator Reid's amendment, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who value the importance of a Social Security trust fund to the American family will join us. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, for supporting my amendment and joining in the debate. He has raised two very important issues. One relates to the future of Social Security and its involvement in balancing the budget. The other relates directly to my amendment, to whether a supermajority vote will be required in the House and the Senate in times of a national disaster or a national economic emergency for the Congress to decide to spend more than we have received in tax revenues that year. 
The Senator from Utah, the chairman of the committee, has spoken in committee and on the floor. His point is made and made clearly. He believes that Social Security should compete with all the other Federal programs. He believes that it should be there with no special treatment, should not be excluded, should be brought to the debate and treated the same way. I respect his point of view. I disagree with it. 
But in order to bring this back to my amendment, I would like to focus on the debate which started last Thursday and continues this afternoon. 
Consider this possibility. If we are successful in balancing the budget in fiscal year 2002, as proposed by President Clinton and virtually all of the leadership in Congress, we will applaud, congratulate ourselves and believe, I think rightly, that our economy is in stronger shape. And now let's take a hypothetical. 
In the next year, 2003, there is a downturn in the American economy. This is not an extraordinary event. In fact, history tells us that once every 5 years we face such a downturn. So our budget is in balance and the next year, millions of Americans, because of this recession, are out of work; men and women who have been paying Federal taxes, no longer working. Naturally, they are not paying the taxes. 
On the other side of the coin, they are men and women who need a helping hand. They are men and women who need unemployment compensation from the Government. They are men and women who may need, in dire circumstances, food stamps to feed their children from the Government. They may also need Medicaid for hospitalization care of their children while they are unemployed from the Government. They may be determined to go back to work and headed for a job training program to get them qualified for another job, that training program coming from the Government. They may decide it is time to get that advanced degree or college degree and need to ask for a loan from the Government. In each of these instances, people who are not paying taxes, working families who, through no fault of their own, are out of work, turn to the Government for a helping hand. 
Any economist is going to tell you your books are not going to be in balance that next year. Congress will then have to decide whether in the year 2003, in this hypothetical, we will not have a balanced budget, because we don't want to relegate millions of unemployed Americans to the ash heap of economic history. We want to make certain they have the same chance other families have had to get back on their feet, and that is the purpose of the Durbin amendment. 
How will we reach that decision? Under the amendment to the Constitution being offered by the chairman, the Senator from Utah, it would take a three-fifths vote of the House and the Senate, approved by the President in order for us to decide, yes, in the year 2003, we are going to waive the requirements of a balanced budget in order to get the economy moving again, in order to get people back to work, not to risk going more deeply into the recession. 
The chairman stands and says this supermajority requirement, this 60-percent requirement, is not unreasonable. Surely, he says, the House and the Senate, faced with this economic challenge, will rise to the occasion, cast partisanship aside, avoid the personalities, rally around the flag, stand behind the families. I say to the chairman and to others of like mind, history suggests it might not be that easy. 
In the desk of each Senator is a publication known as the Senate Manual. It contains a lot of information about the rules of the Senate, and it also contains the Constitution of the United States. 
I ask the chairman to consider the following: When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, which we are seeking to amend with this resolution, there were 13 colonies organized under 
the Articles of Confederation. And they said that 9 of the 13 colonies would have to ratify the Constitution for it to go into effect. 
Think about this: The birth of our Nation, the creation of the United States of America, and turning to 13 legislatures in 13 colonies, this Constitution was given to them, asking them to be a part of our Federal system. 
What if we had given them the Constitution with a supermajority requirement in each of the legislatures? What if we had said to them, `Just to make certain that you don't do anything rash, we are going to require a 60-percent vote from the legislature of each colony to ratify the Constitution, and it will take 9 of the 13 colonies to do it'? 
Mr. President, I am not certain we would be a federal nation today, because if you reflect on the votes actually cast in each of the 13 colonies, you will find, unfortunately, that 5 of the 13 did not meet the supermajority requirement. Only 8 of the colonies would have met the chairman's supermajority requirement. 
So, though he believes we can rise to the occasion in economic recession, history tells us that even in the creation of this Republic, a supermajority requirement would have complicated things, slowed them down. I don't know if we would be standing today on the floor of the Senate of the United States of America. It is anyone's guess. But the suggestion that a supermajority requirement is something easy to come by belies history. 
What my amendment says is that a majority is necessary to make this decision. So, if we face a natural disaster--the big one in California, a hurricane in Florida, a hurricane in North Carolina--or a national recession, that we will come together as a national legislature and decide for that given year we will waive the requirement of a balanced budget because of a national economic emergency, a national disaster. 
The chairman suggests people will abuse this. They are going to call everything a national economic emergency. I don't think so. I think history tells us over the last 4 years, with the Clinton administration, with both a Democratic Congress and a Republican Congress, there has been a real commitment to deficit reduction. 
The chairman is standing next to his leaning tower of unbalanced budgets and suggesting to us that this is going to go on forever. But if the chairman would look closely over the last 4 years, he will see they are somewhat different than the other 24 years, because we have come to a bipartisan conclusion that we should and can reduce the deficit in a responsible way. 
President Clinton's administration, with the cooperation of a Democratic Congress and a Republican Congress, have brought 4 straight years of deficit reduction. This is the first time that has occurred in this century and far into the last century. So it suggests Congress has the message and has the goal in mind and is moving toward it in the right way. 
The chairman has said to us many times, this is something the American people want, a balanced budget, and he is right, not just by our empirical evidence of visiting our States and speaking to our constituents, but also by sophisticated polling time and again. People come forward and say, `Let's have a balanced budget.' But I say to the chairman, I will also add a couple things to that. 
If you would ask them whether they want to protect the Social Security trust fund as part of balancing the budget, they want that in an overwhelming way. 
If you would ask them whether or not it is right for our Nation to come to the rescue of families unemployed in the midst of a recession, for the Nation to come together to offer things to families to get back on their feet, I think you will find an overwhelming response. 
Because the bottom line for most American families, whose senses are dulled by all this economic theory rhetoric, is whether or not they are doing well for themselves. 
Are people in their households working? Do they have a job? Do the kids have a chance for a bright future? Is our economy expanding, creating good-paying jobs? I think that really is a bottom-line question. In election after election that is the test we are held to. 
This amendment does not meet this test. This amendment, by requiring a supermajority vote, says that this Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives will hold itself to such a standard as to question whether or not we can rise to the occasion when there is an economic necessity.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts. 
I think his point is well taken. I might add this. He has specified various groups that have come forward with reservations about this amendment. He and I both understand that in a time of economic turmoil, economic recession, some of the most vulnerable Americans are not even represented in Washington by a special interest group. They are the working poor, getting up every morning, and going to work, 40 hours a week, struggling to get by, barely beyond the minimum wage, often husbands and wives, sometimes working two jobs, trying to make ends meet, trying to keep their families together. 
That is what concerns me. They will be the first casualties in a recession. They will be the ones laid off. They will be the ones who will have to then make a decision about their lives and to get back on track. And what we are saying, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts and I agree, is that at various points in the modern history of America there have been opportunities for them created through Government programs that have helped. 
Oh, certainly they need their own personal responsibility, their own initiative. But the door was there for them to walk through. If that door is bolted shut with the supermajority requirement, these families, the working poor, the groups that the Senator from Massachusetts has outlined, they will be the first casualties. That is why I offered the amendment. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for speaking on behalf of the amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contribution to this debate. I agree with him that there are many leaders in both political parties who come to this issue with complete sincerity. He has noted my predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, the late Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, Warren Rudman, and the list goes on--men and women who have taken the time to analyze this situation and have come to the conclusion that a balanced budget amendment is in the best interest of this Nation. 
I respect all of those people, but I respectfully disagree with them when it comes to the specific language of this amendment. There is a reason why the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, after 26 years on Wall Street, came before our Judiciary Committee and testified that absent an amendment, such as the one I am offering today, this procedure that we are enshrining in the Constitution will tie our hands in times of economic emergency and recession. It will turn recessions into deeper recessions or even depressions. We can't justify that, in the name of clinging to the old school language of the balanced budget amendment. The Senator from New Hampshire says we may be within one or two votes. 
I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, if we can sit down in a calm, bipartisan way and address two aspects of this balanced budget amendment, the supermajority gridlock when it comes to a national disaster or national economic emergency, and protection of the Social Security trust fund, I would daresay to my friend from New Hampshire that we would not be quibbling over two votes. This amendment would leave the floor of the Senate and the House with the kind of substantial bipartisan majority which would say to the legislatures across America that this amendment is a better one, a better version. But you know what happens in this town, in `Wonderland, DC.' Special interest groups get dug in. You can't change a word. If you touch a word of it, you are betraying all of the trust that has been given you. Please, how seldom we rise to amend this Constitution. Should we not do it in a way that is responsible, in a way that meets the requirements of our future? 
You know, during the worst days of our budget deficits, during the Reagan and Bush administrations, there were many Members of the House--most are not serving now--that I served with, who used the balanced budget amendment as a figleaf for their fiscal recklessness. 
They would rush down and vote for these unbalanced budgets. They would lard up their districts. They would vote for big spending here and there. And then, when people said, `Well, how do you explain doing this when it produces such deficits?' `I am for a balanced budget amendment, I want to amend the Constitution, and I want to make it against the law for people to do what I am doing. That shows you how sincere I am.' 
Now we are like generals fighting the last war. That mentality, that language, brought to 1997 is what we want to put in and enshrine in this Constitution, saying that the wording and terms are inviolate, ignoring the realities. And, yet, the Treasury Secretary and over 1,000 recognized experts on the economy have come forward and warned us. They have warned us to think twice about this. It may have a surface political appeal. But how on God's green Earth is it going to work? 
The chairman spoke eloquently in the debate on Thursday regarding my amendment and said, `The very purpose of this provision of the distinguished Senator from Illinois is to make a balanced budget amendment easier to waive.' He went on to say, `Instead of trying to find ways to avoid fiscal responsibility, we ought to be working toward passing a strong balanced budget amendment that will help us to keep out of recessions in the first place.' 
I would like to say to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that if he can help us craft an amendment that will abolish recessions in the American economy, I will certainly consider it carefully. But I do not think we gain anything by suggesting that a balanced budget amendment will put an end to the business cycle. With or without this amendment we will someday face a recession, and the question is, How will we respond? 
For those who question whether or not this Senator from Illinois will vote for a balanced budget amendment, I have voted for five balanced budget amendments--five versions that protected Social Security, avoided the supermajority gridlock, and addressed important issues that protect the American people particularly in times of recession. 
I would also like to make note of another element. Some say that this will lead to irresponsible behavior by the Senate and the House; that, if the Durbin amendment is adopted requiring only a majority vote, the people will exploit this amendment. I do not think the critics have taken a close look. If the critics of this amendment will read it carefully, they will see that, in my amendment, anxiety is not the basis for waiving the balanced budget. They will see that it requires, in fact, specific action by the House and by the Senate for waiving. 
First, there must be an economic recession, or a serious economic emergency in the United States. 
Second, Congress, must declare that there is such a recession, or serious economic emergency, by joint resolution. 
Third, that resolution must be adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House. 
Fourth, that resolution must become law, which means it must be signed by the President, or enacted over his veto by two-thirds vote of both Houses. 
I do not believe that any future Congress will view this as an escape hatch to ignore the requirements of a balanced budget. If they do, it will be at their own political peril. 
I believe that the requirement which I have in my amendment to the balanced budget amendment will require public accountability, a record vote, and the determination by the House and the Senate that, in fact, we do face an economic emergency. 
The chairman has also said we do not need the Durbin amendment; that what we need to do is to run a surplus in our Treasury so we have a so-called rainy day fund that we can turn to to take care of working families who have lost their jobs. 
Unfortunately, the lead witness called by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to testify on behalf of the balanced budget amendment, former OMB Director James Miller, who is living proof of the redemption of politics, a man who has presided over a series of deficits as OMB Director and now is totally committed to a balanced budget since he no longer holds that position, came before us and said that, if he could change one thing in this balanced budget amendment, he would allow the Federal Government to establish a rainy day fund, or a stabilization fund. 
Mr. Miller knows, I know, and I think most do, the language being offered by the chairman in Senate Joint Resolution 1 does not allow the creation of a surplus, or this rainy day fund, to be there when our economy is in need. That, I think, is a serious shortcoming. 
Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board, a man credited by both political parties despite controversy of having used monetary policy to stabilize our economy, was testifying before the Budget Committee when I asked him point blank, `Are you for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?' He said that we should not put `detailed economic policy' into the Constitution. I asked him about the automatic stabilizers, the Government coming to the rescue of an economy because of a recession. He said, `It is far better to have a surplus or rainy day fund.' 
I am sorry to tell Chairman Greenspan that the balanced budget amendment before us today does not give us that option. It does not give us that option and, because it does not give us that option, is fatally flawed. 
Let me speak to the supermajority vote again. Not only would a supermajority vote result in too many of our predecessors failing to ratify our Constitution but a supermajority vote--think about this for a moment. Think about it in the context of the last 24 months, the last 24 months when this Government was in such chaos and gridlock that we had Government shutdowns. Because of the requirement of a supermajority vote? No. Because of the requirement of a majority vote to extend the debt limit of the United States. Facing the need to pass a debt limit bill simply acknowledging our obligation for debt already incurred, or about to be incurred, we could not do it by majority vote. Without that debt limit extension, Federal law required that the functions of Government stop. The Government was shut down not once but twice for a total of 27 days at the cost to taxpayers of over $1.4 billion for the failure of Congress to muster a majority vote. 
Now we hear from the proponents of this amendment, `Trust me. If we get into trouble, if there is a regional economic recession, if there is a disaster, a Midwest flood, or hurricane in Florida, surely this Congress will come together and do the responsible thing.' Well, we saw, unfortunately, in recent memory when the Congress did not rise to its responsibility, or rise to the occasion, and allowed these terrible Government shutdowns for lack of a majority vote. And now we are putting in the Constitution of the United States clear language to require a supermajority to respond to a national economic emergency. 
The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, said on Friday that past Congresses have passed economic stimulus packages in times of recession when they were needed with the necessary 60 votes, including 1993. Unfortunately, his recollection was not accurate. The inability to obtain 60 votes prevented enactment of antirecession legislation in 1993, and even the President's deficit reduction package, which turned out to be a tremendous boost to the economy, passed this body only when the Vice President voted with an `aye' vote. By supermajority it never would have occurred, and I am not certain where we would stand today in terms of our economic situation. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think the chairman, the Senator from Utah, concluded that automatic stabilizers do have some impact. I think that the chairman would agree with me that for a person who has lost his job or a person who has lost her job, the prospect of turning to the Government for unemployment insurance to continue to keep your family together not only stabilizes your situation while you search for another job but helps to stabilize the economy. 
I think the Senator from Utah would agree with me that unemployed workers seeking retraining and additional education to find a job in fact help to stabilize our economy. And that is exactly the point of this debate. 
I would concede every point made by the chairman about all of the other stabilizers that have evolved in our economy if he would concede that there is still a legitimate role of specific programs which step in to help the unemployed family. 
Let me give you an illustration of this which has been used in this debate before. This is an illustration of the business cycle in America from 1870 forward. The spikes on the top of the line are the good news. That is when the economy was expanding, businesses were growing, farmers were doing well, and jobs were being created. 
But every time we dip below this line, we see unemployment, businesses going out of business, farmers quitting, heading to town. And look at these spikes in the economy on the negative side leading up until about 1945 or 1947--much more pronounced, much more dramatic, deeper recessions, depressions, millions of Americans put out of work. 
But what happened after the mid-1940's? We see the downturns, but they are barely noticeable in comparison to what occurred before that time. 
Automatic stabilizers. The things which the Senator from Utah noted--global economy, monetary policy, so many other things--but what happens are the things I have noted as well. Families out of work had a place to turn. It was no longer survival of the fittest. If you had personal responsibility, if you were held accountable, you had a means to get back on your feet. 
Last Thursday, in this debate I talked about my friend, Bob Bergen, who lost his job at the factory in Springfield. Bob came by my house yesterday in Springfield, and we were talking about it. I said, `Bob, remind me. How did you get out of that factory job?' which he had been at for 22 years. They closed down the factory, and he got into the business of furnaces and air-conditioning. I said, `What was the name of the program?' 
`The JTPA Program. I signed up for it, and I went to the community college. I took the courses, and when they closed that plant, I was ready to do something with my life.' 
JTPA is a Federal Government program. It is one of the automatic stabilizers we have used in the past. To discount that or dismiss it and say that it has nothing to do with Bob Bergen now in a good business in Springfield, IL, employing his son, I might add, as are so many millions of others, is to ignore reality. 
Let me address one other point raised by the chairman. 
The chairman says that my use of the term `economic recession' is just not precise enough. I call the attention of the chairman to Senate Joint Resolution 1, to his own language, which allows, in section 5, Congress to waive all the provisions of the balanced budget amendment in times that `the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.' 
What does it mean? Troops in the field, troops under fire, whether or not we suspect that might occur or it already has? These sorts of things suggest that whatever the language of this constitutional amendment, our implementing legislation is going to have to be there to make certain that it is explained in detail. 
At this time I yield to the ranking Democrat, Senator Leahy.

Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will use this to conclude my remarks. 
I want to first thank my colleague, the Senator from Utah, for this debate, for his fairness throughout this debate and the prior debate, though we clearly disagree on a very important issue. I thank him for the fairness with which he has handled this debate and allowed me the opportunity to express my point of view. 
I said at the beginning of this debate I don't think there is a more serious vote that a Member of the House or Senate could make, absent a vote on whether the United States goes to war, than a vote on whether we amend this Constitution. When you think that on only 17 occasions in the 205 years, since 1791 have we actually amended this great document, each of us should pause and reflect and make certain that what we bring to the legislatures of this Nation for consideration is the very, very best. 
What we are talking about today, I think, is a critically important part of this debate. It is important because, as the Senator from Vermont, who was kind enough to join me in this debate, said, we are talking about the ability of the American people through their Government to respond to an economic emergency. 
There are those who would argue we need a supermajority, and history tells us in the last 2 years, the requirement of a majority vote resulted in gridlock and Government shutdown and national embarrassment. I worry that at some future date in the midst of an economic downturn, after this budget has been pared back dramatically to reach balance, when there are people and groups in this town, like hungry dogs on one bone, trying their very best to preserve something, requiring a supermajority vote to step up and help working families get back on their feet could be an invitation to gridlock at a time when those families need us the most. 
Mr. President, I close by making a final request to the fairminded, to the judicious chairman of this committee in asking him for one last consideration, and that is that we have the yeas and nays on the merits of this amendment. I think I know the outcome, but let us preserve in this debate an up-or-down vote on this question. Let us give, in the course of this debate, to the American people our best judgment on the merits. 
Let us not have this question, I think critical question, masked by some procedural vote that will suggest that this amendment on its face does not merit a yea-and-nay vote in the Senate. I think it does, and I would gladly give that right to any Senator in their effort to improve on a modification of a document which we all value and revere, the Constitution of the United States. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee for his cooperation in this effort. Though we may not see eye to eye on this amendment or the underlying amendment to the Constitution, he has been gracious and gentlemanly throughout. I appreciate that very much. 
I would also like to salute the Democratic leader from that same committee, the ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, for extending the same courtesy, both personally and through his staff. 
This is only the second time that I have taken the floor of the Senate to speak. And I consider it a high honor to follow the Senator from West Virginia. In the context of constitutional debate, I think we are all anxious to learn the views of the Senator from West Virginia because he reveres this Constitution, this great document, as much if not more than any other Member of the U.S. Senate. 
In the course of the last 14 years I have served in the U.S. House of Representatives. I have cast about 7,000 votes. There were many important votes among them. The most important vote in my estimation was when I was called on to vote and decide whether or not the United States would go to war. I knew with that vote and the decision made by this Congress that lives would be lost. Husbands, fathers, sons, daughters, loved ones would put their lives at risk because of that vote. I do not think I cast a more important vote in my congressional career. 
But immediately behind that vote I would have to put consideration of constitutional amendments. It is so rare that we in this body or in the other body have an opportunity to address amending this great Constitution that I hope we will all take it with a great deal of seriousness. Since 1791, 205 years ago, we have chosen to amend this great document only 27 times. Of course, the first 10, the Bill of Rights, were in that year, 1791. And each time an amendment has been suggested we have tried to step back and measure it against this Constitution, this document, and to determine whether or not that amendment or that suggestion really ranks with the importance of this great document. 
This amendment that we are considering, the balanced budget amendment, is one that has been debated at great length. And it has been debated by many people of both political parties for a long period of time. 
I hope that every Member of the Senate will come to this debate as I have with a new energy and a new determination to make certain that whatever we do in accepting or rejecting this amendment that it will bear the test of history, that those who come after us will judge us as having been thoughtful and reflective in determining whether or not this amendment belongs in this great document and whether this amendment will stand the test of time. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that this balanced budget amendment as offered stands the test of time, and that is why I am offering an amendment today to address what I consider to be a fundamental flaw in the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment that is before us today does not provide an adequate means for dealing with economic recessions or other serious economic emergencies that could unexpectedly throw the budget out of balance or require a fiscal response. It would tip the balance against working families and make it harder to help them recover from a recession or other economic emergency. In times of recession or economic slowdown it would force us to do exactly the wrong thing by making it more difficult for the Federal Government to respond to adverse economic circumstances. In the case of a regional economic downturn, or other economic emergency that fell short of a national recession, it would leave us unable to respond unless a supermajority of 60 percent or more agree to take action. 
That is why I offer this amendment to allow Congress and the President to waive the requirement of a balanced budget in those times when our country is experiencing an economic recession or 
serious economic emergency. I do not stand alone with this point of view. More than 1,000 of the Nation's most respected economists recently joined together to condemn the proposed balanced budget amendment as unsound and unnecessary. And here are their words:  
The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-called `built-in stabilizers' limit declines of after-tax income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced every year would aggravate recessions. 
The more than 1,000 economists who signed this statement include at least 11 Nobel laureates and many present and former Government officials, including the former chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, current and former Federal Reserve Board Chairmen, and former Democrat and Republican Directors of the Congressional Budget Office. The group includes a friend of mine and a man I respect very much, Robert Eisner, professor at Northwestern University in my home State of Illinois who has a solid grasp of the economic ramifications of Government budget policies. 
Most Members of this Senate, Democrat or Republican, would concede that our economy has moved forward in the last 4 years. Some credit fiscal policy emanating from the President and Capitol Hill, and others credit monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. I think it has taken both efforts to put this economy on the right track. 
During the course of his testimony before our Budget Committee the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, was asked point blank about the balanced budget amendment. And in the Chairman's words he said he was `opposed to putting detailed economic policy in our Constitution.' This is a man who must on a day-to-day basis sit with his staff and cohorts and determine the course of the American economy. He is a man who is as dedicated to balancing the budget as any person in this Nation. He is someone who has made tough and difficult decisions time and again to put this economy on track, and he has cautioned us that this is a mistake, a mistake for us to embody in this Constitution detailed economic policy, that we forswear the flexibility necessary to make certain that this Government of, by, and for the people can respond to the needs of the people in times of recession. 
What these economists and Mr. Greenspan are warning us of is that the balanced budget amendment if not changed will exacerbate the economic slowdowns we experience. It will put our Nation into an economic straitjacket that will make it hard to respond to economic downturns. 
Let us talk for a moment about the mechanisms that work in our economy in times of recession. Tax receipts fall. Certain types of Federal spending increase. Consider the obvious, the plant closes in your hometown where workers who have spent a lifetime showing up every day doing their job and paying their taxes end up out of work, perhaps for the first time in their lives finding themselves drawing unemployment compensation from this Federal Government. Perhaps if things go badly for a family for a longer period of time, they may be called on to apply for food stamps to make sure there is food on the table, maybe even Medicaid to make sure there is hospitalization protection for members of the family, and then of course trying to find another job. They may need to call on the Government for job training courses or education to prepare themselves for another career; another opportunity. 
What I have just described is not radical. It is a natural outgrowth of a free market capitalist economy with business downturns and with the vagaries of the business cycle leaving some families and some workers needing help. 
The fiscal changes I have described that take place when the Government steps in are described as economic stabilizers because they kick in automatically in times of unemployment and recession, and they help the economy recover, as they help individuals get back on their feet. That is why Robert Greenstein from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities described the effect of the balanced budget amendment in this way in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee: 
In years when growth is sluggish, revenues rise more slowly while costs for programs like unemployment insurance increase. As a result, the deficit widens. Under a balanced budget amendment, more deficit reduction thus would be required in periods of slow growth than in times of rapid growth. 
This is precisely the opposite-- 
The opposite, in his words-- 
of what should be done to stabilize the economy and avert recessions. The constitutional amendment consequently risks making recessions more frequent and deeper. In the period from 1930 to 1933, for example, Congress repeatedly cut Federal spending and raised taxes, trying to offset the decline in revenues that occurred after the great crash of 1929. Yet those spending cuts and tax increases removed purchasing power from the economy and helped make the downturn deeper; they occurred at exactly the wrong time in the business cycle. 
In Dr. Greenstein's words:  
This is why a balanced budget amendment requirement is called `pro-cyclical.' It exacerbates the natural business cycle of growth and recession. It also is why most economists who favor tough deficit reduction measures strongly oppose a constitutional balanced budget amendment.

Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding. 
It is ironic that this is my first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate and that I am speaking on behalf of a gentleman whom I have known for 25 years and one I am proud to support. I speak on my behalf and on the behalf of the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, in support of this nomination of Bill Daley to be our new Secretary of Commerce. 
Bill Daley, of course, is well known in the city of Chicago and across this Nation. The Daley name carries with it certain connotations of political leadership, mainly positive, maybe some negative on a national basis. But those of us who know what the Daley legacy has been in the State of Illinois feel that it is overwhelmingly positive because of the contribution that has been made to our State, to the city of Chicago, and to this Nation by the Daley family over the last few decades. It has been significant, significant in this respect: The Daley family has been willing to step forward into public service to face the slings and arrows that public figures face, and to lead. 
And they have led, led our great city of Chicago forward, not only under Mayor Richard J. Daley but now Richard M. Daley, and through the other members of the Daley family. 
William Daley--Bill Daley as we know him--has often been behind the scenes, not on the center of the stage. Of course, when his father was mayor, he was a young man. Now that his brother is mayor, and he is in a capacity to play a larger role, many times he has stepped to the side. He led in his own fashion, in his own way, and developed a reputation in Chicago, and I think across this country, for leadership, not only the obvious, leading in the city, in community endeavors, charitable undertakings, making certain there was some vision from the business community about the future of Chicago, but on the national scene as well. 
It is interesting that when President Clinton faced one of his toughest challenges in his first term, in passing NAFTA, a controversial issue even within the Democratic party, that he would turn to Bill Daley of Chicago and say, `Come to Washington. Use your skills and leadership to help me pass this important trade agreement.' 
When the dust had settled and NAFTA had passed, even the critics of NAFTA gave credit to Bill Daley and said, `Here is a man who could be trusted.' His door was open. His word was good. As I said at the Commerce Committee, he showed the skills of a playmaker like Michael Jordan, whose name may be known to even the Senator from South Carolina. We are proud of the fact that Bill Daley has served this country well. We think this designation of Bill Daley as the Secretary of Commerce creates another opportunity for him to serve his Nation well. 
It is no surprise that the Department of Commerce has been under the spotlight in the last several months, and some questions have been raised, and I think deservedly so. 
I want to salute my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for noting that there is need for reform in the Department of Commerce. I say to Senator McCain, we could not choose a better person than Bill Daley to bring about real reform, because he is a professional. 
I have to also note the Senator's comments about investigations into questions about his background have shown that they were fine, that he comes to this job with the level of honesty and integrity that we expect of Cabinet people and people in public service. He will be tested to put together a team to bring about real reform in the Department of Commerce. Bill Daley is going to meet that challenge. I think he is going to rise to that occasion. 
I might speak to one other point before yielding back. 
During the course of this hearing and investigation, questions have arisen about the future of the Department of Commerce. Some have even questioned whether it should exist. I, for one, believe it plays a critically important role. Now that the cold war is behind us, we are engaged in a new war of equal proportion--a war over jobs, a war over opportunities, a war to find, I guess, for the next generation of Americans, the same opportunities other generations have enjoyed. 
We cannot step back and hope that our reputation as a Yankee trader will be all that is needed for us to win in that war. We need to be on the front, in that battle, making certain that American workers and businesses are treated fairly when it comes to world commerce. That is the job of the Department of Commerce, one of the more important responsibilities that it faces. I hope the Department of Commerce is valued for that responsibility. It certainly is, in my estimation. I know Bill Daley feels the same. 
His background in business, in banking, in the practice of law, and in public policy, make him uniquely qualified to come to this job in the Department of Commerce and to serve his Nation well. I am happy to stand today in support of this nomination. I hope that this body will join me in giving a solid vote of support to the designation of Bill Daley as our new Secretary of Commerce. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding me the time.
