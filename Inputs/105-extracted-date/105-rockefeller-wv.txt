Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate is considering this comprehensive bill which would make valuable changes to a wide range of veterans' benefits and services. This legislation represents the culmination of considerable oversight and investigation, hearings and markups in both the House and Senate, and the normal flow of legislation and compromise which is the basis of reaching consensus. The bill does not represent all that I or others involved would have wanted; but it does represent the best that we could do under the rules and budget constraints within which we operate. 
Although the bill we consider today addresses many initiatives--from assisting Persian Gulf War veterans to providing educational assistance to health care professionals--I will mention only some of the issues which are of particular interest to me.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Mr. DeWine in his introduction of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act. I would like to thank Mr. DeWine of this leadership on this bill, another example of his ongoing commitment to our Nation's most vulnerable children and families. I would also like to thank my good friends Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Chafee for their support of and input on this legislation. 
Last year at this time, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the most sweeping piece of child welfare legislation in more than two decades. For the first time, this law establishes that a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in the abuse and neglect system. The law promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes. More specifically, the law requires a State to move to terminate the parental right of any parent whose child has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months. While essential to protect children, these accelerated time lines increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened abuse and neglect courts. 
Our courts play a vital role in the Nation's abuse and neglect system. Through my discussions with judges in my state of West Virginia and across the country, I have learned that abuse and neglect judges make some of the most difficult decisions made by any members of the judiciary. Adjudications of abuse and neglect, terminations of parental rights, approval of adoptions, and life-changing determinations are not made without careful and sometimes painful deliberation. Despite the courts' commitment to the fair and efficient administration of justice in these cases, staggering increases in the number of children in the abuse and neglect system, have placed a tremendous burden on our abuse and neglect courts. 
Many abuse and neglect courts have found creative and effective new ways to eliminate their backlogs and move children more efficiently and safely through the court system. In West Virginia, Supreme Court Justice Margaret Workman and a dedicated group of judges and attorneys have developed a comprehensive plan to increase the accountability and efficient administration of abuse and neglect cases. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Judge Grossman's abuse and neglect courts have implemented state-of-the-art computer tracking systems which help them smooth the legal paths of children in foster care. 
The purpose of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act is to help remove the burdens on an even greater number of abuse and neglect courts by increasing their administrative efficiency and effectiveness. The bill establishes a program which will provide grants to state and local courts for the creation and implementation of computerized casetracking systems, similar to the one that has seen such incredible success in Ohio. Through the establishment of such systems, courts are able to more easily track how long a child spends in foster care and the status of their cases. Such easy-to-access information will allow courts to move children more quickly and efficiently through the foster care system and into adoptive homes and other permanent placements. This grant program will also enable state and local courts to design and use similar computer systems and to allow for the replication of similar 
models in other jurisdictions. The technical assistance provision in this bill provides additional funds to aid these courts in the design and implementation of their new computer programs. 
Throughout the debate on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we heard from dozens of judges who said that the biggest problems facing their courts was the overwhelming backlog of abuse and neglect cases. Without creative ways to eliminate such backlogs, the judges argued, new cases will never move smoothly through the court system. That is why this bill also authorizes a grant program to provide State courts with the funds they need to eliminate current backlogs once and for all. For some courts, that might involve the temporary hiring of an additional judge, a temporary extension of court hours, or restructuring the duties of court personnel. This program will provide grants to those court projects that will result in the effective and rapid elimination of current backlogs to smooth the way for a more efficient courts in the future. 
The Strengthening the Abuse and Neglect Courts also recognizes the need to improve training, continuing education opportunities, and model practice standards for judges, attorneys and other court personnel who work in the abuse and neglect courts. More specifically, the bill requires that abuse and neglect agencies design and encourage the implementation of `best practice' standards for those attorneys representing the agencies in abuse and neglect cases. The Act also extends the federal reimbursement for training currently provided to agency representatives to judges, court personnel, law enforcement representatives, guardians-ad-litem, and the other attorneys who practice in abuse and neglect proceedings. For the first time, such reimbursement would help fund specialized cross-trainings between agency and court personnel and trainings that focus on vital subjects such as new research on child development. 
In addition to the judges, guardians-ad-litem and attorneys in the abuse and neglect courts, volunteers for the Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Program also play a key role in helping abused and neglected children in the court system. CASA volunteers are the eyes and the ears of the courts, spending time with abused and neglected children, interviewing the adults involved in their lives, and helping to give judges a better understanding of the needs of each individual child. Despite the incredible success of the CASA programs, thousands of abused and neglected children do not have the benefit of CASA representation. The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act provides CASA with a $5 million grant to expand its programs into under-served areas and to improve its ability to recruit, train and supervise volunteers in already existing programs. 
When we talk about child welfare in this country, abuse and neglect courts are too often left out of the discussion. This is an unacceptable mistake, since our courts play a central role in the well-being of our nation's abused and neglected children. I am confident that the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act will be valuable first step in making these courts stronger and more efficient than ever, and I ask my colleagues to join us in this important effort.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to share my warmest congratulations to the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence Central Service Office on its 10th Anniversary celebration. Through its around the clock support, educational outreach and a network of safe shelters, the WVCADV Central Service Office providers mothers and children with the information and resources necessary to produce `Peacemaking Partnerships'--statewide cooperation to eliminate domestic violence. 
Offering support on a 24-hour basis with an exceptionally educated full time staff, corps of volunteers and Americorps workers, the WVCADV has been able to help prevent, and in many cases help heal the scar of domestic violence in the state of West Virginia. Such commitment is essential in the campaign to stop domestic violence which has grown in staggering proportions. Statistics reflect that a woman is assaulted by her husband or intimate partner every fifteen seconds in the United States. Without effective mechanisms for intervention, this number will only continue to grow. 
The WVCADV plays a vital role in encouraging victims of domestic violence to come forward and tell their stories. Through community education, seminars and conferences designed to broaden public awareness of warning signs and other violence-related issues, the WVCADV is changing the past protocol of `looking the other way' into empowerment, response and prevention. 
Through the myriad of support services WVCADV has made available, the network of thirteen safe shelters in West Virginia provide a place for women and children as they begin the process of leaving violence-filled homes. With nearly seventy-five percent of fatal attacks occurring after separation, such safe shelters are essential to protect women and children from their abusers. These shelters not only provide a secure, stable environments with educational programs, but also offer direct contacts with legal advocates and law enforcement to ensure the safety of these women and children after they leave. 
Furthermore, through their collaboration with advocates and policy makers, the WVCADV fosters legislation which is essential to counter domestic violence--setting up mechanisms not only to protect abuse victims but also to increase and provide accountability for abusive behavior. In 1994, I proudly cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act, the first comprehensive piece of Federal legislation to address this important issue. I will continue to work with my collegues in Congress and with the staff of the WVCADV to ensure that the most vulnerable families get the support that they need to remain safe, stable and free of violence. 
Throughout the month of October, the WVCADV will hold events throughout the State to celebrate the progress they have made in fighting domestic violence. On November 6th a statewide event titled `In Celebration of Peacemaking Partnerships: Looking Back and Moving Ahead' will demonstrate the 10 years of success and goals. I cannot think of a more fitting title for this anniversary celebration which recognizes the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence Central Service Office's leadership in forging model partnerships throughout West Virginia and across the nation. 
Again, Mr. President, I want to express my sincerest congratulations to the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence Central Service Office for the work it has done and for all that it will continue to do in the future. Also, I would like to express my appreciation for all the WVCADV staff and volunteers. Such commitment and dedication that always inspires me in the work that I do on behalf of West Virginia children and families. I look forward to our future endeavors together as we continue to make great strides in creating `peacemaking partnerships' throughout West Virginia and across the country.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to President Lee Teng-hui and the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan on the occasion of their National Day which will occur October 10. It is a deep honor for me to join in the celebration of this momentous occasion. 
The remarkable achievements of Taiwan continue to tell a powerful story of how democracy can grow in Asia, and that it is compatible with a commitment to capitalism. Taiwan's ability to survive the Asian financial crisis better than any other free economy in the region is just another example of the significance of Taiwan's leadership. Quite simply, Taiwan's economic and political miracles never cease to amaze me. 
It is a true honor for me to have a long-standing, very personal friendship with Taiwan. My own state of West Virginia has benefitted from Taiwan's commitment to the U.S. in profound and long-lasting ways. I am more committed than ever to the people of Taiwan to keep building on a relationship that holds so much more promise in the years ahead. I know that we will continue to look to Taiwan to continue setting an example in their commitment to democracy, to vibrant economic ties with the U.S. and the rest of the world, and to peace.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will help the President deal with the flood of dirt-cheap steel imports from our trading partners. The Section 201 reform bill I am proposing with my colleague and Senate steel caucus co-chair, Senator Specter, will strengthen the President's ability to help domestic industries receive the relief they need and deserve when imports are a cause of serious injury. 
Import relief is what the U.S. steel industry desperately needs right now. West Virginia steel makers deserve help now, before this crisis worsens, as I fear it will. All U.S. steel manufacturers deserve that assistance. That's why I am introducing this legislation before Congress recesses. I intend to push to improve our ability to remedy harm against domestic industries and at the same time remain consistent with rules we expect our world trading partners to live by. We can be tough and fair on trade at the same time and the bill I am introducing today proves it. 
In my state of West Virginia, our two largest steel manufacturers, Weirton Steel and Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel have both already begun to suffer the effects of the steel import crisis. Weirton has laid off 200 workers and reports that their fourth quarter earnings and lack of pending orders could force the companies to consider additional lay offs in the near future. Wheeling Pittsburgh is also worried about the affect of the crisis on their bottomline. Laying off workers is never easy, but this crisis is forcing such hard decisions. West Virginia steel makers are producing world-class products as efficiently as any foreign competitors, but when foreign competitors are blatantly dumping their product at prices which are sometimes actually below the cost of production, it cuts the legs out from under American companies--but such unfair practices are absolutely unacceptable. U.S. industry, the U.S. steel industry and other industries, deserve just remedies when competitors unfairly dump their product on the U.S. market. We want to give the President the policy tools he needs to deal with unfair import competition. 
Import data tells the story of a worsening steel crisis--the first two quarters of 1998 have shown a 27% increase in imports of hot-rolled steel. Japanese imports increased by an astounding 114% in that same time frame. Steel imports from South Korea increased 90%. There is no end in sight. Russia and Brazil are nations who are other prime offenders. 
The tragedy of this crisis is that the U.S. steel industry has spent over a decade reinventing itself, adjusting and modernizing, in order to become a top-notch competitor as we approach the 21st century. This industry is a true success story--productivity has shot up and we can beat any producer in the world on price and quality when provided with a level playing field. For decades, I have worked with leaders in the steel industry at Weirton Steel, Wheeling-Pittsburgh, Wheeling-Nisshin, and others. I have watched and encouraged these steelmakers and unions working together to make the tough, necessary decision to modernize. 
Unfortunately, just as United States steel manufacturers are realizing the gains of such investments, they are facing a flood of imported steel being sold at rock bottom prices--again, below the cost of production in some instances. We cannot compete against that kind of unfair competition. The legislation Senator Specter and I are introducing today will give the President an improved tool to ensure that when there is serious injury as a result of imports, the U.S. can respond. 
Specifically, our legislation will reform Section 201 which permits the President to grant domestic industries import relief in circumstances where imports are the substantial cause of serious injury. 
Under current law, domestic industries must show that increased imports are the `substantial cause' of serious injury--which means a cause that is important and not less than any other cause. This imposes an unfair, higher burden of proof on domestic industries than is required to prove injury under World Trade Organization standards. The Safeguards Code of the World Trade Organization was established to make sure that fair trade did not mean countries had to put up with unfair practices. The WTO standard requires only that there be a causal link between increased imports and serious injury. I believe that U.S. law should not impose a tougher standard for American companies of harm than the WTO uses for the international community. Applying the WTO standard is responsible and reasonable. In this bill, we propose to establish the same standard for the U.S. as is used by the WTO. Free trade must mean fair trade. 
In addition, in this bill we also intend to conform U.S. law to the standard in the WTO Safeguards Code when considering the overall test for judging when there has been serious harm to a domestic industry. We clarify that the International Trade Commission (ITC) should review the overall condition of the domestic industry in determining the degree of that injury by making it clear that it is the effect of the imports on the overall state of the industry that counts, not solely the effect on any one of the particular criteria used in the evaluation. 
It is our sincere hope that Congress will act on this legislation and send the message that the United States will fight for the right of its industries to complete on a level playing field in world trade. If imports flood our markets, we will act to protect American industries against the consequences. 
I am someone who adamantly believes the promotion of free trade is essential to our country's continued economic growth. If we are to continue to expand the trade base of our economy we need U.S. industry to know that we will keep it fair. American industry and American workers can deal with fair trade, but they shouldn't be asked to sit still for unfair trade practices that hurt workers and their families, while robbing the profit-margins of U.S. companies. 
I intend to work in Congress, with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and those in the Administration responsible for trade policy to give the President better, more effective tools to ensure that our country can insist trade be free and fair. Our steel industry, indeed all U.S. industries, deserve no less. I will carefully monitor the steel import crisis and consider other appropriate actions as we see how this situation develops.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Dr. Madan Bhasin for being awarded the 1999 Industrial Chemistry Award by the American Chemical Society. This honor is annually bestowed to recognize outstanding contributions to industrial chemistry that have resulted in the commercialization of an economically significant new product or process. I am always proud when West Virginians are recognized for their outstanding contributions to society. However, this is an especially nice case since Dr. Bhasin's work also demonstrates how great ideas can improve a company's profit margin and save resources at the same time. 
Dr. Bhasin received his B.Sc. from the University of Delhi and his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1958 and has been with Union Carbide since 1963. During his 35 year career at the Union Carbide Technical Center in South Charleston, West Virginia, he has devoted his efforts to researching and applying catalysts to create new production methods and help improve existing industrial processes. His invention and implementation of nine generations of ethylene epoxidation catalysts led to his recognition by the American Chemical Society. The catalysts that Dr. Bhasin invented allow for the more efficient conversion of ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol, which are components in products such as polyester and anti-freeze. Billions of pounds of ethylene epoxidation are used each year so increasing the conversion efficiency has allowed Union Carbide to remain one of the world leaders in this market as well as save energy and reduce by-products. This is obviously a win for Union Carbide, the environment and the state of West Virginia. 
Again I would like to take this opportunity to publically recognize and congratulate Dr. Bhasin for this great accolade and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize today the efforts of a group of West Virginia citizens who have joined together to address an important issue affecting our state and the nation. These individuals, who have formed Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse (CALA), are working to educate the public about how excesses in our civil justice system can be harmful. 
CALA volunteer spokespersons are speaking out about how lawsuit abuse means people pay through higher prices for consumer products, higher medical expenses, higher taxes and lost business expansion and product development. I should note that my own concerns relate to abuse of the system which comes in the form of frivolous suits and inappropriate delays--not legitimate use of our tort system. 
CALA reports that recent studies of liability costs have found that our State has a high lawsuit and liability cost relative to our economic output measured as gross state product. As another example of the effect of lawsuit abuse, CALA's own survey of all West Virginia municipalities last year found an estimated annual lawsuit-related cost for our municipal taxpayers to be more than $9 million. Nationally, it has been estimated that the costs of our civil justice system averages $1200 per person per year. 
Legal reform of any kind is not a simple issue. The legal system is essential to provide justice to every American. But that does not mean that the status quo is perfect. When lawsuits and the courts can be used in excess or result in imposing costs without reason on the other parties, from individuals to not-for-profit agencies to businesses, the system should be reviewed and reformed if possible. 
I often have spoken about the problems of our product liability system. We see the terrible consequences of our country's confusing patchwork, slow, and often unfair system of product liability rules that need to be properly and fairly reformed. 
The leaders of West Virginia's CALA movement should be commended here today. Volunteers such as Robert Mauk of Huntington; Jim Thomas, Sid Davis and Mac McJunkin of Charleston; Cuz Blake of Bridgeport; Phyllis Garner of Clarksburg; Rick Pruitte of Fairmont; and Sam Chico of Morgantown are all working hard to ensure that our State has a strong, fair and effective civil justice system that will serve all West Virginians and grow our economy and job base. These people give their time to speak to community groups, organize educational activities and distribute materials to help us all be conscious of lawsuit costs and excesses of the system. 
Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 21 through 26 to be `Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week' in West Virginia. I want to commend these citizens for their dedication and commitment and to acknowledge this week as time of public awareness on the serious issues associated with lawsuit abuse.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today the Committee on Veterans' Affairs released the final report of its Special Investigation Unit (SIU) on Gulf War Illnesses. The report represents the culmination of the unit's year-long, 20-member staff investigation into issues surrounding the illnesses that have affected many veterans of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. 
The Gulf War ended over seven years ago, but the aftermath of this military victory will remain with us for years to come. This brief war represented a critical turning point in our concept of modern warfare. For the first time since World War I, we faced the possibility of widespread use of chemical warfare agents. Previously, concerns about the use of `weapons of mass destruction' focused on the threat of nuclear warfare, increasingly possessed by the more developed nations of the world, but still limited in availability. But in the Gulf, we came face-to-face with the threat of the `poor man's atomic weapons'--chemical and biological weapons. 
Chemical and biological weapons have been around for a long time. The United States and its allies abandoned the use of chemical weapons many years ago. In April 1997, the United States Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, joining many other nations in the international disarmament of chemical weapons. But for terrorists and rogue nations, chemical and biological weapons remain the weapons of choice, and they are likely to play a significant role in the battlefields of the future. According to Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, just as we faced this threat in the Gulf War, we are likely to face it again. 
In hearings before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, military heroes such as General Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell recounted their fears about the potential use of chemical or biological weapons in the Gulf War. They described the dilemmas they faced as they realized that vaccine supplies were inadequate to protect the 697,000 men and women who were deployed to the Gulf, forcing our leaders to decide who would be protected and who would not. They recalled the anguish associated with making those decisions. But fortunately, the widespread use of chemical weapons and the massive casualties that had been predicted for that war did not occur. 
After the Gulf War, it was generally agreed that we must be better prepared to meet this threat in the future. We needed to develop new technologies for the detection of chemical and biological weapons in the battlefield; to make sure that we had adequate supplies of vaccines and medical antidotes, and other protective equipment, especially masks and suits; and to ensure that our troops received adequate training to carry out their mission in the event of use of chemical/biological warfare. Given the crisis our military faced during the Gulf War as our leaders realized that we were not well prepared then, you might expect it would be high priority to make sure we are not caught unprepared again. Sadly, this has not been the case. 
The SIU report finds that almost eight years after the Gulf War, our military is still not prepared to fight in a chemical or biological warfare environment. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense corroborated these findings in a recent report which states that with the exception of Navy surface ships, our armed forces are unable to assess unit chemical and biological defense readiness because unit commanders have not made this training a priority. Of the 232 units reviewed by the Inspector General, 80 percent were not fully integrating chemical and biological defense into unit mission training. This is completely unacceptable. 
The SIU also found that training for chemical and biological warfare is still inadequate, and that the technology for battlefield detection of chemical warfare agents has not improved since the Gulf War. Although the threat of chemical and biological warfare has increased since the Gulf War and hangs heavy over the potential battlefields of the 21st century, the military still has inadequate supplies of vaccines and chemical/biological protective equipment. It is imperative that we be prepared to face these very real risks. Moreover, we must be ready for the possibility that the next terrorist attack on U.S. civilians may include such weapons. The task of domestic defense and preparedness poses an even greater challenge. 
Recent events underscore the need to make this defense and readiness issue a national priority. Eight years after the Gulf War, United Nations inspectors still have not been able to fully assess Iraq's chemical and biological weapons capabilities. We have all seen the roadblocks that Saddam Hussein has succeeded in placing in the path of this international effort to inspect for these weapons. Fortunately, we did not have to send in military personnel in the recent U.S. attack to destroy the chemical plant in Sudan. Had we needed to, however, and if these terrorists had chemical and biological weapons, I fear our ground troops would have been ill-prepared to function in such an environment. 
My concerns here are not new. In 1994, when I was chairman of the Committee, my staff issued a report that called attention to many of the long-term health concerns arising from our soldiers' exposures to environmental hazards. Many of the concerns raised then remain today. 
Senator Specter and I will call upon Secretary Cohen to carefully consider the findings of this report and provide an emergency action plan to address these shortcomings. I am confident that he is as concerned about our military's preparedness for this threat as we are, and we look forward to his response. 
Our military men and women must be protected and they must be prepared to fight in a chemical/biological warfare environment. That means that they need ongoing, quality training in chemical/biological defense and detection systems that will work quickly and reliably on the battlefield. It means that they need adequate supplies of the required chemical protection masks and suits, and training in how to properly use them under battlefield conditions. It means they need sufficient supplies of vaccines, antibiotics, and medical antidotes. And it means that they need well-trained medical personnel who are prepared to respond to chemical and biological warfare casualties, and the medical equipment needed to care for such casualties. 
All of this means a commitment of time and funding across all the service branches, and the support and leadership of commanders everywhere to guarantee this commitment. Most of all, this requires a solid commitment from this Congress and President Clinton. 
We have had enough talk of readiness--it's time to make it a reality if we are to fight on the battlefields of the 21st century.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I support the introduction of The Adoption Equality Act of 1998. 
I am proud to be a co-sponsor of The Adoption Equality Act of 1998, part of a continuing effort to improve the lives of abused and neglected children in my state of West Virginia and across the nation. 
I would like to begin by sharing my special thanks with my colleague and good friend, Senator Chafee, not only for his work on this important legislation, but for his ongoing commitment to bringing about meaningful change for America's most vulnerable children. I also want to express my sincere gratitude to the other cosponsors of this bill, Senators DeWine, Kerrey, Bond, Levin, Landrieu, Dorgan, and Moynihan. I am so pleased to see that the strong and unique bipartisan coalition forged during the adoption debate last fall is continuing the job yet to be done on behalf of abused and neglected children. 
Last fall, our bipartisan coalition introduced--and the Senate unanimously passed--The Adoption and Safe Families Act. That legislation, signed into law on November 19, 1997, fundamentally shifted the focus of the American foster system by insisting for the first time that health and safety should be the paramount consideration when a State makes any decision regarding the well-being of an abused and neglected child. That legislation is designed to move children out of foster care and into adoptive homes more quickly than ever before. 
I am also proud to report that West Virginia is launching its own special initiative to promote adoption. This June, state officials reported that there were 3003 children in the custody of West Virginia. 870 of these children have adoption as the goal of their permanency plans, and 95% of these children have special needs. The State has committed to hiring additional specialists to provide adoption services and is seeking federal support to enhance these efforts. It is wonderful to know that West Virginia and other states are so enthusiastic about moving forward to promote adoptions and to help children find safe and stable homes. 
The Adoption and Safe Families Act took into account the unique circumstances of `special needs' children--those children who, for whatever reason, are difficult to place in adoptive homes. States now receive a special bonus for each special needs adoption. Most significantly, the Adoption and Safe Families Act took the first essential step in ensuring ongoing health coverage for all special needs children who are adopted into new families. 
While I am satisfied that The Adoption and Safe Families Act will strengthen the American foster care system, I made it clear that it was only the first step in many to make things significantly better for abused and neglected children. 
The Adoption Equality Act is an essential second step in this ongoing process. This important legislation will promote and increase adoptions by making all special needs children eligible for Federal adoption subsidies. This bill is designed to `level the playing field' by ensuring that all loving adoptive families have the support they need to address the fundamental needs of the children they raise. 
Federal adoption subsidies, already authorized under section IV-E of the Social Security Act, usually take the form of monthly payments provided to families who adopt special needs children. These payments provide essential income support to help families finance the daily costs of raising these children and to cover the expense of special services. Federal adoption subsidies play a vital role in the lives of thousands of special needs children. Many families that I have visited in West Virginia and across the country have told me that without this essential support, they would not have been able to afford to take in the children who have become such an important part of their family. 
This bill will fix the one remaining barrier that keeps many adoptive families from accessing precious Federal adoption subsidies. Under current law, a special needs child is only eligible for Federal adoption subsidies if his biological family was poor enough to qualify for welfare benefits under the now-defunct Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program (AFDC). If his family doesn't qualify under 1994 AFDC standards, even the hardest to place child cannot receive federal adoption subsidies. 
In other words, a special needs child's eligibility for federal adoption subsidies is dependent on the income of the parents that abused or neglected him. This is simply wrong. 
The Adoption Equality Act will eliminate this tragic anomaly in Federal law by making all special needs children eligible for Federal adoption subsidies. This is a responsible way to make sure that willing adoptive families have the support that they need to take care of all the needs of their new child, whether those include food and clothing, therapy, tutoring, or a new addition to their home. 
Throughout my travels as the Chair of the National Commission on Children and my meetings with families in West Virginia, I have observed a recurring theme. I have come to understand that in many cases, a family wants to adopt a child more than anything. And yet, there is often a barrier that stands in its way. The lack of adequate financial resources is at the top of that list. This legislation help alleviate this unnecessary burden. 
In closing, I want to reiterate a point that I made during the debate over the Adoption and Safe Families Act. At the heart of the ongoing discussions about what is the best policy for abused and neglected children, there have been many complex questions raised about how Federal taxpayer dollars should be spent and who is worthy of receiving them. As we struggle with these difficult issues--which often pit social against fiscal responsibility--I keep returning to the same fundamental lesson I have learned from the families I have met: if we cannot build social policy that not only protects our children, but gives them the best possible chance to succeed in life, we have failed to do our job as a government and a society. 
The Adoption Equality Act is designed to make sure that all abused and neglected children, even the most vulnerable special needs kids, have this real chance for security and happiness.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize the extraordinary work and dedication of our Secretary of Education, the Honorable Richard Riley. I am quite proud to call Secretary Riley a good friend. Over many years, I have had the privilege of working closely with the Secretary to promote quality education and help children and families. I believe everyone in the Senate understands the importance of quality education for every child, even if we may sometimes disagree on the best ways to achieve this fundamental goal.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize the Energy Express Americorps for their contributions to local West Virginia communities. In 1994, several studies demonstrated conclusively that many low-income children were not receiving proper nourishment and we all understand how this hurts a child's healthy development. Further research has suggested that not only did low-income students lack proper nutrition, but they also faced academic set backs while their more fortunate classmates made academic gains during summer recess. Inspired by such disturbing statistics, West Virginia Americorps created Energy Express, a unique program, which offers six-week summer program for low-income, elementary children to promote reading skills, to create strong partnerships with mentors, and to provide nutritious meals. Energy Express is an innovative Americorps program that helps low-income children with a healthy, safe environment, and promotes reading skills in a community environment. 
Energy Express formed an effective partnership with the existing Summer Feeding Program that provides nutritious meals and education to promote proper eating habits. The Energy Express summer camps go beyond the call of duty to simply prepare and provide; they create a family-style atmosphere where the children learn how to make decisions, engage in conversation, assume responsibility, and cooperate with one another and others.. 
The mission of Energy Express also goes beyond just child nutrition to promote further education. Recognizing the need to increase reading skills and to encourage retention of lessons from school, Americorps provides four hours of tutorial time that always remains fun. Weekly themes of `myself,' `family,' `friends,' `home place,' `community,' and `ideal world' guide the mentors and children in their work. The curriculum includes creating books, performing stories, reading both silently and out loud, and immersing the children in creative art activities, all of which are pertinent to a designated theme. At the end of each week, the child is able to take home a book relevant to the theme to keep in his or her personal library. 
The design of Energy Express organizes six to eight children per one college student mentor. These mentors serve as tremendous role models for maturity, educational development and also as wonderful community volunteers committed to West Virginia. Each mentor receives an extensive eight week training program led by on-site educators who teach them positive feedback, how to productively discipline and the basic fundamentals of tutoring. Through preliminary visits and weekly contact concerning their child's progress, the mentor reaches out to the parents in ways which encourage involvement and support. 
The program's growth in the past four years characterizes one of its successes. In 1994, Energy Express reached two counties, 85 students and 13 college mentors. This summer the program reaches 38 counties, 68 sites, 2721 students, 425 Americorps college mentors and approximately 25 Americorps VISTA Summer Associates. In 1997, Energy Express received national recognition as it won the Joint Council of Extension Professionals Award for Excellence in Teamwork and the Council of State Governments Innovations Award. Energy Express also serves as a national model for many other states attempting to duplicate such programs. 
Most important, however, is the success of the children. In 1997, studies indicated that many of the students not only retained previous knowledge, but gained one month in word identification and three months in comprehension. 124,990 nutritious meals were served and the children received 12,930 books to add to their personal library. Many states as well as other communities in West Virginia hope to duplicate these same results. Their hands are somewhat tied by the lack of needed funds available. Each site costs approximately $25,000, but the rewards passed on to the children, communities and mentors are immeasurable in return. 
Energy Express demonstrates the incredible work and success of Americorps. The commitment of its volunteers not only helps the community, but also provides growth for the volunteers themselves. My experience as a VISTA worker gave me a similar experience, and I continue my dedication to our Mountain State. I see that today's volunteers show that same dedication, and I extend my sincere gratitude to all of them. These persons have committed themselves fully to public service, both as volunteers and employees. It is through their hard work that the people of West Virginia benefit from the world's myriad of opportunities.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, along with Senator Byrd and Senator Specter, I am proud to introduce today the `Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998.' This bipartisan legislation establishes a clear framework for the compensation and health care needs of Gulf War veterans. This bill would create a permanent statutory authority for the compensation of ill Gulf War veterans. It builds upon the system of scientific review and determinations for presumptive compensation that currently exists for veterans exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War and builds upon S. 1320, which I introduced last October. 
The bill we introduce today is an even more comprehensive effort to address the needs of our Nation's Gulf War veterans. Senator Byrd's and Senator Specter's many contributions have served to make this an even stronger bill that will help to expedite the process of scientific review of possible wartime hazards and exposures that may have contributed to illnesses in our Gulf War veterans, which in turn expedites compensation to ill veterans. It will also help ensure health care for these men and women in the years to come, and improves the current program for evaluating the health of families of Gulf War veterans. 
As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of many of our Nation's Gulf War veterans. The Persian Gulf War will undoubtedly go down in history as one of our country's most decisive military victories. Despite our fears of potentially huge troop injuries and losses, the careful planning and strategy of our military leaders paid off. The ground war lasted only four days, and the casualties we experienced, while deeply regrettable, were fortunately few. But as with any war, the human costs of the Gulf War have been high, and the casualties have continued long after the battle was over. 
Many of the men and women who served in the Gulf have suffered chronic, debilitating health problems. Unnecessarily compounding their pain has been their difficulty in getting the government they served to acknowledge their problems and provide the appropriate care and benefits they deserve. This legislation will go a long way to address some of these concerns. We can't wait the 20 years we waited after the Vietnam war to assess the effects of Agent Orange, or the 40 years we waited after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed veterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act now. We have already waited too long. 
For the past seven years, we have looked to the leaders of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for a resolution of these difficult issues. While they have made some progress, I think we can all agree there is much more to be done. This legislation will require VA to enlist the National Academy of Sciences--an independent, nonprofit, scientific organization--to review and evaluate the research regarding links between illnesses and exposure to toxic agents and wartime hazards. Based on the findings of the NAS, VA will then determine whether a diagnosed or undiagnosed illness found to be associated with Gulf War service warrants a presumption of service connection for compensation purposes. This will provide an ongoing scientific basis and nonpolitical framework for the VA to use in compensating Persian Gulf War veterans. 
Mr. President, I will now highlight some of the provisions contained in this legislation. 
First, this legislation calls for the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to provide a scientific basis for determining the association between illnesses and exposures to environmental or wartime hazards as a result of service in the Persian Gulf. The NAS will review the scientific literature to assess health exposures during the Gulf War and health problems among veterans, and report to Congress and the VA. 
This bill tasks the NAS with first reviewing a list of likely exposures. Such a step will jump start their review and provide NAS with an initial blueprint to build upon. This is important because it will speed up the process of providing compensation to veterans, and our veterans should not have to wait any longer. 
Second, this legislation authorizes VA to presume that diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses that have a positive association with exposures to environmental or wartime hazards were incurred in or aggravated by service even if there was no evidence of the illness during service. Having that authority, VA will determine whether there is a sound medical and scientific basis to warrant a presumption of service connection for compensation for diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses, based on NAS' report. Within 60 days of that determination, VA will publish proposed regulations to presumptively service connect these illnesses. 
Third, this bill extends VA's authority to provide health care to Gulf War veterans through December 31, 2001. After the war, DoD and VA acknowledged that they couldn't define what health problems were affecting Persian Gulf War veterans. Nonetheless, we did not want to make these veterans wait for the science to catch up before we could provide health care and compensation for their service-related conditions. That is why, back in 1993, we provided Persian Gulf War veterans with priority health care at VA facilities for conditions related to their exposure to environmental hazards. Gulf War veterans' access to health care through VA must be continue to be ensured. 
Fourth, this bill requires NAS to provide recommendations for additional research that should be conducted to better understand the possible adverse health effects of exposures to toxic agents or environmental or wartime hazards associated with Gulf War service. The VA, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will review and act upon the recommendations for additional research and future studies. 
Fifth, this legislation tasks NAS with assessing potential treatment models for the chronic undiagnosed illnesses that have affected so many of our Gulf War veterans. They will make recommendations for additional studies to determine the most appropriate and scientifically sound treatments. VA and DoD will review this information and submit a report to Congress describing whether they will implement these treatment models and their rationale for their decisions. 
In addition, this legislation calls for the establishment of a system to monitor the health status of Persian Gulf War veterans over time. VA, in collaboration with DoD, will develop a plan to establish and operate a computerized information data set to collect information on the illnesses and health problems of Gulf War veterans. This data base will also track health care utilization of veterans with chronic undiagnosed illnesses to better evaluate these veterans' health care needs. VA and DoD will submit this plan for review and comment by NAS. After this review, VA and DoD will implement the agreed-upon plan and provide annual reports to Congress on the health status of Persian Gulf War veterans. 
Also, this legislation requires that VA, in consultation with DoD and HHS, carry out an ongoing outreach program to provide information to Gulf War veterans. This information will include health risks, if any, from exposures during service in the Gulf War theater of operations, and any additional services or benefits that are available. 
This bill also extends and improves upon VA's Persian Gulf War Spouse and Children Evaluation Program to allow VA greater flexibility in the implementation of this important program and to allow for greater access for the families who seek medical evaluations. 
Finally, this bill requires the Secretary of VA to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study the feasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National Center for the Study of Military Health. The proposed center would evaluate and monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to post-deployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces. In addition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to members of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on military operations. It could also monitor and direct government efforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their return from military deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid identification of any trends in diseases or injuries that result from such operations. Finally, such an independent health center could also serve an important role in providing training of health care professionals in DoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases and health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses. 
We will continue to retrace the steps and decisions that were made in deploying almost 697,000 men and women to the Persian Gulf in 1990. Hopefully, we will learn from the lessons of this war to prevent some of these same health problems in future deployments, where our troops will again face the threat of an ever changing and increasingly toxic combat environment. But we also must address what our ill Gulf War veterans need now. We need to provide a permanent statutory authority to compensate them. We need to be able to answer the questions of `How many veterans are ill?' and `Are our ill veterans getting sicker over time?" 
Mr. President, this legislation targets these important issues. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and me in supporting this legislation.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in June 1997, President Clinton announced his Initiative on Race, One America in the 21st Century. His Initiative was created to encourage all Americans to work together in understanding and dealing with our racial differences. In the course of the past year, President Clinton has traveled around the country hosting several events to pursue these goals and foster a national dialogue on the subject. I am proud to tell you that West Virginia not only listened to President Clinton's announcement but answered his call to join him in taking action on this important effort. 
The Contemporary American Theater Festival (CATF), located in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, commissioned a play on Asian racism entitled Carry the Tiger to the Mountain, and Governor Cecil Underwood formed his own Initiative on Race, One West Virginia. Together, they planned a Town Hall Meeting on the Performing Arts and Race which was held this past weekend in Shepherdstown and will be broadcast by West Virginia Public Television this coming Thursday and Sunday. 
Over 300 people attended the afternoon performance of Tiger and the Town Hall Meeting which followed and was narrated by Kwame Holman, of The Newshour with Jim Lehrer. The panelists for the event included choreographer Garth Fagan, who recently won a Tony Award for The Lion King; Angelo Oh, a member of the President's Advisory Board on Race; Molly Smith, the Artistic Director of Arena Stage; George Takei, a theater and television actor from Star Trek; Helen Zia, contributing editor to Ms. Magazine; Christian McBride, a jazz artist and composer; Abel Lopez, president of Non-Traditional Casting Project; Dr. Simon Perry, a faculty member from Marshall University; and Liz Lerman, artistic director of Dance Exchange. The audience included local community members of various backgrounds, West Virginia NAACP activists, and over 100 members of the Organization of Chinese Americans. This impressive list of panelists and audience gathered in this small town and produced a level of dialogue on the arts and race to further enhance President Clinton's vision for One America. 
The afternoon discussion brought forth many ideas and questions in regard to the arts and race. The panelists discussed the role of the performing arts in society, how the depiction of minorities as stereotypes can further intensify racial misunderstandings, and how if we as a society would think of culture more than race, then perhaps we could succeed more. As George Takei mentioned, the performing arts are `a forum for understanding and communication.' Yet so much depends on who does the articulating and who has access to the art being presented. In its most truthful essence, the arts can allow `cultures to touch each other,' as Molly Smith of Arena Stage pointed out. And if we can `touch each other' or understand each other, then we can begin easing the tensions that separate us. 
These are but a few of the ideas discussed in Shepherdstown at the Town Hall Meeting, but you can see the wealth of communication that transpired on the subject in just a few short hours. Imagine if a community in every state hosted a similar event to foster and promote honesty and understanding of our racial differences. 
I am very proud of my fellow West Virginians' efforts and success in answering President Clinton's challenge to work towards living as One America in the 21st Century. And I congratulate Ed Herendeen, the producing director of CATF, and Cherylene Lee, the playwright of this commissioned work, for bringing Carry the Tiger to the Mountain to West Virginia for its world premier season. CATF is dedicated to promoting live, provocative theater that challenges us to think about issues in our society, and once again it has achieved that goal.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I support my colleagues, Senator Wellstone and Senator Murray, in their efforts to restore the veterans benefit that was unjustly cut to pay for unprecedented increases in the highway bill. 
Adoption of this amendment would restore the former state of the law, by reinstating disability rights for veterans, while still fully preserving each and every highway project that was included in the highway bill and in the corrections bill that was covertly attached to the IRS Restructuring bill. 
Prior to the enactment of the highway bill, the law required the payment of disability compensation to veterans who could prove that they became addicted to tobacco use while in military service, if that addiction continued without interruption, and resulted in an illness and in disability. The conference report on the highway bill rescinded this compensation to disabled veterans, generating $17 billion in `paper savings' to fund an unprecedented increase in ISTEA. 
Of course, anyone familiar with these claims for compensation for tobacco-related illnesses knows that OMB's cost estimate is just a guess. Since 1993, VA has received less than 8,000 claims, and has only granted between 200-300. In arriving at its $17 billion estimate, the Administration, for some unexplained reason, estimated that 500,000 veterans would file tobacco-related claims each year. The actual cost to VA for claims filed over the last six years has been a few million dollars, not anywhere near the $17 billion estimate. 
I will again remind my fellow Senators who think that subsequent actions have discharged any further responsibility to these veterans, that so far, the Congress has done nothing to undo this wrong. An amendment was adopted to direct a portion of the proceeds from the tobacco bill to VA health care--but it was only for health care, and not for compensation, that is, monthly disability benefits for tobacco-related illnesses. But now there is no tobacco bill. So that effort is meaningless. 
There were also some provisions in the highway bill that provided enhancements to some very important VA programs--the GI Bill, grants for adaptive automobile equipment, and reinstatement of benefits to surviving spouses, to name a few. But the veterans community was not bought off by the spending of only $1.6 billion on veterans programs, with the remaining $15.4 billion going to highway increases. 
Finally, the text of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill, was covertly attached to the IRS Restructuring Conference Report. Although this Report contains some improved language, as it strikes references to smoking being `willful misconduct,' it still cut off compensation for tobacco-related illnesses for the overwhelming majority of veterans. It does not truly help veterans. Instead, it is another nail in their benefits coffin. 
The amendment that Senators Wellstone and Murray put forth today is our only real opportunity thus far to right this wrong and correct the injustice done to America's veterans. The issue before the Senate now is simply whether we are going to continue to wrongly deny disabled veterans the rights they had under law. It is a simple choice--and I hope my colleagues will now choose to `do right' by veterans.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my colleagues, and most especially Senators Grassley, Baucus, and Breaux, in introducing the `Home Health Care Access Preservation Act of 1998.' This legislation seeks to prevent many reputable home health agencies from going out of business and it will ensure that patients continue to have access to quality home care in the future. 
I would like to talk about the importance of health care in the lives of our Nation's seniors and why we must take action to protect their access to home care. Some people question why we need to make these changes. I think they ask because when we talk about providing care, sometimes we forget that it is about taking care of someone. Home care is not just about giving people their pills and checking their blood pressure. It's about giving people who need a little help the ability to stay at home, surrounded by their family and friends. It's about preserving the dignity of people who've worked hard their entire lives to provide for their families and serve the community they live in. 
Mr. President, our seniors should not lose their right to live life in the way they want because of their age. They want to stay at home. They can get the care they need at home. We can provide it for them. And if we can do it, I think we should. 
There are also financial reasons to provide home health care. When managed properly, home health care can save the health system money. Homes care can often be substituted for more expensive care provided in hospitals and nursing homes. 
Last year, the Congress made needed reforms to the Medicare Program through the Balanced Budget Act, including moving to a prospective payment system (PPS) for home care. Everyone, including the home health industry, agrees that the Medicare Program should move away from a retrospective payment system and PPS to encourage all providers to be more cost-effective. 
The move toward PPS was included among many other reforms to Medicare. We, however, knew that we couldn't move directly into PPS--we needed time and more information to create a workable system. Therefore, the Interim Payment System (IPS) was also established in the BBA to transition home care from fee-for-service to prospective payment. But, in making these changes, the future viability of home health care has been threatened. 
Already, at least four home health agencies have gone out of business in my home State of West Virginia. In rural states like West Virginia, sometimes there is only one agency to provide these services in the area. We cannot afford to lose providers without endangering the well-being of our citizens. 
Therefore, it is imperative that we again take action to make sure that the home health care problems we're facing today do not become a crisis that we'll have to face in the near future. This legislation will help do just that. 
This bill attempts to accomplish three critical goals: 
1. Keep agencies viable by providing a badly needed bridge between the old home health payment system and the new system due to be implemented in the next several years. 
2. Level the playing field in the home care industry, ensuring that efficient, low cost providers are able to continue providing services as Medicare transitions to a new payment system. 
3. Make certain that patients with chronic health needs have continued access to quality care. 
Many members of the home health industry are particularly concerned about this issue of providing quality health care to patients with chronic conditions. Under current law, caring for the chronically ill pushes home health agencies closer to the brink of bankruptcy. We share that concern and realize that IPS does not address this issue. As a result, our bill creates supplemental payments to compensate home health agencies for the added costs they incur caring for the chronically ill. 
While this bill would address the immediate concerns faced by the home health care industry, and is an important step toward protecting access--there is still more that needs to be done. While the BBA intended for IPS to be a temporary system, it now looks like it may be in place longer than we expected. I have recently learned that HCFA may have to postpone the implementation of the prospective payment system. They will have their hands full restructuring their computer systems to prepare for the year 2000. I remain concerned that if we do not move to PPS quickly, all agencies will face an additional 15 percent across the board cut. Certainly, this will place an undue financial burden on the agencies and force many to close their doors. 
Mr. President, I am not advocating going back in time and undo the BBA. However, we must address the inequities that resulted from its enactment, particularly when it comes to making certain our seniors get the care they need. To do this, we must level the playing field so that all reputable home health care agencies can remain competitive. Our legislation will accomplish this by providing a bridge between the old Medicare payment system and the new one. 
We have to remain watchful of the situation to make sure that home health care continues to be a viable option for so many in need. We have a commitment to those who came before us and sacrificed so much to make this Nation what it is today. I believe that we have to honor that commitment, and I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting the Home Health Care Access Preservation Act.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. While you are correct that I have concerns about specific provisions in the amendment, I also have concerns about the process by which we have taken up this issue. One of my top legislative priorities since coming to Congress has been the promotion of alternative fuels, and I am concerned that today's action is only a band-aid on a program which needs major surgery. However, I am prepared to accept the amendment today with the commitment to work together in the coming weeks to find a compromise to address my concerns.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am delighted that $10 million to fund S. 2115, the Department of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Providers Incentive Act, has been provided through a managers' amendment to the VA/HUD appropriations bill. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for their cooperation in making this possible. 
The new scholarship and educational debt reduction programs that are contained in S. 2115 are designed to revitalize the Health Professionals Education Assistance Program at VA. This program was originally intended to help VA to recruit and retain health professionals, but it has atrophied in recent years, despite an ongoing demand for educational financial aid by health professionals employed by or interested in working at VA. This funding will help breathe new life into the educational assistance programs, and provide much needed incentives to improve recruitment and retention of primary care providers. 
The VA health care system is in the midst of a major reorganization that is simultaneously reducing the current workforce and creating the need for more primary care health professionals. VHA's five-year strategic plan includes the activation and/or planning of nearly 400 community-based outpatient clinics, to be staffed by primary care health professionals. Yet hiring of these professionals and retraining of current employees, to prepare for these changes, has lagged behind the planning process. The Primary Care Providers Incentive Programs that will be funded through this amendment will motivate current employees to get training in new areas of need by providing scholarships, and assist in the recruitment of new primary care providers by helping to pay off student loans. 
VA needs educational assistance programs such as these to effectively recruit and retain trained primary care health professionals. In VA hospitals and clinics, some of the most difficult positions to fill are those of nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. In my own state of West Virginia, for example, at one of the VA hospitals, there has been a vacancy for an occupational therapist for over 12 years! Two of the VA hospitals have no physical therapists at all. This is simply unacceptable. 
The plain fact is that starting salaries in the VA are not competitive with those in private practice. The Education Debt Reduction Program gives the VA a financial recruitment tool that will be an enormous help in making the VAMCs more competitive for these much-needed and highly skilled individuals. In fact, one of the most frequently asked questions by prospective new employees is whether or not VA has a debt reduction program. Clearly, this program will answer a critical need. 
But improving recruitment is only half of the story. Retention of trained people is equally important. Funding the employee incentive scholarship program can help solve this very real problem. Eligibility is limited to current VA employees, providing a way for vulnerable individuals to protect themselves against future RIFs by acquiring training in the new areas of need. This will go a long way toward improving staff morale at the VA, which has been severely undermined in the last few years due to the necessary streamlining that resulted from significant budget cuts. 
The educational assistance programs in S. 2115 are a valuable investment, enhancing morale of the VA health care providers in the short term, while building a workforce that matches VA's needs and improves veterans' health care in the long run. In the coming months, I will be working with my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to authorize these worthwhile programs.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair. 
I had very much hoped that the argument of politics would not be used in discussing this. I agree with much of what my distinguished colleague over these many years has said. But I think, frankly, that on the question of product liability tort reform there has been enough, sort of acting and sort of wanderlust faith on both sides of the aisle that we don't need to point fingers at each other. 
My view towards this is that I would like to see, as the Senator from Washington indicated, a very modest bill which would be signed by the President to go forward. And I, after 11 years of working on this, am not willing to give up. I am not willing to say that I am going to put product liability to death. I am not going to be a part of that. 
I will, therefore, vote no on this cloture vote because I still think that, arguments about politics to the contrary, neither side having totally clean hands on all of this, the controlling factor ought to be the substance of the bill, which I think is good, and that the controlling factor on a vote ought to be how one feels about whether or not one can continue to debate product liability and hope that the leadership will come together in some kind of an arrangement, as, indeed, in this sort of Kabuki dance there has been. 
The majority leader last night vitiated cloture for today. The minority leader objected. The majority leader yesterday said there would be a period for filing of votes. A Democrat objected. On the other hand, there have been many problems on the other side. 
So what I am trying to do is to promote product liability in a very modest form which will be signed by the President. And, therefore, I hope my colleagues will vote no on the pending cloture motion so we might have a chance to continue this discussion and hopefully work out something on this modest but helpful bill. 
I thank the Presiding Officer.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. I happened to be upstairs in the Hart Building working on something else and listening to Senator Patty Murray from the State of Washington raising this very strong argument about veterans. I previously spoke on veterans; therefore, one might think I wasn't going to come down and give the same speech again. But when I heard the powerful argument from the Senator from Washington and I heard some of the responses, the Senator from West Virginia had to come down, because this is really the only way that we can protect veterans. We have no other choice. 
I believe the Senator from Rhode Island--although I didn't hear him say it, I know he said it in the past--this is somehow expansion of the benefit, this is some new benefit that goes to veterans. I don't know how to make this clear, but what we are talking about here is that, through however it worked, the legislators who were working on this particular piece of legislation, that started out with ISTEA and now has come to the IRS conference report, rescinded current law. 
They took current law which says that if you go through all the steps that you have to go through in the VA to prove that you are a disabled American veteran by virtue of your addiction to nicotine and that it was caused and continued and it was because of your service, and all of these steps that you have to go through, that you are entitled to appropriated funds. 
I will agree it is not money that comes from highways. I have always said this is not money that comes from highways, either ISTEA I or ISTEA II. But we have rescinded current law and, therefore, veterans are being denied and will be denied--unless as the distinguished Senator from Washington is trying to do in making a point of order--disability benefits which are rightfully theirs under current law. 
How do we come to this point? How do we allow ourselves not to correct this? It is not a matter of spending money. It is not a matter of taking money away from this or that highway project. It never has been. It is simply reinstating current law which, in fact, at this particular moment only affects 300 veterans throughout the United States of America, because out of the 8,000 who have applied for this disability, only 300 to this point have made it. 
Now, I think we are probably talking about $200 or $300 million total. The administration, of course, participated in this sham by coming up with this $17 billion. Then it was $10.5 billion. And who knew what it was, which was basically to pay for programs which they wanted. Unfortunately, the majority party joined in on this. 
So here are the veterans with nobody to speak for them, with no legislative tools available to them, left on an unamendable conference report on IRS which has nothing to do with veterans. And the Senator from Washington is doing the only thing that she can do in her desire to protect veterans, keeping their current law ability to use appropriated funds to pay for their disability benefits. That is what the Senator from Washington is trying to accomplish. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator not agree that if the Senator from Washington prevailed on her point, that, in fact, it would not vitiate the IRS bill, but would simply mean that the conferees would have to go back, the conferees themselves, and do this work and perhaps straighten out the veterans situation and then come back to us?

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Simply because it is this Senator's judgment that what the Senator from New Mexico has said is in two respects incorrect. This Senator would like to simply give his opinion, and that would be that, No. 1, the ISTEA bill would in no way be affected. That is signed. It would in no way be affected. Second, the IRS bill would in no way be affected at all. It is simply a matter that the conferees--again, new conferees--would come back, not debating the IRS bill, but simply clearing up this matter which is of extreme importance to this country's moral obligations to veterans.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very happy to be making comments while the Senator from the State of Wyoming is presiding. 
Mr. President, I wish to say that there may hopefully be some encouraging news with respect to the negotiations going on about product liability. As you know, the majority leader came to the floor and said that a cloture vote would continue as planned for tomorrow morning, and that amendments would be allowed up until 5 o'clock, which collectively allowed for about 4 hours of amendments. 
I think it is very important, in the relationship between the majority and the minority, for the minority to be able to make amendments. And I think there has been some--no, not some, but a great deal of concern from our side about the pattern of using cloture motions, rather than as a chance to shut off debate, as simply a chance to shut off amendments. But now I understand that there is some consideration being given to perhaps postponing the cloture vote for a period of days so that there can be some discussion on the subject of amendments on the product liability bill. 
It is actually very interesting. In all the years--I was reflecting on it this morning with Senator Gorton--that this Senator from West Virginia has been working on product liability, there has really been no debate about product liability, only speeches. There have been speeches on the topic or a filibuster would commence and continue, and a series of speeches, but really never debate, never questions and answers back and forth, people probing each other. 
So I hope, anyway, that this possibility will come to pass. I think we do need debate. I think we do need a chance to offer amendments. 
Having said that, however, the Senator from West Virginia wishes to reiterate his position that I reached an agreement with the White House. It was an arduous, long process, but one in which honor and faith was kept on both sides, and I feel bound by the position of the White House as it stands now, or however it develops--and it probably won't develop--but that has to be my position. I am a defender of the faith, so to speak, in terms of the negotiation that I carried out with the White House to produce a rather minimal bill with respect to product liability but, on the other hand, a bill which moves the subject forward. 
Mr. President, my real purpose today is to speak about veterans' rights. I should start out by saying that I very much respect the chairman of the Finance Committee, whom I specifically and directly remove from any criticism which I might be about to make, because it should not be directed at him at all. That goes also for the ranking member, Mr. Moynihan, for his part in bringing the IRS debate and bill to a conclusion. But I am not happy and I think my colleagues know that. 
Veterans' rights have been bartered away, in deals without the full scrutiny of the Senate or even the authorizing committee. There are many here who believe very strongly in the authorizing process; not everything is appropriating. Authorizing has to come first. That is the way of the Senate. That has been quietly and very definitely thrown aside in this whole process. 
I am referring to the denial of veterans' disability rights which were enacted as part of TEA 21, and in the process now going on with regard to the technical corrections bill needed to amend drafting errors which were admittedly made in that bill. 
America's veterans, indeed, all Americans, are being subjected to what amounts to an unprecedented power play, conducted behind closed doors, as part of the highway reauthorization process. This is a kind of process which one can talk about on the Senate floor and very few choose to listen to it, because it sounds like what everybody doesn't like about Washington and, in fact, it is what everybody should not like about Washington. 
This is an example of a process run amok, where any provision, no matter how heinous or unrelated, can be added in conference under cover of darkness. 
Now, of course, if you add something in conference, all of us understand that the conference report is unamendable. So you vote yea, or you vote nay on the report, but you cannot amend it; thus the power to use this process is a formidable power, and thus we need to do things correctly in this body. 
I think the process that has gone on here is a process all Members are going to come to lament. This process is backroom, back-door politics. It is not democracy, and, Mr. President, veterans have earned better than this. 
Veterans have earned more from their government than a process that denies their rights without any accountability. Veterans have earned more than a process where the denial of veterans' rights can be inserted into unamendable conference reports, under the cover of darkness. They have earned more than a process where, in the name of expediency, extraneous provisions are placed in conference reports to avoid accountability, and where the majority has, in effect, destroyed the normal protections. 
Why is it, I ask myself time and time again, why is it that this Senate is willing to look the other way on this? Why is it 
that we are allowing such an abuse of power to go on? 
It is clearly unfair. I do not think that it was the original purpose of the conferees or the original people doing ISTEA to deny benefits that are in the current law for tobacco-addicted veterans who have disabilities, veterans who have gone through an unbelievably difficult process at the Department of Veterans Affairs to qualify for service connection for their disabilities. But, in fact, under the highway bill, current law has been rescinded, wiped from the books, and nobody has done anything about it, and nobody can do anything about it. And we sit here, stand here, talk here, silently, knowingly doing nothing about it at all. 
Now, IRS reform, highway spending, these are two things that I very much favor. I voted for the underlying bills. In terms of the IRS reform conference report, had that come up clean, I would have voted for it now. I voted for it in committee. I am on the Finance Committee. However, I cannot support its passage at the expense of America's veterans. 
You say, well, but that is just one group of people and this is a very large issue. Well, veterans are more than just one group of people, Mr. President. They are symbolic of the tenor of a nation, the moral attitude of a country towards its citizens who have maintained its freedom. Veterans are at all times to be taken very seriously because of the sacrifices that many of them have made, and in this case in particular, where their disability has been fostered by the Government's actions in a number of ways. 
My colleagues know I have been fighting for many months to correct the injustice that we did to veterans. It is my duty, it is my honor to do so, and I am going to continue to do so here. But I must stop and ask, why, why is it that the majority continues to use their power to deny full Senate consideration of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill? 
If we brought it up, we could have a time agreement of a half hour, divide it in two, 15 minutes each side, and we could have an up-or-down vote. But, of course, all of that is just talk at this point, because we are on a conference report and it cannot happen, and I understand that. But that will not keep me from standing here and voicing my outrage at a process which so undoes veterans who have suffered, and does it so unfairly. 
Why has the leadership endorsed, in fact induced, conferees to take such action? Why have they decided to totally ignore the needs of America's veterans on the way to what amounts to a 44-percent increase in highway spending over the last budget cycle. 
I am all for highway spending. I remind my colleagues I come from the State of West Virginia, where only 4 percent of the land is flat, so if you don't have a highway somewhere around you, you are in pretty big trouble pretty quickly. So highways are important to me. 
But instead of bringing this bill to the floor for debate and a single amendment, the majority simply said they would find another way to pass this bill, quietly, covertly, out of the light of day. And it turned out that the other way of doing this was the IRS conference report, which we are debating today. 
We are evading the usual process that would have allowed this to be fully aired and debated in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over veterans compensation matters. People say, well, jurisdiction, who cares? Well, jurisdiction matters, and there are a lot of people in this body who place great weight on jurisdiction. Authorizing committees have jurisdiction for some things; the Appropriations Committee has jurisdiction for other things, but jurisdiction is important. 
Jurisdiction has been bypassed, abrogated, tossed aside in this whole process, and now we are taking away a benefit which was granted to disabled veterans under existing law. Some are going to argue we are giving veterans a new benefit. That is absurd. We have removed a benefit which was there under the current law for veterans who are tobacco addicted to the point of disability, after going through a series of VA tests which are so rigorous that at this point, only a relatively few hundred have been able to qualify for those benefits. So it is extremely unfair. 
Once again, we sidestep the regular process. The IRS conferees failed to restore the benefits. Once again, I exempt the ranking member of the Finance Committee and the chairman of the full committee. I exempt them from blame for this. We failed to restore the cuts. And this is at the direction of the majority. This has been a complete mockery of our budget process and of regular order in the Senate. 
So, this is what I have called a `midnight raid' on veterans' benefits. To put it bluntly, America's veterans have been wronged, deeply wronged, by backdoor trickery. Funding for veterans' benefits has been cut; imaginary savings have been diverted to pay for highways; and veterans' disability rights have been placed in jeopardy, to say the least. 
I had hoped to offer an amendment to the corrections bill that would have struck the veterans' disability compensation offset from the underlying conference report. But that was all pushed aside. I no longer have that option. 
I will say that the IRS restructuring conference report has slightly improved the language pertaining to veterans. I will give them credit for that, since credit must be given where credit is due. The conference report strikes references to smoking being `willful misconduct.' You understand I am talking about a veterans population, for the most part older, which was encouraged to smoke by the Government, told to take a smoking break, where they were sold cigarettes at a reduced price, and where the warnings about the dangers of tobacco were not even produced or shown on cigarettes used in the military until 5 years after that was happening as a routine matter for the civilian population in the United States. 
So, this is another nail in the veterans' benefits' coffin. I am very, very angry about it. America's veterans will not be fooled by backroom, backdoor legislating, no matter how anybody chooses to try to clean up the record on this. They will see through this charade. They will remember it on Veterans' Day, on Memorial Day, on the Fourth of July, when we all give our speeches about veterans. And then we come in, in the darkness of night, and take away benefits from disabled veterans, who under current law have disability compensation rights, and we take them away. We take them away and will not restore them. I cannot be a part of that, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to oppose the IRS reform conference report. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, here we are again. As always, I am very proud to be standing across the aisle from my dear colleague, Senator Gorton. Senator Lieberman is very much a part of this. There are many who are very much a part of this. 
I can report that we are in a position, as the Senator from Washington has indicated, to pass and to have signed a product liability bill for the first time in my living memory, at least, in the Senate. This is, I guess, my 11th year on this subject. 
We have a chance to have the bill signed, however, by the President, only if we maintain the bill in its current very limited form. I, obviously, congratulate Senator Gorton--who does a prodigious job in all events--on this subject and many others, but he has also been extraordinary in the way that he has accepted and rejected and negotiated not only with myself, but also with the White House in his discussions with the majority leader to, in effect, finally bring a product liability bill to the floor which actually can pass, and if it does pass, will be signed by the President, provided that it is in its current limited form. 
It is a good feeling to have a bill that can be signed. I am much more accustomed to being here promoting a bill that I know would be a good bill, but, on the other hand, which I know in the end isn't going to be signed. When you know something is going to be signed, that says two things: One is that you are dealing with some folks in the White House who have been very honorable and consistent; and, second, you have a very limited bill. 
The Senator from Washington used a much more tactful phrase. He said a `somewhat more limited bill.' I will be more direct and say that it is a very much more limited bill. The logic for that is very simple. If it was other than its current form, we might be able to pass it, but it would not be signed. I just somehow fail to see the logic or the wisdom of, once again, passing a bill that is vetoed. I don't see the point in that. It takes up a lot of our time. 
We have all worked at this for years and years. If we are going to do something, let's get what we can. I think that is one of the lessons we learned from health care reform--one which I myself did not learn easily--that when we try to do the whole job, or at least a large chunk of the job, the Congress is not willing to accept it. I now refer to myself on health care reform as a `raging incrementalist.' I have had to accept that position. On product liability reform, I now think the more limited approach makes a great deal more sense. 
I say again to my colleagues and those who work with them, that when I say there is not a lot of room for deviation in this bill, the Senator from West Virginia really means that. This is a process in which I worked for a very long period of time negotiating with the White House, knowing that it was fruitless to come forward with a bill which would not meet with their approval. In essence, we had to look at all of those things which were displeasing to the White House last year when the veto took place and then simply excise all of those or anything related to those, and proceed to craft a bill which did not meet their objections. They were very tough about it, but they were very fair about it. They were very consistent. I really respect them for that. I can name the people who did that, and I will at the appropriate time, but I really honor them for their consistency and their willingness to let it be known where 
they stood. 
Then, my obligation is to let my colleagues know that this is not one of those bills where we can come in and do all kinds of things to it or else it will be vetoed, and only the President holds the pen. He always does, but sometimes there is more room for movement. On this one, I think there is very little room for movement. 
Senators know our legislative calendar is growing very short. That is why I have been so adamant about urging floor consideration for the reform agreement that has been reached with the White House and which will be signed if passed. Senator Gorton and I recently completed work on some technical changes which the White House had agreed to accept but, again, technical, no substantive changes. No substantive changes were contemplated by the White House; no substantive changes were agreed to by the White House, only some technical changes. 
Why? Because they are the controlling element here. They are the ones who have the pen. They can veto it, or they can sign it. Therefore, their leverage is considerable. I can pretend we are otherwise, but it doesn't do me much good. That is the case. Therefore, if we are going to have some form of bill, then let's proceed to get what we can. That is the way Senator Gorton and I have proceeded on this bill. 
I reemphasize to my colleagues that the White House has publicly committed to signing this bill if it remains in this form. That will grate on some of my colleagues. I have also had private assurances this bill will be signed if it is unamended. It is now up to the full Senate to decide if they want a campaign issue or if they want to pass a moderate, balanced, responsible reform bill that helps small business, product sellers, renters, lessors, as well as consumers, but which, in the end, is a fairly modest bill. 
My colleagues know there are many of us who have worked very hard to gain a meaningful and fair reform. I have taken on this task, not because I am a lawyer, which I am not; not because I am heavily involved in following these matters in the trade press, but for a very simple reason. And that is I genuinely believe that in an international global economy, we have to keep up with the competition. 
I just returned from 10 days in China with the President. It is just absolutely stunning to see what is going on there, the way that economy, in spite of the Asian troubles, is leaping ahead. This is true all over Asia. The Asia crisis is going to pass. It is going to be a couple of years. It is going to pass. They are going to come back. The Asian countries are predestined to be successful economically. 
All the European Union nations have a single product liability law. I know, just as a matter of common sense, that when something is manufactured in a State, if it is an average State, 70 percent of the manufactured products will be exported on an interstate, if not international, basis. Therefore, State law, having had meaning at some point, has much less meaning when it comes to interstate commerce, much less international commerce. Again, it is not just a question of the laws, but it is also a question of are we being competitive or not. What is the added cost for liability insurance to our products as we compete in Europe and Japan now, for example, which has also taken on a single national uniform product liability law. 
All of these things are extremely important. I also think having 50 States with separate laws is confusing. It means that people forum shop. They go to the State where they can get the best deal. I think it is true--I am not sure it is true this year--but it is true that last year, 85 percent of all of the punitive damages awarded in this country came out of Alabama, Texas, and California. That means that people knew where to go to get into a court system which would, in a sense, respond sympathetically. I don't think that is a wise way to carry on the business of our country or the commerce of our country. 
All of these States having different laws is very, very complex and very difficult in allowing us to compete, and in fact, in even allowing us to adjudicate in product liability cases where people have, in fact, been injured and do, in fact, deserve payment and, in some cases, punitive damages. 
The plain fact to this Senator's way of thinking is that our current system is simply unable to handle this problem in the modern marketplace and much less--or more so, really--in the global marketplace. 
States cannot deal with product liability problems that occur out of their borders. They can't do that. 
In contrast to the circumstances that existed when our tort system was evolving, most goods, as I indicated, move outside of the State. That is important. When our tort system was evolving, the States could handle it. The States did handle it. Exporting from McDowell County, WV, to Braxton County, WV, was the way life went on some time ago. Now if you export to Ohio, much less the State of California, much less Indonesia, Japan, or China, you have to be much more sophisticated in the way you handle these problems. I think a Federal product liability law does make sense. That does not mean in all respects, and this bill does not do that in all respects, and I think that is an important point. 
I was a member of the National Governors' Association for 8 years, and, like other companies, I was protective of States rights on all issues. But they have fairly consistently recognized the importance of establishing a Federal statute on product liability. I think that is very significant and deserves the consideration of my colleagues. 
There is another bipartisan group called the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group of over 3,000 State legislators from all over the country. They have repeatedly urged Congress to enact Federal product liability reform--Federal product liability reform. 
The bill we are proposing would address the problems in our product liability reform system which we know exist. It would provide increased predictability for business. It would improve the system for consumers at the same time. Is it gigantic on any side? No, because it is not a big bill. That we constantly bear in mind, because if it were a bigger bill, it would not get signed. We want to get the bill signed. This is not the `nose under the tent' theory. It simply would be nice to get some sort of uniform Federal standards on product liability going. 
Under today's product liability system, companies have a disincentive to invent, to innovate. That means there are a lot of beneficial upgrades that are not done. People do not undertake certain kinds of biomedical research or pharmaceutical production or other things just because they fear the result of getting sued. It isn't really so much the number of suits. Those who oppose this Senator's position are always talking about, `The Senator from West Virginia is always talking about the explosion of litigation.' 
I have never talked about explosion of litigation. There is no explosion of litigation. But the psychological factor of a company sitting down and trying to decide whether it will go into a line of research and development which could lead to a cure for some disease, the present laws pull them back. Look at Viagra. It now has had about 300 deaths. I don't know what will happen with Viagra. Maybe they deserve to get sued, maybe they don't, I don't know. But you can see when people are looking at doing some kind of research that they want to pull back. In the case of Viagra, maybe they should have in the first place. Or maybe their warnings were not adequate. 
I am not here to defend Viagra, as I was never here to defend Ford Pinto--that was always the example. Ford Pinto is undefendable. They should have been sued, they were sued, and that was the right thing to do. 
Keeping products off the market that can do remarkable good for people is not in the American tradition; protecting consumers is in the American tradition. But we have always managed to find a balance where we both protect consumers and we move forward, strongly, in terms of innovation. We have always been the country of basic research. Other countries have been the countries of applied research. Basic research is not undertaken unless you can foresee it ending up someday in the marketplace. If you don't, then you don't do it. 
We can help all of this by establishing a set of Federal rules for product liability cases. The compromise bill that Senator Gorton and I were able to work out with the White House, and which was introduced on June 25, creates a national framework for a more rational process for litigation regarding products, and products alone. If a manufacturer was, in fact, responsible for injury, it would remain accountable. If the seller of a product failed in its responsibility, it would be held accountable. The legislation is limited, meaningful, and signable.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will briefly run through a list of the bill's major provisions for my colleagues in the hope that some of them and some of their staff they work with are listening. 
No. 1, the bill, as the Senator from Washington indicated, protects product sellers, renters, and lessors from suits that should be brought against manufacturers, not the product sellers, renters, or the lessors. Product sellers, renters, or lessors will be held liable for their own negligence, make no mistake. For their own negligence they will be held accountable, or their failure to comply with express warranty, but not for the negligence that is beyond their own control. That comports, it seems to me, with common sense. 
The product seller, renter, or lessor remains liable if the manufacturer cannot be brought into court. So, again, a consumer protection. Or they remain liable if the manufacturer is unable to pay judgments. All of this is in order to ensure that consumers retain a source of recovery. So, product sellers, renters, or lessors, et cetera, are protected, but they are not protected in the ultimate sense. That is, if manufacturers don't show up, are broke, can't pay, they--the consumer, injured consumer--will still get recovery. 
No. 2, this bill will create a defense in a product liability case if a plaintiff is found to have been under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol and was responsible for more than 50 percent of his or her own injuries. That has always struck me as a commonsense idea. We should help discourage abuse of illegal drugs or alcohol. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But in any event, if people are responsible for their own use of alcohol or drugs and responsible for more than 50 percent of their injury, there should be an absolute defense against that. 
No. 3, if a claimant's harm is attributable to the misuse or alteration of a product, defendant's liability will be reduced by whatever extent the harm is due to that misuse or alteration. 
No. 4, consumers will have 2 full years to file a complaint from the time he or she discovers or should have discovered the harm and--this is new--the cause of the injury. A lot of States have the harm, the discovery of the harm, but there are not as many that have the cause. So, this is very, very strongly in favor of the consumer. This is particularly true--on the veterans committee, I have worked very hard on a variety of issues, including the Persian Gulf War Syndrome, all kinds of things in the world we are moving into, like toxic harm, et cetera, where the cause becomes much more important, because often things don't show up until much later. 
No. 5, the bill's 18-year statute of repose applies to only durable goods in the workplace, and only in those situations which are covered by State worker compensation laws, and specifically excludes injuries caused by toxic harm. I just mentioned toxic harm. Well, toxic harm has no place, there is no remedy for it, in this bill. This means that only people who can recover for their injuries under State worker compensation laws are subject to the statute of repose. The statute of repose does not begin until after the product's express warranty expires. This provision is good for consumers, and, frankly, it is good for business. Businesses are relieved of unlimited liability, and consumers have a source of recovery. 
No. 6, alternative dispute resolution--this is not the most potent part of the bill that I can imagine--we have an alternative dispute resolution that avoids protracted legal battles. That is encouraged under this bill. Either party can request alternative dispute resolution using existing State ADR procedures. 
No. 7, one of the main provisions of this bill limits punitive damages for truly small businesses 
(under 25 employees with $5 million in revenue), individuals (with incomes of $500,000 or less), and local governments. It creates a Federal standard for awarding punitive damages which are reserved for the most egregious cases--clear and convincing. We simply take the Federal standard, uniform standard, and put it, frankly, where I think most people agree it should be. The bill sets the limit for these punitives for small businesses to $250,000, or two times the economic and noneconomic damages. This limit means that businesses will still have to pay punitives, should that be the judgment of the court, but they are less likely to be bankrupted by the cost of the penalty. This bill does not create punitive damages in States that do not permit punitive damages. That needs to be said clearly. If the State does not have it, this bill will not create it. 
The bill includes a workplace safety incentive by affecting an employer's right to recover worker compensation benefits from a manufacturer whose product harms a worker if the employer's fault was a substantial cause of the injury. 
Finally, Senator Lieberman's biomaterials access assurance bill is the second title of product liability reform. I should say, in all due candor, this was something that was worked out between the White House, Senator Lieberman, and other parties. I concentrated, as did Senator Gorton, on the products aspect of this. Senator Lieberman did the biomaterial section of that and did a very good job. The White House has accepted it and it is part of the bill. This provision is designed to alleviate the shortage of certain biomaterials due to biomaterials suppliers who are increasingly unwilling--as those who would wish to do basic research--to supply products that produce very little revenue, but which would have high litigation costs attached to them. It should ensure the availability of life-saving and life-enhancing medical devices. 
Specifically, the provision will protect suppliers of biomaterials by allowing them to seek early dismissal from claims against a medical device manufacturer, so long as the supplier did not manufacture or sell the device and met its contract requirements. 
In sum, then, Mr. President, this bill, I think, is balanced in its treatment of consumers and business. Again, it is not a large bill. I think it should have strong, bipartisan support. 
I believe in the need to develop a Federal-level framework. To me, the free flow of interstate commerce demands some form of a rational and fair approach. I think that involves, to a certain extent, Federal standards. We are, after all, in a global economy, and the world has changed almost totally in the last 10 years as regards to this product liability subject, and the need for the legislation is greater than ever. 
I am not naive. As we head into this debate, there is long experience--over a decade--of filibusters and vetoes on products legislation. That is why I am so pleased that we have succeeded in negotiating a new bill with the President and his team. This bill has a firm commitment from the White House that it will be signed if it is unaltered. My colleagues do not like to hear the phrase `if it is unaltered.' The Senate does have a right to work its will, but if the Senate works its will and the White House is displeased, of course, there will be no bill. That is a choice the Senate will have to make. 
So to hit the highlights again--one gives this speech only once during the course of debate--we would gain strong protections for product sellers, renters, lessors and suppliers; strong protections for biomaterials suppliers; uniform Federal statute of limitations and workplace durable goods statute of repose; uniform Federal rules on alcohol and drugs; uniform Federal rules on misuse or alteration; uniform Federal legal and evidentiary standard for punitive damages--the key word being `uniform'--strong protections for small business from punitive damage awards; States' advances on joint and several liability determination would remain in place; more uniform rules of preemption (punitive damages and statute of repose changes). And then, as I indicated, there are incentives to resolve litigation, although they are not mighty in their nature. Nevertheless, they are there. 
I am fully aware that some have reservations about the limited nature of the product liability compromise that we secured with the White House, believing that it does not go far enough. That is a view that in other places or at other times, perhaps, might have my concurrence. But we are not in other places and in other times; we are here and now. It is not my view that we will move forward toward enactment of anything if we make changes to this bill. 
For the Record, let me acknowledge that we will face amendments that go beyond the compromise that Senator Slade Gorton and I have now secured with the White House. That was true in the last attempt to move product liability reform, and it resulted in--guess what? A veto, and no law. Those expansions will not have my support. I will not support them, and they cannot be signed into law. 
As I have stated many times before, I don't intend to support product liability reform provisions for the sake of doing it, so that I can say I did it. I want to see a law. I want to see something come from this process after all these years. As the Senate proceeds with debate on product liability reform, I sincerely hope and believe that the majority leader will take advantage of what I consider to be virtually the last opportunity to enact limited Federal reform of our product liability laws in the foreseeable future. 
Mr. President, that is all I have to say at the present time. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to offer my support for S. 2168, the FY 1999 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriation bill, and most particularly for Title I, the section outlining funding for VA. 
Once again, the chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, and the other members of the Subcommittee, have taken a reduced allocation and tremendous limitations on funding, and have miraculously created a bill which adequately addresses the needs of America's veterans. While I would always want to increase support for veterans programs further, I am enormously pleased with the result of their efforts. I would like to highlight several accomplishments in particular. 
On the health care side of the ledger, the Committee on Appropriations recommended $17.25 billion for VA medical care, a substantial increase of $222 million over the President's request and $192 million above the FY 1998 level. When these funds--$17.25 billion--are coupled with receipts collected under the Medical Care Cost Fund, the Veterans Health Administration will have access to $17.92 billion in discretionary resources to care for sick and disabled veterans. 
I am also particularly gratified by the Committee's report language on the need for community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in the Eastern Panhandle of my home state of West Virginia. Indeed, the Committee noted that clinics in Petersburg and Franklin will benefit approximately 2,000 veterans who have been forced to drive long distances and spend the entire day at VA medical center for routine health care. I am hopeful that VA will begin providing needed health care services by the end of this year, if not sooner. 
I must also mention the extraordinary work done by the Committee to appropriate substantial funds for the VA medical and prosthetic research account. For the first time in many years, the Administration had proposed funding this account at the level of $300 million. Although this amount represents an increase compared to last year, unfortunately, this level of funding is not sufficient even to keep up with inflation, much less provide for any real growth. 
For many years, the VA research program has suffered from flatline funding that has hampered its ability to improve the quality of care provided to veterans, attract well-trained physicians, and advance medical treatments that can benefit the nation as a whole. In light of this, the Committee has gone beyond the $300 million mark and allocated an additional $10 million. These additional funds will produce research discoveries which will benefit veterans and non-veterans alike. 
The bill before us also includes a substantial increase for grants for construction of state extended care facilities. The Committee recognized the important role State Veterans Homes play in providing domiciliary and nursing home care to veterans and chose to recommend $90 million for this program. This recommendation is $10 million more than the fiscal year 1998 funding. 
The Committee also included report language which emphasizes the need for VA to ensure funding for grants and per diem payment assistance to community-based providers of services to homeless veterans. In the past three years, VA has closed approximately 4,500 acute mental health and substance abuse beds. At the same time, the number of unique patients receiving outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment has increased by 8 percent. There is no question that outpatient based treatment for homeless veterans with mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders can be effective, but such treatment must be coupled with safe, supervised transitional housing programs. VA grant programs help to fill the void caused by the closure of inpatient services. 
On the benefits side, I was very pleased to see that the Committee included an increase of $5 million for the Veterans Benefits Administration and tied the release of these funds to submission of a plan implementing the recommendations of the National Academy of Public Administration. VA continues to struggle to correctly adjudicate veterans' benefits claims in a timely manner, and faces a backlog of pending cases and an increase in new claims being filed. Additional funding, spent in a targeted manner, should greatly improve VA's decisionmaking ability. 
The Committee has also recommended a $2.2 million increase in funds allocated for the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Professional Group VII, which represents the Secretary before the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. There is a growing backlog of cases at the Court created by the loss of experienced attorneys and increased productivity of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA). Our veterans should not have to wait additional time for a decision because the OGC does not have the staff to litigate their cases. 
Mr. President, in closing, I am pleased with what the Committee on Appropriations has been able to do for VA. I applaud the leadership of all the members of the Appropriations Committee, and especially those members on the VA-HUD Subcommittee.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. It is my firm belief that this legislation will significantly improve the financial stability, health and well-being of millions of American children. My most sincere thanks to Senators Snowe, Kerry, Jeffords and Dodd, who co-sponsored the Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997, the bill that laid much of the groundwork for this legislation in the Senate. I would like to thank Senator Jim Jeffords in particular for his help in securing the inclusion of vital medical child support enforcement provisions in this legislation. I would also like to express my appreciation to my colleagues Senators Ted Kennedy and Dan Coats for their unwavering commitment to children and for their work on securing better medical child support enforcement. 
There is no doubt that child support penalties and incentives payments simply do not generate the flash and natural interest that other children's issues do. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 addresses some very complicated financing formulas, complex interactions between the Federal government and state child support enforcement agencies and hidden budget implications. Despite its plain wrapping, however, effective child support enforcement is one of the most important roles the Federal government plays in facilitating a real continuum of quality benefits and services for children in this country. 
In my role as Governor of West Virginia and later as Senator and Chairman of the National Commission on Children, my ultimate goal has always been the same: to make sure that all children receive the specialized supports necessary to address a wide range of financial, emotional and medical needs. Child support is one of the most vital sources of support for millions of American children, and the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 strengthens state enforcement of these obligations in a variety of areas. I am proud of the fact that my state works hard to enforce its child support obligations and does an excellent job. It is my hope that this legislation will encourage West Virginia and other states do their job even more effectively. 
One of the most important and, unfortunately, overlooked areas of child support is the enforcement of medical child support (that is, health insurance or medical costs covered by the non-custodial parent). Since 1984, Federal law has required state child support enforcement agencies to pursue medical support as part of every child support order. Despite this requirement, only 60% of national child support orders contain a medical support component. In its 1996 review of state child support enforcement programs, GAO found that at least 13 states were not consistently petitioning to include medical support in their general support orders, and 20 states were not enforcing existing medical support orders at all. 
Such limited enforcement of medical support is dismal, particularly in light of the fact that health insurance and premiums provided through a non-custodial parent's health plan are often a child's only chance for comprehensive medical care. My colleagues and I have worked very hard to make sure that Federal programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program provide quality health care for children whose families cannot afford to cover them. While no one could care more about these Federal programs than I do, they are not designed to be and should not be misused as a backdoor for parents who shirk their medical support responsibilities. 
Unfortunately, effective medical child support enforcement is thwarted by a lack of standardized communication between state child support enforcement agencies and the employers and plan administrators responsible for the non-custodial parent's health plan. This is particularly true for health plans that are governed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) which represent 50% of all employer health plans. With 700,000 children dependent on medical support through ERISA-governed plans and an additional 1,000,000 children dependent on medical support through non-ERISA governed medical plans, it is essential that communication between states, employers, and plan administrators be as efficient as possible. 
The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 seeks to improve enforcement of medical support in two ways. First, it orders the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a medical support incentive measure which would base a percentage of each qualified state's annual Federal incentives payment on its ability to establish and enforce medical child support. If implemented by Congress, this sixth performance measure would be added to the first five already included in this legislation: (1) establishment of paternity; (2) establishment of child support orders; (3) enforcement of current child support orders; (4) enforcement of back child support (or `arrearages'); and (5) cost effectiveness. Once HHS develops this medical child support incentive measure, Congress has the responsibility to make sure it becomes part of the overall incentives program. 
The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 also takes another important step towards effective medical support enforcement by requiring the Secretaries of the Department of Human Services and the Department of Labor to develop a National Medical Support Notice as a means of enforcing the health care provisions of a child support order. Under this new requirement, all states would be required to use and all employers and plan administrators would be required to accept the National Medical Support Notice as a qualified medical child support order under ERISA. 
This standardization is an essential step in ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to providing eligible children with the health care coverage they deserve. The legislation also requires HHS and DoL to bring together a Medical Child Support Work Group composed of employers, plan administrators, state child support directors, and child advocates which will recommend additional ways to remove the remaining barriers to effective medical support. We have also required that HHS and DoL submit their recommendations for further legislative solutions to improve medical support, including any necessary changes to ERISA. 
With $15 to $25 billion each year in uncollected child support, we have a long way to go to strengthen our national and state child support systems. I am hopeful, however, that the changes brought about in this legislation make significant progress towards the ultimate goal of ensuring child support for every child who is entitled to it. In that regard, I am particularly pleased that medical child support enforcement is finally receiving the attention it deserves in the context of these broader changes.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that this amendment, which authorizes $10 million for the DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program, has been accepted. This program is a valuable, mutually beneficial association between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and funds health-related research specifically designed to benefit both active duty military personnel and veterans. In fact, fostering this collaborative relationship was the original intent of the DOD appropriation, back when this program began in 1987. It has been funded every year since then. 
The DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program provides an excellent example of interagency cooperation to achieve a common goal. First of all, the VA and DOD jointly designate representatives to oversee the entire process. Before any money is spent, these representatives identify several specific research topics of interest to both agencies. The Departments, working together, then decide the priorities of the research areas and the appropriate funding levels. Research proposals that are received in response to an announcement of the program are reviewed by external experts, to preserve the integrity and credibility of the research. The result is a program which provides a strong, direct link between DOD and VA investigators to pursue high quality research of mutual interest. 
I am cosponsoring this amendment with Senator Harkin and Senator Durbin who also recognize the tremendous benefits that can be gained from continuing this joint research effort. A collaborative approach like this one allows investigators to follow the natural course of disease or injury from the time of onset during active duty, and afterwards, in the veteran population. 
In FY 1998, DOD and VA spent the funds provided for this program on studies of combat casualty care including bone healing and wound repair, and mechanisms of emerging pathogens. These kinds of studies are personally important to me, because in my own state of West Virginia, we have the highest per capita population of veterans, many of whom received grievous injuries during combat. This program is funding research on limb regeneration and recovery from burn wounds at VA medical centers that include West Virginia, and offers hope for a better future for combat-wounded soldiers. 
Last year's program also included the development of new clinical research areas on treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and prostate diseases, including prostate cancer. As the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed the devastating effects of PTSD on the lives of former military personnel, and I am enormously encouraged by research which may prevent the onset of PTSD. 
Let me stress that this amendment does not specify research areas for focus. That decision rightly belongs with the Departments, because of the collaborative nature of the joint program. They have expressed interest in continuing research in the areas I just mentioned, expanding the studies of emerging pathogens to include host defenses. In addition to these ongoing areas of research, two new research initiatives have been jointly agreed to by both Departments. The first will focus on exercise physiology and combat readiness, while the second addresses traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. 
I am also pleased to note that the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee has included report language recommending that VA and DOD develop a new cooperative research program on alcoholism. Rates of alcohol abuse are significantly higher in the military than among civilians. These patterns of heavy drinking persist in the veteran population, such that alcoholism is one of the most common illnesses found among hospitalized veterans. 
As the nature of war changes, the modern military must cope with threats that include environmental hazards and possible biological or chemical warfare, as well as the more traditional hazards of combat. Research is needed to ensure that we are ready to meet these new risks. We must also remember to care for our soldiers after they have suffered the ravages of war, whatever the wounds. We need additional research to find effective ways to help them have healthy and happy lives after service, to repay them for the sacrifices that they make for all of us.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues Senators Frist, Lieberman, Domenici, Bingaman, Burns, Gramm, and Breaux in introducing the Federal Research Investment Act. This legislation will set a long-term vision for federal funding of research and development programs so that the United States can continue to be the world leader in high-tech industries. 
This is a very important time in our history. One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to see the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are becoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is allowing more people to connect to the internet; and advances in fuel-cell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency hybrid vehicles. In fact, seventy percent of all patent applications cite non-profit or federally-funded research as a core component to the innovation being patented. People are living longer, with a higher quality of life, in a better economy due to processes, procedures, and equipment which are based on federally-funded research. 
What I am afraid of is that many people are not aware that these products do not just `come along.' They are the result of a basis of knowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by federal funding. American companies pull from this knowledge base in order to develop the latest high-tech products which you and I read about in the paper and see on our store shelves. 
I view this knowledge base as a bank. The US government puts in modest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific research. The payback comes from the economic growth which is produced as this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies. That is the good news. 
The bad news is that the United States has been withdrawing more than it has been depositing for several years now. Just this year we are looking at the first budget surplus in 29 years. A large part of the current rosy economic situation is due to our dominate high-tech industries. High-tech companies are currently responsible for one-third of our economic output and half of our economic growth. However, we have not been supporting the fundamental, pre-competitive research which is critical to these industries at the levels necessary to allow us to continue at this pace. We must act now in order to try to correct this situation. 
Recently, Senators Gramm  and Lieberman, along with Senators Domenici and Bingaman, introduced S. 1305 the National Research Investment Act. Their idea was to double R&D funding in 10 years, a very noble and courageous effort. Even more importantly, I think, this bill caused members of the scientific and engineering community to pull together and fight as a whole for an idea. It has certainly caused the co-sponsors of this bill to pull together to try to move forward as a group with their original idea. Our bill is the next step in this process. 
This bill is a long-term vision for federal R&D funding. It creates legislative language which stresses the importance of R&D funding to the strength of our nation's innovation infrastructure. It also sets out guidelines for Congress to use in prioritizing funding decisions. 
Based on a careful review and analysis of our past history, our bill authorizes a real funding increase of 2.5% over the rate of inflation for the next 12 years for federally-funded, civilian, R&D programs. This would increase federal R&D spending from the current level of 2.1% to 2.6% of total, overall budget. It would also cause a doubling, in 1998 dollars, of R&D funding in approximately 12 years. In order to make sure that these increases are fully incorporated into budgetary process we request that the President include these increases in his annual budget request to Congress. 
Currently, as I have stated previously, we are in an economic upturn. This is the perfect time to increase funding for R&D so that we can continue this growth. I have faith that, as long as the economic situation allows it, my thoughtful and wise colleagues will support increasing R&D funding to the levels that we have laid out in this bill. However, I am also a realist. I realize that the economy may not always remain as strong as it is right now. That is why we have introduced a funding firewall. Without this firewall I am seriously concerned that history will repeat itself. In the past, R&D funding is one of the first things that has been cut during times of crisis. This is the wrong approach. I believe that cutting R&D funding levels below a bare minimum level causes serious, long-term harm to the R&D infrastructure in the United States. Our firewall would not allow this to happen. It is not meant as a goal, it is meant as a bare minimum which should only be implemented in the leanest of years. 
Many, if not most, recent `quantum leaps' in knowledge have occurred at the interface 
between traditional disciplines of research. Therefore, we legislatively mandate that this funding increase must be macroscopically balanced, so that there is not preferential growth of one agency, program or field of study at the expense of other, equally qualified and deserving agencies. One of the original reasons that I started to get involved with technology issues such as EPSCoR and EPSCoT, was because I believe that technology should be shared by everyone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in Boston. Therefore, this bill should not be seen as a means of promoting elitist science but as a mechanism for allowing for diversity in our national innovation infrastructure. 
Finally, so that we are able to assure other Members of Congress and the general public that this money authorized by this Act would be well spent, we have included accountability measures which will assure that there is no waste of federal money on out-dated, or ill-conceived projects. This bill puts into place a system of accountability for each affected agency. Our bill institutes a study by the National Academy of Sciences to determine how to effectively measure the progress of R&D based agencies and then have them institute performance measures based on these metrics. This will allow increases in funding without concerns over wasteful spending being generated. 
In conclusion, with the help of Senators Gramm, Lieberman, Domenici, and Bingaman, Senator Frist and I have put together a long-term vision for federal R&D funding which we hope will instigate real increases in federal funding for research and development. Federally-funded research has been, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic success. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic prosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at adequate levels. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in the history of illnesses and health concerns that follow military deployments. We have all observed the effects of post-conflict illnesses among our Gulf War veterans who returned with poorly understood, undiagnosed illnesses, and our Vietnam veterans with health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. This legacy is not just a problem of our most recent conflicts; our Atomic-era veterans are still fighting for recognition of health conditions related to radiation exposures they experienced in service to their country 50 years ago. 
If there is any single lesson to be learned from this history, it is that the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have not always been aggressive enough in pursuing the immediate health consequences of military conflicts. Too many times our veterans have had to wait years before post-conflict illnesses are recognized as real problems that require firm commitments of research and treatment programs. These delays have come at a cost to the veterans who have had to fight for this recognition, and they have come at a cost to the government's credibility on this important issue. 
I believe it is time to consider establishing an independent entity with the capacity to evaluate government efforts to monitor the health of servicemembers following military conflicts, and to evaluate whether servicemembers are being effectively treated for illnesses that occur following such deployments. There have been suggestions for the need for such an entity within DoD and VA, but I believe that important health expertise outside these agencies is required as well. Indeed, it may be that the best approach is one that pulls together expertise from VA, DoD, and health care professionals and researchers from centers of medical excellence in fields such as toxicology, occupational medicine, and other disciplines. 
Therefore, I would like to propose an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization to require the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the feasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National Center for the Study of Military Health. 
The proposed Center for the Study of Military Health would evaluate and monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to post-deployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces, including outreach and risk communication, recordkeeping, research, utilization of new technologies, international cooperation and research, health surveillance, and other health-related activities. 
In addition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to members of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on military operations. The proposed center would monitor and direct government efforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their return from military deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid identification of any trends in diseases or injuries that result from such operations. Such an independent health center could also serve an important role in providing training of health care professionals in DoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases and health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses. 
While some have argued that it is time to take some of these responsibilities away from existing agencies, I would suggest that this is a matter for careful study and thoughtful deliberation. Therefore, this amendment would require the National Academy of Sciences to assess the feasibility of such an independent health entity. In their report to the Secretary of Defense, the Academy should provide a recommendation of the feasibility of such an entity and justification for such a recommendation. If such a center is recommended by the Academy, their report should also provide recommendations regarding the organizational placement of the entity; the health and science expertise that would be necessary; the scope and nature of the activities and responsibilities of the entity; and mechanisms for ensuring that the recommendations of the entity are carried out by DoD and VA. 
Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, there have been too many times when I have heard agency officials testify that poorly understood, unexplained illnesses are a common, inevitable occurrence of every military conflict. With the tremendous advances achieved elsewhere in medical and military technologies, I find the acceptance of these illnesses as an inevitability to be unacceptable. I hope that this amendment will offer an initial step to better prevention and treatment of these post-conflict illnesses.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about veterans' rights being bartered away. And I hope that my colleagues both here on the floor and in the various parts of the Capitol will listen to what I have to say, because it may be the last time this can be said. 
These rights for veterans are being bartered away in back room deals; they are being done without full Senate consideration; they are being done without amendments; they are being done without the public's knowledge; they are being done in a way which is, to me, shocking. I am referring to the denial of veterans' disability rights that was enacted as part of TEA 21 and the process which is now going on with regard to the technical corrections bill, which is needed to amend drafting errors that were made to TEA 21. 
Mr. President, I have been in the Senate now for 13 years. I have been very honored to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is part of my Senate service that has truly made me proud. I am proud to be helping real people with genuine human needs. Coming from a great State like West Virginia, which, like the Presiding Officer's State, places great honor on military service, and in serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, both of these things have allowed me the opportunity to learn a lot about the sacrifices that millions of our brothers and sisters have made to preserve the freedoms that we too often take for granted. They have earned our respect in ways that many of us will never know, God willing. 
I am proud to serve veterans, and I hope to continue to serve them however I can. But I am not so proud of the way this Congress--this Senate--is treating disabled veterans this year, and I wish to talk about it. I am, in fact, ashamed for all of us in the Senate. It is not a pretty story. It makes me very angry, and it makes me very sad. America's veterans--indeed, all Americans--are being subjected to an unprecedented money grab, a shell game, conducted behind closed doors, as part of the highway reauthorization process. 
Mr. President, veterans have earned better treatment than they are getting. They have earned more from their Government than a process that denies them their rights without any accountability--They have earned more than a process that is out of control. I repeat, this is a process in which all of the American people are being harmed by what is being done to veterans behind closed doors. 
My colleagues all need to know the truth of this. Why is it that we are now willing to look the other way when a conference report grossly exceeds the scope of the underlying original legislation? As my colleagues know, I have been fighting for many months to correct the injustice that we do this year to veterans. It is my duty, Mr. President; it is my right to do so as a single U.S. Senator; and it is my obligation. 
Mr. President, we bestow upon the Republican leader the power to control the matters that are brought before this body. If the Democrats control, then the Democratic leader does it. If the Republicans control, the Republican leader has that authority. It is awesome authority. It is an awesome responsibility. But the leader has failed veterans this year. 
Why does the Republican leader continue to use his power to deny full Senate consideration of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill? What is he afraid of? Why has the leadership turned a deaf ear to America's veterans who have been calling and writing to all of us to petition to have this bill brought to the floor? Why is it that the Republican leader will not give us the 
opportunity to offer an amendment to H.R. 3978 which would restore veterans' disability rights that were cut off to pay for unprecedented increases in highway funding? 
Instead of bringing this bill to the floor for debate and for a single amendment--30 minutes; that is all I ask for, 30 minutes equally divided--the majority leader has simply said that he will find another way to pass this bill--quietly, covertly, out of the light of day and out of the sight of veterans. It is not a pretty sight. That other way, we are now told, will probably be the Internal Revenue Service restructuring conference report that is slated to come to the floor soon. 
Now, as all of my colleagues know, when a conference report comes, it is unamendable. So it is a winning tactic. You want to get something passed, you put it into a conference report--and nobody knows about it; and nobody even knows where the conference committee is getting its directions--you put it in, then you bring it to the floor. Nobody can amend it, because it is called a conference report. It is sacred on this floor. It is unamendable, evading the usual process that would have allowed this issue to be fully aired and debated in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the authorizing committee which has jurisdiction over veterans' compensation matters. 
The highway bill conferees this spring took away a benefit that had been granted to disabled veterans under existing law--there is no new program here, it is under existing law. The conferees took something away from disabled American veterans--found disabled because of their inservice smoking addiction, having passed through a terrific series of tests which eliminate virtually all of them. 
Now, once again sidestepping the regular process, the Internal Revenue Service restructuring conferees will fail to restore the benefits cut in the highway bill. It will be done at the direction of the Republican leader. And I know something whereof I speak, because I have talked with some of the conferees. That is why I am here to share my sense of outrage with my colleagues. 
This is a critical issue of justice and fairness to people who are addicted because of the efforts of the U.S. Government in part, and in some cases in full. And every moment that we wait to correct this injustice, veterans and their families are irreparably harmed. 
Right now, the Department of Veterans Affairs is holding veterans' smoking-related disability claims in abeyance, just holding them until this corrections bill is passed. And when I say this `corrections bill,' I am talking about a corrections bill we will probably never see, we will never have a chance to debate; there will be no 30 minutes equally divided; there will be no up-or-down vote so Americans will know where people in the Senate stand on this matter--because it is being done in quiet. 
All of this means that the VA is not deciding any of these claims. 
Some were filed over 5 years ago and those folks have already been waiting all of this time for decisions. Their lives are on hold. Some claimants will have died. In fact, I suspect a lot of them will have died waiting for a decision. Some of their widows will have lost their homes since they did not have a VA check to make ends meet because the veterans' disability compensation has been cut off in secret. Every day that we wait, another veteran or a widow is irreparably harmed. We can't go back, but we can help those who are still waiting. 
Let's review the history of what happened here. I understand the Senate wishes to do other things. That is of no concern to me at this moment. What I am concerned about is these people and their future. In a disingenuously conceived fiction, the Clinton administration and the Budget Committee this year created some imaginary `savings.' It was a lovely scheme. 
I had all the OMB people in my office coming to tell me about the wonderful things that they were going to do with this money and that it would be used to help pay for all the President's projects in his budget, but they were doing it at the expense of disabled American veterans who, until recently, under current law, had the right to file disability claims if they are addicted to nicotine because of the U.S. Government. So they create imaginary savings. The Clinton administration did this, first, by increasing the budget baseline by an artificially inflated, absolutely unrealistic, ridiculous estimate of the cost of disability claims of veterans suffering from smoking-related diseases, and then at the same time by proposing to change existing law to bar disabled veterans from receiving this compensation. Well done, well done. The paper savings they created were then used to fund a huge increase in the highway bill. 
Now, these savings, Mr. President, you have to understand, are not real. This is a big shell game. They exist on paper only. They are based on an estimate of 500,000 veterans who would file tobacco-related claims each year. As I have said, so far a total of 8,000 have applied and only 300 claims have been granted. So you can now grasp the ridiculousness of the estimates on the part of the Clinton administration--but still, they came over and argued this. There were calls from the White House, calls from OMB, visits from the White House, visits from OMB. 
Experience indicates there is no factual basis for this ridiculous estimate. The reality, as I will say again, is that only 8,000 veterans have filed such claims over the past 6 years. So you can see these numbers are totally pie in the sky, merely a self-interested guess, a self-promoting guess by OMB. 
Make no mistake about this, the huge increase in highway spending is, in fact, being paid for by make-believe savings, paid for by a devious fiction which is really spending of the surplus which we all so jealously claim to be protecting. Shame on every one of us, all 100 of us. Shame on us for perpetrating the fiction and then for cutting off of the current law for disabled American veterans who are disabled due to tobacco-related illnesses. 
Although based on fiction, the impact of this number shuffling is very hurtful and real. The benefit that has been granted to disabled veterans under existing law has been summarily eliminated by a sleight-of-hand action, without consideration by the authorizing committee--which has jurisdiction, I might add, over compensation issues--in a complete mockery of our budget process and of regular order in the Senate. 
We have created new ways of doing things in this body in order to avoid this issue. Now this is what I have called a midnight raid on veterans' benefits. I have used these and other words in the past and I could use stronger words. To put it bluntly, America's veterans have been wronged by back-door trickery. Funding for the veterans' benefits have been cut; imaginary savings have been diverted to pay for highways; and veterans' disability rights have been placed in jeopardy. 
No, it is not too late to correct this. It is not too late to 
correct this injustice done to disabled American veterans. The necessity of passing a technical corrections bill to the highway bill provides the opportunity to do just that. Those interested in the highway projects listed in the corrections bill are very interested in passing this bill. So believe me, we are going to pass it. It is probably going to come to the floor attached to the IRS Restructuring conference report. Or it will come attached to something else. In any case, there will be no chance for the disabled veterans, but plenty of chances for more Federal dollars for highways. 
The amendment I offer would strike the veterans' disability compensation offset from the underlying conference report on H.R. 2400. I have requested that it be put to an up-or-down vote so that America's veterans can see, in the light of day, where their elected representatives choose to stand on this issue. 
Now, let me be clear what my amendment would and would not do. First and foremost, be assured my amendment strikes no highway project. These projects are already in law. My amendment would fully preserve each and every highway dollar and project that was included in the highway bill. I voted for the highway bill. I support highway funding. I come from West Virginia. Only 4 percent of the land is flat. You think that we don't need roads? Not a single project in West Virginia or any other State will be affected in any way, shape or form by this. Why? Because the projects will be funded through the appropriations process. 
Second, my amendment would not trigger a sequester. That is one of the contentions of those who would deny disability benefits to veterans. It is untrue. My amendment is protected by the same budget trickery, to be honest, that covered the TEA 21 bill and that waived certain provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act. 
Third, the amendment I propose does not provide any new benefit to any veteran. It merely restores the state of the law prior to the enactment of the highway bill. The law was based on interpretation of VA's existing obligation to veterans to provide compensation for smoking-related illnesses. Veterans who file claims for smoking-related illnesses would have to meet the same legal and evidentiary requirements as claimants for any other service-connected disability. The test to establish these claims is, as I have indicated, very tough. I remind you, only 300 have passed so far. 
The veteran must prove that the addiction to use tobacco began in the military service, that the addiction continued without interruption, and that the addiction resulted in an illness, and that the addiction resulted in a disability. 
He must prove all of that. Eight-thousand have tried and 300 have been successful. Easy test? Not quite. 
It is imperative that the correction bill be brought to the floor where it can be debated and amended. If TEA 21 is permitted to stand uncorrected, an entire category of veterans' disability rights will be eliminated. Even claims of veterans who became ill with tobacco-related illnesses while on active duty will be cut off. And smokers' claims for conditions that may be associated with tobacco use, but are also presumptively service connected--please hear this--based on exposure to Agent Orange or radiation, may also be cut off. What are we doing here? 
Moreover, in a provision that truly adds insult to injury, the conference report makes tobacco use in the military an act of `willful misconduct.' Do you know what that means, Mr. President? It means that veterans are justifiably outraged that smoking could be considered `willful misconduct,' equating smoking with alcohol or substance abuse. They feel betrayed by a Government that encouraged smoking during their service, and now would turn its back on the health problems that resulted. 
If H.R. 3978, the corrections bill, is allowed to go forward as drafted, and unamended, veterans and their survivors will forever lose their ability to seek compensation for tobacco-related deaths or illnesses resulting from nicotine dependence that was incurred in service. These veterans will lose their ability to get VA health care. Veterans with service-connected conditions receive priority free health care. If you add it up, if service connection for compensation purposes is barred, using CBO numbers, there will be about 700,000 veterans who will very possibly be turned away from access to VA health care. 
The Government's role in fostering veterans' addiction to tobacco during their military service is well known and much `untalked' about in current weeks. Smoking was thought to calm the nerves. I had lunch with one of my best friends the other day, and he told me that back in World War II he was given free cigarettes in C rations and K rations, and discounted cigarettes--cigarettes which didn't have any warning on them until 5 years after the FDA required that they be put on civilian packs of cigarettes. No; they were encouraged to `take a smoke break, relax, calm yourself. Sure, this is battle and training and it is stressful, but this cigarette will help you.' The voice of the U.S. Government was speaking. 
So all of this represents a shameful abuse of the trust of our young service members. How can we now turn around and call a behavior encouraged by our Government `willful misconduct'? How do we do that? How can we turn our back on these veterans' need for health care? Well, we are doing it by ignoring the consequences of the highway bill and by ignoring America's veterans. 
There has been a lot of talk about veterans and smoking in the last few months. As you know, this Chamber adopted an amendment to direct a portion of the proceeds from the tobacco bill--if we can remember that far back--to VA health care. That action, of course, is now meaningless. Senator McCain was for the amendment and so was I. The amendment was for health care, not compensation for the disability of veterans made ill by tobacco that was foisted upon them by the U.S. Government in service to their country. 
So we have no tobacco bill now. Those of my colleagues who sought refuge in the tobacco legislation now are going to have to look for some other place for refuge. 
Some may also point to the provisions in the highway bill that provide enhancements to some very important VA programs. It was said to me early on, `Senator Rockefeller, you have to understand that we put a lot of things in this technical corrections bill that are for veterans. You can't be against these, because that will cut those things out.' And so they put in some enhancements to the GI bill, grants for adaptive automobile equipment, and a few other programs. 
I am sorry, but veterans are not to be bought off. Veterans are unanimous in their view of this. This is $1.6 billion in benefits that veterans could have. But the price is the abolition of the right for disabled veterans to seek compensation for tobacco-related illnesses--I am sorry, Mr. President, that price is too dear. Our friends in the veterans community speak with one voice on this issue, and I agree, they cannot support the increase in benefits to one set of veterans, to be paid by the cutting of essential benefits to another class of veterans who already have those benefits under law. Veterans across this Nation reject this attempt to buy them off. 
So I repeat--and I am not ordinarily this partisan, and I hope that the Presiding Officer understands that--what is the majority leader scared of on this? Why can't we have a vote on this? This is a basic, moral issue--to determine the way that the U.S. Government chooses to present itself to the American people. There is a fundamental, moral principle involved--undoing current law, under a budget fiction, started by the Clinton administration, and joined in by the majority. So the result of all of that power is that veterans are shut out, dumped, and then cut out of the law from this point forward. Why does the Leader not bring this bill to the floor so it can be debated and amended? Why does he have to move this in the dark of night? Once again, I urge the majority leader to bring this corrections bill to the floor. 
I participated in a conversation at the back of this Chamber with one of the conferees on the IRS bill, describing how, oh, yes, it was probable that this technical corrections bill would be put into the IRS conference report. That sounds positive, doesn't it? No, it is highly negative. That means that when it comes to the floor, it cannot be amended or debated. It can only be voted up or down, and the veterans lose on all fronts from that action. 
My colleagues need to understand that there is a huge problem with the majority leader's tactic. American veterans will not be fooled by what he and others do here. American veterans are not stupid, and they are angry. They will see through this charade, but most of the Members of the Senate do not see through this charade--the charade of how the funding process began and how the highway money comes out of the surplus and the phony savings. I bet there wouldn't be 12 Senators on this floor, who would understand exactly what happened, how absurd the whole thing is, how embarrassing the whole thing is, and how wrong it is for veterans to not even be given a chance. 
America's veterans are justifiably losing their faith in Government. This will accelerate that process for American veterans. They no longer believe that the Government that they fought to preserve intends to meet its obligation to them. I share their fear. 
What is obscene about all of this is that this denial of disabled veterans' benefits occurred just before Memorial Day, when everybody on this floor and in the other body was pouring out words of patriotism, appreciation, love, respect, reverence to veterans for all they have done for their country. But in the Halls of Congress, actions often belie these words. If we do not take care of America's veterans now, one might say, who will take care of us in the future? 
To secure the soldiers we will need in the future, we must maintain the promises made to those who protected us in the past. 
Thirty minutes equally divided up or down, Mr. President, I submit is a fair request on behalf of disabled American veterans. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in the history of illnesses and health concerns that follow military deployments. We have all observed the effects of post-conflict illnesses among our Gulf War veterans who returned with poorly understood, undiagnosed illnesses, and our Vietnam veterans with health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. This legacy is not just a problem of our most recent conflicts; our Atomic-era veterans are still fighting for recognition of health conditions related to radiation exposures they experienced in service to their country 50 years ago. 
If there is any single lesson to be learned from this history, it is that the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have not always been aggressive enough in pursuing the immediate health consequences of military conflicts. Too many times our veterans have had to wait years before post-conflict illnesses are recognized as real problems that require firm commitments of research and treatment programs. These delays have come at a cost to the veterans who have had to fight for this recognition, and they have come at a cost to the government's credibility on this important issue. 
I believe it is time to consider establishing an independent entity with the capacity to evaluate government efforts to monitor the health of servicemembers following military conflicts, and to evaluate whether servicemembers are being effectively treated for illnesses that occur following such deployments. There have been suggestions for the need for such an entity within DoD and VA, but I believe that important health expertise outside these agencies is required as well. Indeed, it may be that the best approach is one that pulls together expertise from VA, DoD, and health care professionals and researchers from centers of medical excellence in fields such as toxicology, occupational medicine, and other disciplines. 
Therefore, I would like to submit an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization to require the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the feasibility of establishing, as an independent entity, a National Center for the Study of Military Health. 
The proposed Center for the Study of Military Health would evaluate and monitor interagency coordination on issues relating to post-deployment health concerns of members of the Armed Forces, including outreach and risk communication, recordkeeping, research, utilization of new technologies, international cooperation and research, health surveillance, and other health related activities. 
In addition, this center would evaluate the health care provided to members of the Armed Services both before and after their deployment on military operations. The proposed center would monitor and direct government efforts to evaluate the health of servicemembers upon their return from military deployments, for purposes of ensuring the rapid identification of any trends in diseases or injuries that result from such operations. Such an independent health center could also serve an important role in providing training of health care professionals in DoD and VA in the evaluation and treatment of post-conflict diseases and health conditions, including nonspecific and unexplained illnesses. 
While some have argued that it is time to take some of these responsibilities away from existing agencies, I would suggest that this is a matter for careful study and thoughtful deliberation. Therefore, this amendment would require the National Academy of Sciences to assess the feasibility of such an independent health entity. In their report to the Secretary of Defense, the Academy should provide a recommendation of the feasibility of such an entity and justification for such a recommendation. If such a center is recommended by the Academy, their report should also provide recommendations regarding the organizational placement of the entity; the health and science expertise that would be necessary; the scope and nature of the activities and responsibilities of the entity; and mechanisms for ensuring that the recommendations of the entity are carried out by DoD and VA. 
Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, there have been too many times when I have heard agency officials testify that poorly understood, unexplained illnesses are a common, inevitable occurrence of every military conflict. With the tremendous advances achieved elsewhere in medical and military technologies, I find the acceptance of these illnesses as an inevitability to be unacceptable. I hope that this amendment will offer an initial step to better prevention and treatment of these post-conflict illnesss.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to pause for a moment to recognize the achievements of the great state of West Virginia, a land of rugged beauty, vast natural and mineral resources, and a hard-working citizenry. The people of West Virginia celebrate these qualities every day, but today is a special occasion when we celebrate West Virginia's 135th anniversary. It was June 20, 1863 when West Virginia rose from the pain of a house divided and took its place as the nation's 35th state. 
The patriotism and commitment to freedom that led West Virginia to split from Virginia in this country's darkest hour have defined the state's history since then. West Virginia was the first state to institute Rural Free Delivery of mail, and its miners led the way in the progressive labor movements of the early 1900's. A leading producer of coal and steel, West Virginia and its people were essential to this nation's wartime economy. 
West Virginia's economy continues to expand into the 21st Century. The state is now on track to become a major producer of everything from automobile engines to aircraft to telemarketing services. In addition, more tourists than ever flock to West Virginia's mountains and valleys for their scenic beauty, recreation opportunities, and friendly folk. West Virginia offers skiing in the winter, blazing colors in the fall, hiking and water sports in the spring and summer, and treasures like historic Harpers Ferry year-round. 
I am proud to represent West Virginia in this distinguished body. I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating West Virginia's 135th year in the Union, and that they and their constituents can gain inspiration from West Virginia's motto, Mountaineers Are Always Free.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor to talk about, as others have, something of fundamental importance to the people that I represent in my State of West Virginia, and that is equal treatment for all Americans with respect to health care. I am not just talking about Congressmen, and I am not just talking about coal miners or CEOs or custodians, I am talking about all Americans and all the time. 
I want to talk about what I think is an urgent need here in Congress to pass legislation on the quality of health care, and that this legislation should apply to every single American. When enough of us recognize these needs, I am convinced we are going to enact legislation, and it is going to be called patient protection. It may have some other name. It may be modified, it may be expanded, who knows? But the need for it is undeniable, and it has to happen. Every single day that passes without the enactment of some kind of patient protection legislation is another day that millions of Americans, thousands of people I represent in West Virginia, are subject to the denial of needed treatments by insurance companies who are looking out for their bottom lines. 
Every single day that we as a Congress fail to act on the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, if we want to call it that, is another day that Americans are left vulnerable to health care decisions made by people who are not doctors--in fact, doctors complain about this all the time--but who are, in fact, business professionals. Every day that we do not act, Americans are refused the specialty treatment they need and deserve. I am going to give two examples of this which I think are scary, and 
which are very real. Make no mistake, if we do not respond and if we do not respond forcefully, more Americans are going to lose confidence in our health care system. 
It is interesting to me, having observed health care now for quite a number of years, that it used to be it was only patients, or only consumers of health care who were worried about the cost of health care, the quality of health care, the problems of health care, the paperwork of health care. Now, the people who really are coming on board in this angst are physicians themselves and nurses and people who work in hospitals who have to deal with the realities of what the health care system has become in this country. 
West Virginia is no exception. West Virginia may have some more problems than some other States, but we are no exception with regard to the need for patient protection. I constantly run into West Virginians when I am at home who complain to me--not at my invitation, but at theirs--about being denied the treatment they felt they were promised, or that they knew they were promised from plans, health care plans where they thought their premiums entitled them to something called quality health care and fair treatment. 
One complaint I hear all too often is being denied specialty care. That is a very big deal. General practitioners can take care of a lot of problems, but sometimes you come to a point where you have to have more. Under most managed care plans, a patient's primary care physician may in fact refer, as the gatekeeper or whatever, a patient to a specialist, if the primary care physician determines that specialty care is necessary. That makes a lot of sense to me. Primary care physicians are in a very good position to do that. That is a professional decision involving going to another professional. However, things may change if the specialist is not on the list often called the plan's network. 
Let me explain. Suddenly, someone then comes from the administrative office, or from some other division, and may take over. Suddenly, the patient who, along with the primary care physician, is anxious for that patient to see a specialist because of some health problem, finds out that the executives, not the physician, but the executives in charge of the managed care plan, people who are not doctors, not medical providers, reserve the right to refuse payment for the specialist recommended by his or her original doctor. In fact, this is a frequent occurrence for people who have insurance companies that push their employees to steer patients to only the physicians listed within their plan. 
That is not the way it is meant to work. Insurance companies do not always make the best medical choices because they are not trained in that business. They are trained in a different business. Too often motivated by their bottom line, which is understandable, and not often enough motivated by the patient's health care needs, many specialty referrals are refused. Now, I go to my examples and I hope my colleagues will listen. 
I think of a little 6-year-old boy from West Virginia who became seriously ill. Concerned, his mother rushed him to the doctor's office, his doctor's office, in fact, where he was quickly diagnosed with diabetes. His primary care physician referred him to an out-of-plan pediatric endocrinologist; a specialist in childhood diseases, that is. That was the referral, to a specialist in childhood diseases. The specialist 
placed this young child on insulin to control his condition. But when the child's primary care doctor referred him back to the specialist for a follow-up visit--which makes a lot of sense--the referral was denied, stating, `* * * service available with in-plan endocrinologist.' 
That doesn't sound so bad, does it? In other words, go to the in-house, in-plan endocrinologist. So while it sounds like the child could get the care that was needed from the in-plan physician, the reality is that he could not get that health care for a very subtle but basic reason. The in-plan specialist was an adult endocrinologist, not a child endocrinologist, specializing in adult diabetes. But diabetes is not the same in children and adults, and there are different specialties for adults and for children in that field. The treatment is different. There is serious risks of developing future health problems when the childhood diabetes is not dealt with properly by a proper physician. The insurance company in this case was gambling, in effect risking this child's future health for the few dollars they saved by saying: Oh, you have to go to an in-plan doctor. 
As bad as that case is--and I wish it were the only one, but it is not--I was recently told the story of a 14-day-old baby girl. Mr. President, 14 days old, this precious little child's health was already jeopardized by her health plan. What do I mean by that? This poor child was brought to her doctor 14 days after birth because of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection at that age requires an evaluation for urinary tract abnormalities. But the referral from the pediatrician to an out-of-plan specialist was denied, again saying services are available in-plan, an in-plan urologist. OK, if she could get the right treatment in-plan, that is what HMOs are for; right? 
But she could not. She could not get the help because the urologist the plan would have had her see was, once again, an adult urologist. Am I picking here? Am I just being petty? No. The problem lies in discovering and treating urinary tract abnormalities which is vital to preventing serious and permanent kidney damage, and the appropriate specialist for such a situation is a pediatric urologist. 
I have working in my office, thanks to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a pediatric cardiologist. A pediatric cardiologist is different from an adult cardiologist. In other words, an adult and child are different and they require different specialists with different skills. It is a basic and important fact. Simply to say you have a urologist in-house is not to say that if that urologist deals with adult urology problems, that it is sufficient for a 14-day-old baby girl. 
This decision by the HMO was based on having an adult urologist, which urologist did not have speciality training in pediatric disorders and, therefore, was not capable of caring sufficiently for an infant. Why? Because keeping her within the plan's network of doctors costs less. 
I understand business, and business is important, but this business of quality of health care treatment is very serious and very scary, and that is what we have to focus on when we are thinking about what we are going to do. These are our children, the most helpless and vulnerable of all of American citizens. They have no way of defending themselves. They depend on their parents, they depend on their communities to take care of them, and these people, in turn, depend on us in Congress to ensure that they are not taken advantage of, that games are not played with their health and the health of their children. 
The time has come for us to pass a bill which guarantees certain commonsense protections for every single patient in America, young or old, rich or poor. This legislation--which we have the opportunity to pass, an obligation, I think, to enact this year, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998--will do exactly that. 
I am interested in good health care for our people, Mr. President. I don't think it is a game, and I don't think it has anything to do with politics. I think it is a very, very serious consideration. 
I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.  
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Becky Cain as she prepares to retire from an outstanding six year term as president of the League of Women Voters. Becky Cain has shown remarkable leadership for the League and her community of Charleston, West Virginia as well as a strong dedication for the well being of the people of her state and her nation. 
For generations, the League of Women Voters has had a tradition of working for campaign finance reform, defending the National Voter Registration Act, working for consumer protection legislation for health care, ensuring health care for seniors by protecting and enhancing Medicare, and protecting Clean Air standards, and strengthening the United Nations by providing adequate funding. This is an organization of leaders, and Becky Cain is certainly a great leader among leaders. 
As the volunteer head of the League of Women Voters, Becky Cain has been an articulate and committed spokersperson for citizens' interest in government. Under her direction, the League has been the leader in the passage of the National Voter Registration Act and has been stalwart in continuing efforts to preserve and strengthen this important legislation. 
Under her leadership one of the priorities of the League has been a comprehensive, nationwide campaign entitled, `Making Democracy Work.' This effort, involving different branches of the League and civic leaders in over 1,000 communities across the nation, is a long term effort to engage citizens in the important issues affecting them, to strengthen our democracy at the community level as well as bringing a diverse group of citizens together to face a larger challenge that faces us as a nation. 
Finally, I would like to thank Becky Cain and volunteers like her who give of themselves so selflessly for the good of their community, their state, and our nation.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize an outstanding teacher, mentor, and West Virginian--Ms. Lucille Smith Watkins. For almost 50 years, Lucille has taught at Logan County Elementary School with unmatched enthusiasm. At 73, she is still fiercely committed to teaching and harbors no intention of quitting, saying `I like getting up and going to teach every day. The children seem to do real well. When I feel like I'm not helping them anymore, I'll retire.' 
Lucille credits her family for instilling an early appreciation and love for education--influenced by the sacrifices and efforts that they exerted in order to make higher education a possibility for herself and her six brothers and sisters. Her early love of education blossomed into a consuming lifelong passion of service to the school as she has often found herself cooking and buying groceries for the school along with teaching. 
Her outstanding commitment to teaching hasn't gone unnoticed in the state. On May 5, she received the very first Lucille Smith Watkins Award, an award in her honor presented annually by her school to the county's outstanding educator. On May 8, she won the Mary L. Williams black educator award during a West Virginia Education Association conference in Charleston. Yet, these awards and honors cannot match her smiles and pride for the achievements of her students. Beaming with price about her student's recent Young Writer's Award and her students' trophy for perfect attendance in her classroom, Lucille is a testament to her own love of teaching, and most importantly her love of her students. 
There is no better way to make a profoundly lasting impact upon the future than through nurturing the mind of a young child. Lucille is a refreshing example of the strength and endurance of one woman's attempt to make a difference. Speaking for the citizens of West Virginia, I am proud to have such an outstanding woman in our state and challenge others to strive to affect and mold the lives of children as successfully as she has.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Shelby to introduce legislation intended to strengthen the manufactured housing industry. Manufactured housing provides a major source of affordable housing for American families and seniors. This industry represents almost 30 percent of new single-family homes sold in the United States. In my state of West Virginia, manufactured housing represents more than 60 percent of new homes. 
Manufactured housing should play a strong role to increase the availability of affordable housing. This issue will be especially important to seniors. According to a recent national survey, 45 percent of households living in manufactured homes are headed by a person more than 50 years old. 
Manufactured housing is affordable housing, and it is the fastest growing type of housing nationally. The average cost of a new manufactured home without land in 1997 was $38,400. Even with land and installation fees, this cost is well below the typical costs of a newly constructed site-built home. 
But this industry faces challenges. Unlike other housing, manufactured housing is regulated by the 1974 National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, (HUD). Because of reform in HUD management, the federal officials overseeing manufactured housing have declined from a staff of 34 to only eight. This decline in staff has occurred at the same time that the industry has grown. Unfortunately, due to a lack of staff, HUD cannot keep pace with the need to update the code on a consistent basis and timely manner. For example, there are new nationally recognized standards for fire protection prepared by the National Fire Protection Association and endorsed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). However, there is no indication that HUD is ready to act on using these new standards to upgrade its codes for manufactured housing. In fact, between 1989 and 1996, a consensus committee has made 140 suggestions to HUD about changes for the federal codes on manufactured housing. More than 80 of these provisions are still pending in the Department. 
In 1990, Congress established a National Commission on Manufactured Housing and pushed the commission to forge a consensus on key issues for this important industry. Unfortunately that effort collapsed in 1994. 
This legislation is a new effort to address the challenges facing the industry. Introduction of the bill is just a first step. We all understand that the legislative process is designed to seek a consensus and improve legislation. I believe that we must work hard to forge a consensus between the industry and the consumers. This will be a challenge, but the potential rewards can be great for both sides. The industry can win and prosper with a more effective, streamlined regulatory process that keeps pace with improvements and standards. Consumers will win if safety standards and regulations are adopted more efficiently, such as the pending fire safety standards. Also, if the industry can use newer standards to provide better housing, manufactured housing could be designed to meet a wider variety of needs including modules for assisted living and stack able units for urban sites. 
My hope is that all sides will see this legislation as an opportunity to come together and develop a new, improved program for manufactured housing. Affordable housing is a major issue for families and communities. Manufactured housing is playing a key role in affordable housing, but more could and should be done. To achieve success, we need to develop a bipartisan, consensus approach. We need to help the industry and assure consumers that safety and standards will be retained and improved, not weakened. This is worth our combined effort to provide more affordable housing.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will address two subjects, primarily veterans and the highway technical corrections bill. But in this morning's Congressional Daily, the majority leader, when referring to the question of the matter of the treatment of disabled veterans who have been addicted to smoking and have become disabled because of that, said, `Where was Rockefeller when we passed this bill?' And that is a quote. 
The majority leader has publicly questioned my record on the issue of veterans' smoking-related disability rights, and I really thought I had a duty to set the record straight. 
The Clinton administration has met with me on several occasions on the veterans smoking issue. I told the Director of OMB and I told the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs at least a year ago that I would vigorously oppose their proposal to deny veterans' disability rights. I have maintained that exact position all along. 
When the Senate considered this year's Republican budget resolution in March, I offered an amendment to strike the budget language which would have transferred the smoking disability rights issue to the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee and assumed denial of smoking-related disability rights--assumed denial of those rights. My amendment was defeated, frankly, fairly much along party lines. 
When the ISTEA bill was brought to the floor by the committee, there were no provisions at all in that highway bill which would have denied veterans disability rights. I support, therefore, highways and I supported the ISTEA bill. I voted for it. 
But in the course of the highway bill conference, language was inserted to deny smoking-related disability rights in the deep of the night, with no consultation--nothing. Of course, as we know now, even this midnight raid was not done correctly and requires major corrections, and I refer to the highway technical corrections bill. Since the conference report was not amendable, there was nothing that I could do about that. There was no opportunity to reverse at that point the injustice that was being done. I could not offer an amendment. It was called a conference report. 
The corrections bill on TEA 21 provides for the first time, therefore, the opportunity to fully protect highways and veterans. We no longer need to make a choice of one over the other. Highways will remain fully authorized. They will not lose a dime. Veterans' disability rights will be preserved. 
The Republican leader asked where was Rockefeller? I am pleased to respond that I have been busy protecting the rights of disabled American veterans. That is where I have been. 
Further, Mr. President, I rise to urge the Republican leader to bring up H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill, for immediate floor consideration in the Senate. Our failure to have this corrections bill considered immediately will have a devastating impact on veterans' disability rights. 
As I indicated yesterday to my colleagues, when H.R. 3978 is considered, I plan to offer an amendment--and nothing will stop me from offering an amendment if that bill comes up, and I will object to other bills coming up in order to force that bill to come up if I am able to so exercise my due parliamentary rights --I plan to offer an amendment to strike the veterans' disability compensation offset from the underlying conference report on H.R. 2400. I have asked for a very limited time agreement of 30 minutes equally divided--15 minutes for each side does not seem to me unreasonable--and then a vote. 
As the Presiding Officer is very well aware, adoption of my amendment will have the effect of preserving current law; that is, it will preserve existing disability rights for veterans, the status quo. It will simply preserve what already exists--nothing new--what already exists, and will fully preserve each and every highway project that was included in the ISTEA bill. That is such an important point to make. 
Some people think we are talking about removing billions of dollars from highways. We are not. Not one dime will be lost to highways. All of that money is going to have to be appropriated by the Appropriations Committee in any event. Let me repeat that: Every highway project in ISTEA, now TEA 21, will remain fully authorized after my amendment is adopted, if adopted. They will be in law, so to speak. 
The highways will be in law. If the leadership permits the TEA bill to stand as is by failing to raise the corrections bill, veterans' disability rights will be eliminated and the current law will be changed. Smoking will be considered an act of `willful misconduct' in the military, and we will be cutting smoking-related disability benefits for veterans who became ill on active duty and those who became ill due to exposure to Agent Orange and those who became ill due to exposure to ionizing radiation. This goes far beyond the intended scope of even the conferees, I have confidence in that. 
Mr. President, roads and bridges are, obviously, very important to the State of West Virginia, which is only 4 percent flat. I support highways. I support highway funding. Not a single project in West Virginia or in any other State--I repeat and repeat again--will be affected in any way by the amendment which I will put forward if given a chance. 
This amendment is a proveteran amendment. It is simply whether we are going to deny disabled American veterans the rights they now have under the law. There has been a great injustice done to America's veterans, and this corrections bill is an opportunity to remedy that injustice. 
Existing law requires the payment of disability compensation to veterans who can prove in a very complicated process that they became addicted to tobacco while in military service, if that addiction continued without interruption and resulted in an illness and in a disability. Addiction is the illness; addiction is the issue. The conference report on the highway bill rescinded--that is, cut--this compensation to disabled veterans for tobacco-related illnesses resulting from nicotine addiction that began in service. 
This cut in veterans' disability compensation generated $17 billion in what only can be called the most extraordinary paper savings that I have come across in my 13 years in the Senate, and these paper savings were literally stolen from veterans and used to partially fund an unprecedented increase in the ISTEA fund. 
Of course, anyone familiar with these claims for compensation for tobacco-related illnesses, and there will be few who are, knows that OMB's cost estimate is just a guess. They just guessed, and they sort of guessed in a way that they could pay for a lot of the other President's program ideas. I didn't appreciate that, but that is the game they decided they were going to play, and so that is what they did. They tried to talk me out of my objections to it, and they could not. That is my administration, not the Presiding Officer's. The so-called savings we are spending on highways are just that, they are paper savings. 
Since 1993, the Veterans' Administration has only received less than 8,000 claims--the Presiding Officer will be interested in this; since 1993, there have been only 8,000 claims for these tobacco-related disability illnesses-- 
and has granted only 200 to 300--200 to 300. So 27 million veterans and only 200 to 300 disability claims for smoking-related illnesses granted by the Veterans' Administration. 
In arriving at its $17 billion estimate, the administration, for some unexplained reason, estimated that 500,000 veterans would apply for tobacco-related claims every year, Mr. President. It is absurd; it is ridiculous. It is a shell game. It was intended to pay for some of their other programs. And in the process, they wanted to cut off disability claims for veterans who are owed them. It is make-believe. 
The amendment that I offer would maintain current law as is by reversing the highway bill's raid on veterans. 
My amendment strikes no highway project. My amendment merely preserves VA's disability compensation for tobacco-related conditions as is. 
I am sure we will hear a good deal of doomsday projections about the effect of this amendment. Again, here are the facts. The amendment does not otherwise affect the highway bill or the projects that it authorized. They remain the same. They are unaffected. My amendment will not bring down the highway bill, will not create a sequester. I can read you law on that. But I will spare the Presiding Officer that. But those who say that, `Oh, this will cause a sequester and a cut in Medicare, Social Security,' the Presiding Officer and others will hear that argument--that argument is wrong. That argument is wrong. Those are the contentions of those who would deny disability benefits to veterans. 
When we argued this issue 2 months ago, when my amendment to the budget resolution was debated, I warned my colleagues that veterans would be justifiably outraged by this raid on their disability compensation program, and they are. 
America's veterans perceive that Congress has turned its back on the Government's responsibility and promise to care for its veterans and on the role it played in fostering their addiction to tobacco--that is well known to the Presiding Officer and all other Members--distribution of free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations; reduced prices; and they delayed the warning that appeared on tobacco in the military cigarettes until 5 years after it had been done at the civilian level. 
Mr. President, we have spent weeks talking about addiction to tobacco and how powerful that addiction is and how that addiction has been fostered. Why is it when it comes to the issue of veterans and tobacco, it is viewed solely as a matter of personal choice? Why is it that this administration and this Congress believe that veterans should have had greater knowledge about tobacco's addictive properties when they began smoking than the general public did? 
Veterans believe in doing their share and carrying their weight. They always have; they always will. But the Congress is not asking for cuts in all accounts this year, oh, no. In fact, we are not even demanding that others, such as Social Security disability recipients, lose smoking-related compensation. Again, only veterans are singled out for this treatment. 
There has been a lot of talk about veterans and smoking in the last few months. So I want to make sure that my colleagues are not confused. The amendment that was adopted on Tuesday to direct a portion of the proceeds from the tobacco bill to VA health care in the tobacco bill, by voice vote, is only for health care. The tobacco-related amendment does not deal with disability benefits, compensation; only with health care, not compensation, benefits for tobacco-related illnesses. That is a major point. 
Those of my colleagues who will seek refuge in the tobacco legislation need to reconsider. And, in fact, in some sadness I am not even sure there will be tobacco legislation. I hope otherwise. But one cannot be confident at this point. 
In any event, some will say--and I close on this point--that the corrections bill puts in $1.6 billion for other veterans programs. And indeed it does. But our friends in the veterans community speak with one voice on this issue. And I agree. They cannot support the increase in benefits to one set of veterans to be paid by the cutting of important benefits to another set of veterans. 
Veterans across this Nation reject this attempt to buy them off. That is why I urge support of my amendment. It is a simple choice. Again, the choice is not highways versus veterans. Highways are fully protected. Veterans are not. Please choose veterans. 
I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I, along with Senators Specter, Lott, and Daschle submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution that will allow the Disabled American Veterans to sponsor an event on the U.S. Capitol grounds on June 16 and 17, 1998, during which they will donate 147 transportation vans to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Senator Specter, Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I were asked to help coordinate this unique event, and we are grateful for the support of the Leadership on both sides of the aisle. As my colleagues are aware, Senator Specter is unable to be here today due to recent surgery. 
Mr. President, the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) was chartered by the Congress of the United States in 1932 and serves as an incredibly strong advocate for our Nation's disabled veterans. In 1987, as part of their mission, DAV organized a nationwide transportation program to help sick and disabled veterans receive the essential medical care they so desperately need. From the time of its inception to the present, DAV will have donated 750 vans in support of this program. 
In my state of West Virginia, thousands of veterans live in rural areas, miles from the nearest VA medical center, and often in areas with no public transportation. So I am acutely aware of how veterans not only in West Virginia, but from coast to coast, rely on the DAV transportation program to receive essential medical care. I am proud to have worked with DAV to help foster this program. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join us in supporting legislation to authorize use of the Capitol Grounds for this remarkable event. And I, along with Senators Specter, Lott, and Daschle, commend DAV for their donation and work on behalf of our Nation's veterans.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues have agreed to secure a small piece of the tobacco revenue to improve veterans' access to health care. The amendment offered by my colleague, Senator McCain, is similar to an amendment I had planned to offer which would have set aside $2.7 billion for veterans health care; and I am delighted that he shares my views on this matter. In my view, given the significant increased costs of providing VA health care due to smoking-related illnesses, it only seems fair to do something to fortify the veterans' health care system. 
Specifically, this amendment, Amendment No. 2446 to S. 1415, would dedicate $600 million per year of the spending included in the tobacco bill to help reimburse VA for their smoking-related expenses and expand access for direct smoking-related services to other veterans. 
I want to talk about the amount of funding for the moment. I arrived at this formula because the VA's increased costs due to smoking are about 7 percent of the estimated total federal health care costs due to tobacco-related illnesses. 
This amendment is really a modest one. I ask my colleagues to look at the estimates for VA's cost of providing smoking-related health care. In 1997, VA spent $3.6 billion, and over the next five years, will spend $20 billion. 
I believe many of my colleagues would be surprised to learn that VA spends so much. But it is true. Veterans have a very high prevalence of smoking-related diseases and illnesses, because as young servicemembers, they were encouraged to smoke by the military and became addicted. Let me remind my colleagues that the military distributed free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations and sold tobacco products at vastly reduced prices to service members, a practice that continued until very recently. 
And in the aggregate, veterans are older, and, therefore, the long-term effects of smoking are likelier to have taken a toll on their health status. 
To put it all in perspective, we are not asking our colleagues to approve an amendment to completely reimburse VA for their full health care costs--though many believe this would be justified. No, this amendment would be limited to just a fraction of VA's true costs--approximately 15% of what they are actually spending taking care of veterans afflicted by diseases and illnesses caused by smoking. 
Quite obviously, providing tobacco-related health care places a tremendous financial burden on the VA health care system. I want to make one thing perfectly clear: because of limited resources, the VA health care system is not and has never been accessible to any veteran who walks in the door. There is no entitlement to health care for all veterans. 
Because all of the health care provided at VA hospitals and clinics is subject to the availability of funding, VA enrolls veterans according to certain priorities. Those veterans with service-connected disabilities, or low incomes, or those who are members of certain groups, like former prisoners of war, are enrolled first, and second, and third, and so on. 
With an essentially frozen budget, when VA covers the health care costs for smoking-related care, it means that other veterans are denied care. 
Though modest, the amendment would do wonders to VA's ability to provide more health care to veterans. Some 240,000 veterans who would not gain access to VA's health care system would now be able to see VA doctors and nurses. Veterans dying of smoking-related illnesses could spend their final days in VA hospices. 
Finally, Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that this amendment comes on the heels of the elimination of a $16 billion existing veterans' benefits to offset funding in the highway bill. That particular battle has been lost, and nothing can make amends for cutting an existing veterans benefit to pay for highways. Though the damage is done, I am pleased that my colleagues have chosen with this amendment to provide a measure of security for veterans and the health care system dedicated to serve their needs.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to draw attention to legislation I have cosponsored that will create the Medical Innovation Tax Credit. This bill will facilitate the development of lifesaving medical treatments at medical schools and teaching hospitals. I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators D'Amato, Feinstein, Boxer, and Hutchison, in this initiative. 
In my own State of West Virginia, and throughout this country, academic medical centers are feeling the changes in the health care marketplace. With limited reimbursement under managed care and cuts in Medicare payments, these medical institutions are under increasing financial pressures. 
To compound these stressors, academic medical centers also support certain services, such as burn units or trauma centers, which are vital to the community but financially draining to a hospital's budget. West Virginia University's Ruby Memorial Hospital, for example, operates a trauma unit which serves as a lifeline to victims of serious injuries. Our legislation would help these academic medical centers to avoid choosing between research and the day-to-day activities associated with the running of a hospital. 
Under the Medical Innovation Tax Credit, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies would receive a tax credit equal to 20 percent of the funds spent for medical research expenses conducted at eligible sites. This incentive will make them a more attractive site for clinical trials. Given the important role played by academic medical centers, I believe this support is warranted. 
Mr. President, our bill will add a freestanding section to the Internal Revenue Code to create this research incentive. It is intended to complement the existing research-targeted tax credits--the Research and Experimental Tax Credit and the Orphan Drug Tax Credit, both of which have been credited with stimulating billions of dollars in research. Initial clinical studies are just the beginning, however. Additional studies are frequently needed to determine combinations for administering drugs and for providing the most appropriate therapies to patients. The Medical Innovation Tax Credit is geared toward promoting this type of research. 
Aside from medical schools and teaching hospitals, National Cancer Institute-designated centers will also be eligible sites. Peer-reviewed clinical trials are credited with providing cancer patients the best available care. Our legislation will indirectly promote these opportunities for care. 
Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals affiliated with teaching hospitals will also be eligible under the legislation. VA research is not only supported by an appropriation, but by private donations largely from pharmaceutical companies in support of clinical drugs trials. Clinical research conducted in VA medical centers has a significant and lasting impact on the care provided to veterans. 
Mr. President, if America is to continue leading in the field of biomedical research, we must do all we can to assure that valuable research programs at medical schools and teaching hospitals do not suffer because of financial pressures and changing market conditions. Research is just too important. 
I look forward to discussing this issue and pursuing the goal of this legislation in the coming months with my colleagues on the Finance Committee as we look at a variety of ways to improve and strengthen our valuable research program.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the following legislation, `The Department of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Providers Incentive Act of 1998.' This legislation is intended to revitalize the VA's Health Professionals Education Assistance Program, thereby reducing waste, targeting primary care professions and under-served areas, and making the VA more competitive with private employers for skilled personnel. I am pleased to be joined by my respected colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in this effort. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation. 
The VA health care system is in the midst of a major reorganization that is simultaneously reducing the current workforce and creating the need for more primary care health professionals. This reorganization has dramatically changed the way the VA delivers health care, by shifting the emphasis to outpatient rather than inpatient care. As part of this process, the Department of Veterans Affairs has set a goal of doubling the number of primary care providers in the VA health care system, and we want to assist them. There are two good ways to hire and keep highly skilled professionals--offer incentives to current employees to get training in new areas of need by providing scholarships, and recruit new primary care providers by offering assistance in paying off student loans. This legislation, which includes both a scholarship program and an education debt reduction program, can help. 
The VA needs educational assistance programs such as these to effectively recruit and retain trained primary care health professionals. In the VA hospitals and clinics, some of the most difficult positions to fill are those of nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. In my home state of West Virginia, for example, at one of the VA hospitals there has been a vacancy for an occupational therapist for over twelve years! Two of the VA hospitals have no physical therapists at all. This is simply unacceptable. 
The plain fact is that the VA cannot offer the same starting salaries as those available in private practice. The Education Debt Reduction Program included within the Primary Care Providers Incentive Act gives the VA a financial recruitment tool that will be an enormous help in making the VAMCs more competitive for these much-needed and highly skilled individuals. This program was first designed by Senator Mikulski in 1993 in recognition of this very problem. It was needed then, and it is still needed now. 
Recruitment is only half the problem in building a new workforce that is geared toward providing primary care. Retention of trained people, especially in the face of low morale due to budget cuts, is equally important. The scholarship program in this legislation is designed to answer this very need. Eligibility is limited to current VA employees, thus enabling VA to build staff morale. The scholarship program provides a means for vulnerable employees to protect themselves against future RIFs by acquiring training in the new areas of need. And, VA gets the workforce they need, composed of motivated and loyal employees. 
Professional associations representing primary care health workers, VAMC human resources personnel, and past recipients of VA scholarships are strongly in support of this legislation. Although this is a time of budget reductions in health care, these programs are a worthwhile investment, enhancing morale of the VA health care providers in the short term, while building a workforce that matches VA's needs and improves veterans' health care in the long run.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. `A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.' What better way to pay tribute to America's veterans on this Memorial Day than to quote our former President, John F. Kennedy. He knew then, in 1963, that it was imperative we honor and remember our veterans, as should know today. We must not forget the sacrifices of the many men and women who gave so much for the sake of this great country, and we must honor them with our gratitude. 
I stand before you today to salute these veterans. In my home state of West Virginia, generations of veterans have served in the Armed Forces, and many have lost their lives. This country would not be the world power that it is today had it not been for these men and women who fought so bravely. Let us not just know that this day is Memorial Day, let us take a moment to put names, faces, on these veterans. Husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, and children. Friends to us all; friends who fought for our freedom. Freedom that we share every single day of our lives. Freedom that makes America as great as it is. 
Stand proud when you see the American flag waving high in the air. Sing along to the Star Spangled Banner. Nod your head in respect when you pass by a veterans' cemetery. Behind these symbols of America are the people who have made them so remarkable, the veterans of this country. They deserve our gratitude on this day and everyday. 
So many veterans gave their lives for this Nation. We cannot forget what they did for us. The lives that were lost and the lives that were changed forever. It does not matter whether they served in combat or peace time. Each left behind familiar surrounds, undertook risks, and faced the unknown. We should honor them all for their courage. They joined the Armed Forces of this country to defend and protect it, to make it safe for their, and our, loved ones. 
We vowed to take care of our veterans when they returned home to us. In many ways, we have, by setting up a benefits program and a health care system, creating two Committees in Congress to oversee these efforts, devoting enormous amounts of resources to their health and well being. But I am forced to say that the recent record of this administration, and of many in Congress, has deteriorated in the area of protecting veterans' benefits. Our commitment to meeting the needs of veterans has been eroded, and we can and must do better. There are still 
many areas that need improvement. It is not a perfect system. We must strive to better it and not let any of our veterans be shortchanged of the benefits and care they so dearly earned and deserve. 
I would like to speak about just a few of the ordeals that our veterans have had to face after their return from service. I do this to acknowledge these problems and to pledge to continue in my fight for solutions. 
Gulf War veterans. Even though the war is over, many are struggling with illness, often undiagnosed, but nevertheless debilitating. Seven years have passed since the end of the Gulf War, and DOD and VA still do not know what is wrong with the veterans who fought in this war. We need to be able to answer the questions of `How many veterans are ill?' and `Are our ill veterans getting sicker over time?' 
We also need to provide a permanent statutory authority to compensate these veterans. That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 1320, that targets these important issues. It took our government 20 years after the Vietnam War to assess the effects of Agent Orange and 40 years after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed veterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act. We cannot allow our Gulf War veterans to keep waiting for the benefits and care that they earned seven years ago. 
Or take atomic veterans, who were exposed to ionizing radiation during service. I have serious concerns about the way atomic veterans' claims are being handled and the way regulations to administer those claims are being created. These veterans were intentionally placed in harm's way, sworn to secrecy, and abandoned by their government for many years. It is critical that we search for a better way to address their compensation claims. 
I recently cosponsored legislation that would authorize health care for veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation, veterans who have so far been excluded from access to VA services. These veterans, primarily Navy submariner and Army Air corps pilots, received nasopharyngeal radium treatments in the 1940's and 1950's to treat and prevent inner ear problems that developed due to the inadequate pressurization of their respective vessels. Unfortunately, the health effects of the treatments that were given to these veterans are unknown. However, when such high levels of exposure are sustained, we must be concerned about long-term health effects, and thus, we have a responsibility to ensure these veterans' access to health care. Simply put, it is the right thing to do. 
We owe these veterans. They risked everything for us--their health and sometimes even their lives. We should, at least, give them appropriate research, health care, and compensation. At least. 
An important issue concerning veterans at this time is the VA budget for benefits and health care. I would like to share with America where these issues stand. 
First, the benefits side of the budget. The administration this year requested a very modest increase of $565 million in funds for benefits payments, just what is needed to cover cost-of-living allowances. VA has also requested $850 million--$63.5 million above the FY 98 level--for the account that funds the administration of nonmedical benefits. Although these amounts appear to be an increase, VA's benefits delivery staff will lose 45 FTE. In a time when it takes VA 157 days to decide a new compensation claim, and years longer in appeals cases, it concerns me greatly that VA is seeking funds that will not allow it even to maintain, at the very least, its current level of staffing. 
I am particularly troubled by the proposal by the administration, adopted this very day by the Congress, which cut $10.5 billion from the veterans' benefit account over the next five years. This was done by removing VA's existing authority to pay compensation to veterans who suffer from tobacco-related illnesses, based on the nicotine dependence they developed while in the service. The money saved from cutting this benefit will be put into more highway spending. 
Although I support a strong highway bill, I firmly believe that it should not be funded by cuts in veterans benefits, particularly a program cut that totally bypassed the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. That is why I offered an amendment to the Budget Resolution to protect the funding to the veterans account. Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated by a vote of 52-46. 
On the health care side, the VA budget request for medical care is $30 million less than last year. The base appropriated funding level of $17.03 billion would be supplemented by approximately $560 million from veterans' copays and collections from insurance companies. When the base funding level is combined with these collections, the VA health care system would have $17.6 billion to spend next year--approximately what it is spending this year. Unfortunately, this flatlined budget makes no allowance for cost-of-living increases for VA employees and other rising costs due to inflation. 
The VA health care system is a system in transition. Recent changes in lines of authority, resource allocations, and methods of health care delivery, as well as downsizings and facility integrations, have buffeted the system. While all this reorganization is underway, I am concerned that VA have good systems in place to ensure that high quality health care is the standard practiced at all VA facilities, regardless of where they are located around the country. I will continue my efforts to make sure that VA, as the nation's largest health care provider, upholds the highest standards of quality of care. 
What is clear is that we still have a lot of work to do for our veterans. We have come a long way, but there are still many miles to cover. 
They promised us they would risk their lives. We promised them we would take care of them. Caring for our veterans is the least we can do. 
On this day, ladies and gentlemen, be proud of the men and women--veterans and service members from every branch and action--who have served our nation with courage. And, my colleagues, match your pride with a pledge to maintain the nation's commitment to them. 
Veterans have earned our respect and admiration. I am committed to upholding their honor the offering them the thanks they so richly deserve. I ask you, America, to do no less.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am grateful to my friend from the State of Michigan. 
I start out by disputing any thought by the senior Senator from Arkansas that the words `patriotism' and `Bumpers' don't go side by side--I know the Senator himself knows that to be true--in his service in the Marine Corps, his service in this body, the things he has been through over the years. He is a patriot. He is a marvelous man. 
He happens, however, to be marvelously wrong on the amendment that he puts forward, which in spite of the larger framework of the immigration bill, is a very specific and very targeted amendment which would do enormous damage to what we are trying to do in areas of my State that need this program desperately, and which do enormous damage to some of the things that I and others I work with--Governor Underwood and others--are trying to do in the State of West Virginia. I refer to the attempt to eliminate the EB5, the immigrant Investor Program. I didn't say that with an abundance of fluency, and there is a reason for that. It is not one of the things that trips off your lips. I confess that it was not until relatively recently, in the last several years, that I, indeed, learned what it was at all because we had not had experience. 
Let me give a little context. I was Governor of the State of West Virginia for 8 years and I was always very frustrated, and I say to my fellow Governor from the State of Arkansas, of all of the money that was discretionary to the Governor during the 8 years that this Senator was Governor, I spent 75 percent of it on water and sewer, which of course is invisible and never seen. And I put more per capita in one of our poorest counties in southern West Virginia called McDowell County, which used to be referred to as the $1 billion coal field, and now is mostly worked out and people have left. Even when I came to West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer in 1964, I say to the Senator, there were tens of thousands of people in McDowell County, the Senator would remember. Now there are about a handful. 
I felt that I had not come through properly in spite of efforts for McDowell County, for Wyoming County, for Mercer County, for southern West Virginia, for people who had broken their backs and given their lives, many of them, and who walk around, some of them carrying oxygen tanks. For some it is a 10-minute walk from one side of a room to another side to adjust the television and back because of something called black lung or because of diseases they have accumulated by virtue of being coal miners. 
These are the areas I am talking about. There are other areas in West Virginia and the State of Arkansas and in the State of Massachusetts and in the State of Michigan and in the State of Maine, all of our States, where people just don't have the 
opportunity to have jobs because they live in rural areas. It might be a worked-out coal mining area which is called rural, or it might be an area which is mostly trees which would be called rural, but it is rural and jobs don't tend to go there. People don't tend to build the interstates over there. 
I am old fashioned about it, but the reason that I stayed in West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer, more than anything I wanted to see people go to work. I think my friend from Arkansas understands that. I think he understands it very well. What I found was there were just certain blocks, certain ways, certain impediments that nature put up which just didn't allow some of our good people to be able to go to work by accident of their birth or by the fact they were so close to their families that they didn't leave and go to other places like so many others had done from Appalachia. So they stayed and they can't work and they want to work, and they want so badly to work but there is no work. So that is how I came to know what the EB5 Immigrant Investor Program is. 
`Give us your poor,' the Senator from Arkansas said. Well, our income and our population is increasing, I am happy to say, in West Virginia at a very healthy rate. Things are being done right there. People have caught the flavor of it and there is a sense of optimism which I haven't seen there in 20 or 30 years. 
But I learned about this program that the Senator wants to eliminate in this amendment. It is just a little thing down here. It says, `Repeal. . . Section 203(b)(5),' et cetera--one sentence which nobody can understand, but I know exactly what it does. It would eliminate everything that I am talking about, just eliminate it. It would be gone. 
I learned about this program because of a company called InterBank. It is a merchant banking company. They run a program which is called Invest in America. Nothing wrong that I can see in that, especially because in this program InterBank has pooled millions of dollars in foreign investments, millions of dollars to establish new operations in teleservicing--telemarketing some call it; I call it teleservices--in exactly the kind of areas in West Virginia I was talking about. 
I was in Welch, WV, in McDowell County on a freezing-cold day when they announced they were going to create 400 new jobs. The next day they had 1,500 applicants from that county; the word traveled so fast. This was considered the best news that had ever happened to that county. And now they are looking at others. They are looking, in fact, at putting, 10, 12, 15,000 jobs across the State of West Virginia in precisely the kinds of places where nobody else will go to invest, and they want to do it in telemarketing, or teleservicing as I prefer to call it. West Virginia is important in that we are wired very well in terms of fiber optics, so it is a superb place for them to do that. 
It is like with the telephone system. If you are in Washington, DC, and you call information, you are talking to somebody in West Virginia. Where you live, where you reside doesn't make that much difference anymore. But it makes a tremendous difference in southern West Virginia and in other parts of West Virginia where people do not have work, where people remember having had work because of coal mining or remember when they had an opportunity for work, but they were rejected for work. Now they realize that they could get into these programs and get trained because InterBank is going to put a lot of money into training people, West Virginia people, and I assume people in other parts of the country, other industries like them in other parts of the country. 
We are talking about $7 or $8 an hour. I don't ridicule that. And I don't ridicule it because it is a company that has benefits particularly when it is a company that provides health benefits, which is something I care about as much as anybody on this planet, and they are included. My people will get them or my people will not get them, depending, and it is true for all the rest of the people in this country who interact with this program as to whether this amendment passes or fails, which is why I hope so much that it fails. 
Yes, it is true there has been some abuse, and the Senator, I believe, quoted the New York Times. I don't necessarily think because something is in the New York Times and it is printed, it defines what national policy is to be, but I read it every day and I respect it very much, and there was an article saying there had been some abuse. There have been 30 or 40 articles talking about the abuse in Medicare and I don't hear anybody talking of getting rid of Medicare, because HCFA is trying to crack down. There is, I am sure, abuse in the farmers assistance programs which help the Senator and the people he represents from Arkansas, which don't do our people any good at all in West Virginia. 
All I am saying is that there is always abuse in Federal programs, but it is usually a little bit. In the case of the INS, I have talked with Doris Meissner about the problem of abuse and about these programs. She has put our InterBank program on hold, in fact, even though they have done nothing wrong, because they have the FBI and the INS who looks into this, and the State Department looks into it. They have a total of five separate reviews that are involved in this. The INS is not only taking steps to correct whatever abuse that may exist, but they are so adamant about it that they are taking those programs where there are no problems and making them wait until they have a chance to look at the entire thing. I pleaded with Doris Meissner to approve this program, which had no deficiencies, and she said, `I can't do it. We have to put it near the end of the line so we can review all of these programs to make sure there is no fraud and abuse, and where there is, we can get rid of it.' 
Now, is the idea that somebody would be able to bring some money into the United States to put a West Virginian, or a Washingtonian, or Oregonian, or somebody from Maine, Vermont, or Wisconsin, to work, that they would bring in some money and they would be given a period of a couple of years for review and, after the review, which is a three-agency review, they be allowed to stay because they have brought money, which is then pooled, which puts people to work in areas where nobody else will put them to work, is there something wrong with that? I certainly don't see it. 
If it is helping my people in southern West Virginia, or from the State of Maine, where there is so much of the population located in one section--and I am sure some industry will not go into the interior section because the infrastructure isn't there, but they might with innovative thinking such as InterBank has put forward. 
So I think eliminating a program, just wiping it out for the idea of somehow being able to say I am against waste, fraud, and abuse and I am going to have none of it, when one knows there may be, as in Medicare--I repeat, there is waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, and the Health Care Financing Administration which is going crazy trying to cure that abuse, most of which comes from the private sector. Here, INS is doing the same thing. They admit it is a good program, but they admit they cannot have a program that has any abuse at all in it. So they are stopping everything until they have a chance to review it. 
Yes, we need to take steps to prevent abuses in this or any other program--INS, Medicare, crop subsidies, or any other thing that involves the U.S. taxpayers' money--but to eliminate a program that holds out more for the people of my State in terms of areas where people have had a hard time getting jobs, all of a sudden having a $7- or $8-per-hour job with health benefits, I can't imagine doing such a thing. 
I passionately urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the Senator, my friend from Arkansas. 
I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I may answer, as the Senator well knows, the amendment he referred to was in 1989, as my encyclopedic memory comes flashing before me like a billboard here in the Senate. As I told the Senator, on that particular bill, I felt I voted wrong and I have told him since then that I should have voted against 
him. In reflection, I think my vote at that time was based on too much of a knee-jerk theory on the idea that somehow it was wrong, when, in fact, it was exactly, I think, the right thing to do. The case didn't seem to be as strongly made at that point. If the Senator would put that forward again, I would vote against it in a flash.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Arkansas, what strikes me as utterly crass is the thought that for the words the Senator used, that I would then take away or deny the opportunity for the people that I love so much in my State, that you love so much in your State in the delta area, or wherever it may be, from having jobs when they have never been able to have jobs before. 
Let me tell you something very plain and clear. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia have statistically bound themselves together on the bottom of the charts for a long time. I am absolutely, flat-out sick of it. There are not many principles that will get me over the fact that I am sick of seeing my people not being able to work when my people--if you are a West Virginian and you go down to North Carolina and apply for a job, and they ask--and this is true--`Where do you come from?' and you say, `West Virginia,' you are hired because of the work ethic, because these people have known jobs. There has been a tradition in parts of our State where people have known jobs. When they have had a chance to get those jobs, there is a 1-percent turnover, or less, and absenteeism is 1 percent or less per year. They work. 
We had AT&T close down a plant employing 450 people in Charleston, WV, the capital of our State. After the workers got their pink slips, I say to the Senator from Arkansas, saying they were fired, and it had been announced in the press, just against hope, I guess, they worked harder, their productivity went up after they got their pink slips. 
And they kept the plant open. 
I don't mean to filibuster the Senator's question because it was an honorable question.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This is not a matter of selling citizenship, I repeat. I want to be able to explain that. It is not a matter of selling citizenship. 
You come in, and then for $500,000, if you can produce 10 jobs for West Virginia, for Americans, if you can do that, then after a period of 2 years of that activity, then by three different agencies with an analysis from those agencies, which is extremely tough, if you then pass muster, then you can become a citizen, but not before. 
If you would ask if I would turn down somebody from England, or if I would turn down somebody from somewhere else, and I worked for 10 years to get the Toyota Motor Company to come to West Virginia--10 years, and they came, do I feel that somehow--I am just making a point--that because the person comes from Japan, or because they come from Taiwan, or because they come from some other place and they have some money and they want to come to this country, which is what the Statue of Liberty is all about, and they are willing to put 10 Americans to work and those 10 Americans turn out to be 10 West Virginians in the case of InterBank, and other companies that are interested in West Virginia in a like manner, I would say bring them on.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me answer the Senator specifically, returning to what he has read. The reference to InterBank was not accurate. 
Yes; a desist and refrain order was issued against the bank because it was thought that InterBank was selling securities to Americans in California. 
I hope my colleagues are listening, because this is important, because the Senator is attempting to put me on the defensive, and therefore his amendment, which I strongly oppose, seems to have more weight. But the Senator is wrong in his criticism, because he has read the New York Times with too much faith. 
The issue began from an ad in fact that InterBank ran in a Japanese language magazine. This magazine was translated into English and had some circulation in California 
which is understandable. 
Although the InterBank program is only available to foreign nationals California's Commissioner of Corporations was unaware of the program and assumed that the ad was an offer for the sale of securities in California to Americans. Since that time the matter has been completely settled, and InterBank is seeking to have the order lifted.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No; the only difference we have is maybe broader than that, because I take it philosophically. I grew up in a very lucky fashion, unlike the Senator from Arkansas. Sometimes in private we joke about that, and we have a good laugh about it. 
But my great-great-grandfather came from somewhere in Germany. Nobody really knows what he was doing. And he came to this country because he wanted to be able to do something better, to have a better life. I find nothing wrong with that. I thought that, again, was what the Statue of Liberty was all about. My family has done well. Other families have done well. People not only do well in this country, they do well in other countries. Often people who do well in other countries want to come to the United States either for their own professional purposes or because they feel they can use the money which they have earned in other countries to better affect this country. That is one reason why people are investing. Is it wrong for foreigners to buy in the stock market? No. They are. It is one of the reasons they are doing so well; we are a good deal. 
What I am saying is, positively the Senator was wrong in his previous question about California, that the commissioner of corporations was totally unaware of this program. What I am saying is that allowing people to pool money to put West Virginians, or Kansans, or others to work is a principle which is no less evil than allowing 17 people from Boston or 13 people from Magnolia, AR, to pool funds and put people to work in those two States. 
Citizens of the world want to come to this country. That is why we are so much populated by people who came from other countries, including my own family, and including the Senator's, at some point. That is what is great about this country. If in that process we create jobs for people who in the 34 years that I have been in West Virginia have never held a job before and it brings with it health benefits, then don't expect me to stand in its way.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to my friend from Massachusetts that I certainly do agree with the variety of the application he describes. And I would also say to my friend from Massachusetts the final words of the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, before sitting down were oh, no, these are all people who are living in Hong Kong, which is an odd statement to make. But I want my colleagues to pay very, very close attention when I say that the majority of the people involved in this program are coming to this country, are bringing their families to this country, want to settle in this country, want to educate their children in this country. They are not doing this from long distance like it is totally legal for them to do, for example, to invest in our stock market from long distance. 
As the Senator from Massachusetts has said, these are people who for the most part plan to come into this country, bring their families, are in this country. That is one of the ways that you can come to this country. You want your children to go to good schools. You want them to have a better life than they do from where they might come--just the wide open spaces, the wide open opportunities of America. So this is one of the vehicles. 
On the way, by the way, it helps create potentially tens of thousands of jobs in this country, and then 5,000 or 6,000 jobs in my State of West Virginia from people who are for the most part deciding to come to live in this country and to make their money available to put my people to work. I would not argue against that.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for accepting this amendment which I was rushing to the floor to eloquently and brilliantly explain, and it has been accepted. That is really what one prays for in this institution. I hope it survives the conference. I am sure that it will. 
Basically, the theory of it was--and I think that the chairman understood it as well as the Senator from North Dakota--that we should be honest with consumers. A lot of people don't know what a lot of the prices are on the telephone long-distance bill. Charges have gone down from an average of 34 cents per minute since deregulation of AT&T to about 16 cents per minute now. We should tell them when we bill them, if the prices go up on certain items, they also go down on others. 
As an example, recently there was a $1.5 billion access charge reduction, so actually the cost to the consumer on their residential rate bill was going to go down, but the companies only wanted to show the part that had a $675 million increase--$675 million increase, $1.5 billion decrease; obviously, the net of the decrease wins big time, but they are not going to be told that. 
I think this is a very useful amendment that the chairman of the Commerce Committee has accepted. It isn't about reregulation, it is about treating consumers fairly. It is also, frankly, about something which is very complicated that 
consumers don't understand, nor should they be expected to understand, nor do many of us understand as we should--things like prescribed interchange carrier charge, called PICC. That is a very big thing in all of this. 
Even where universal service protects high-cost areas, the whole concept of universal service is not understood by most voters or many in the Congress itself. 
We have to be fair. We have to level with them. We have to be straight and honest. That is what this amendment attempts to do. That is one of the reasons I am so glad this amendment has been accepted. 
I thank, once again, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, and also my friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it probably would not have been within the nature of the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Jennings Randolph, to object to something that was about to be said about one of his departed colleagues. He was not like that. But I need to report to you, as of course our colleagues know, that Senator Randolph has died. My colleague, Senator Byrd, spoke to the subject, and did so very eloquently. 
I think the sad news, of course, is that he is no longer with us. The good news is, in talking with one of his two sons Jay and Frank--and the Senator from West Virginia talked with Jay--he said he died very peacefully on Friday. He was a great defender of all 13 States in the Appalachian Regional Commission, including the State of Mississippi. 
It was a very interesting decision, in fact, when Senator Randolph decided to resign. I now can tell a story which I have never told before because it was one of such exquisite sensitivity on the part of the then-senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Randolph. 
No Governor has ever been elected to the U.S. Senate from the position of Governor of West Virginia. It has never happened in our history. There are reasons for that. In any event, my term was expiring as Governor in 1984, and I wanted very much to run for the Senate, but, on the other hand, Senator Randolph was a very, very formidable Senator, obviously a powerful committee chairman, had been in the Congress longer than anybody. He was the only person to reach back to the original first days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., and he was literally at Franklin Roosevelt's side on a number of occasions when he signed bills. This is an enormous bridge of history and bridge of spirit. I think he wanted to rerun for another term. I don't know that, but it is my feeling that he did, because he was a very young 84. Anyone who knew Jennings Randolph knew him to be hardy, vigorous, strong, and very much in love with his job. 
He, understanding my interests, and my understanding his interests, he being obviously by far in the stronger position, asked me to come have breakfast with him at his hideaway. Being senior, he had a very nice hideaway. I had never been to a hideaway before, and rarely have been to one since. He had a nice breakfast served there. There was pleasant conversation. He was very relaxed. Then he simply turned to me and he said, `Jay, would you like to be the next Senator from West Virginia?' 
I said `Senator, yes, I would, but not if you, Senator Randolph, want to run for reelection.' And I meant that. 
Without really pausing anymore than I had, he said, `Well, I think you should be the Senator.' 
If one thinks back as a Senator of what one has known over the years, it is very rarely that a Senator who has spent virtually all of his life in public service willingly, generously, and warmly gives up his seat, which probably could have been his again, in order to step aside for somebody somewhat younger. 
That is not a story I have ever heard told before because I am not sure it has happened before, but it is a story that I am very proud to say today because I told Senator Randolph's son, Jay, that I wanted to tell it today. Jay knew about it because his father had told him about it. It is something that, better than anything I could say, characterizes the nature of the generosity of this man, which was counteracted on the other side by a ferocity of intensity about his work. 
It is very hard to make any other case, but this man was a giant in legislative history, and one could say for no other reason than he served for as long as he did, simply to say, `I served with Franklin Delano Roosevelt.' How many times did I hear him talk about Franklin Delano Roosevelt? 
He was by nature a man who believed in government--and he was very much a Democrat that way, although he was a 
conservative Democrat on many social issues--in terms of what is it the people need, what is it the people shall have, what is it that I think I can help them get. In fact, when he made that decision not to run, our unemployment rate in West Virginia was somewhere around 17 or 18 percent. Government was very important to Senator Randolph, and he led his life and his legislative life very much with that in mind. 
He and Senator Byrd were elected at the same time in 1958 because there was a special vacancy because of a special circumstance. 
Positive, civil, courteous, and kind he was. I asked, before I arose to make these remarks, where he sat, and I was informed that he sat in five different desks. One of them, I think, is the desk from which Senator Levin from Michigan just spoke. 
Over his time here, he insisted on courtesy in the Senate, something which has been paralleled by his colleague, Senator Byrd, for so many years. I am told by my father-in-law, Senator Percy, who was also his very close friend, that he would often get up and insist on order in the Senate. He was very much a stickler for protocol and order and also for voting from his or her desk, which is something that Senator Byrd also feels very strongly about. 
I remember a Senator of kindness, of good humor who was always in an ebullient mood, who actually bounced sometimes when he talked he was so enthusiastic about what he was doing. But he demanded dignity in the treatment of others. He demanded respect in the treatment of others. He was very old-fashioned in his ways and, thus, I think we miss him even more these days. 
He did many things. He was always open to new ideas. He actually, more than 50 years ago, flew an airplane for some distance that was powered entirely by methanol. One, he knew how to fly an airplane, which was unusual; two, he flew an airplane which was powered by methanol, which was almost unprecedented. He involved himself at a very early age, and he did so with extraordinary effectiveness. 
I could talk for an hour, which I will not, about what he accomplished. Everybody knows that he really was the founder of the Appalachian Regional Commission, which has done so much to help not only the State he loved, West Virginia, but 12 other States in addition to that. He was a principal architect of the Interstate Highway System which helps to place him in time, because that was done during, as we know, the middle and late fifties. 
I think the proudest of all of his achievements, or the one that caused him to talk the most and to be the most enthusiastic about, was the 26th amendment. He was the author and the driver of the 26th amendment which gave 18-year-olds the right to vote in this country. 
He protected the environment with ferocity. He was tremendously interested in coal, as well as the environment, in worker safety and, as I have indicated, in aviation issues, and in just simply countless other areas. 
He was prodigious in his volume of output. Of course, that was, in part, because he was chairman of a very powerful committee, and he was chairman of that committee for a very long time. That was in the days when the Senate tended to be more in control by one party than the other for a very long time. He worked with the Scoop Jacksons and the Lyndon Johnsons and all of the others. They were able to accomplish an enormous amount. He did that and he loved it--he simply loved doing that. He simply loved laying pavement out across the wide horizons of our country. 
There was an interesting aspect to Senator Randolph. He was intense about all of his work, but he was very much of a U.S. Senator from the State of West Virginia. He accepted full responsibility for the title `U.S. Senator' and acted on all matters that related to that with incisiveness and careful thought. But he liked to say--and often said, and said with great pride--quoting him--`I essentially am a West Virginia Senator. I'm not what you'd call a national Senator or international Senator.' I think if he were here today, I am not sure the words would be that different. 
And to understand that one has to understand his roots. He was born in this tiny community of Salem, WV, which is now the home of probably as many Japanese students in a Salem-Tokyo University setting as reside anywhere else in this country. His father was the mayor of Salem. He was born with very little money, and he worked his way in farm jobs. He knew agriculture very well. He worked for anybody who would give him a job to put a few dollars in his pocket so he could further his education and improve his possibilities. I liked that about him, because he was utterly a rural Senator, but with an urban reach when it came to the national part of his responsibilities. 
He started in journalism and was always a prolific writer. He married Katherine Babb and won election to the House of Representatives in 1932 at the age of 30. One can do that these days, although one cannot go much younger than that legally. But then it was extraordinary, it was extraordinary to be able to do that. And I indicated he has two sons, Jay and Frank. 
So more than 50 years later, I think the occupant of the Presiding Officer's chair will understand that it is quite a feeling for me to have succeeded him, to have been allowed to succeed him by his own gesture of generosity and, frankly, just to be able to succeed him. 
He is long remembered in this body, as well as in the House, for the very exceptional nature that he had: High optimism, great confidence, enormous belief in country, and his absolute love for his State. He also--and I will say this in closing--he had a great love for his profession. And in that I think many of us join him. He was not one of those who felt being in public service was some kind of a second choice; I think he felt it was the best choice of all. 
He was somebody who honored his craft, who brought great distinction to his craft, who never compromised on his principles. And when he faced a West Virginia audience or a Senate Chamber, he could stand tall and strong and broad shouldered, as he was, and do his work, because he knew he was doing work which was enormously important for helping the people that he so loved from the State of West Virginia. 
So this is a day and a time that we have reason to reflect on Jennings Randolph and what made him an exceptional person. It is sad, I think, this tradition in the Senate when we do this about Senators when they die. It would be almost impossible to create a tradition where we did that while they were still living. But it would be nice if they could hear what it was that we say about them. And I suspect that Senator Jennings Randolph is able to hear and to know on this day, and days to succeed, what his colleagues think about him. 
I personally am grateful to him for many reasons, as I think should be very obvious. I am not sure that I would be here if it were not for Jennings Randolph. And I know that my colleagues join me in our prayers and our thoughts for his 
family and in thanking Jennings Randolph for his enormous contribution to a craft which we call public service. And we do that with honor and pride. 
I thank the Presiding Officer.  
Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the Veterans' Equality for Treatment and Services Act of 1998. This bill will authorize a demonstration project to allow VA to bill Medicare for health care services provided to certain dual beneficiaries. The legislation is known as VA subvention, which is a concept that has been discussed over the years by those of us in Congress, by veterans service organizations, and by advisory bodies studying the VA health care system. I join my colleagues Senators Jeffords, Hollings, and Specter in this initiative. 
Due to budget constraints, many VA hospitals and clinics have been forced to turn away middle income, Medicare-eligible veterans who seek VA care. To truly understand the need for VA subvention, I ask my colleagues to couple these difficulties in accessing the system, with VA's frozen FY 99 budget. The frozen medical care budget obviously cannot cover even salary adjustments required by law, let alone allow for any growth and expansion within the VA health care system. 
For veterans, enactment of the Veterans Equality for Treatment and Services Act of 1998 would mean the infusion of new revenue and thus, improved access to care. For the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a VA subvention demonstration project will provide the opportunity to assess the effects of coordination on improving efficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries in a selected number of sites. Finally, Congress would receive the results of this feasibility study, which, once and for all, would give us the necessary data to make rational policy decisions in the future about Medicare and VA's involvement. 
The four VA medical centers in my own State of West Virginia spent $4.2 million caring for nearly a thousand Medicare-eligible veterans with middle incomes in 1995. Though this is telling information, I cannot provide my colleagues with the truly crucial piece of the story, that is, the number of these Medicare-eligible veterans who were turned away from the facilities created to serve them because of lack of resources. This demonstration project would encourage these eligible veterans who have not previously received care from the Huntington, Beckley, Martinsburg, and Clarksburg VAMCs to do so. 
The Veterans Equality for Treatment and Services Act is designed to be budget neutral. To that end, the VA would be required to maintain its current level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans already being served and would be effectively limited to reimbursement for additional care provided to new users. Payments from Medicare would be at a reduced rate and would exclude Disproportionate Share Hospital adjustments, Graduate Medical Education payments, and a large percentage of capital-related costs. In effect, the VA would be providing health care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply discounted rate. HHS and VA would have the ability to adjust payment rates, or to shrink or terminate the program if Medicare's costs increase. In the event that these safeguards included in the proposal fail--an event which the VA has declared unlikely--this proposal caps all Medicare payments to the VA at $50 million.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I'm delighted to join the Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Specter, in bringing before the Senate the nomination of Togo D. West, Jr., to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs and urging his confirmation. 
Mr. President, Togo West has a long history of serving his country and America's service members. He began his career as an Army lawyer from 1969 to 1973, first as part of the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps and later with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. He left the Army in 1973, but never strayed far from public service. In 1975, he served in the Department of Justice as Associate Deputy Attorney General. In 1977, he was appointed to serve as the Department of the Navy's General Counsel. From there, he also served as the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, and in 1980 he was appointed General Counsel of the Department of Defense. 
Most recently, Togo West served our country as Secretary of the Army, a position he held beginning in 1993, until President Clinton appointed him Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs on January 2, 1998. As Secretary of Veterans Affairs, West will be responsible for safeguarding and improving the VA's system of delivering health care and benefits to America's 26 million veterans. VA is the second largest federal agency, employing almost 235,000 people, many of them veterans themselves. 
Togo West will be filling the vacancy left by Jesse Brown, the former Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Jesse Brown has always been a tireless veterans advocate, and his leadership and energy are missed by veterans and others who also fight on behalf of veterans. 
Mr. President, Togo West has a wonderful opportunity to serve the veterans of our Nation in this new capacity. He has demonstrated himself to be a person of the highest integrity with extraordinary leadership skills. President Clinton has shown great confidence in him, his work, and his commitment to veterans by nominating him to serve in this important position. I concur with the President who has said that Togo West `has always understood the special responsibility we owe to our men and women in uniform both during and after their years of service.' His unique perspective and experience will serve him well in meeting the challenges that lie ahead. 
Mr. President, I am proud of the confirmation of Togo West. I thank my colleagues for their unanimous support of this nomination.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as someone who has had a tremendous interest in Japan throughout my life, I have gained a great deal by maintaining direct and meaningful contact with Japan as a country, a people and a fascinating culture since my days as a student there in the 1950s. And although it is tested constantly, I truly believe the relationship between Japan and the United States continues to be strong. It is a relationship based on shared interests in democracy and the market economy, as well as mutual respect and fundamental friendship. It is from that perspective--as a friend of the Japanese people--that I feel it is so important to introduce this resolution today with my esteemed colleagues. 
It was not very long ago that Americans were up in arms about the trade deficit and Japan in particular--blaming the Japanese and other foreign countries bitterly for plant closings, job losses and our long list of economic ills. It was a very difficult time for our relationship with Japan, and a very difficult time for America as we struggled to get our own economic house in order. 
It was, however, also a cathartic time that I think was both inevitable and ultimately healthy for both countries. 
During that time, the United States was going through its own banking difficulties with the S&L scandals that saw many of our banks close their doors. Unemployment was way up and wages were stagnating. Our federal deficit was exploding and our national debt was climbing into the trillions. And corporations, many of which had traditionally employed their workers throughout their lifetime, were shedding employees by the thousands. 
The pressure to change intensified, as the American people watched our edge in certain industries and technologies slip and our people's anxieties and personal pain grow. The pressures strained our political system. In a nation of great diversity, ideas were born and rejected, consensus embraced, then rejected. While the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement, I think there would be a large consensus that would agree that the United States has effectively tackled many of our `structural problems'--the ones that Japan was right to point out to us so often. 
Today, Japan faces a similar crisis. A creeping economic crisis that has profound and dangerous implications for all of Asia, and the world. At stake, in my opinion, is Japan's leadership in the world and the stabilization of the Asian economies. This world and the United States cannot move forward successfully, without Japan's leadership. 
I feel so strongly about this and that is why this resolution is so very important. It is not to speak harshly of Japan, but to push for an honest, frank discussion, among friends, to talk about the very serious issues facing Japan that could lead to problems around the world. 
I would remind my colleagues that this crisis is not a recent phenomenon. For more than six years, we have had warnings of problems on the horizon. Many Japanese have told me the biggest mistake that Japan could make would be to continue to delay action and postpone reform. One of the things I and many Japan watchers worry about is that because of Japan's strong financial reserves, they will somehow get through this crisis, and there will be those who say, `see everything is OK. The system works fine;' that Japan will get through this crisis without learning anything from it. 
By turning inward and ignoring the need for change, at the moment that Japan is challenged to lead, Japan risks abdicating its long term global and regional security and economic responsibilities to emerging powers like China or even India. This has serious implications for the United States, as well. 
In terms of Japan, it is hard to not believe that Japan will once again face the problems that require action, and come out stronger as a result. The Japanese know more than anyone that many so-called `Japan watchers' in the United States and elsewhere are more pessimistic--saying that the talk in Japan of reform, adjustment, and stimulating the economy from within is not real. But when I think of Japan's history and what Japan's leaders in government and business know about economic success, I still personally choose to be more optimistic. 
I recall 1973, with the oil shock and the end of the Bretton Woods system, when it led the Japanese to a national commitment to reduce energy consumption and to increase energy efficiency. The overall effect on Japan as a whole was dramatic and impressive. 
Again, in 1985, with the Plaza Accord, when the yen began its dramatic strengthening--resulting in a commitment from Japanese industry to become much more efficient and squeeze out enormous waste and costs. The result was an incredibly competitive manufacturing machine. 
Now it is 1998, when the problems of other Asian countries require plans for international bail-outs and very harsh measures. President Clinton has called on Japan to become the engine of growth and recovery in Asia. I agree with him and encourage him to continue pushing Japan. Frankly put, Japan's future depends on a prosperous Asia and world. And America's future does as well. 
But, we also need to be realistic about what can and cannot work in Japan. American or European solutions to problems will not necessarily work there. If Japan is to lead Asia out of this crisis, Japan needs to move more quickly to recognize the extent of this problem and to find the uniquely Japanese solutions to them. But, only Japan can chart Japan's future. 
Japan needs to continue to work toward the reforms in their regulatory system which Prime Minister Hashimoto has begun. While there has been some small movement on this front, still, many more regulations remain that are a strait jacket on competition and free commerce. Telecommunications, housing and distribution are all sectors ripe for deregulation. 
In a similar vein, opening Japanese markets to more products, particularly products 
 from Asia, is critical to the Asian recovery. This won't be easy--and that's where leadership comes in--especially as Japan itself struggles to regain its balance. Open markets, over the long term, will position Japan to become the leader of a reborn Asian miracle. 
One extremely important foundation in a Japanese recovery, and in promoting Japanese economic leadership in an Asian recovery, is the fostering of a new pluralism of ideas in their political system. Every nation goes through times of introspection. America often does. Certainly, a national dialogue in Japan on this crisis and how to emerge from it stronger than ever, can't hurt. And efforts to institute significant political reform here should not be slowed. Diet Members, as the most direct representatives of their districts, need to become actively engaged in finding solutions. At all levels of government, accountability is key. Ministers need to have the power to lead their departments, and become responsible for their success and failure. Bureaucrats need to take orders, as easily as they give them. 
Over and over again, my Japanese friends point to the fact that Ministry of Finance and its bureaucracy has a far greater influence on policy than is appropriate and prudent in a parliamentary democracy. This has been said to me by Japanese time and time again over a number of years. It would seem to me, and not to be idealistic here, that the ministry ought to reflect the views of the Prime Minister and those elected to represent the people, and not the reverse. In our country this is a subject of extensive discussion and complaint by people who care about Japan. Accountability in a democracy is paramount. 
Why should it be that when I meet the Minister of Finance, or any Minister for that matter, that I know that I'm not speaking to the person who makes the decisions? How can that be in a democracy? In Great Britain they share Japan's Parliamentary system, but their cabinet agencies reflect the views of the Prime Minister and the people who elect the parliament, and they run the agency. Of course the Ministers consult with the bureaucrats, but they are held accountable for reflecting the Prime Minister's views and the national will. Unfortunately, that can't be said about today's Japan. 
I also find it ironic that the political reforms, such as single delegate districts, that were supposed to open up Japan's democracy and decision making, have not brought about the fundamental change in the system that everyone expected. The lack of a strong multi-party system, with a strong and viable opposition party remains a barrier to reform and serves as a wall through which ideas and change cannot penetrate. 
Just as Americans still have much to learn from Japan's successes, my point must also be to emphasize that we are affected by how Japan handles the challenges now posed by the weaker parts of their economy. Our relationship is not just a matter of the ties between our leaders, the tremendously important military alliance we share or the many forms of business and investment we transact between one another. We are increasingly connected through currencies, our banking systems and loan policies, the value of stocks, and whether Japan puts too much emphasis on exporting its way out of the problems rather than internal measures. We in the U.S. hope that our economic condition will insulate ourselves from the downturns in Asia. But we have to worry about markets shrinking for our products and especially any growth in our sizable trade deficit with Japan. 
My biggest fear is that if the Asian crisis remains unchecked, and average Americans begin to feel the impact of the succeeding market collapses on their incomes, they will begin to question Japan's national resolve and political will to deal with these problems. I especially don't want to see any further reasons for Americans to turn within or fear an active role in world trade. Throughout my political career, I have pushed very hard in my state of West Virginia for open markets, a global economy and fought against the forces of isolation and protectionism. Competition has served both my state and my country, and they will Japan as well. 
So, the actions Japan takes, or does not take, will affect America, as surely as they will their neighbors in Asia. 
I hope both our nations' leaders will continue to place the utmost importance on the U.S.-Japan relationship. Its strength is the basis for honesty with one another, for the ability to address problems together, and to pursue regional and shared objectives. We also must maintain and nurture this strength, which especially requires us to appreciate the role that our economies have on one another--because of their effect on our people and our sense of ourselves as nations. And this is a time when steps are more urgently required to ensure progress and prevent any kind of setback. I pledge to do my part in continuing to promote the importance and the potential of a strong, close U.S.-Japan relationship at all levels.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my colleagues, and most especially Senators Hollings, Ford, and Dorgan, in introducing the `Air Service Restoration Act of 1997.' This legislation is the result of many months of effort, first, to understand what has happened to air service in small and rural communities in the last twenty years and, then, to develop a comprehensive strategy for restoring and promoting air service to these areas--many of which have suffered such a dramatic decline in service and increase in fares that the U.S. Department of Transportation refers to them as `pockets of pain.' 
By most accounts the 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has been a huge success--with lower fares, better service, and more competition enjoyed by most of the nation, as well as an airline industry that has reached unprecedented levels of financial success and stability. But for all its successes, airline deregulation has one, potentially fatal, flaw--the creation of an ever-widening gap between the air transportation `haves' and `have-nots', with small and rural communities across the nation left to choose between high-cost, poor-quality service or no service at all. Clearly we have not and are not meeting our responsibility to foster and maintain a truly national air transportation system. 
West Virginia's communities are unquestionably among the hardest hit in the nation when it comes to air service declines. Prior to deregulation, West Virginia was served by at least five major commercial air carriers. We enjoyed a comprehensive route structure and comfortable levels of jet service at competitive prices. In the twenty years since, every major carrier, with the notable exception of U.S. Airways, abandoned its direct service to West Virginia. Jet service all but disappeared. Three airports--Elkins, Martinsburg, and Wheeling--lost commercial passenger service altogether. 
At the same time, West Virginia passengers experienced fare increases of 20-30 percent, in real terms, with service from regional or commuter airlines using smaller, turboprop planes. Some of these are solid airlines and offer good service, and we are thankful that they have stayed with us. But for many years their West Virginia product has been far inferior to that provided other communities--their planes are small, their schedules thin and their prices high. Not surprisingly, West Virginia businesses and passengers have responded by flying less or going elsewhere. At a time when the rest of the nation has experienced a 75 percent increase in air traffic, passenger enplanements in our state have declined at every airport, with a statewide decrease of nearly 40 percent. 
My top priority over the past twenty years--the same twenty years as airline deregulation--has been to bring good jobs and opportunity to West Virginia. Whether it's a specific project or a broad policy issue, from trade to connecting schools to the information highway, most of my work is about creating economic growth in my home state. In the last several years I have begun to see and hear more and more that the lack of convenient and affordable air service is holding us back, stunting economic growth in West Virginia just as it is in small and rural communities across the country. And unless we act now to restore and promote air service to under-served areas, we will never be able to close the economic development gaps in any meaningful and sustained way. 
Part of the change that I believe needs to take place can and must occur at the state and local level, where business and community leaders know what their needs are and can develop a real stake in the future of their airports by educating consumers, attracting air service, and filling airplanes. But aviation is a national issue, with global implications. No small or rural community should be expected to overcome the cumulative effect of twenty years of deregulation on its own. They need help, they've asked for help, and they deserve help. 
The legislation that we introduce today is part of what I hope will be a new era in our national aviation policy--an era that builds on the successes of deregulation and takes responsibility for its failures. The centerpiece of the bill is a five-year $100 million pilot program for up to 40 communities, with grants of up to $500,000 to each community for local initiatives to attract and promote service. Communities would provide local matching funds of up to 25 percent, and could do so directly or indirectly, through mechanisms such as seat guarantees. The Department of Transportation would have the authority to facilitate links between pilot communities and major airports by requiring joint fares and interline agreements between dominant airlines and new service providers. 
To administer the grant program and provide a resource for small communities both in and out of the pilot program, the bill creates a new Office of Small Community Air Service Development at the Department of Transportation dedicated to promoting 
and restoring air service to small communities. Among other tasks, this office would be responsible for ensuring that accurate and meaningful passenger traffic data is available regarding service to small communities, as it is today for larger communities. 
To clarify the priority for small communities in receiving and retaining service to slot-controlled airports, the bill directs the Department to ensure that any slots given to air carriers for small community air service will be withdrawn if the carrier fails to provide the service. 
To address a major infrastructure concern of small and rural airports, the bill establishes a pilot program allowing communities that face the loss of an air traffic control tower to instead share the cost of funding the tower, on a contract basis, in proportion to the cost-benefit ratio of the tower. 
Finally, the bill calls on the Department to review the airline industry's current marketing practices--practices which many believe are exacerbating the decline in air service to small communities--and, if necessary, promulgate regulations to curb abuses that inhibit market entry. 
The legislation we introduce today will begin to afford small and rural community air service the priority they deserve in our national transportation policy. It is my hope and intent to pursue this legislation in the context of the 1998 reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and Airport Improvement Program, and I look forward to working together with others of my colleagues, several of whom have shown a real commitment to achieving needed solutions in this area. 
In the global marketplace of today air service has become perhaps the single most important mode of mass transportation. When it comes to economic growth, there is no substitute for good air service. If we are to ensure that all communities throughout the nation are prepared to compete in the next century, we have no choice but to improve their transportation options.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a subject called universal service, and the threat it faces because of the Federal Communication Commission's--the FCC's-- policy regarding Internet service providers. When we passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a number of us--a bipartisan group called the Farm Team--fought hard to include Section 254, the section that ensures our nation's continued commitment to universal service. This section is the heart and soul of this new law, because without this fundamental commitment, telecommunications service in rural areas would not be affordable. Without it, we will watch a new world of haves and have-nots when it comes to telecommunications and access to the Information Age. 
When I deal with this issue, I am painfully reminded of another example of deregulation: the airlines. West Virginia and other rural states got the short end of the stick on airline deregulation, and we continue to pay the price for it. That's what made me and others so determined not to let this happen under the Telecommunications Act. We knew we had to make sure that the idea of universal service was not simply expressed as a goal or listed in some weak section--we made sure it was a statutory obligation explicitly stated in the Act. 
Maintaining universal service involves a number of issues. Senator Stevens took on most of these by demanding a major report from the FCC on their progress regarding universal service, in a provision in last year's appropriations bill that funded the FCC. That report is due April 10, and many of us are looking for serious answers from the FCC to the many questions we have about the direction they are heading with regard to universal service funding. 
Two big concerns are, (1) the FCC's ill-advised decision to provide only 25 percent of the costs of universal service, leaving the remaining 75 percent to the states; and (2) their decision to only fund the FCC's portion of the high-cost fund from interstate revenues. I do not believe that rural states can live with either of these proposals, because what we'll get are higher rates and dwindling investment in our local telecommunications networks. This simply does not square with the Act's promise of delivering comparable services at comparable rates. Section 254 was designed to ensure a national standard of affordability for telecommunications services, and that is a standard we simply must live up to. 
In the 1996 law, we recognized that the maintenance of the nation's telecommunications network is a shared responsibility--and one that provides shared benefits. It is in our national interest that everyone be able to affordably make calls from anywhere and to anywhere in the United States. 
This isn't a radical concept. As a nation we share responsibility in many areas. My colleague Senator Dorgan points out that land-locked states like West Virginia, North Dakota and Montana all help pay for the Coast Guard, even though our citizens use those services far less than others. I certainly wouldn't advocate that we stop supporting the Coast Guard, and the same principle applies here. Shared Responsibility. 
I will have more to say on these subjects as the FCC moves forward on implementing universal service. Today I want to focus on the subject of internet telephony, and how the FCC's current regulatory policy threatens the promise of universal service. 
The problem is that the FCC's current policy is basically a policy of letting so-called information service providers avoid paying for their fair share of universal service, even though these companies are delivering services that are clearly telecommunications services and which burden the local network. Senator Stevens has been the most vocal leader on this issue, and I want to praise him. We both come from high-cost states, and we both know the importance of changing the FCC policy so that their mission to maintain universal service can be fulfilled.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his, as usual, stalwart defense of what is right in health care. I am struck by the referral of the Senator from Maine to the increased number of uninsured, which has always been put out by those--particularly the insurance companies--who oppose any kind of adding on to health care coverage or the quality of health care coverage in this country. 
It is the oldest irony in the books. They have never supported anything, anything that I can remember, over the last 10 years that increased health insurance coverage. They have opposed everything. She quotes them--and she was even shot down by the Republican appointed CBO Director June O'Neill, who says in her letter, `CBO has not estimated how PARCA [the bill referred to in the estimates under discussion] might affect the number of people covered by insurance.' 
So on the one hand there is no argument, there is no case to be made about the increase; and secondly, in talking about this consumer bill of rights, we are talking about very, very fundamental things. 
I had to take my own son into an emergency room within the last 2 weeks with my wife. There was nobody in the emergency room except us. It was held open, Sibley Hospital, because it was open and we were able to take advantage of it. It is the most important room in a hospital. This bill would guarantee that an emergency room would be open for everybody in America--not just people named Rockefeller or Kennedy--24 hours a day, 365 days a year. That is necessary. 
I have another relative who has been through a mastectomy. People who say mastectomy quality is going up and people are not being urged to get out of hospitals simply don't know the facts because I have seen otherwise and I know otherwise. 
I suggest we support the amendments of the Senator from Oklahoma and that we support the Senator from Massachusetts, both.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have a very interesting amendment to propose and I think a very important one. I want to say first, I fully support highway funding. Obviously, in a State like West Virginia, where it is mostly mountainous, highway funding is more important and more expensive than most places. I supported Senate passage of ISTEA. We are spending $217 billion on highway funding this year. When I was Governor, I helped get an amendment passed in this Congress, which was actually referred to as the Rockefeller amendment, which said if States had accumulated money, they went to the head of the line on interstate highway building and got their money from the Federal Government first. 
Again, this is in no way an antihighway amendment, as some are very anxious to label it. It is, however, very much a proveteran amendment. The amendment has one purpose and one purpose only: To protect veterans funding from a midnight raid--nothing less--by the administration and the Budget Committee. The raid isn't really a raid, it is a ravage on the authority of the Veterans' Committee to see that the needs of the Nation's veterans are met. In this case, I am talking particularly about disabled veterans. 
It is as simple as that. The veterans' account under the budget authority is being cut by $10.5 billion to pay for an enormous increase in highway funds. This money is in the veterans' budget baseline. And today they are taking it away from disabled veterans and putting it into highways, where we already have $217 billion. My point is they need to find another offset. 
I think my colleagues would want to know just what is being done here, because it is not a pretty sight. First, what is the law about? Veterans law generally requires the VA to pay disability compensation to veterans for any injuries, diseases, or conditions they incur while they are in service in the military. After long debate, and for very good reasons, the Government long ago decided that veterans disability compensation is not limited to only combat-related conditions. The budget resolution would change that. 
In 1993, the VA general counsel in a Republican administration interpreted the law to require the payment of disability compensation to veterans who could prove they had become addicted to tobacco while in military service if that addiction continued without interruption 
and resulted in an illness and disability. 
It is important to remember that this is a very, very tough test for veterans to meet. And very few veterans--only about 8 percent of those who have made such claims--have been able to meet this test so far. In my home State of West Virginia, where there are approximately 200,000 veterans watching this debate closely, as of March 10, only 250 smoking-related disability claims have been filed and, of that number, only 6--6--had been granted so far. What this says to me is that these are tough claims to substantiate. This tough test is the very reason that so few claims have been filed and why so few have been granted. 
Even the military now acknowledges that it played a significant role in fostering addiction in very young men and women in the service. How did the military do this? One, by distributing free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations. Two, by creating a culture that encouraged smoking at every opportunity, a culture of `smoke 'em if you've got 'em.' And three, by selling tobacco products at vastly reduced prices, prices as much as 76% less than in civilian markets. 
Mr. President, whether or not a veteran became addicted to tobacco during military service, the results of that addiction are issues that the VA has correctly decided, under existing law, should be determined by its triers of fact. This is the law currently. This is the law that the Budget Committee would unilaterally change. 
Now we get to the midnight raid. In approving the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution, the Senate Budget Committee assumes a $10.5 billion cut from the veterans account--from disabled veterans, in effect--to partially fund the very large increase in ISTEA funds. The Budget Committee made this transfer based upon their decision to totally bar any veterans' claims for disabilities resulting from any tobacco-related illnesses. But not only did the Budget Committee make this raid on veterans' compensation for disabled veterans under the budget resolution, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs' jurisdiction over this issue is totally removed. And lo and behold, where does it appear to go? It appears to be solely placed in the realm of the Transportation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. President, this type of gimmickry makes a mockery of our budget process and of regular order in the Senate. It makes a mockery of the system of the Senate, which so many of our Senators are fond of talking about. This budget resolution will ultimately result in the erosion not only of the Veterans' Committee's authority, but of all authorizing committees' authority to determine policy. The budget committee is saying to us on the Veterans' Committee, we who take our work seriously, we will decide for you, we in the Appropriations Committee will decide for you; you will not decide policy in the authorizing committee. 
Let's put a human face on this issue. Just who are the people that this VA compensation is helping? In Huntington, WV, Robert Christian is a 71-year-old World War II veteran. He entered the Navy when he was 17 years old. He began smoking cigarettes supplied by the Navy while on a ship headed to the Pacific, where he was involved in three separate invasions during that war. 
Robert is just one of thousands of World War II veterans who became addicted to cigarettes supplied by the military. Don't talk about personal choice. His cigarettes were supplied by the military. So Robert smoked and has been addicted for 24 years. Today, he has bronchitis and emphysema as a result of his addiction. He receives regular treatments to help him breathe. 
Because Robert and his physicians were able to make the connection between his bronchitis and his nicotine addiction, his medical disability has been service-connected by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the budget resolution, veterans like Robert would not be able to seek help. That is a disgrace. 
His disability check is not a lot of money, I might add. But the real asset in this case is his VA health care. Now, as a service-connected veteran, Robert is able to go to the VA medical 
center for treatment of his service-connected condition. He is able to get his health care because he is service connected. This would change under the budget resolution. 
And let's look at my friend, Larry Stotts of Spencer, WV. Larry joined the Marines at age 18, and he, too, began smoking the cigarettes supplied in service. 
Larry is a Korean War combat veteran and one of the Chosin Few. The Chosin Few are veterans of a bloody battle--in driving snow and sub-zero temperatures--at the Chosin Reservoir in Korea in 1950. 
After years of smoking beginning in the military, Larry has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is so severely disabling that the VA has granted--under the very law now proposed to be struck down--a 100% service-connected disability and free medical care. 
So when you take away this Department of Veterans Affairs compensation, remember that VA health care is now being provided on a priority basis. It has to do with your service-connected status or income level, and the first priority is for medical conditions linked to service in the military. A vote to deny VA compensation for smoking-related illnesses due to Government-sponsored nicotine addiction, which began in the service when these young men and women were teenagers, is also a vote to deny veterans health care--not just compensation for being disabled, but health care to thousands of veterans who turn to the VA for treatment of their smoking-related diseases. This is indeed a sorry statement about this country's sense of obligation to those who served our country. Mr. President, this issue is much clearer than all of this discussion of the law and the cost estimates. The issue is stunningly simple. Even if one opposes paying this compensation to a disabled veteran, or even if one is totally comfortable with the cost estimates that have been created, there is simply no reason--no reason--morally, ethically, or otherwise, to take away money from disabled veterans' programs and use it for other programs like tax cuts and highways. It is outrageous that veterans' programs are being looted in this way. 
We are not asking for cuts in all accounts this year. In fact, we are not even demanding that others, such as Social Security disability recipients, lose their smoking-related compensation. No. Only veterans. 
This year, we single out veterans and say: You, veterans, pay for all of this by giving up your rights. We imagine your satisfaction, disabled veterans, at $10 billion extra for highways, paid for by the loss of your rights to compensation as a disabled veteran. 
I oppose this raid. I urge a vote in favor of my amendment, and I reserve the remainder of my time. 
I will ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment after I yield to the Senator from Colorado. How much time is left?

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the distinguished floor manager indicates that the President of the United States has done this. I am not trying to protect the President of the United States. I think he is wrong on this also. I am trying to protect disabled American veterans who have been addicted to nicotine and who will be barred from getting compensation as a result of this. All I can say is that my amendment seeks to strike $10.5 billion that was put artificially, by trumped-up means, into the veterans' baseline. If there is a study or something to look at it in the future, it will then be too late--my purpose will be dead. I want to return to veterans that $10.5 billion which is ascribed to roads--which we treasure in West Virginia, but which, because of the good work of my senior colleague, we are doing very well with. And that is a common joke around here, and one which I enjoy and respect. 
But I care about veterans. We have approximately 200,000 of them in West Virginia. We have 26 million of them in this country. This is a blatant attempt, under a whole new concept--despite our new understanding of addiction to tobacco in general, and our new understanding of addiction to tobacco by veterans in the service--which DOD now admits for the first time--to take money away from helping veterans and give it to highways. 
Concrete and rebars and all of those things are important. But so are human beings who have served in this country's military service and who are addicted and have to go through an incredibly hard process to become classified as disabled to get this kind of help from VA. 
Yes, as the manager has indicated, some will get their health care benefits. But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about a process which, because of the addiction, they have to go through a very difficult process to achieve a status where they can get compensation for their disability due to addiction. It is a fundamental American matter, and it is also the law of the land at the current time.

Mr. President, the Craig amendment would cut $10.5 billion in veterans' funds in the budget resolution. 
No. 2, the Craig amendment still allows the money to be cut and then to reauthorize--as he says, we will do a study for a year--incidentally, by the same people, a study by exactly the same people who came up with this solution, to cut the money. 
But in order to reauthorize the veterans' disability benefit, the Congress--everything would then be subject to PAYGO, and my colleagues had better understand that Congress would then have to cut off another veterans' benefit. So this is a blind path that we are going down. A vote in favor of the Craig amendment is a vote to shift $10.5 billion away from disabled veterans.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the budget resolution would take $10.5 billion of `savings,' which is in the baseline of the Veterans Administration budget, and remove it, excise it, and put it into more highway funds. There are $217 billion of highway funds over 5 years. What this would effectively also do is bar any veteran's claim for disability from a tobacco-related illness at a time when the test for getting a tobacco-related illness in the VA is incredibly difficult. Only 278 Americans, to this point, have achieved that. The whole issue on tobacco and the military has changed in the last 3 or 4 years. We want to restore the money, keep the money in the VA budget and not have it taken out and given to highways, which could find a different offset.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues understand that by voting for the Domenici amendment--which I hope they will not--they will simply completely reverse the vote which they have just made and wipe it all out. That will seem strange, I think, to veterans. This is an up-or-down vote on veterans and their disability benefits. A 1-year study, in the humble opinion of the junior Senator from West Virginia, is a farce, because it is going to be made by exactly the same three groups that came up with the $10.5 billion cut out of the veterans account to put the money into highways. I doubt that they are going to be any different next year, because they will need the money. They will have to go get the money in the next year. 
This cuts veterans. A `no' vote is what I would ask of my colleagues.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. 
Mr. President, it took Congress a decade to forge consensus necessary to pass the 1996 Telecommunication Act. This bold law was designed to promote competition in the dynamic telecommunications industry, but such competition is to be balanced by maintaining the commitment to universal service, a fundamental principle which has ensured affordable access to communications for every American, especially those in rural areas. 
I voted for this historic legislation because in my view it struck the right balance. 
I support competition, but I will insist on universal service. 
And I will insist on time to fully implement the Act. This bold law seeks to move the $200 billion telecommunications industry to a more competitive market, but it will not happen overnight. President Clinton signed this major legislation into law in February 1998, just two years ago. This started the telecommunications industry on the path toward competition, but there have been some road blocks along the way with implementation snags, mergers instead of competition, and excessive litigation. 
The current result, unfortunately, is confusion. 
I do not want to reopen the Telecommunications Act, but I do want to relieve the confusion among consumers who seem to be bearing the brunt of this transition. Today, I am introducing bipartisan legislation called the Consumer Protection Act to ensure `truth in billing.' I believe that consumers deserve to have the truth, the whole truth about changes in billings. 
As the telecommunications industry moves from a regulated, monopolistic model into a more competitive model, we need to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make wise decisions in selecting their telecommunications carriers. In a regulated market, the regulations are intended to protect consumers' interests. Under a more competitive model, we need to ensure that accurate information is provided to consumers so they can protect themselves and use their ability to choose in the market place. 
This legislation is very simple. It directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate billing practices, and report on the findings to Congress. If this investigation exposes misleading practices, we need to have disciplinary action to protect consumers. 
If telecommunications companies choose to use line-items on phones bills, those companies must accurately report all regulatory actions, including how federal actions reduce costs, such as the $1.5 billion in access reductions provided in July 1997. 
This legislation ensures that telecommunications companies cannot selectively disclose only those pieces of information that are in the companies' interest. When federal actions bring rates down, consumers have the right to know. As the industry makes the transition to a more competitive market, consumers deserve a full accounting so they can make informed decisions when they choose their telecommunications provider. 
The Consumer Protection Act will ensure that consumers will see on their own bill how companies allocate savings resulting from deregulation of the industry, as companies are required to disclose how savings are passed along to residential rates, small business rates and other customer payment plans. This is not re-regulation. Nothing in this dictates how much companies can charge for their services. And nothing prevents companies from putting line items on bills. Those choices are still entirely at the companies' discretion. This legislation simply requires them to tell the whole truth if they choose to put a line item on customers bills. 
The legislation has a third provision that requires companies using a line-item on customer bills to file with the FCC all the revenue and company reports they now file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
The idea behind this requirement is simple. Since we require companies to report their revenues to the SEC in order to protect stockholders, shouldn't we provide the same information to the FCC in order to protect consumers? 
During this period of transition from a monopoly-based system to a market-based system, there will be some ups and downs. But we should act to minimize confusion and protect consumers as the new market evolves. 
At the state level, public service commissions are beginning to take steps to provide fuller, more accurate information to consumers. In January of this year, New York Administrative Law Judge Eleanor Stein recommended that telecommunications carriers be required to disclose fully, in bills of all classes of customers, the fee increases and fee reductions resulting from the enactment of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. 
In February the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) passed a resolution that clearly noted that line-items are a business choice made by companies not a mandate from the federal government. The NARUC resolution called on the FCC to take action to require interstate carriers to provide accurate customer notice and the purpose of line-items. 
Some state officials are taking action. NARUC is calling on the FCC to lead. Now Congress needs to end the confusion, and tell consumers the truth. 
I am proud that the Consumers Union supports this bipartisan legislation. I welcome the support of my colleagues, Senator Snowe of Maine and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to you on behalf of the citizens of West Virginia. The West Virginia Department of Culture and History has named 1998 `The Year of the Quilt.' In the Appalachian Mountain region, and particularly in the great state of West Virginia, the tradition of native crafting, including quilting, has thrived uninterrupted for over two hundred years. 
In 1968, my wife, Sharon, along with a group of community-minded West Virginians assisted a talented group of quilters to form Mountain Artisans, a nonprofit group comprised of gifted quilt makers, to help in the preservation and exposure of this artful tradition of design and talent. Many West Virginians considered quilting a part of the mountain state's heritage. My wife and I are particularly fond of the Mountain Artisans. When we were expecting our first child, in the late 1960's, the group graciously decided to create a quilt for our first-born. With the assistance of the Sod Sewing Group from Sod, West Virginia, the quilt was completed in mid-September of 1970. The beautiful quilt, which is known as `The Rockefeller Quilt' was displayed at the Rockefeller home and today, adorns the wall just outside my office in the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C. 
One master quilter I especially admire is Mortana McCormick of Sod, West Virginia, who contributed to the creation of The Rockefeller Quilt. Ms. McCormick, a distinguished quilter, has represented the State well and helped put our state on the `interior design and fashion' map. She has contributed to fashion patchwork designs for Barbra Streisand and museum collections displayed in West Virginia and internationally. Mortana McCormick is just one of the talented artisan-quilters that call West Virginia home. I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing this long standing tradition and art, and its many talented artists, including Ms. Mortana McCormick.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope that Senator Richard Bryan from Nevada is on the way to the floor as I speak. I speak in opposition to this amendment. 
I need to point out that Medicare beneficiaries did not ask for this so-called `new right.' This is a proposal which is written to, frankly, charge seniors more money. That comment can be thrown around and thrown around very glibly when one is trying to make a populist point. On the other hand, therefore, it is true--and it has to be said in that manner--92 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied or, in fact, very satisfied with the availability of care under the Medicare Program now. 
It is this Senator's belief that fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program will increase very substantially if private contracting is allowed to occur. The Congressional Budget Office has this to say about the Kyl-Archer bill: 
HCFA's efforts to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims could be significantly compromised because it would be difficult to evaluate episodes of care with gaps where services were directly contracted-- 
A very complicated way of saying a rather easy thing. It would not be very easy to track this: 
Without adequate regulatory oversight, unethical providers could bill Medicare while also collecting from directly-contracted patients. 
In other words, they could collect twice from Medicare and 
the patient. 
The bill would almost certainly raise national health spending. 
The Government Accounting Office. 
Private contracting, further, Mr. President, is not about the freedom of choice, as some of our friends from across the aisle would have us believe. The effort to privately contract is really, as I indicated much earlier, about money. Seniors have freedom of choice now. 
You can make a very, very good case that the strength of Medicare is based upon an original concept that no longer exists, and that is one gigantic pool. Because everybody is in that pool, almost like the original Blue Cross, Medicare wins money on some, loses on others, but in the end everything tends to wash out evenly. 
Seniors now are given many options. I participated in one of the options myself, the PSO amendment, which I did with Senator Bill Frist, and it was successful. But all this does not indicate, therefore, that seniors do not have the freedom of choice now. They do. They can go in many directions, and that is increasing all the time. They can see any doctor they want now, and they have adequate protections that the Medicare Program has and is providing them. 
The proposal to privately contract is opposed by the American Association of Retired Persons, the American College of Physicians, the National Council of Senior Citizens, Families USA, et cetera, and that is not really the point, is it? Because one can always find groups that are for or against something. 
While private contracting may be a good deal for doctors, it really is not necessarily a very good deal for beneficiaries, and that becomes important in the Medicare communities. Seniors would pay 100 percent of the bill when they privately contract. That is the way it would work--a large price tag for services that Medicare would otherwise cover. 
Private contracting would cripple Medicare's ability to hold down health care costs and would put elderly and disabled citizens at serious financial and medical risk. Under the Kyl-Archer bill, doctors can charge whatever they want for a Medicare-covered service. One would ask, why would one want to do that? The Kyl-Archer bill would allow doctors to give priority, frankly, to wealthy patients who are willing and able to pay out of pocket. 
My wife and I recently had an event--not serious--with our 18-year-old son. We took our son to six different physicians, most of them specialists. So when I say this, I say this in the context of an enormous regard for physicians and for the field and for the fact that our 18-year-old son wants to become a physician himself. Nevertheless, it is an incentive for doctors to go to those who are able to pay and get them to pay out of their pocket and pay more. 
In a February 23, 1998, letter from the GAO--which I believe is fairly broadly respected around here--to Senator Moynihan, the GAO's findings do not support Senator Kyl's sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Senator Kyl's amendment, for example, reads, according to the GAO, `most seniors are denied this right (to obtain health care from physicians or providers of their choice) by current restrictions on their health care choices.' 
Again, a denial of choice argument. 
The GAO letter to Senator Moynihan reads:  
Nearly all physicians treat Medicare patients and accept new patients covered by Medicare. Recent data from the AMA indicate that 96.2 percent of all non-Federal physicians treated Medicare beneficiaries in 1996. Moreover, the percentage of physicians treating Medicare patients has increased--from 95.2 percent in 1995 and 94.2 percent in 1994--over the last 2 years. 
A 1-percent increase. It simply shows the direction of more physicians treating Medicare patients. 
Again, the GAO says: 
According to the recent reports from PPRC, `access for most [fee-for-service] beneficiaries remains excellent and . . . measures of access are essentially unchanged from previous years.' 
In closing, Mr. President, I wish to make this statement. Much has been made of the United Seniors Association, which is a conservative fundraising arm of the Republican Party, in fact, and is the No. 1 supporter of the Kyl private contracting amendment. But then again, those things happen, too. I will say when Chairman Roth of the Senate Finance Committee heard their testimony, he said, `I just want to make it clear that those kinds of statements are not satisfactory to this chairman.' And he was not at that point a particularly happy chairman. 
At the beginning of the Kyl amendment, frankly, there were some of us who were very, very concerned because there were 47 cosponsors, including one Democrat. There has been a lot of emphasis, I think, in the last number of weeks to try to get this to be a better-understood proposition. In fact, I think now people are beginning to understand that this is not necessary, and there is a way for physicians to be able to charge Medicare beneficiaries more, and, in a sense, if a Medicare beneficiary is in a very sick condition or bad condition, how are they able to negotiate in the first place? I think the Senate would do best to simply send this sense of the Senate underground. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues to introduce the Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1998. I believe this legislation, with its special emphasis on the enforcement of medical child support orders, will improve the financial security and health of thousands of American children. This bill also takes careful steps to ensure that vital Federal health programs such as Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program are not misused by parents who are able but unwilling to live up to their health care responsibilities. I want to take this opportunity to share my special thanks with Senator Snowe, who has shown a long-standing commitment to this important issue. I would also like to thank Senators Kerry, Kennedy, Dodd, Jeffords, and Chafee for their work on the issue of child support. 
As a nation, our most fundamental measure of success is how effectively we provide for our children. We have a collective responsibility to ensure that our children have the financial resources they need to live happy, healthy and stable lives. At the same time, the responsibility for addressing many of children's daily needs fall squarely at the feet of their parents. In my state of West Virginia and elsewhere, too many parents neglect their financial responsibilities, maintaining that because they are no longer living in the same house as their children, they no longer have to support them. With so many parents refusing to provide their children with adequate financial support and health care, between $15 and $25 billion dollars in child support remains uncollected each year. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1998 takes several steps to make child support a dependable part of the continuum of private and public benefits available to American children. Since the child support enforcement system was created in 1975 to centralize state government collections, Congress has authorized Federal funding to improve and broaden state child support programs. In addition to general financial support, the Federal government also makes annual incentive payments to the states based on the cost effectiveness of their child support collections. That is, dollar for dollar, do the states show a significant return for the money they spend on child support collections. 
For several years, there has been a consensus among both state child support agencies and child advocates that basing incentive payments on cost effectiveness alone does no justice to the many other areas of state performance. Two years ago, the welfare reform law took a positive step forward by commissioning a task force composed of child support experts from the Department of Health and Human Services and state agencies to come up with a new set of incentives that would keep states on the road to more effective child support collections in a variety of areas. The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1998 incorporates the consensus findings of this work group. For the first time, the new incentives structure takes into account not only a state's cost effectiveness but its ability to establish paternity and child support orders and to collect current and back child support payments. 
This legislation also increases the emphasis on a State's collection of medical child support and eliminates some of the barriers the States face in their efforts to enforce medical child support orders. With one out of seven American children unable to access basic health coverage, medical child support or `medical support' has become a vital part of child support enforcement. Medical support can take many forms including an order to a non-custodial parent to provide health insurance, to cover a portion of an insurance co-payment or a deductible, or to pay past medical bills. Since 1984, federal law has required state child support enforcement agencies to petition for and collect medical support as part of any general child support order if health care coverage is available to the non-custodial parent at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, however, medical child support is still only collected in about 30% of all child support cases. If we fail to use this prime opportunity to re-establish medical support as a priority, enforcement of medical support might be even more dismal in the future. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1998 will improve the collection of medical support in two significant ways. First, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a sixth medical support criterion upon which Federal incentives payments will be based. This sixth medical support incentives factor will not only ensure that States do their best to collect medical support, but it will also send a message to the States that when creating and improving their overall collections systems, medical support is a top priority. 
Many of us have worked hard to make sure that all American children receive appropriate health care coverage through both public and private programs such as the newly-created Children's Health Insurance (or `CHIPS') Program. Although this and other Federal programs are vital, they were never intended and should not be used as a parachute for parents who could afford to cover their own children, but refuse to do so. 
This bill also helps improve medical support collections by eliminating some of the procedural barriers that the states face when they try to enforce medical support orders through health plans governed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Once a court issues a medical support order, the state child support enforcement agencies sends a notice of that order to the non-custodial parent's health plan. Over 50 percent of American employers offer health plans that are governed by ERISA. As a result, there are over 700,000 children who are dependent on a medical support order through an ERISA-governed plan. Currently, there is a lack of uniformity in the way that state child support enforcement agency and the health plan administrators communicate with one another. Despite the fact that ERISA already defines the elements a medical support order must contain in order to be valid under federal law, there is still a lot of confusion by the state agencies and the plan administrators about what is required. 
After consultation with dozens of ERISA plan administrators, state agencies, and child advocates, this bill removes this procedural barrier by requiring the Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor to create and implement a standardized national medical support notice that states would be required to use and employers would be required to accept under ERISA. This standardized form will take into account the respective administrative needs of both states and employers. Second, the bill requires the Secretary of the Department of Labor, in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services, to submit recommendations for any other necessary improvements to the medical child support provisions of ERISA. Finally, the bill commissions a work group composed of medical support experts from state agencies, employers, plan administrators and child advocates to identify and make recommendations for the elimination of any remaining medical support barriers. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1998 is designed to improve States' overall child support collections with a special emphasis on the effective enforcement of medical support orders, so that all qualified children receive the health coverage that they deserve.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that will authorize provision of care to veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation. This bill, requested by the Department of Veterans Affairs, will provide priority health care to a group of veterans that have so far been excluded from access to VA services. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. 
Let me take you back over 40 years, to the 1940's and 50's, when thousands of military personnel (primarily Navy submariners and Army Air Corps pilots) received nasopharyngeal radium treatments to treat and prevent inner ear problems that developed due to the inadequate pressurization of their respective vessels. These treatments were considered the standard in the medical community at the time for children with severe middle ear obstructions and infections, often with accompanying deafness. To adapt the treatments to healthy adults, the Navy and Army conducted experiments on small groups of submariners and pilots. Subsequently, between 8,000 and 12,000 servicemen were irradiated for military purposes. The treatments were halted in the early 1960's as a result of two developments: pressurized planes and submarines became available (thus obviating the need for the treatments), and the clinical dangers associated with radiation were becoming apparent. 
Looking back, we now know just how dangerous these treatments can be. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that tissues at the exact site of radium placement were exposed to 2000 rem of radiation. That is 400 times greater than the maximum `safe' level of radiation exposure established by the Atomic Energy Commission many years ago. Parts of the brain received 24 rem, five times the accepted limit of exposure. Studies that have analyzed the health effects of external irradiation of the head and neck conclude that there is an increased risk of tumors of the brain, and of the thyroid, salivary, and parathyroid glands. One study done on individuals who had received nasopharyngeal radium treatments concluded there was an increased risk of developing head and neck tumors associated with the childhood treatments. 
Unfortunately, the health effects of the treatments that were given to our veterans is unknown. Careful scientific studies cannot be done because the records documenting the treatments are incomplete or nonexistent. However, when such high levels of exposure are sustained, we must be concerned about long-term health effects, and thus, we have a responsibility to ensure access to health care by these veterans. Simply put, it is the right thing to do. 
This legislation is a step in the right direction in helping these individuals. As Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am well acquainted with the difficulties experienced by veterans who were exposed to radiation during service to their country and later sought help from the VA. The willingness of the VA to include this group of veterans is clearly demonstrated by the fact that VA initiated this legislation, and that is good. 
In summary, this legislation grants veterans who received nasopharyngeal radium treatments the same status as other atomic veterans who served in the occupational forces in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, or who were present at the atmospheric test sites in Nevada and the Pacific. These veterans will now be able to enroll in the ionizing radiation registry, which entitles them to a full and complete physical examination. They will also gain access to medical care, to treat cancerous conditions detected during this examination that are associated with exposure to ionizing radiation. 
It is especially important to provide physical examinations and health care to these veterans because documentation of the nasopharyngeal radium treatments was poorly done, if it was done at all. Thus, the relevant clinical information is not in their civilian or military medical records to alert a physician to potential problems. The appalling lack of documentation has proved to be a constant problem in ongoing efforts to grant benefits to atomic veterans of all types, and continues to plague us in this effort as well. 
We will continue to study the plight of all atomic veterans, but this legislation offers eligible health care to a group of atomic veterans that have up to now been closed out of the VA. It is reasonable, compassionate, and long overdue.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator Frist in introducing legislation to authorize the National Science Foundation to form a commission to review and propose recommendations for assuring the United States leadership in science and mathematics. This bill would require the formation of a 12 member commission of experts in the field of science and mathematics education. The commission is charged with reviewing the recently released Third International Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) study results, along with whatever other relevant information they need to assess the state of science and mathematics education in the United States, and reporting back to Congress with a set of recommendations for implementation by public and private agencies; these recommendations would serve to allow United States students to become preeminent among the nations of the world. 
As everyone in the Senate knows, I have been a long and ardent supporter of education. That is why I read with such dismay the recent TIMSS study results which show United States students behind every major industrialized nation in the study. This is an unacceptable situation. The United States' economy is becoming increasingly dependent on high-technology, information management, and intellectual ability rather than raw materials, natural resources and muscle power. It is imperative that our high-school graduates--whether they go on to college, post-secondary technical training, or move straight into the workforce--have a solid foundation of science and mathematics education. A recent study suggests that 60 percent of positions require some sort of computer skills, while only 22 percent of today's workers have applicable skills. We can not let this inequality continue to future generations. 
Unfortunately the TIMSS study results show that we are setting up our students to fail. We need to identify, and work diligently to implement, means to correct this situation. The commission formed by this bill is a needed first step. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this bill to amend Chapter 29 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to effect the immediate elimination of the special duty rate on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) imports from Mexico in order that the United States polyester industry can remain competitive in the U.S. domestic market. 
We're faced with an ironic situation where a single American supplier is the source of substantial harm to the American polyester production industry and American workers. This is a highly unusual situation in which the American supplier has been able to remain a monopolistic producer of PTA, thus controlling the supply of the product and the price U.S. consumers must pay. By eliminating the tariff on PTA from Mexico, this legislation will place the U.S. PTA market on a level playing field with adequate supply and market dictated prices. 
PTA is the principal feedstock in producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polyester resin produced in West Virginia by Shell Chemical. This feedstock, PTA, comprises nearly two thirds the cost of polyester production. PTA is produced for the U.S. merchant market by one sole supplier, who can control both the price and supply of PTA in the U.S. market. Because the NAFTA tariff makes PTA imports unaffordable, U.S. PET producers, like Shell, are limited domestically to only one source to meet their PTA needs. This domestic source is not providing PET buyers with sufficient quantities of PTA, nor at a competitive price. Subsequently, the combination of the NAFTA tariff on PTA and a single domestic merchant producer of PTA, the U.S. price for PTA is kept the highest in the world. As a result, U.S. polyester producers, like the one in West Virginia, operate in a closed, non-competitive environment. 
Consequently, a tariff inversion is created which significantly harms U.S. PET production because PET imports made with cheaper, foreign PTA are subject to relatively low tariffs or none at all in the case of GSP countries. This tariff inversion exposes West Virginia's PET production and all U.S. polyester production to unfair competition from foreign competitors. Further, it prohibits any possibility for expansion and new job creation. 
I understand that the Office of the United States Trade Representative is currently negotiating with their Mexican counterparts various tariff eliminations under the Second Round of Accelerated Tariff Elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The PTA tariff is under consideration. The elimination of the duty for PTA is supported by the majority of the U.S. PTA industry and Mexico. 
Shell's future economic viability in West Virginia is linked to the elimination of this tariff. If the tariff is not eliminated, the cutback in Shell polyester production could cost as many as 250 full-time jobs that pay on average, $70,000 a year, including direct wages, benefits and retirement. Already 160 jobs have been lost since 1995 as a direct result of the economic disadvantage caused by this inequity. I would add that these jobs provide some of the highest paying salaries in my State. 
This lack of competitive domestic PTA pricing does not just cause harm to my State of West Virginia--also at risk are nearly 3,500 workers employed by several U.S. polyester producers buying PTA across the country. 
I urge the Senate to act on this PTA tariff elimination bill so that West Virginians and other domestic workers and producers can fairly compete in this highly competitive global marketplace and to have the opportunity to expand U.S. operations when market conditions permit.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to congratulate and honor two West Virginia students for their unselfish and outstanding volunteer service in their communities. Mark Jones of North Marion High School in Farmington and Tasha Daft of Mannington Middle School in Mannington have been named State Honorees in the 1998 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an honor conferred on only one high school and one middle-level student in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
These young volunteers, Mark and Tasha are true inspirations to all of us. They are our future, and they are diligently working to ensure the preservation of their communities as insurance for a better tomorrow. 
The program that brought these young role models to our attention, The Prudential Spirit of Communities Awards, was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. 
Mark is seen throughout his community as Cowboy Dave, his stage persona, sending a drug free message to youngsters. Since 1996, he has reached nearly 1,300 students speaking about drug and tobacco prevention. Tasha is the creator of the `Flower Power,' `Trash, Treasure, Recycling,' and `Our World is Worth It' projects. Through these she is able to help protect our earth and its inhabitants. 
Mark and Tasha should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their recognition, they will come to Washington in early May for several days of special events including a Congressional breakfast reception on Capitol Hill. 
I highly applaud Mark and Tasha for their act in seeking to make their home communities a better place to live. I would also like to salute four other young students in my state who were named Distinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their volunteer service. They are : Lisa Taylor of Ansted; Ryan Donovan of Williamson; Stephanie Cooper of Hambleton; and Heather Phillips of Winfield. 
All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment that is extraordinary and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show how important young people are to our community and the valued asset they are to our world and future.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed senior colleague from West Virginia. The junior Senator doesn't believe he will need 11 minutes, but I am grateful to have that opportunity. As needs to be said, Senator Byrd has been remarkable in his fight for roads and infrastructure, and not just for roads for West Virginia, but also as a fighter for roads for Arkansas and every other state in this country. 
My senior colleague and I--I having been Governor for 8 years, my senior colleague having worked on this problem for many, many years--we are intimately acquainted with the nature of what four-lane highways and federally qualified roads, like route 33 and route 250, can mean. So this is not a minor issue to us. 
I am here on the floor to ask therefore why it is that the Senate still isn't acting on the highway bill. Why is it? I pick up the Record of yesterday. It is not enormously thick. There is not a lot on our calendar. My senior colleague talked about the Senate sitting idly by. We have cast a handful of votes since reconvening. We had one vote today. It may be our last one for the day. We had a couple votes yesterday. They were not votes, Mr. President, that required enormous amounts of debate. We had time laid out for debate, but they were on individual judges about whom people already felt one way or another. 
One has a sense that we are filling time. I don't say that in a partisan way, I say that in just a sort of generally frustrated way. In my 13 years in the U.S. Senate, this feels like the slowest start to a year in which we have so many things that we need to accomplish. 
So the excuse of not moving on the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--an incredible name, I agree, but incredibly important legislation it is--simply escapes me. Why wouldn't we be doing it? 
I can remember when I was Governor working with my senior colleague, Senator Byrd, and Senator Randolph on an amendment in this area to help West Virginia and other states obtain the matching money they needed to apply for. 
The people of my State, the people of all the States where roads are needed and construction needs to be finished, where bridges need to be completed, are facing a cut-off of funds that carries no logic to it, as far as I can understand. If there is a formula problem, and there always is because that is the way we classically operate in the Senate, we should set a deadline to resolve the problem. We need to face up to a real deadline--my senior colleague is making this point, Mr. President--because waiting longer doesn't just put off the day when we even start to try to deal with these and the other outstanding issues. 
But we can resolve those issues. The Senate has resolved far more contentious issues than these. So I don't have any doubt about that. I do have a very strong sense of the damage that failure to act on the highway bill will do to the State that my senior colleague and I represent. It happens to be a State which has almost no flat land. I think about 4 percent of our land is flat. 
I am very familiar with the Presiding Officer's State, because my uncle was Governor of Arkansas and my first cousin now is Lieutenant Governor, as the Presiding Officer and I have discussed. I know the Ozarks are a part of Arkansas. It is very difficult there. There are also lots of mountains. West Virginia is mostly mountains. It is the oldest mountain system in the world. The Appalachian Mountains are the oldest mountains in the world. They have been worn down over the centuries, but they are very formidable and still blanket the greatest part of our State. 
So I would say to my senior colleague, I can remember the last year I was Governor, it cost, for about a mile of interstate or a mile of Appalachian corridor highway, about $17 million to build a mile. That was back in 1984. I have to assume that we are talking now $25 million to $30 million per mile--per mile. 
Completing and upgrading our roads is a terribly urgent situation for West Virginia. We have Corridor H which we have to finish. Some people complain that my senior colleague puts so much emphasis on Corridor H. I would say that we in West Virginia are very grateful that Senator Byrd is doing just that because it is the only way we are going to get this critical road finished. 
If I can just explain the importance of roads like Corridor H and reflect on the urgent need for this ISTEA reauthorization, is to remind people listening that you still really can't get from the east coast into the central part of West Virginia or any part of West Virginia easily. 
You know, trucks are not willing to drive on two-lane highways. We wish that they could, but they do not. And we have a very difficult aviation situation which some of us are also working on very hard. We have an ample amount of rivers and barges, but even there, Senator Byrd and some of my colleagues in the House have to work very, very hard to modernize the lock system, many of which were built, 50, 60, 70 years ago. 
So transportation for us is not what it is, let us say, for some other States which are relatively flat or have very warm climates so that roads last far longer. We not only constantly have to repair our existing roads, but we also have not even completed our basic road system. And that is terribly disadvantageous. 
You can track the economy of West Virginia, how well certain places are doing, and others are not doing, based upon how close they are to a four-lane highway. That is not unique to West Virginia, but it is West Virginia at this moment for which I speak and this Senator speaks. And, therefore, I feel very strongly about this situation. 
Roads supply jobs. Why can't we look at it that way? I can remember when we were building what we call the turnpike in West Virginia, which was meant originally to be a four-lane highway and ended up to be a two-lane highway. How that happened is a mystery which has been shrouded in the history of West Virginia for many years of speculation. But the point is, building that highway involved going through some of the worst, steepest part of the beautiful, gorgeously beautiful southern mountains. And that was an enormous project. I mean, it is not like building roads in many other parts of the country--you have to build huge abutments of towering concrete walls as you cut into the side of mountains. The work involves phenomenal engineering feats. It is like building the Panama Canal to put an Appalachia corridor or interstate in most parts of West Virginia. 
The construction jobs that stem from roads are tremendously important to us. The Nation's unemployment is low. But in West Virginia, our rate is approximately twice the Nation's unemployment. Every job is important to us. There is not a single job in West Virginia that anybody takes for granted. There is not a single job in West Virginia, the potential for a job, that people do not clamor for, try for. 
Toyota recently moved some of their production to West Virginia. And they are going to make half of all of their engines in North America and Canada in West Virginia. They had a need for 300 workers, and they got applications from 25,000 people. What does that tell you? Obviously some were from Ohio, some from Kentucky, some perhaps from Virginia, but we want the work. 
We want the work, we want the roads, and we want the roads so then we can further create the jobs. In fact, to make the point, Toyota would not be in West Virginia if it were not for Interstate 64. They openly declare themselves to locate their plants close to where Interstate 64 is whether it be Kentucky, West Virginia or wherever. 
So the economic need for turning our attention to the ISTEA reauthorization bill is obvious and clear-cut to my constituency. Our States wait to know whether they can go ahead with their infrastructure plans. They watch us approve a couple of judges and work on a couple things. We had a vote on a cloning bill this morning. It wasn't cloning, it was what leads up to cloning. Maybe we will get around to another vote this afternoon; maybe we will not. 
But, good grief, this highway bill has to be done, Mr. President. It has to be done. This is the people's will. We made them a promise with the 6-month extension. And we are not keeping that promise. And there is no reason not to. It is a bill which does good. And again, there may be argument about the formula, but however it comes out, it is going to do every single State an enormous benefit. 
And I have to say one last time that our State will benefit 
enormously from this legislation and needs this legislation to pass. We have not finished our road system. We do not have the prosperity that we deserve in West Virginia for which our people have struggled for a hundred years or more. Coal is diminishing. Only 6 percent of our work force is involved in coal. 
We need to have manufacturing and we need to expand our intellectual and technological activity. We need to have all kinds of things. We cannot rely on coal and steel as much as we used to. 
So I make the point that Corridor H has to be finished. It is absolutely a requirement for the State. Corridor D needs to be finished. As my senior colleague knows better than anybody, that has been nearly finished except for a few miles, but those miles are enormously expensive miles, and they have been languishing now for 2 decades or more. And that is what connects the western part of our State with Ohio and the rest of the Nation. 
West Virginia is enclosed by enormous States: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, and Maryland. People cannot get out or cannot get in unless they can drive out or in or fly out or in. And they cannot fly out or in easily, so they have to drive. You cannot canoe down the Ohio River and up the Little Kanawha. You have to be able to drive. 
So I simply say, in lending my very, very strong support to Senator Byrd's efforts, and as somebody who was a Governor for 8 years and understands the economic significance of our infrastructure, that there is no reason to go on with this uncertainty. There is simply no excuse. I join my senior colleague, and praise him for all he has done in carrying the fight over the years and carrying it almost single-handedly. I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Byrd and join with Senator Dorgan, who was speaking earlier, and others, so that we can get immediate consideration of ISTEA. It is the right thing for the Nation. It will benefit our State and the Presiding Officer's State. And we have no reason at all not to be doing the people's business in this critical area. 
I thank my senior colleague, and I thank the Presiding Officer.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator Frist in introducing legislation to authorize the Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. This bill funds the NGI program, which actually involves six agencies, at $102.5 million for FY99 and $115 million for FY2000. It would also require the Advisory Committee on High Performance Computing and Communication Information Technology and Next Generation Internet to oversee the program and report to the President and the Congress on its activities. 
As everyone in the Senate knows, I have been a long and ardent supporter of the Internet and Internet-related research. In fact, I would point to the current Internet as an example of what the government can do right. When the Internet was started, it was a government funded network for researchers and military personnel. It was expected to grow, but not into the commercially supported network with a $250 billion market base that it is today, and it is still growing. This rate of return on a rather modest government investment is something that any investment banker would love to achieve. An added benefit is that this modest government investment has allowed U.S. industry to become the world leader in most Internet-related markets. 
I also want to commend the Clinton Administration for their steadfast commitment to a clearly needed leadership role in charting the future of the Internet, and yet in also working closely with the affected industries, the academic community, and many others whose contributions to future applications and possibilities are almost endless. I am pleased to now work with Senator Frist, the dedicated chairman of the Senate's Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, to provide a further foundation for this important work through this legislation. 
The current Internet is a victim of its own success. As more and more people come on-line, the network gets more and more crowded. People are beginning to think that the `www' in Internet addresses stands for `world-wide wait' rather than `world-wide web'. Therefore, I fully support the idea of increasing the speed, reliability and usefulness of the Internet. With increases in speed and efficiency of data transfer, hopes of distance learning with real-time video and audio, remote access image libraries, and more use of telemedicine, will become practical realities. In addition, with increases in bandwidth, I am sure that U.S. researchers will come up with new applications that we cannot even think of today. 
Do not think that it is a coincidence that all the applications I just listed have to do with remote access to data. The ability to give those that do not have easy physical access quick and reliable electronic access to resources is, I feel, one of the Internet's greatest benefits to society. As history has shown us, it would be extremely easy for a situation to arise in which there are states with NGI capabilities and states without, if there is not balanced representation in the decision-making process. Due to the increased computing power and ability to collaborate with other NGI network institutions, NGI states could have a large advantage over non-NGI states when applying for grants and participation. With this in mind, I am glad to point out that this bill formally addresses geographic concerns for rural institutions and users. 
As I stated earlier, I have always been a firm supporter of the Internet, and will continue to support research in this area. This bill authorizes an innovative inter-agency program to increase the speed, reliability and usefulness of the Internet. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I secondly thank my colleague from West Virginia. I wish the Presiding Officer a happy new year as we start off on what I think, based upon what we heard last night, ought to be a very optimistic and productive year. I thought it was really quite an extraordinary speech. 
Even at the time there seemed to be so much in it that we could do that I worried, was it too much? And I came to the conclusion, no, it was all perfectly sensible--not all of it huge, some of it incremental, some of it large and challenging--all of it doable, and I think that is our challenge. 
I think our country ought to be very happy about the fact that we have a balanced budget. It really was extraordinary, $357 billion down to $10 billion. We will present a balanced budget to the President for the first time in 30 years. That is an extraordinary accomplishment. We all share in that. The Democrats probably get the lion's share of the credit for the 1993 part, but the Republicans and Democrats did it together last year and, therefore, sealed what is a remarkable accomplishment in being fiscally prudent--and I think surprising, in a good way, the American people. I think that is probably a good thing because the markets rallied by our action. The markets are now troubled because of what is happening in Asia, and our President last night held out challenges to us on that matter, too, very boldly and I thought very correctly. 
The point is we really have to go forward. We have, according to whoever you listen to, somewhere between 70 days and 100 days in which to enact legislative affairs. I haven't counted it up. I don't know exactly how that works, but I will take their word for it. In any event, there is really not much time, which means we have to reach across the aisle. The Presiding Officer and I often don't agree on subjects. On the other hand, we agreed on something of monumental importance when it came to the adoption bill at the end of the last session, and that is the way things get done around here, and that is the way things ought to get done around here. Republicans can't succeed without Democrats. Democrats, obviously in the minority, cannot succeed without Republicans. Yet we often succeed and do ourselves proud here, and I feel very comfortable in saying that. 
I think the President made very clear that parents want their children to have the best kind of education. He put a program on the line. It is not an extravagant program. It is a sensible program. On our side, we have been grumbling about crumbling schools for quite a long time, and now I think we have a chance to do something about that. The President put forward some money for that. 
I think workers have reason to feel--workers of all ages--have good reason to feel good about last night because I think the President is very concerned particularly about those between 55 and 65 years old who don't have health insurance. We have all watched the phenomenon as American companies, reacting to principles that I'm not prepared to argue with, which I regret I am not prepared to argue with, as they decrease coverage, as coverage becomes more expensive or they decrease coverage, perhaps, of the dependents of the worker, even if they hold on to the coverage for their worker, and often it is the coverage of the worker's children that is really the matter most at stake. I think he wants that to be solved. He wants people to be able to buy into the Medicare Program between 55 and 65. 
Interestingly enough, that is a group which has an enormous amount of dependency on health care because right now 15 percent of those older Americans are completely uninsured. So that is the time in life when things begin to get more difficult in terms of health, and the President understands that and reacted to that. 
I really did like, Mr. President, what he talked about in health care. I liked the idea of pushing us further than we have been on children's health care. We did a very good job last year on a bipartisan basis, and that is exactly what it was. I remember the Finance Committee meetings. They were an absolute model, Senator Byrd, of bipartisan cooperation. All staff, everybody left the room, and then there were just the 20 Senators--11 Republicans, 9 Democrats--facing each other. And rather rapidly, perhaps because there was no glare, an enormous amount of cooperation just exploded in that cooperation, and all of a sudden we had the children's health care bill which is being put to good use. Fifteen States have already asked Donna Shalala for a waiver to be able to proceed. West Virginia has not at this point concluded what it will do. Governor Underwood presented a good program to the State legislature. The State legislature is going to come back with a good program. There will be a compromise reached. The legislature is Democratic. The Governor is Republican. They both want the same thing. They both want to see children insured. So does the President, and he wanted to see more of that. 
I will express a concern to the Presiding Officer that a large number of those 5 million children that we included in our bill last year are children who are already eligible for Medicaid but simply don't know it because their families are detached from the system, because somehow through the school lunch program they just have not found out they are eligible, they don't want to fill out the paper forms, or they are afraid. That is a phenomenon that one finds in the hills and hollows of various parts of this country. I worry a great deal about being able to get out to those children. In the case of West Virginia there are some 30,000 children who are already eligible for Medicaid. But the President was challenging us to do that and to do more, and well he should because there are 10 million uninsured children in this country. No other industrial nation on Earth has to go through the pain of saying that. He pushes us forward. 
I think he cares very much, as I indicated, about the workers in the 55- to 65-year-old range. They worry about their future. The baby boomers, the younger generation, wonder whether there will be Social Security and Medicare for them, and 
they have reason to worry. I think the President, therefore, said, look, let's take the money which is going into a surplus, should there be one, and put that into Social Security. He said, `Social Security first.' That is strong stuff. I think the American people really identify with that. That means that, no, there cannot be some of the tax cuts which some on both sides of the aisle may want to see, some of which may be very useful. But in a sense he was saying we can't have it all. We have to make priorities. Social Security comes first. 
There is also, as the Presiding Officer knows, a commission on Medicare which I am very proud to serve on. That is a huge problem that we will have to solve. Last year we bought ourselves about 10 years, but let's face it, in the buying of those 10 years we took some of the pressure off, the decision that we will have to make in the next 2 years, and we cannot allow that to happen. 
The Social Security Commission of 1983 succeeded because Social Security was in the act of collapsing and the commission knew it and therefore they acted. The commission on Medicare, which affects so many in our country, is not going to be faced with that kind of immediate pressure so we will have to bring it on through our own energies, our own intellectual and moral commitments, and I believe we will be able to do that. 
The other thing that the President said among many that I liked very much was the whole concept of people dealing for the first time with managed care. He pointed out the enormous number of Americans that are in managed care now and he wants to see basic rights for people that have that available to them. I think he is quite right. We will see, as we have before, insurance companies and their lobbyists talking about mandates and big Government and all kind of things like that, but I don't sign on to that. I think the President is right, that confidentiality ought to be a right, and managed care patients ought to be able to see a specialist. Just because it is the cheapest doesn't mean it is the best. Patients should not be herded into something because it is cheap. It ought to be as cheap as possible, but it has to be very, very good. 
All in all, I thought the President had a lot to say. I thought he said it with eloquence. I thought he said it with strength. I thought he said it with a very, very strong vision. Health care is hard. No. 1, it is hard just as a subject, but it tends to automatically send people scurrying one direction or another direction. People either say too big Government or people say that is not enough. Somehow we have to find in this Chamber a way of understanding that the world's greatest economy can afford, even if it is on an incremental basis, that all of our citizens be insured. We really can do that and we can work together to do that. 
There has been marvelous cooperation--Senator Chafee and myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch--on children's health last year. There have been so many examples of that over the recent years. I think part of the lesson that he preached last night was, `Let's do this together.' It wasn't just `I, a Democratic President of the United States.' It is `we,' representing all of us, representing Republicans and Democrats all across this country. 
I am ready to fight for a good solution for Medicare. I want to see parents satisfied that their children are getting the best education. I want to see baby boomers have a sense of security about Social Security in the future because we dedicate surpluses to that area, and I also want to see retired workers who are either kicked out of jobs or retired from jobs during the vulnerable period of their older lives, 55 to 65, to have a basic sense of being able to buy into Medicare. I think that is sound health care policy and I congratulate the President on doing that. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) has been added as a cosponsor to S. 1293, the Child Support Performance Improvement Act. Senator Snowe and I introduced this legislation last year to call for critical ways to strengthen child support enforcement, including an effort to address the critical need for medical support among children with absent parents. 
It is an honor to have Senator Kerry, a long-time child advocate and leader, join Senator Snowe and me in our effort to promote effective and efficient child support enforcement. Senator Kerry's commitment to this issue is well known, and he has been aggressive pushing for action through previous legislation. 
Today, we are joining forces to promote our bill, S. 1293, and to work together on a new initiative to resolve the lingering barriers that prevent enforcement of medical child support, a crucial aspect of support and stability for children and families. Senator Kerry's special commitment to medical support is clear. Working with him and other colleagues, we want to eliminate the barriers which hinder state agencies from effectively implementing the 1984 federal law that requires states to petition for medical child support, if it is available from non-custodial parents. Our law says children should not be discriminated against in health care coverage in cases of divorce, but we need to work together to ensure that this obvious principle works in practice. Public health coverage, through Medicaid or the new children's health initiative, should not be a substitute for private insurance from parents when such insurance is available. We hope to ensure that children get coverage they need and deserve. 
To achieve our goals, we want to work with congressional colleagues, child advocates, state leaders, interested business groups and the Administration to ensure that we forge consensus on ways to tear down existing barriers to health care coverage that is fair and streamlined. 
The technical nature of this issue is complicated. But the reality for children and families is clear--medical coverage means that parents have the peace of mind that their children can obtain the health care that is so vital for a healthy, successful childhood. I welcome Senator Kerry's support and urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. Unfortunately, there are many provisions and new investments that Members wanted to include. But we are running out of time in this session, and securing new funding and appropriate revenue offsets is an overwhelming challenge. I appreciate the concerns the Senator has raised and would like to work with him in the future. As my colleagues know, Indian children are covered under a special law, known as the Indian Child 
Welfare Act. We should work together to ensure that this law and other Federal programs for abused and neglected children are better coordinated. 
Let me assure my colleagues, though, that this package will help Indian children. Within the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children, the PASS Act, is a provision to extend the 1993 law to provide funding for family preservation and family support for 3 additional years. This program is designed to support community-based programs to help innovative projects invest in prevention and programs to strengthen families. Within the existing law is a 1-percent set aside for the tribes. This will be extended 3 more years, and I hope this funding will enable the tribes to continue ongoing efforts to help Indian children.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to express my enormous delight that Judge William P. Greene, Jr., was recently confirmed for the position of associate judge for the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. Judge Greene brings to this job a lifetime of experience in the armed services and the law, and I believe President Clinton made an excellent choice in nominating him for this position. 
Bill is extremely qualified to serve on the court. After graduating from Howard University School of Law in 1968, he joined the U.S. Army, where he proudly served for 25 years. Bill was an officer in the U.S. Army Judge Advocates Group Corps, and earned the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, and Army Commendation Medal more than once. 
Since 1993, Bill has served as an immigration judge for the Department of Justice in Baltimore. His leadership skills and ability to make clear, decisive, and just decisions have been well tried--and well proven. 
In addition to his many other fine attributes, Bill has another that makes me especially proud of him--he is a native West Virginian. Bill was born in Bluefield, WV, and lived there until he was 10. He grew up in a military family and although they moved around to many different places, Bill always considered West Virginia home, and returned to West Virginia to attend West Virginia State College. 
Bill's father was a veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, and was awarded the Silver Star for valor. So it is no surprise to me that Bill possesses an enormous sense of patriotism and pride in his country. The learning experience of growing up in a military family, combined with the experience of his own military career, will be enormously helpful to him in the job that lies ahead. 
Everyone who has worked with me on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs knows that I have long been a supporter of the court, so you can be sure that the quality of those who serve there is important to me. I am confident that Judge Greene will bring to the court the wisdom, judgment, and sensitivity so necessary for the court's vital work. In doing so, he will serve both our country and his fellow veterans well.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud and pleased to be part of the successful effort to pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Having worked to achieve the objectives of this bill for many years, I am very grateful to everyone involved in reaching today's result--the final passage of a significant bill that will help children and families in true need across the country for many years to come. 
This legislation is the culmination of extensive bipartisan negotiations between the House and Senate over the course of this year to enact the most effective ways to ensure the health, safety, and stability of America's most vulnerable population: abused and neglected children. The product of intense debate and sometimes difficult concessions on all sides, this bill has emerged as a positive first step in fixing our Nation's broken child welfare system. At the same time this process has demonstrated the undeniable benefits of bipartisan cooperation and compromise, it has also highlighted the mountain of work still left to be done on behalf of abused and neglected children. In that regard, I hope the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will be a cornerstone for future efforts on behalf of abused and neglected children, especially those children whose special needs present formidable barriers to their safe adoptive placement. 
The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 is most significant in its focus on moving children out of foster care and into adoptive and other positive, permanent placements. If American child welfare policy does not succeed in providing a real sense of belonging and identity to children living in the foster care system, we will be denying these young people the fundamental supports they need to become satisfied and caring adults. It would be a tragedy to write these children off as a lost generation, just another group of children from broken homes and a broken system who just didn't get enough support to make a difference. 
In my role as chairman of the National Commission on Children, I had the unique opportunity to travel across the country and speak with hundreds of children, parents, and caregivers about how to effectively address their most basic needs and about how the Government can help to foster their most fundamental aspirations. Because of that commission, I spent a day in LA juvenile court and saw the system at its worst, overwhelmed and ineffectively serving children. But I also met a dedicated advocate, Nancy Daly, and she introduced me to the Independent Living Program and other efforts that can work to serve children. We've stayed in touch, working on these issues together ever since. 
At the heart of the recent debate about the best policy for adoption and child welfare, dozens of complex questions have been raised about how Federal taxpayer dollars should be spent and who is worthy of receiving them. As we struggle with these difficult issues, which often pit 
social against fiscal responsibility, I keep returning to the same fundamental lesson I have learned from the families with whom I have spoken over the years: If we cannot build social policy that effectively protects our children, we have failed to do our job as a government and a society. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends and colleagues, John Chafee and Larry Craig for their unflagging leadership in bringing the legislation this far. My partnership with Senator Chafee on children's issues is one of the most fulfilling aspects of my legislative work, and I thank him for his leadership. Senator Craig also provided tremendous help and fortitude in achieving the final consensus and action needed to produce results. There have been a series of premature reports about the collapse of negotiations. Without their efforts and the rest of our bipartisan coalition, the naysayers might have triumphed over the needs of almost a half a million children in foster care. 
I would also like to share my sincere appreciation with the other Members of the Senate adoption working group who have worked so hard to create a solid bipartisan package: Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, Bond, Landrieu, Levin, Moynihan, Kerrey, and Dorgan. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Finance chairman, Senator Roth, who has made it possible for the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to become a reality. 
I also want to pay special tribute to the First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, for her longstanding and intense dedication to the goals pursued in this legislation. She has told me of the public's deep concern for children who are barred from becoming part of permanent, loving families. Her interest and encouragement have been invaluable to me and to others involved in this effort, and I know she will help ensure the administration's commitment to turning this new law into reality. 
The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will fundamentally shift the focus of the foster care system by insisting that health and safety should be the paramount considerations when a State makes any decision concerning the well-being of an abused and neglected child. This legislation is designed to move children out of foster care and into adoptive and other permanent homes more quickly and more safely than ever before. For the first time, this legislation requires States to use reasonable efforts to move eligible foster children toward adoption by introducing a new fast-track provision for children who have been subjected to severe abuse and other crimes by their parents. In such severe cases, this bill would require that a permanency hearing be held within 30 days. In the case of an abandoned infant where reasonable efforts have been waived to reunite the family, that child could be moved into a safe and permanent home in a month's time. 
While this legislation appropriately preserves current Federal requirements to reunify families when that is best for the child, it does not require the States to use reasonable efforts to reunify families that have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, physical abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. In cases where children should not be reunited with 
their biological families, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 requires that the States use the same reasonable efforts to move children toward adoption or another permanent placement consistent with a well thought-out and well-mentioned permanency plan. 
In addition, the act encourages adoptions by rewarding States that increase adoptions with bonuses for foster care and special-needs children who are placed in adoptive homes. Most significantly, the legislation takes the essential first step of ensuring ongoing health coverage for all special-needs children who are adopted. Without this essential health coverage, many families who want to adopt children with a range of physical and mental health issues, would be unable to do so. I am delighted to see that medical coverage, which has always been a vital part of any program that substantively helps children, is also a key component of this bipartisan package. 
Ensuring safety for abused and neglected children is another significant goal of this legislation. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 seeks to accomplish this goal by ensuring that the safety of the child is considered at every stage of the child's case plan and review process. Moreover, the bill requires criminal background checks for all potential foster and adoptive parents. 
The legislation also substantially cuts the time a child must wait to be legally available for adoption into a permanent home by requiring States to file a petition for termination of parental rights for a child who has been waiting too long in a foster care placement. At the same time that it speeds adoptions where appropriate, it also gives States the discretion to choose not to initiate legal proceedings when a child is safely placed with a relative, where there is a compelling reason not to go forward, or where appropriate services have not been provided in accordance with the child's permanency plan. 
At the same time that this bill imposes tough but effective measures to decrease a child's unnecessary wait in foster care, it reauthorizes and provides $60 million in increased funding for community-based family support and court improvements over the next 3 years, collectively referred to as the `Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program.' As part of a balanced bipartisan package, these programs will support a range of fundamental State services to help children and families and to provide necessary services to adoptive families. This legislation also takes care to assure that children who have gone through adoptions that have been disrupted or whose adoptive parents die will remain eligible for Federal support. 
For West Virginia, and every State, this legislation means positive change. Our State currently has about 3,000 children in foster care. Under this new legislation, the emphasis will shift the primary focus to their health and safety and to finding them a stable, permanent home. Throughout these debates, I have listened to West Virginia leaders, including Chief Justice Margaret Workman, who testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and Joan Ohl, our West Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources. I have visited agencies in my State that provide the full range of services from family supports to adoption, and I have been in touch with social workers and families. I know that the provisions of this legislation will challenge my State, but I am equally confident that its leaders are ready to make the necessary changes to do more for the thousands of children in West Virginia who are depending upon us. 
I am pleased to have been a part of this tremendous effort on behalf of abused and neglected children, and am hopeful that the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will bring about real and positive improvements in the lives of the half a million American children living in foster care.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate is considering S. 714, as amended, a bill that would make valuable changes to a number of veterans benefits and services. In the waning days of this session, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees were able to reach compromise on a wide range of programs and services for veterans--from programs to assist homeless veterans, to providing home loans to Native American veterans, and I urge my colleagues to give their unanimous support to this measure. It is particularly fitting that we make these improvements for veterans programs now, since tomorrow is Veterans Day. 
Mr. President, because all the provisions of this measure--which I will refer to as the compromise agreement--are set forth in the joint explanatory statement which Senator Specter will place in the Record, I will discuss here only some of the issues which are of particular interest to me. The explanatory statement was developed in cooperation with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and that committee's chairman, Bob Stump, will insert the same explanatory statement in the Record when the House considers this measure.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there has been a lot of debate on the floor over the last several days about fast-track authority, and a lot of it has run against my grain. I don't think it has been at a very high level. What I would like to do is respond to a few of the main arguments that have been used against it that I have heard from some of my colleagues about both the nature of fast-track authority and the need for fast-track authority. 
Before I begin I would like to say that West Virginia's economy depends and will continue to depend enormously on strong growth in its exports. So any vote which is taken which does not support the proposition of promoting exports from West Virginia is one that I would question. Indeed, the U.S. economy is moving very strongly forward. I don't believe myself that the growth will continue in West Virginia as strongly as it might have if fast track does not pass this Congress, if we do not give that authority to the President. West Virginia had $1.3 billion in exports in 1996. That's about a 35-percent increase in exports since 1992. That is quite remarkable. West Virginia's specific exports to Japan, which is our second-largest export market, went up 128 percent in 3 years. Just think about that, Mr. President--a 128 percent in 3 years; increasing exports increases West Virginia--and that dramatic increase has been with just one country--Japan. And, in fact, that means West Virginia exports to Japan totaled about $116 million in 1996, which is not a lot in some States, but it is a lot in West Virginia. U.S. exports increased by $125 billion last year alone--a lot of this because of trade arrangements. 
One thing is undeniably true--denying the President fast-track authority will not create a single new job in West Virginia. Nobody can make that argument with a straight face. It won't save a single job either to deny the President fast-track authority. It will only hamper our ability to sell goods to new markets, which is what this is about, and hurt the growth of a critical sector of our economy, and one that I have personally been working on very hard over the last 10 to 15 years. 
I think most of the arguments about the revolutionary provisions of fast track are highly overstated, and highly dramatized. Fast-track authority isn't anything new. And, because it is a procedural mechanism, I don't think there is anything to be feared about it. I recognize that others don't think so. Some have good arguments. Most have rather poor arguments, I think. Fast track is a mechanism simply that helps the United States keep up with the changing world economy and deal with our trading partners in 21st century management. 
So, let me take a moment to respond to a few of the persistent arguments which are used against fast track. These are just a few of them. 
Is there sufficient congressional consultation accompanying fast-track authority: Very big contentious deal. Right? We are ceding all of our authority to the President of the United States. We will no longer be a Senate. We will just be a tool of the Presidency. 
That is ridiculous. Congressional consultation is required in order for the administration to have and to retain fast-track authority and it has been significantly strengthened, I would say powerfully strengthened, from what was required under the legislation granting the last fast-track authority in 1988. New requirements for the administration are imposed under this bill which the House, and some Democrats in particular, don't seem to have the guts to be able to vote for it. It has all been passed through the Senate Finance Committee in order to ensure the administration carefully coordinates and consults with Congress at every stage of the process. Listen to me on this. 
The 1988 act required that the President provide written notice to the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee of bilateral trade agreements at least 60 days before providing notice to the Senate and the House of his intention to enter into an agreement--and, remember, this is the last fast-track authority--and to consult the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee regarding the negotiations. 
The bill that we passed out of the Senate Finance Committee and which the Senate has voted by a vote of 69 to 31 to take up, the President to provide written notice to the Congress as a whole of his intention to begin multilateral and bilateral negotiations at least 90 days in advance. 
That notice, Mr. President, must specify the date the President intends to begin such negotiations, the specific objectives of the negotiations, and whether the President intends to negotiate a new agreement, or, on the other hand, to modify an old or existing agreement. Any failure of the President to provide notice can result in the introduction and consideration of a `procedural disapproval resolution' which would deny fast track for the trade agreement, if the resolution were approved. 
This bill also requires the President to consult with the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, and with other committees, before and after providing the notice of his intention to begin negotiations. 
Already we are in advance of where we were in 1988. 
The President must consult with all other committees that have any jurisdiction or participation in this matter that request consultations if a committee wants to be consulted. If it wants to be consulted, it can request consultation, and the President must consult with them in writing. 
In addition, the Senate Finance Committee's fast-track bill requires the President to consult with the private sector advisory committees established under the 1974 Trade Act, as the President deems it appropriate, before beginning negotiations. This consultation takes place before the trade negotiations have even begun. 
Before the President is permitted to enter into a trade agreement, the President must consult with the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as other committees of jurisdiction over legislation involving subjects that would be affected by the trade agreement, in addition to the consultation requirements of the 1988 act, which includes discussions about the nature of the agreement and a detailed assessment of how the agreement meets the objectives and purposes of the act. 
Now the Senate Finance Committee bill requires the President to consult the Congress on all matters related to the implementation of the agreement. 
Free trade agreement negotiations must include an overview of the macroeconomic environment of the countries with which the President intends to negotiate and a discussion of effects on exchange rates--on exchange rates. It is a good idea included in response to concerns raised by certain Members--and it is in the fast-track authority. 
These consultations must be continuous as negotiations of the trade bill are continuous. What additional requirements for consultation do the opponents of this want? Another new 
consultation requirement was added in response to Senate Members' concerns about side agreements that were entered into during previous free trade agreements, like NAFTA and the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The new requirement mandates the President consult with respect to any other agreement he has entered into, or intends to enter into with the countries party to the agreement. 
This would include all kinds of agreements: Formal side agreements, exchange of letters, and any preagreed interpretations of the provisions of a trade agreement entered into in conjunction with a trade agreement. 
Advisory committee reports are required. 
What provision of the extensive consultation requirements am I on? No. 7, No. 8? I have no idea what number I am on of all these new provisions which give strength to the congressional role in forging trade agreements. 
Advisory committee reports are required to be submitted not more than 30 days after the President notifies Congress of his intention to enter into a trade agreement. 
I know going through this amount of detail sounds arcane. But I just want to in a sense ridicule the arguments that are being used that somehow we are ceding all power to the President. Is it the U.S. Senate which is important in this, or is it jobs for workers in West Virginia and across the country which are important in this? What comes first here? 
Further, the Senate Finance Committee fast-track bill requires the USTR to consult regularly, promptly, and closely with congressional advisors for trade policies and negotiations, and with the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committee whole membership, and to keep both the advisors and the committees fully informed every step of the way through the negotiations process. 
Ambassador Barshefsky is over there doing negotiating, which is really done in secrecy--most of it. 
No. 9. We have to be consulted on the progress of the negotiations of any trade agreement eligible for fast track so the Congress can evaluate the negotiations at each stage virtually at each hour. 
I do not know what more Members might require in the form of consultation. 
Because negotiations traditionally become most intense at the conclusion of the negotiation process, the Senate Finance Committee further expects that the USTR will enter into a formal agreement in the form of procedures similar to those agreed by the executive branch in 1975 that will ensure that congressional advice and committee advice will be able to be fully taken into account as in the past. 
Again, this next provision must be the tenth or eleventh requirement for consultation---- 
As a condition of fast track authority, the U.S. Trade Representative will commit to a set of procedures that afford Members and cleared staff--not just Members but cleared staff--with necessary documents, classified, or unclassified. They will have access to things such as cables, statements of executive branch position, and formal submission from other countries. The USTR staff will work with the Senate Finance Committee to set up a system of briefings for Members during these negotiations, and appropriate staff to be included in the final rounds of the trade negotiation agreement. 
And the President is required to notify Congress before initialing a trade agreement which might even be eligible for fast-track authority. He can't even put his initials on it before he consults with Congress. Once the agreement is initialed by the President, the President then has 60 days to provide the Congress with any and all changes required to U.S. law to implement the agreement. 
Well, I have another two pages on that, all of them, Mr. President, simply showing that the Senate has adequate consultation--the question is how much negotiating room the President has with all these consultation requirements. No problem with the Senate. 
Now, some people make this argument. Some argue fast-track authority is not needed to move trade agreements. It is absolutely true that there have been hundreds of trade-related agreements and declarations which the U.S. Trade Office has concluded during this administration. From January 1993 to just last month that has been the case. 
But, let me give my colleagues some examples of these many trade deals that the opponents of this bill point to to suggest that trade agreements continue to be made and that fast-track authority is not really necessary; in other words, you don't have fast track authority to have trade agreements. Well, a lot of these agreements which have been agreed to and negotiated are very peripheral in nature. One, a bilateral investment treaty with Albania. Great. And then an agreement regarding processed chicken quotas with Canada. A memorandum of understanding on trade in bananas with Costa Rica. Wonderful. A trade and intellectual property rights agreement with Estonia. Historic. An agreement on a temporary waiver of Hungary's WTO export subsidy schedule. Wow. Harmonized chemical tariffs with Japan. All right, that's good. An agreement on trade in textiles and textile products with Lesotho. Wonderful. And it goes on and on and on. 
I hope that my colleagues will agree that as important as having bilateral agreements with any given country may be--and some of the examples I listed have, in fact, real economic impact; they have real impact on important industries in my State and other States--not many of these agreements are major trade deals. That is my point. In fact, very few are major trade agreements in the sense they are not opening up new markets. 
Here rests my argument. What we are talking about is opening up new markets. What the opponents are talking about is totally removed and off base. 
I do not mean to say that negotiating with individual countries and establishing bilateral agreements isn't a very important part of improving the trade environment. These individual product or industry-specific agreements with different countries do help improve U.S. trade. I have no doubt about that at all. But they do not make significant expansions in our export markets that America and West Virginia need desperately in order to improve. 
Ensuring that U.S. goods and services can be available on a level playing field to the 96 percent of consumers in this world who are not Americans happens to be very important. Trade agreements make sure that we have access to new markets under reasonable conditions. In our increasingly global world, that means we have to have multilateral agreements like GATT and the Uruguay round, and free trade agreements with areas like Latin America and Asia are needed. Why? Because they are growing enormously, and their middle class is growing and their ability to purchase goods is growing. 
An up-or-down vote on a multilateral trade agreement makes sense to me because it how we expand our markets. As the U.S. Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, told the Finance Committee, in the two fastest growing regions of the world, Latin America and Asia, governments are seeking preferential trade agreements. `They are forming relationships around us, rather than with us, and they are creating new exclusive trade alliances to the detriment of U.S. interests.' 
Then Ambassador Barshefsky goes on to say, `In Latin America and Asia alone over 20 such agreements have been negotiated since 1992, all of them without us.' 
Well, I can't imagine that doesn't bother the opponents of fast track. I care about the effect of trade on jobs in my State. And there is plenty of protection for the Senate and the Congress in this fast-track authority. You cannot negotiate a trade deal with 100 Members of the Senate and a foreign country or set of countries. It cannot be done. Fast track makes sense. 
Can you imagine people coming in and saying, well, we have to. 
What are other countries doing on trade agreements while the U.S. debates fast track? Where is the United States at a disadvantage if we don't pass fast track, as they may not in the House? Again, primarily due mostly to my own party. 
I have talked about the fact that major markets are negotiating trade agreements and the United States is not in the picture. Let's just look at the major world markets: 
No. 1, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay have formed a common market called MERCOSUR. MERCOSUR has a GDP of about a $1 trillion and includes a population of 200 million people. It wants to expand its market to the rest of South America. The sheer numbers of people and dollars in this market makes it the largest economy in Latin America. MERCOSUR has agreements with Chile and Bolivia, and is talking with Colombia and Venezuela, in addition to Caribbean nations. The EU and MERCOSUR plan to complete a reciprocal agreement by 1999. We are on the outside of all that. 
No. 2, Latin American nations are meeting with members of the Central American Common Market [CARICOM] to discuss free trade negotiations. 
No. 3, Chile, with one of South America's leading economies has already signed agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Granada, Venezuela, and MERCOSUR countries. That means Chile has a preferential trading relationship with every major trading country in our hemisphere except the United States. How do the opponents of fast track feel about that? 
There are seven members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation [SARC]--Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and Maldives--they have set 2001 as the date they would like to create a free-trade area. Right now, SARC is only 1 percent of world trade, but it has 20 percent of the world's population which means this is another important market to the United States in the future. 
I talked about Latin America earlier and want to underscore why that market is so important to our trading future. Projections are that Latin America will exceed Western Europe and Japan combined as an export market for the United States in the next decade--and that's under current conditions where tariff barriers average three to four times the average United States tariff. Put simply, Latin America is one of the largest emerging markets, of the 30 million people who join the middle class annually, three-fourths of those 309 million people are currently in emerging markets and low- and middle-income markets. 
I am almost at an end. The Asian Pacific Rim is our second fastest growing export market. Meanwhile, our industrial competitors continue to make agreements that put U.S. goods at a disadvantage. Canada has a new trade agreement with Chile. The EU is in a position to take better advantage of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe. The EU is also working on getting a free-trade agreement with MERCOSUR. 
China is zeroing in on Latin America and Japan is working on its ties to Asia and Latin America through closer commercial ties and a greater commercial presence. 
Mr. President, I simply make these remarks because I think it will be such high and deep folly if the House declines to vote on--or if voting, votes down--fast-track authority. I think some of the arguments made in this body have made it easier for Members of the House to say, `Look what so-and-so said in the U.S. Senate.' 
It is a question: Do we want to expand trade? Or do we want to just keep all inside of ourselves? This has been an age-old problem with the United States. We cycle back and forth from one view to another. This is the time to cycle for an expansionist trade point of view.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate is considering S. 714, as amended, a bill that would make valuable changes to a number of veterans benefits and services. In the waning days of this session, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees were able to reach compromise on a wide range of programs and services for veterans--from programs to assist homeless veterans, to providing home loans to Native American veterans, and I urge my colleagues to give their unanimous support to this measure. It is particularly fitting that we make these improvements for veterans programs now, as Veterans Day is just a few days away. 
Mr. President, because all the provisions of this measure--which I will refer to as the `compromise agreement'--are set forth in the joint explanatory statement which Senator Specter will place in the Record, I will discuss here only some of the issues which are of particular interest to me. The explanatory statement was developed in cooperation with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and that Committee's Chairman, Bob Stump, will insert the same explanatory statement in the Record when the House considers this measure.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, at least half a million American children are living in this country's foster care system--a system that was never designed and never intended to provide a permanent home for children who have been abused and neglected by their parents. Tragically, many of these children could be adopted, but are forced to wait to become a part of a new family because the current child welfare system has become tired and broken. Most vulnerable among this already fragile population are those children with special needs--children who, without help and strong governmental support, will never have the opportunity to become a part of an adoptive family. 
Acknowledging our collective obligation to let no child fall through the cracks of the system--especially those facing severe emotional, physical, and other circumstantial limitations--I am pleased to have the opportunity to lend my vote and full support to the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] Act. This legislation, the produce of a series of hard-fought and sometimes painful compromises, represents a positive first step in a long journey of essential work to be done on behalf of abused and neglected children. 
While many of us properly acknowledge that the journey is by no means over, we would not have been able to come this far had it not been for the unflagging leadership of my good friends and colleagues Senators John Chafee and Larry Craig. They are the reason that this unique bipartisan coalition has been able to bring this bill forward. I would also like to express my special thanks to the other hard-working members of the Senate adoption working group who have made this first step possible: Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, Bond, Landrieu, Levin, Moynihan, Kerrey, and Dorgan. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of Senator Roth who has made it possible for this legislation to be fairly considered here today. 
The PASS Act will fundamentally and positively shift the focus of the current foster care system by insisting, for the first time in Federal law, that a child's health and safety and the opportunity to find a loving, permanent home, should be the paramount considerations when a State child welfare agency makes any decision regarding the well-being of an abused and neglected child. The main objective of this bill is to move abused and neglected kids into adoptive or other permanent homes and to do so more quickly and more safely than ever before. 
While PASS appropriately preserves current Federal requirements to reunify families when that is best for the child and family, it does not require the States to use `reasonable efforts' to reunify families that have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, physical abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. Thanks to Chairman Roth, the legislation includes a new fast track provision for such children in cases of severe abuse. Under the new provision, when reasonable efforts are not appropriate, a permanency planning hearing would be held within 30 days. In practice, this change could yield tremendous results. For example, in the case of an abandoned infant where reasonable efforts are waived, a permanency hearing would be scheduled within the month, and that child could be moved swiftly into a safe and permanent home. To provide balance, the PASS Act requires that the States use the same `reasonable efforts' to move children towards adoption or another permanent placement consistent with a well-thought out and well-monitored plan. 
In addition, PASS encourages adoptions by rewarding States that increase adoptions with bonuses for foster care and special needs children who are placed in adoptive homes. Most significantly, the legislation takes the essential first step of ensuring ongoing health coverage for all special needs children who are adopted. Without this essential health coverage, many families who want to adopt children with a range of physical and mental health issues would be unable to do so. I am happy to see that medical coverage, which has always been a vital cornerstone of any program that substantively helps children, is also a key component of this bipartisan package. 
Ensuring safety for abused and neglected children is another significant goal of this legislation. PASS seeks to accomplish this goal by ensuring that the `safety of the child' is considered at every stage of the child's case plan and review process. Moreover, the bill requires criminal background checks for all potential foster and adoptive parents and other adults living in the same household. 
PASS also cuts by one-third the time a child must wait to be legally available for adoption into a permanent home by requiring States to file a petition for termination of parental rights for a child who has been waiting too long in a foster care placement. At the same time that it speeds adoptions where appropriate, it also gives States the discretion to choose not to initiate legal proceedings when a child is safely placed with a relative, where necessary services have not been provided to the family, or where the State documents a compelling reason not go forward. 
At the same time that this bill imposes tough but effective measures to decrease a child's unnecessary wait in foster care, PASS continues investments in strengthening families at the community level by reauthorizing the 1993 budget provision for family preservation and family support for 3 years, with an extra $60 million in funding. This is an innovative prevention program, and this bill's new language encourages States to ensure that adoptive families are also served by the program. As part of a balanced bipartisan package, these programs will support a range of fundamental State services to help parents, children, adoptive families and to improve the court system. This legislation also takes care to assure that children who have gone through adoptions that have been disrupted or whose adoptive parents die will remain eligible for Federal support. 
PASS provides a strong foundation for the work that is yet to be done on behalf of abused and neglected children. Years ago, as chairman of the National Commission on Children, I was proud to issue a bold, bipartisan report called Beyond Rhetoric. This report included bold recommendations to reform our current, inadequate system to help abused and neglected children. I am committed to the agenda laid out in this plan and will keep working until we achieve all of its goals for children and families. 
The PASS Act is a bold step forward. It has been extremely rewarding to forge such a strong bipartisan consensus to promote adoption and to take key steps in helping every child find a safe, stable, and permanent home.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in order to recognize Stone & Thomas, an outstanding business, for its continuous service to its customers and to the State of West Virginia. Stone & Thomas has been known for its commitment to customer service since 1847. That is 16 years longer than West Virginia has been a State. 
This year, Stone & Thomas celebrated 150 years in business, and its longevity is a testament to the quality of service and merchandise which they are committed to. 
Mr. President, since its founding in 1847 by Jacob Thomas and Elijah Stone, this remarkable business has been owned and operated by five generations of the same family. Currently, Stone & Thomas is run by W.S. Jones, the president, chief executive officer and the great-great-grandson of Elijah Stone. Mr. Jones, like the four generations before him, has continued the creed of outstanding service which Mr. Stone and Mr. Thomas pledged themselves to. Furthermore, Mr. Jones, like those before him, has continued to improve and expand upon an already exceptional business. 
All told, Stone & Thomas has employed, and continues to employ, thousands of citizens of West Virginia. They are presently responsible for over 1,500 jobs in my State, as well as several hundred jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia. And just this week, Mr. President, they celebrated the opening of another customer-friendly store in Charleston, WV, which is expected to bring work to 70 more West Virginians. 
Mr. President, Stone & Thomas has accomplished so much during its 150 years in business. Because of its diligent efforts to satisfy the customer it has grown to become West Virginia's largest independent retailer, as well as one of the top 100 in the Nation. 
Because of their outstanding commitment to customer service; because of their longstanding record as a fair, honest, and friendly business; and because of their superior contributions to the economies of West Virginia and three other States, I pay special tribute to Stone & Thomas.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to be joined by two of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Conrad Burns and Senator Byron Dorgan, in introducing today the Railroad Shipper Protection Act of 1997. This legislation is the result of many months of effort to develop constructive and pragmatic proposals for addressing the increasingly serious problems faced by shippers in need of affordable access to railroad service in every region of the country. As a bipartisan team committed to achieving urgently needed results in the coming year, we offer this bill with the hope that it will generate the interest, input, and support needed to help shippers obtain fair treatment and true competitive access from railroads across the country. I commend both Senators Burns and Dorgan for their leadership and constant attention to these issues, which can be complex and yet affect numerous communities, key industries, and workers nationwide. 
This legislation deals with issues of longstanding concern to me. Because of the importance of the relationship between the Nation's railroads and the shippers and communities that they serve, especially in my State of West Virginia, I have made a special effort throughout my tenure in the Senate to promote a rail transportation system that is fair and economically sound for all parties. Of all of the things that have troubled me about that system over the years, none is more troubling than the plight of captive rail shippers--businesses and communities that are dependent on a single railroad for freight transportation service. 
West Virginia has more than its fair share of captive shippers. Many of our coal fields, most of our chemical manufacturers, and one of our finest steel manufacturing facilities--and the largest single employer in our State--all are captive to a single railroad for shipments to domestic and foreign markets. The result is that West Virginia businesses too often suffer from unreasonable freight rates and inadequate transportation service. 
Today, two events are conspiring to create additional captive rail shippers--and worsen the competitive position of existing captive rail shippers--in West Virginia and across the Nation. 
First, our national freight rail system continues to concentrate into fewer and fewer major railroads. Since Congress deregulated the railroads in 1980, the number 
of major Class I railroads has declined from 43 to 5--and will drop to 4 if the division of Conrail is approved. For a long time the fears expressed by shippers, and by those of us in Congress who are dedicated to protecting shippers, have fallen on deaf ears. In the past several months, however, the entire Nation has witnessed the far-reaching economic impact of a merger gone awry. The 1996 merger of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific has made dramatic headlines as service is disrupted, trains pile up, shipments are lost, and ultimately facilities and jobs are put in jeopardy. The chemical industry alone has had to grapple with service disruptions costing an average of $35 to $60 million per month through the summer and into the fall. 
The UP-SP service crisis has caught my attention in part because the effects are so far-reaching that a number of West Virginia shippers have asked for my help, and in part because I now face a major merger in my own backyard with the proposal to divide Conrail between CSX and Norfolk Southern. The UP-SP situation is expected to improve in the coming months, following implementation of a comprehensive service recovery plan and unprecedented intervention by the Surface Transportation Board, but the UP-SP story has only reinforced my belief that concentration of the Nation's railroads is an ominous development for many shippers and for States like West Virginia. Railroad concentration is reducing transportation options and worsening the competitive position of captive shippers. 
Second, the Surface Transportation Board, established in 1995 to succeed the Interstate Commerce Commission, is understaffed and underfunded, and is not adequately promoting rail competition and protecting captive shippers. As I feared at the time it was passed, the effect of the ICC Termination Act has been to reduce our national commitment to a strong and effective regulatory body to protect rail shippers. Rather than being vigilant in protecting captive shippers from railroad abuses, the STB has instead been consumed with reviewing major railroad mergers, conducting annual revenue adequacy determinations which serve no purpose, and making matters worse for shippers by deciding in December 1996 that railroads may render captive a shipper that is otherwise positioned to enjoy competitive service by refusing to quote a rate on a bottleneck segment. 
Mr. President, just as the railroad industry has become more and more concentrated, the regulatory agency charged with protecting captive railroad customers has become less and less able to do its job. 
Some may wonder how the STB, which is directly charged with protecting against unreasonable rates and promoting competition, came to make such an 
anticompetitive and antishipper decision as that set forth in the 1996 bottleneck cases, and I think the answer illustrates well the need for Congress to correct the current imbalance between railroads and their customers. 
The answer lies in the confusing instructions that were given to the STB in the ICC Termination Act, and previously in the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. In these statutes Congress directed the STB and its predecessor, the ICC, to promote our national rail transportation system `by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues' (49 U.S.C. 10101(3)) and by making `an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels' that allow them `to attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States' (49 U.S.C. 10704(a)(2)). Congress has further directed the STB to make an annual determination of each railroad's revenue adequacy--a determination that finds most class I railroads to be revenue inadequate, contrary to the view of Wall Street and industry observers about the financial strength of individual railroads and the industry as a whole. 
As is evident in reading the Board's bottleneck decision, the perceived revenue inadequacy of the major railroads, and the belief that protecting revenue adequacy is the preeminent responsibility of the agency, formed the basis of the STB's agreement with the railroads that they should have the right to prevent rail-to-rail competition even where competition is physically possible. At this point in the evolution of the railroad industry, such an approach is not only inequitable, it is harmful to our national economy. 
Today, I join with my colleagues in proposing legislation to clarify the policy of the U.S. Government with regard to railroad competition and to restore the intended balance between railroads and shippers in the laws governing their relationship and the oversight role of the STB. This bill would accomplish five major objectives: First, making clear that it is the policy of the U.S. Government to promote rail competition and protect captive shippers; second, reducing the regulatory burden on captive shippers by simplifying the market dominance test; third, overturning the bottleneck decision by requiring railroads to quote a rate on any available segment of service; fourth, eliminating the `revenue adequacy' test, which serves no practical purpose and perpetuates the erroneous view that railroads are in dire financial straits; and fifth, requiring the STB to open its process more widely in order to meet the needs of small shippers. 
It is our intention to pursue this legislation in the context of the STB's reauthorization next year. I am firmly committed to ensuring that the Board is reauthorized in a timely way and is provided with the funds it needs to perform its mission as the primary oversight agency for the Nation's railroads, but I want to make clear that I will not support continuation of the status quo in the relationship between railroads and shippers. 
The legislation I introduce today will begin to afford rail-to-rail competition and captive shipper protection the priority they deserve in our national transportation policy. It is an important first-step, and I look forward to working with Senator Burns, Senator Dorgan, and others over the course of the next several months to expand upon the shipper protections we propose today. I invite our colleagues to join us in this effort, and genuinely seek constructive input and assistance to achieve needed solutions.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I feel very strongly that we should give the President fast-track authority before we adjourn. He needs fast-track authority. We are not saying what is going to be in the trade bill that comes after the fast-track authority. 
It is extremely important to remember that fast-track authority is something every President has had since 1974. There is absolutely nothing new in it. The idea that we would withhold from the President fast-track authority on the notion that only the Congress can negotiate trade agreements--Lord help us when it comes to the point where the Congress has to negotiate trade agreements. There are some trade agreements where we can put our imprimatur on that trade agreement, for example: NAFTA, which I voted against; GATT, which I voted for; Chile, which would be upcoming; or others. 
But let's understand that in virtually all cases the President could go ahead and negotiate, his people at the U.S. Trade Representative's office could go ahead and negotiate trade agreements, and what the Congress thinks or does not think does not really apply. We would, obviously, watch that, and in the Finance Committee we watch trade very closely. 
The whole notion of withholding from the President of the United States, in a highly visible action, withholding fast-track authority from the President of the United States, doing that in the Senate or in the House or both, is absolutely unthinkable in terms of good judgment, as far as I'm concerned. 
I can tell you in my own State of West Virginia which is not exactly located on either the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, that trade and exports are a tremendous part of our economy. We have tens of thousands of people who are working exclusively because of international trade. We need to be increasing that. We need to be opening up new markets not only as the State of West Virginia but also as a nation. There are about 11.5 million jobs in this country right now which are exclusively related to international trade. We ought to be pursuing that. 
One of the people that I work with was talking with somebody from the U.S. Trade Representative's office the other day and that person had just come back from a certain part of the world--I think, South America--and said that other countries are going ahead and making agreements and cutting deals on trade and that they are bypassing the United States because we are withholding fast-track authority. It is expired. It doesn't exist. We have to reauthorize it. We need to reauthorize it. 
Somehow, also, the idea that the United States exists all by ourselves in this world doesn't make sense anymore, much less the U.S. Senate being able to sit and determine what will happen in the world. I think the history of the last week and what has happened with the stock markets has shown that transactions are international, they are instantaneous, they are electronic, they depend enormously upon each country taking the maximum advantage of the comparative advantage which it has in terms of goods which it produces. The United States has an enormous comparative advantage. Not to take full advantage of that doesn't make any sense to me. 
Actually, it might interest some people to know that West Virginia, which is not thought of as an internationally related State, in fact, is. In terms of the proportion of the jobs in our State which are related to products which are exported internationally, only three or, maximum, four other States export more of what they produce proportionately than does the State of West Virginia. So here is a State in the middle of the Appalachian mountains--not just because of coal, not just because of steel, but because of many things--we are highly dependent on the international trade environment. 
Mr. President, I remember several years ago when fast track was still in existence. We had two votes. One was on something called NAFTA; the other was on something called GATT. We could have done neither of those unless we had first made sure that the President had fast-track authority, which he did. I happen to think NAFTA was a bad deal for the State of West Virginia and I think I have been proved correct. I would definitely vote again as I did then, which was to vote negatively. 
On the other hand, GATT was tremendously important to the State of West Virginia. As somebody who is interested in trade, I went to Geneva to work with some of the international trade folks where the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, was being negotiated. I worked on antidumping. That is central to West Virginia's steel industry. I worked on countervailing duties. That is central to America's trading interests. Also, circumvention. Most people don't know what circumvention is. Here is a good example. Sony television used to make all of its television sets in Japan, and then export them to Mexico with everything done but the front piece glass--not the tube that actually radiates the pictures but the front piece of glass. That would be added on in Mexico and then would be exported into the United States from Mexico, counting as a Mexican import. That is circumvention for the purposes of trade law. In the GATT we were able to stop that. So Sony had to build a plant in America, hiring 1,000 American workers, to do what they had previously done in an entirely different fashion. 
Trade law is important. Section 337 has everything to do with intellectual property protection. It is the future of our information technology that is at stake. So we could not even have negotiated the GATT agreement without fast track. I'm saying that the President of the United States and his team of negotiators ought to have the right to negotiate a critical trade agreement as they choose, but then we would have the right to either approve it or disapprove it according to how we felt. I think that is a perfectly reasonable relationship. 
The Congress, in a sense, we up or down the trade agreement, but we don't down the process through which the administration can get into the trade agreement. We don't simply say, `fast track you are not going to have,' so you can't begin to negotiate a trade agreement. 
I think that is totally counter to the purposes of international trade and frankly to the interests of my own State. So I hope that in the Senate and these coming days as we debate this issue that we would give the President of the United States the fast-track authority which President Reagan had, which President Ford had, which President Carter had, which President Bush had, and which President Bill Clinton ought to be able to have. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. 
Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to be introducing the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 1997 with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. I have already had the great pleasure of working with Senator Collins on legislation earlier this year to improve the portability of Medigap insurance policies. We were successful in getting a good portion of that legislation enacted this year, so I am very pleased to have another opportunity to work with Senator Collins on another set of issues that are so important to millions of Medicare beneficiaries and the rest of America. 
We introduce this legislation to ask Congress to take action that responds directly and humanely to the needs of elderly and others during some of their most difficult and often traumatic time of their lives. The United States deserves to be extremely proud of the medical advances and efforts that have extended our people's life expectancy and our ability to overcome disease and medical setbacks. But we need to take some additional, tangible steps to also make progress in the practices and care that affect our citizens when they ultimately face death or the real possibility of death. Our bill provides some of those steps. 
While this is a difficult area to discuss, it is a very real area for Americans year in and year out. This is legislation designed to respond to pressing needs of patients, their family members, and their health care providers, and I hope that Congress will adopt these steps in the next year. 
In view of the debate this year on physician assisted suicide and from my own personal experiences, I have spent considerable time delving into the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their family members, and their physicians when confronted with death or the possibility of dying. In almost all such difficult situations, people are not thinking about physician-assisted suicide. The needs and dilemmas that confront them have much more to do with the kind of care and information that they need, often desperately. 
The legislation we are introducing today builds on bipartisan legislation enacted in 1990, called the Patient Self-Determination Act. That legislation was championed by my former colleague from Missouri, Senator Danforth. I held a subcommittee hearing on Senator Danforth's legislation and it became very clear that the lack of a national policy on advance directives was not acceptable. As a result of that bill, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospice programs, and HMO's participating in the Medicaid and Medicare programs must provide every adult receiving medical care with written information concerning patient involvement in their own treatment decisions. The health care institutions must also document in the medical record whether the patient has an advance directive. In addition, States were required to write description of their State laws concerning advance directives. 
Mr. President, at the time of that bill's enactment, we realized that it was only the first step toward increasing public awareness and addressing some very difficult issues related to end-of-life care. As a result of that legislation, a growing number of Americans do have advance directives. But recent studies have found that the majority of Americans have not discussed end-of-life issues with their families or their physicians and have not relayed their treatment preferences either verbally or in writing. 
There is also an increasing awareness that physicians and many other health care providers are uncomfortable addressing end-of-life issues and are even apparently unwilling to respect their patient's preferences in some cases. Another complicating factor is the great variation that exists among State laws, and the lack of a legal requirement that an advance directive written in one State be respected in another State. 
Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today focuses on the need to improve end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries. It addresses the need to develop models of compassionate care and quality measures for end-of-life care in the Medicare Program, and it will encourage individuals to have more open communication with family members and health care providers concerning their preferences for end-of-life care. 
The first section of the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act strengthens the previously enacted Patient Self Determination Act in the following ways. 
First, it requires that every Medicare beneficiary have the opportunity to discuss health care decisionmaking issues with an appropriately trained professional, when he or she makes a request. This measure would help make sure that patients and their families have the ability to discuss and address concerns and issues relating to their care, including end-of-life care, with a trained professional. Many health care institutions already have teams of providers to address difficult health care decisions and some even mediate among patients, families, and providers. In smaller institutions, social workers, chaplains, nurses, or other trained professional could be made available for consultation. 
Second, our bill requires that a person's advance directive be placed in a prominent part of the medical record. Often advance directives can not even be found in the medical record, making it more difficult for providers to respect patients' wishes. It is essential that an individual's advance directive be readily available and visible to anyone involved in their health care. 
Third, it will assure that an advance directive valid in one State will be valid in another State. At present, portability of advance directives from State to State is not assured. 
Such portability can only be guaranteed through Federal legislation. 
The second part of our bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to advise Congress on an approach to adopting the provisions of the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act for Medicare beneficiaries. The Uniform Health Care Decisions Act was developed by the Uniform Law Commissioners, a group with representation from all States that has been in existence for over 100 years. The Uniform Health Care Decisions Act includes all the important components of model advance directive legislation. A great deal of legal effort went into its development, with input by all the States and approval by the American Bar Association. Medicare beneficiaries deserve a uniform approach to advance directives, especially since many move from one State to another while in the Medicare Program. The tremendous variation in State laws that currently exists only adds to the confusion of health care professionals and their patients. 
Just this month, a study done by Dr. Jack Wennberg at Dartmouth University documented the tremendous variation that exists in the medical care that Medicare beneficiaries receive in the last few months of their lives. This sort of analysis highlights that patient preferences have little to do with the sort of care patients receive in their final months of life. Where you live determines the sort of medical care you will receive more so than what you might prefer. 
The third part of this legislation would encourage the development of models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but still have chronic, debilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. The tremendous advances in medicine and medical technology over the past 30 to 50 years have resulted in a greatly lengthened life expectancy for Americans, as well as vastly improved functioning and quality of life for the elderly and those with chronic disease. Many of these advances have been made possible by federally financed health care programs, such as the Medicare Program that assures access to high quality health care for all elderly Americans. Medicare has also funded much of the development of technology and a highly skilled physician workforce through support of medical education and academic medical centers. These advances have also created major dilemmas in addressing terminal or potentially terminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of control by many with terminal illness. 
I believe it is time for Medicare to help seniors have access to compassionate, supportive, and pain free care during prolonged illnesses and at the end of life. As we begin to discuss restructuring the Medicare Program for the long term, this will be one of my primary goals. Our legislation instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop appropriate quality measures and models of care for persons with chronic, debilitating disease, including the very frail elderly who will comprise an increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill also sets up a consumer hotline that can provide the American public with information on the legal, medical, and ethical issues related to advance directives and medical decisionmaking. 
Mr. President, I am learning more and more about the importance of educating health care providers and the public that chronic, debilitating, terminal disease need not be associated with pain, major discomfort, and loss of control. We can control pain and treat depression, as well as the other causes of suffering during the dying process. We must now apply this knowledge to assure all Americans appropriate end-of-life care. And to make sure that Medicare beneficiaries are able to receive the most effective medicine to control their pain, Medicare's coverage rules would be expanded under our bill to include coverage for self-administered pain medications. 
Under current law, Medicare generally does not pay for any outpatient prescription drugs. The only pain medication paid for by the Medicare Program are those drugs that are administered by a portable pump. The pump is covered by Medicare as durable medical equipment and the drugs used with that pump are also covered. Our bill would expand coverage to include self-administered pain medications, for example oral drugs or transdermal patches. These alternatives are as effective in pain relief and, most obviously, a much more comfortable way for patients to receive their pain medication. 
Mr. President, much also needs to be done to assure that all health care providers have the appropriate training to use what is already known about supportive care. The public must be educated and empowered to discuss these issues with family members as well as their own physicians so that each individual's wishes can be respected. More research is needed to develop appropriate measures of quality end-of-life care and incorporate these measures into medical practice in all health care settings. And finally, appropriate financial incentives must be present within Medicare, especially, to allow the elderly and disabled their choice of appropriate care at the end of life. Medicare's coverage policy should not be the sole determinate of the route that pain medication is administered. 
To conclude, I am proud to offer this legislation with Senator Collins. We hope consideration of this bill will be an opportunity to take notice of the many constructive steps that can be taken to address the needs of patients and family members grappling with great pain and medical difficulties. During this time when physician assisted suicide obtains so many headlines, we are eager to call on Congress to turn to the alternative ways of providing help and relief to seniors and other Americans who only are interested in such alternatives.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senator Frist, Senator Hollings, Senator Burns in introducing legislation to reauthorize the programs of the Technology Administration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. This bill reauthorizes the Office of Science and Technology Policy as well as the NIST labs and facilities about the President's budget request. It also funds the Advanced Technology Program at $198 million and the Manufacturing Extension Program at $111 million. 
It is noteworthy that after several hearings on ATP, and after assessing Secretary of Commerce Daley's detailed review of the program, we are now putting forward a bill that continues to authorize this important form of investment in America's economic competitiveness. As I, along with many others in this Chamber, have stated before, this program supports American industry's own efforts to develop new, cutting-edge technologies which create the new industries and jobs of the 21st century. 
Let me remind my colleagues that ATP does not, and I repeat, does not fund the development of commercial products. Instead, this program provides matching funds to both individual companies and joint ventures for pre-product research on high-risk technologies which have the potential to place U.S. industry as the leader in new industrial areas. This high-risk, high-reward strategy has already led to the creation of new U.S. industries based on information transfer, biotechnology, and new materials synthesis. 
In spite of the merits of this program ATP has been criticized by some Members for the past 4 years of the program's 6 years of existence. This year Secretary Daley undertook a 60-day review to assess the ATP's performance and evaluate these criticisms. The Department of Commerce solicited comments from more than 3,500 interested parties and took into account comments provided by both critics and supporters of the program. fact, Senators Lieberman, Domenici, Frist and I joined together and provided one of the 80-plus comments the Department received. I would like to take a moment and commend Secretary Daley for the job he did in undertaking this review. As we all know, there is not a department or program that can't be improved. And as a long time and avid supporter of ATP I believe, that after 6 years of operation, experience would suggest that there should be some areas that can be improved. This review has done just that. The recommendations that Secretary Daley has put forth further strengthens a strong and productive program. I agree with his suggestion to place more emphasis on small and medium-size single applicants, joint-ventures, and consortia. This bill adopts that recommendation by amending the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to define a large business as one with gross annual revenues in excess of $2.5 billion and prohibits such businesses from participating in ATP programs as single applicants. 
In addition, I was pleased to see the added emphasis by the Secretary on the need for an EPSCoT program, based on the EPSCoR model, which would enhance technology development in the 18 States that have traditionally been under-represented in Federal R&D funding. EPSCoT would provide the opportunity for States which have been able to build infrastructure capable of supporting high-tech research to use this infrastructure to its maximum advantage. Studies have shown that strengthening the competitive performance of research laboratories, usually universities, in an underdeveloped area, which is the purpose of EPSCoR, is often not sufficient to establish new, high-tech companies. EPSCoT seeks to assist in technology transfer to the local economy by encouraging links between universities, local businesses, and local and State governments. Unlike ATP, which focuses on the national economic interest in research and development, EPSCoT focuses on allowing under-represented States the opportunity to participate in the technological revolution that is sweeping the global economy. In order to help the success of the program, Governors, business leaders and researchers were consulted about the importance of technology transfer for economic development. This bill provides statutory language to implement the Secretary's proposal of creating the EPSCoT program. 
Secretary Daley's review could not have been done at a better time. After 6 years of existence, a thorough and complete review of the process has shown that is it competently managed, produces positive results and has been working to achieve it's stated objectives. The proposals set forth in this review strengthen a very strong program that is one of the cornerstones to the Nation's long-term economic prosperity. The bill we are introducing today provides the necessary changes to existing law to implement many of the recommendations. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1997, legislation which establishes a clear framework for the compensation and health care needs of Persian Gulf war veterans. This bill implements the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to create a permanent statutory authority for the compensation of ill gulf war veterans. It builds upon the system of scientific review and determinations for presumptive compensation that currently exists for veterans exposed to agent orange during the Vietnam war. 
As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of many of our Nation's gulf war veterans. The Persian Gulf war will undoubtedly go down in history as one of our country's most decisive military victories. Despite our fears of potentially huge troop injuries and losses, the careful planning and strategy of our military leaders paid off. The ground war lasted only four days, and the casualties we experienced, while deeply regrettable, were fortunately few. But as with any war, the human costs of the gulf war have been high, and the casualties have continued long after the battle was over. 
Many of the men and women who served in the gulf have suffered chronic, debilitating health problems. Unnecessarily compounding their pain has been their difficulty in getting the government they served to acknowledge their problems and provide the appropriate care and benefits they deserve. This legislation will go a long way to address some of these concerns. We can't wait the 20 years we waited after the Vietnam war to assess the effects of agent orange, or the 40 years we waited after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed veterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act now. We have already waited too long. 
For the past 6 years, we have looked to the leaders of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for a resolution of these difficult issues. While they have made some progress, I think we can all agree there is much more to be done. This legislation will require VA to enlist the National Academy of Sciences--an independent, nonprofit, scientific organization--to review and evaluate the research regarding links between illnesses and exposure to toxic agents and wartime hazards. Based on the findings of the NAS, VA will then determine whether a diagnosed or undiagnosed illness found to be associated with gulf war service warrants a presumption of service connection for compensation purposes. This will provide an ongoing scientific basis and nonpolitical framework for the VA to use in compensating Persian Gulf war veterans.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague and friend, Senator Snowe, in introducing the Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997. I have long been impressed with Senator Snowe's commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of children, and I believe that this legislation will go far to improve the financial security of thousands of American children. 
As a country, our most fundamental measure of success is how well we treat our children. We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and as a community to do our utmost to make sure that American children live happy, healthy, and stable lives. At the same time, we must acknowledge that much of the responsibility in ensuring children's happiness and security falls squarely at the feet of their parents. Sadly, many parents neglect their emotional and financial responsibilities, maintaining that because they are no longer living in the same house as their children, they no longer have to support them. 
It is estimated that each year, $15 to $25 billion in child support go uncollected. One study reported that four out of five parents have attempted to shirk their court-ordered child support responsibilities at one time or another. In many of these cases, families, already fragile from the absence of one parent, are forced to turn to welfare as the only reliable source of monetary support. In 1975, Congress created the Child Support Enforcement Program to help stop this disturbing pattern. The goal of that program was and still remains to reduce public welfare expenditures by forcing absent parents to provide child support as a regular and reliable source of income for their children. As part of this goal, the Federal Government provides incentive payments to encourage State child support agencies to enforce child support collections as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unfortunately, in the past several years, these incentives have become disincentives; handsomely rewarding even the most poorly performing States with the most dismal collection rates. 
Last year, the welfare reform bill took a positive step by commissioning a task force composed of child support experts from the Department of Health and Human Services and State child support agencies to come up with a new set of incentives that would put State agencies back on the road to efficient collections. The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997 incorporates the consensus findings of this working group. For the first time, the new incentive structure takes into account, not just a State's cost effectiveness in collecting child support, but that State's overall success is establishing paternity and child support orders as well as collecting current and back child support. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to create and implement a sixth incentive: a medical support incentive. As we are all aware, health care is an essential part of any financial package provided for a child. For the first time, this bill requires the implementation of a medical incentive which will require States to seek medical and health coverage as part of the overall child support order. All children deserve comprehensive health coverage, and there is no reason it should be a public expenditure when a child's parent is perfectly able to pay for it. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997 also takes an important step in requiring States to pay families back first. The bill ensures that States will not be allowed to count toward incentive payments the collection of arrearages that are not first returned to former welfare families who need such payments to remain financially independent. While the overall incentive structure rewards the States for good performance, the families first provision keeps the States from receiving a double bonus--allowing them to keep arrearages to reimburse themselves and then getting an incentive payment for it. 
Finally, the bill adds tough but reasonable data requirements to make sure child support incentive payments are based on complete and reliable data from the States. States that do not have accurate data on their child support collections and on other aspects of child support enforcement should not be qualified to receive incentives. This provision will encourage States to make their collection systems even more efficient and, in turn, this will mean millions of additional dollars being directed to the children who need it. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997 is the first vital step in assuring that the States have the most efficient and effective ways possible of collecting child support from parents who have the responsibility to care for their children. Increasing child support collections will not only save Federal and State Governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year in public expenditures, it will accomplish the most important goal of all: improving the financial stability and general well-being of thousands of American children.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings in introducing legislation to reauthorize the programs of the U.S. Fire Administration [USFA]. 
I just want to say a few quick words about this program. The USFA has a tough and rewarding mission. As I am sure my colleagues have noted, the statistics relating to fires in this country are staggering: Approximately 4,500 people die annually, and over 30,000 people are injured. In West Virginia, there were over 9,000 fires in 1995 causing 28 fatalities and 160 injuries. The fact is, Mr. President, these numbers would be worse if it were not for the brave men and women firefighters who put their lives on the line to save and protect others. 
I want to take this moment to commend the 1.2 million members of the Nation's fire service of whom 80 percent are volunteers. In 1995, 163 firefighters were injured in West Virginia in the line of duty. They deserve the best training, assistance, and technology available to do their job. The USFA provides these invaluable services to these men and women in an effort to ensure their safety, their health, and to improve their ability to fight fires with the best available technology. 
If there is a Federal program that is worth its value in dollars, it is this one--an ounce of prevention is clearly worth a pound of cure. In addition to the services the USFA provides firefighters, I want to commend this agency for its education and awareness programs, particularly those that target young children, and for their use of the Internet. Children start over 100,000 fires a year from just playing. The USFA has developed an interactive homepage and guide for parents clearly demonstrating their awareness of today's tools needed to reach today's youth. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, the chairman of the Science Subcommittee, Senator Frist, for his efforts to move legislation in a bipartisan manner. This bill is a fine example of his efforts to work with Members of both parties to move good legislation that benefits the public as a whole. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I recognize a growing group of concerned citizens in West Virginia working to educate the public about their concerns over the costs of what they refer to as `lawsuit abuse.' 
In many areas of West Virginia, local supporters of Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse have given their time on a volunteer basis to speak out about an issue that has statewide and national implications. The costs of lawsuits can include higher costs for consumer products, higher medical expenses, higher taxes, and fewer jobs, due to lost business expansion and forgone product development. At the same time, the legal system must provide avenues for recourse and justice. Together, leaders and citizens must try to achieve consensus in ensuring that our system is balanced and fair to all. 
Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse has a straightforward goal. They want to help the public prevent unnecessary lawsuits. 
When West Virginians see a problem, we work to make people aware of it, and we try to make it right. CALA members are citizens who believe they see harm to our society brought on by certain unnecessary lawsuits and excessive awards that can cripple a small business or strip an individual of his or her life savings. CALA supporters emphasize that they want to make sure that persons with a real need for the civil justice system have access to the courts. Public opinion surveys in our state have shown that a majority of responsible citizens want their legal system to be more fair, more effective, and more sensible, to serve everyone's interests. 
These nonprofit CALA groups have raised local funds to run educational media announcements and are speaking to local organizations and citizen groups across the State to raise public awareness of the issue that they call `lawsuit abuse.' 
Supporters of CALA also encourage that citizens do their part by serving on juries when they are called. To help encourage the youth of West Virginia to become responsible citizens when they reach adulthood, CALA groups have offered scholarship grants to students through an essay contest on the subject of importance of jury service. 
While the local groups have thousands of supporters, there are few individuals who should be recognized for their ongoing leadership and for dedicating countless volunteer hours in the past year. These individuals are Cuz Blake of Bridgeport, chairman and founding member of CALA of Northern West Virginia, and Robert Mauk of Huntington, chairman and founding member of CALA of Southern West Virginia. Many others have given their time and energy to these public watchdog groups as well, persons such as Sid Davis of Charleston who, despite having to take time off recently for health reasons, has returned to his volunteer position as an officer of CALA of Southern West Virginia. 
Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 21 through September 27, 1997, to be Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week in West Virginia. I commend all of the individuals who are involved in Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse for their involvement in civic affairs and their efforts to promote constructive action in a policy area they care about. 
As someone who has been a leader for a balanced, responsible form of product liability reform, I continue to hope for the kind of education, dialogue, and consensus-building clearly needed to address problems in our legal system that hurt consumers, victims, and the private sector. I encourage CALA to continue raising these issues and promoting solutions that ensure justice and improve the legal system. West Virginia and the country as a whole need informed, educated, and dedicated citizens to help elected officials address serious issues and achieve proper reforms when necessary.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, abused and neglected children are among the most vulnerable and poorly protected members of American society. Too many of these children are left to wander aimlessly through the foster care system--a system which, from the outset, was never designed or intended to be a permanent home. We can no longer continue to sentence these foster children to endless waits--a legal limbo in which they no longer feel welcome in their biological families but are unable to be adopted into new and loving homes. Despite the thousands of dedicated foster parents and child welfare workers who strive daily to effectively address the many needs of abused and neglected children in an overloaded system, we know that nothing can replace a permanent and loving home made by adults who can be counted on without condition or limitation. 
Acknowledging our collective obligation to allow no child to fall between the cracks, I am proud to join together with Senator John Chafee and my other colleagues in a truly extraordinary bipartisan effort to introduce the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act [PASS]. Under Senator Chafee's committed leadership on children's issues, this bipartisan group has worked extremely hard to forge an effective compromise--a compromise which offers concrete, practical strategies to provide permanency in lives of foster children and to ensure that health and safety are built into every level of America's abuse and neglect system. Central to this entire effort was also Senator Larry Craig, who brought focus and determination to the sometimes difficult bipartisan negotiations. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my most sincere thanks to my other colleagues, Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, Bond, Landrieu, and Levin for making possible this outstanding example of bipartisan teamwork. 
The Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act will fundamentally shift the focus of the foster care system by insisting that a child's health, safety, and opportunity to find a permanent home should be the paramount concern when a State makes any decision concerning the well-being of abused and neglected children. As a comprehensive package based on bipartisan consensus, PASS will accelerate and improve the response to these concerns, promote safe adoptions, and restore safety and permanency to the lives of abused and neglected children. 
The main objective of this bill is to move abused and neglected children into adoptive or other permanent homes and to do so more quickly and more safely than ever before. Right now, many foster care children are forced to wait years before being adopted--even in cases where loving families are ready and willing to adopt them. Some children lose their chance for adoption altogether. While PASS preserves the requirement to reunify families where appropriate, it does not require States to use reasonable efforts to reunify families that have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, physical abuse, sexual abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. The PASS Act maintains the delicate balance in protecting the rights of parents and families while placing primary focus where it should be: on the health and safety of child. 
PASS encourages adoptions by rewarding States financial incentives for facilitating adoption for all foster children--especially those with special needs which, sadly, make them more difficult to place. For those situations where children cannot go home again, PASS requires States to use reasonable efforts to place them into safe adoptive homes or into the permanent care of loving relatives. In addition, PASS cuts by one-third the time that an abused and neglected child must wait in order to be placed in such adoptive homes. In response to a candid and focused look at today's foster care crisis, the bill also seeks to rescue children from the legal limbo of the current system by requiring States to take the necessary legal steps to free for adoption those children who have been forced to linger in the system for a year or more. PASS also prevents further abuse of children in the foster care system by requiring criminal records checks for all foster and adoptive parents. PASS is about helping the individual child but, equally as importantly, fixing the system. 
It is always the right time to focus on the needs of children--especially those unfortunate enough to find themselves in the sometimes dysfunctional labyrinth of the abuse and neglect system. Unfortunately, however, reform has never been more necessary. President Clinton's `Adoption 2002 Report' found that there are currently half a million children in temporary foster care placements. One hundred thousand of those children should be adopted, but less than half of that number are legally eligible to become part of an adoptive family. In my home State of West Virginia alone, referrals to Child Protective Services are expected to rise to an all-time high of 17,000 this year. Foster care placements have jumped from 2,900 children in January 1996 to 3,113 children in January 1997. These staggering figures reveal a foster care crisis of unprecedented proportions. 
PASS is the first step in a vital, ongoing effort to put children at the very top of our national agenda. It is time that we provide all children with their most profound wish: to live in a safe and loving home with caretakers who treat them with respect and dignity. If we are unable to address this most fundamental need, these children will not be able to grow, learn, and provide a secure place for their own families. It is unthinkable to deny abused and neglected children such vital opportunities.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I completely agree with the comments of my senior Senator. I would note that three of the five teams under contracts to the Department of Energy are working on projects in our State of West Virginia. I understand that the other two are located in Alabama and Ohio. 
These five projects offer great promise compared to conventional greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. A single, small coal mine methane project designed to produce 10 megawatts of electricity is expected to operate at a profit. That same project would unequivocally produce collateral greenhouse gas mitigation benefits equal to the carbon sequestered by approximately 14 million trees. In sharp contrast to the profit generated by the coal mine methane project, tree planting would come at a cost conservatively estimated at $18 million. So, DOE's methane capture program makes dollars and sense. 
This program is relatively small in terms of Federal cost but can leverage significant private sector investment and may generate considerable economic and environmental benefits for Americans living in the Appalachian coal regions. I hope that we may reconsider the recommendation on this particular program.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is very unusual for me to come to the floor to oppose an amendment by my two very distinguished colleagues from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton and Senator Murray. I respect them both immensely. I have worked with them both closely. In offering this amendment, I understand what it is they are trying to do. There are many who look at States like Oregon and the State of Washington and Wisconsin and Minnesota and say these are truly progressive States, their governments are doing things which other State governments ought to be doing. Philosophically, therefore, it would be natural for them to come to the floor to ask for some kind of exemption with respect to the children's health care bill. 
I come to the floor as somebody who has worked for a very long time on health care, and who has worked virtually full time on this children's health insurance bill. This legislation is a huge accomplishment in terms of this Congress and the President. The children's health initiative is the biggest thing to happen in health care since the mid-1960's. Because of my experience in working on health care, and the children's initiative in particular, I am extremely leery about opening up the children's health legislation for amendment. I know that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, has said exactly that, and I know Senator Moynihan has said exactly that. I am not sure there are many people who have talked against this amendment, which worries me because, on the face of it, it sounds like a reasonable request, a progressive State asking for an exemption because they are doing things at 200 percent of poverty, which most of the rest of the States are not. 
Mr. President, I can tell you that this was a very difficult agreement to reach, the children's health insurance bill. There was the whole issue of whether funding should be made available for health care services as opposed to health care insurance? There was the whole issue of whether the Federal Government should have a say, since it is Federal dollars, in terms of how the money should be spent. The benefit package, which is something I care enormously about, in the children's health care bill is not as good as Medicaid, which is already currently available to millions of children in this country. And there was the question that I fought for, as did others, and didn't succeed, on whether vision and hearing should be included. You can make an enormously powerful case that if you don't provide hearing services, then you won't catch the problems children are experiencing in hearing, who then will stop learning. And, if you don't offer vision care, all kinds of other things happen. It was a very controversial bill. It was reached with great difficulty; the culmination and the consensus was reached with very great difficulty. 
I firmly believe it would be very unwise for us to agree to the Gorton-Murray amendment simply because there will be a lot of other people following their lead, and leaders of other States will be following them through the door saying they do 200 percent of poverty, but we do 185 percent or 190 percent of poverty, or we are going to be doing it next year. There will be this and that, and all of a sudden the $24 billion will be quickly eroded. 
Now, am I saying that as a knee-jerk response against what is a very good-faith effort on the part of the Senators from the State of Washington to improve their situation? No. I am opposing the amendment out of a genuine concern, accompanied by some degree of terror that, if this amendment passes, there will be many others that follow. One can almost say that, for example, had there not been votes this evening, I was meant to go to West Virginia to discuss with the Governor, Cecil Underwood, a Republican, how he and I were going to work together to help implement--to make sure that the children's health insurance bill works successfully in West Virginia. We don't do things as generously as the State of Washington because we cannot, we don't have the money. My point is that the children's health program is just being implemented. The ink is barely dry. The implementation date has not even arrived yet. 
There is a very genuine concern on the part of those of us who care about health care that if we start modifying the agreement on children's health that was reached by the Congress and the White House that we will be in trouble. There are still 10 million children in this country that do not have health insurance. I remember there was common wisdom on the floor of the Senate that if we got the $16 billion for children's health insurance in the budget we could insure 5 million uninsured children. And if we got extra money--$8 billion or more from the tobacco tax--then we could insure all of the 10 million children. That was the hope for a period of time on this floor. As it turns out, it is much harder. It is much more difficult. And even with the full $24 billion we may only be able to reach 3.6 million American children who do not now have health insurance. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, I think in responding to the submission of this amendment to them by Senators Gorton and Murray, indicated that, if this amendment is passed, it will result in 30,000 fewer children receiving health insurance coverage--not health services but health insurance coverage. Health insurance coverage is all that matters. That is the wraparound. That is the safety net. That is what guarantees your situation for the future. If we adopt this amendment, others will want special treatment and it would not be long before the $24 billion was eroded away. 
So, again I emphasize the respect that I have for the two Senators from Washington. I emphasize that they have every right, just on the basis of the progressiveness of their State, to request this kind of an amendment. But, if they do, there are going to be many States--in the South, the Midwest, the Northeast, and the West--that are going to be losing as a result of it because others will come in with other requests, and gradually the $24 billion in new funding disappears. 
So as somebody who cares passionately about health insurance being available to all 10 million children, and who a few years ago fought for health insurance to be available to 37 million Americans--now 40 million--who don't have it, I am rejoicing in the 3.6 million children who will get health insurance under the children's health insurance bill. But I do not want to see any fewer get it. 
Therefore, I reluctantly, but energetically, oppose this amendment. I hope that my colleagues will understand that there are a lot of children across America that need to be protected and can best be protected by defeating this amendment. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor. 
I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield? I am not asking him to yield, but I simply would like to reply to what it was that he said. 
The last thing in the world that I want the Senator from Washington, or anybody else, to think is we have ours, let others take care of their own. 
First, I think the Senator from the State of Washington knows that is not the kind of legislator I am, in the first place. And, second, this is not about we have ours, and let others take care of their own. 
This is a question of trying to keep stitched together an extremely fragile program about which there was enormous controversy. Enormous heat was generated. I was actually almost surprised when it passed not only in the Congress but was signed by the President. I would simply say that I understand that the UC agreement on this bill prevents Senators from offering similar amendments on this bill. But as a Senator who is on the Senate Finance Committee, the Governors were always asking for more ways to do things, new ways to get money, more flexibility. The list of demands kept growing. 
Yes, I will fight for the children of West Virginia. But what I am thinking about here really is holding this program together, giving it a chance to work, not precluding the idea of the Senators from the State of Washington being able to introduce this kind of amendment a year or so from now, but simply let us get the children's health program implemented. Let us have a chance to see how it is going before we start exempting this situation and then that situation. 
I hope that will be cleared by the parties.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In response to the Senator, I wholly agree with what he said, by trying to make two points. One is that when we were first contemplating this children's health insurance bill and the whole key concept of maybe getting as much as $24 billion, or even perhaps more than that, it was sort of understood that first we were going to insure 5 million children of the families that had the least resources to buy health insurance, and then we would move on to those who had a little bit more resources but still would not be able to afford buying health insurance from the private market for their children. We were talking about 10 million children. There was a lot of opposition to insuring 10 million children. It wasn't 40 million Americans, but it was 10 million children. Then even with the $24 billion that was applied to the program we are now faced with the prospect of maybe only being able to cover 3.6 million children, leaving, therefore, many of the 10 million uncovered. 
I think the Senator is also correct when he says this in no way precludes--I said that in my remarks earlier--the State of Washington, which has clearly moved out ahead of others, from, once the ink is dry, once we have seen a little bit more about how this works out, to be able to come back based on the ability of this particular State and others to be able to do more. 
But at this point, I am very, very nervous given, frankly, the rather capacious nature of the Governors in trying to bring this money to them, having to put in fairly strict guidelines about what could be spent on health care services as opposed to health interests, which regrettably are different things. I really want to see the program work, and I think we need to give it a chance to work and then come back. And I will be the first to support the State of Washington and others that have done more than other States. But let us take this incredibly, frankly, put-together program and let it work before we open more doors.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, before casting my vote for this tax portion of the budget plan, I want to comment on the aspects that are of most concern to me. 
The basic point I want to emphasize is that my vote for both the spending bill and this tax bill that make up the balanced budget and tax plan is the result of weighing its merits against its flaws. The fundamental job for Congress this year has been to agree on a plan to balance the budget, which is the main objective of the bills we are approving this week. Unlike the Republican budgets that I opposed over the last 2 years, this plan is the result of bipartisan negotiations and contains real benefits and important compromises in the interest of West Virginians and all Americans. 
At the same time, it has been clear that the only way we could finish the job some of us started in 1993, to balance the budget and start dealing with future priorities, was to find middle ground. I recognize that I cannot write or cause the passage of the budget plan that reflects exactly how I would chart Medicare's course, design the childrens' health insurance program, target tax relief, or address other priorities for West Virginians. Instead, I have worked hard in the recent months to influence these parts of the budget and make the best possible case for the approach I think is fair and balanced. 
The spending plan approved this morning and the tax bill before us today are improvements over the extreme Republican budgets that were rejected in the past 2 years and over the earlier versions of these very bills. With the many aspects that will benefit West Virginians and address national priorities, I made the decision to vote for both bills. 
The crucial part of the bill before us is the fact that it will provide tax relief to 27 million hardworking American families who are responsible for raising over 45 million children under the age of 17. Today, Congress joins the President to give those families a per-child tax credit much like the one that the bipartisan Children's Commission unanimously recommended when I chaired that commission 7 years ago. We are delivering real tax relief to American families so that they can share in the benefits of our sharply declined, and soon to be completely eliminated, deficit. That is an achievement I think we can be proud of, particularly because this tax conference report will benefit 5.9 million lower income families who were left out of the Senate-passed tax bill. The fight to make the child tax credit fairer was won by the President and Democrats who refused to ignore the millions of families struggling the hardest to provide for their families. Winning, improving the child credit so it is extended to more American families is important because it means we will more fairly distribute the benefits of the tax cuts in this bill than under the initial tax plans passed in Congress. 
I am pleased that I can report that 25,000 more West Virginia families will benefit from the child tax credit as a result of the changes in the conference report--changing the stacking order of the child credit, now placed before the EITC, and its partial refundability for families with three or more children. It is predominantly for that reason that I will cast my vote in favor of this tax package. Improving the child credit so it reaches more families, the families who need the most help to buy their children shoes, pay the mortgage, or deal with an unexpected medical expense, is a major victory in this tax bill. With this important improvement, I can support this tax package. The substantial dedication of funds to provide health insurance to about 3.4 million of the 10 million uninsured children in our country--totaling $24 billion in new dollars for kids' health--is another major reason to vote for this bill. The additional financing for kids' health comes from a hike in the tobacco tax. I think that is a smart way to pay for this new spending on children's health. I am deeply disappointed that we did not insist on a meaningful benefit package for those children, but I will be back another day to fight to improve that provision. 
But I don't want to cast my vote in favor of this 5-year budget bill without making it perfectly plain that I have serious worries about the long-term costs of some of the tax cuts in this bill. Certain provisions could be a potential tax timebomb because of how their costs explode in the 5 years following the 5 years in this budget, sometime after 2002. The explosion of costs in what we refer to as the outyears--years after the first 5 years of the budget--of the provisions that benefit the wealthiest Americans are very worrisome to me. I have to honestly wonder whether or not we will realistically be able to retain them. The long-term costs of providing such generous reductions in tax rates for estates and gifts, capital gains, and the expansion of individual retirement accounts [IRA's] may prove too expensive to sustain. I cite these particular provisions because they are the ones that score as relatively small costs in the first 5 years of this budget, but are projected to multiply 10 and 20-fold in the second 5 years, according to the scoring of both the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. 
Consider these numbers--estate tax relief costs $5.9 billion in the first 5 years and jumps to $33 billion in the second 5 years; capital gains relief scores as if it saves $123 million in the first 5 years but the cost of that relief increases to $20.2 billion in the second 5 years; and the IRA expansions cost $1.8 billion in the beginning of this agreement, but rise precipitously to $21.1 billion in the next 5 years. Those are enormous increases, and I worry that we cannot afford to include such narrowly targeted tax relief over the long term when we don't know how healthy our economy will be in the year 2002. We may well have to revisit these benefits and reconsider whether they are worth retaining. I would be thrilled if our economic growth and expansion continued at such a pace that we do not have to revisit this work, but I want my colleagues to know that this is one of my worries about enacting this tax bill. 
I remain very confident that over the next few years we have a unique opportunity to provide some tax relief to many Americans --and well understand the promise of that relief helps us deliver an agreement to balance the budget. At the same time, we are plowing $40 billion into education tax credits to help 5 million students with a $1,500 HOPE scholarship to make the first 2 years of college universally available and a 20 percent tuition tax credit for college juniors, seniors, and graduate students, along with working Americans to pursue lifetime learning and get the skill upgrades they need to compete in a changing economy. This level of tax support for education will help us prepare our children and our workforce for the new century. I congratulate the President for holding firm to his commitment. 
I am hopeful that both budget bills headed for the President's signature will make the steps forward that are being promised and celebrated today. I know that many provisions will directly benefit West Virginians in key areas. But I also urge everyone in Congress to keep a careful watch on the results of both bills, and maintain a commitment to correcting anything that may go wrong and budgetary effects that may go awry. Let's do our best to achieve the good promised in these bills, and work to make sure that the legacy of this legislation will be something we can continue to praise in future years.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize two students of Potomac State College in West Virginia who have accomplished great feats through the assistance of our Federal TRIO programs. These programs have helped students for more than 30 years to overcome financial barriers to education. 
Paul Kesner was a participant in the student support services program at Potomac State from 1977 to 1979. This section of the TRIO programs helps students to stay in college until they earn their baccalaureate degree by providing tutoring, counseling, and financial assistance. Not only was Paul able to earn his BA, he went on to obtain an MS in counseling psychology from Frostburg State University, and is currently working on his dissertation to earn a Ph.D. from West Virginia University. Paul is currently the Dean of Student Affairs at Potomac State College. 
Paul was recently elected to be president of the West Virginia Association of Student Personnel Administrators. Paul is also very active in Rotary International and various other local civic organizations in his community. Paul, who grew up on a farm in Mineral County, WV, notes that, `I am grateful for the impact and change TRIO had on my life. Without it, I certainly would not be in a situation to help others progress toward their own educational goals.' 
Michelle Francis participated in the student support services program at Potomac State from 1989 to 1990. This Federal program helped Michelle to graduate from college and to make the career choices that she wanted to make. After earning an associate's degree from Potomac State, Michelle went on to earn her BA from Frostburg State University. 
Michelle is presently the day treatment coordinator at the developmental center & workshop in Keyser. Like Paul, Michelle is also very active in her community, serving in the Ladies Auxiliary of the American Legion, and as a mentor at the Mountaineer Challenge Academy. Michelle was also awarded the 1996 West Virginia TRIO achiever award. 
As the fine results of these two West Virginia citizens demonstrate, the TRIO programs are clearly helping Americans to overcome financial, social, academic and cultural barriers to earn their college degrees. Since 1965, when the Federal TRIO programs began receiving funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, the facts have shown that students who participate in the TRIO student support services program are more than twice as likely to remain in college than those students from similar backgrounds who did not participate in the program. 
Paul and Michelle have joined the ranks of many West Virginians who have achieved outstanding feats after participating in the TRIO programs. Thirty years ago, the TRIO programs were founded on the basis that all Americans deserved the opportunity to achieve a college education regardless of race, ethnic background, or economic circumstances. Today, the town of Keyser is a better place in which to live because of the contributions of Paul Kesner and Michelle Francis to the community. Because the TRIO programs were there for Michelle and Paul, they have been able to be there for the benefit of other West Virginians. 
I know that the TRIO programs will continue to help future West Virginia students to obtain a college degree, and because of this, these future students will be able to benefit their respected communities in much the same way that Paul and Michelle help the city of Keyser, WV. The TRIO programs don't just create a real society of opportunity for everyone, they result in better cities and communities throughout the State of West Virginia and nationwide.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to praise a citizen of West Virginia, Annie Campbell. Annie has recently received the J.C. Penney Golden Rule award for her outstanding volunteer community service. 
Annie has been volunteering her time for Manna Meal for the past 20 years, and has seen it expand considerably. Even though she is nearing 80 years old, Annie pursues her service with confidence and generosity. She drives to pick up food at local businesses and hospitals and sometimes helps to serve the food to the people who come to Manna Meal. She loves to give a helping hand to those in need. She says, `You feel good to know you've done something to alleviate hunger.' 
Annie's life is built around helping people. She is a registered nurse at the Charleston Area Medical Center's General Division, and a leader in her church, where she is the secretary, a circle leader, on the mission committee, and on the kitchen committee. Annie is a committed woman to her community. 
Manna Meal provides food for the hungry. Annie says, `A lot of people who come to Manna Meal are not food hungry, they are companionship hungry.' She helps with both. She provides food and friendship for those who attend the meals. Manna Meal is run by volunteers and donations. Annie has watched Manna Meal expand from a tiny soup kitchen serving 40 to large service providing for 300. 
Volunteer service is vital to West Virginia and America because it is done on a personal and natural level. It is comforting to hear that there are people who willingly dedicate their lives to helping those in need. West Virginia is extremely lucky to have Annie in the State, and I am proud to make this statement regarding her award today.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the West Virginia Americorps Program for their outstanding service and accomplishments. Currently, 500 Americorps members work at nearly 100 sites throughout West Virginia. Americorps programs strive to extend and promote education for children of all socioeconomic backgrounds and to fulfill basic needs, such as, food, shelter, and health care, for West Virginians. By working together with the community, the members of Americorps search for solutions to improve the quality of life and expand opportunities for individuals who are less fortunate. 
Helping individuals become more independent and self-sufficient are goals of Americorps. To help people with multiple sclerosis, the West Virginia chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Americorps members provide friendly home visits, organize peer support groups, and help them with their daily chores. 
The Energy Express Americorps opens new doors and expands the possibilities for children of West Virginia. This 6-week summer learning program provides nutritious meals, a safe learning environment, and positive role models. While developing a strong relationship between students and mentors, the children improve their reading skills. With the support of the community and the involvement and attention of parents and volunteers, children's self esteem is increasing and their reading skills are improving. 
Throughout the mountains of West Virginia, homes need constant care and attention. My colleagues know that floods, violent storms, and other uncontrollable factors can cause homes to deteriorate more rapidly. My State is fortunate enough to have organizations like the Southern Appalachian Labor School, Fayette Environmentally Safe Housing, and Americorps volunteers to repair and remodel homes for low income families. With project partners and community support, West Virginia families may live in a safe, clean environment. 
Another Americorps program, Project HEALTH [Health Education Associates Learning to Teach Health], encourages healthy diets and lifestyles while increasing public awareness on health issues. Through a learn and serve america higher education grant, Project HEALTH and Americorps volunteers have a profound impact on rural communities. As a result of their hard work, communities have reduced illnesses and injuries, increased immunizations for children, improved the diets for high risk individuals, and reduced the number of low birth weight babies. 
While working class families struggle to find adequate child care and affordable health insurance, the cost of living rises. Parents must provide more than the basic needs for their families. However, with the aid of the Regional Family Resource Network and Americorps, these services become a reality. Immunizations, developmental screening, and after school services are available to families in Kanawha, Clay, and Boone counties in West Virginia. Preventive medicine, medical attention, and a safe environment for children after school are vital to raising healthy children. 
To help victims of domestic violence, the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence provides food and shelter, legal assistance, support, and counseling. With the assistance of Americorps volunteers, there are programs in Beckley, Charleston, Elkins, Huntington, Keyser, Lewisburg, Morgantown, Sutton, Welch, Wheeling, and Williamson. Emergency hot lines, resources, and counseling services are offered by the coalition also. Educating women about the warning signals and teaching them ways to avoid violent situations can prevent abusive behavior and possibly death. In West Virginia, there are twelve shelters providing services to victims. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all the volunteers and employees who dedicate their lives to public service, and I'd like to thank the community for their support and involvement in Americorps projects. Your time and effort are greatly appreciated by all. With your help, our state has been able to improve the quality of life for West Virginians and to increase the opportunities for them in the future.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend, Senator Jim Jeffords, of Vermont to introduce a bill that will help families avoid an additional tragedy in their already traumatized lives. We are introducing a bill to raise lifetime limits on insurance policies to $10 million. But, first, I want to recognize and applaud Chairman Jeffords' extraordinary leadership on this issue--last Congress and this year. With his leadership, we will succeed in raising the lifetime cap on health benefits to $10 million. 
People buy health insurance to protect themselves and their families when they get sick. They spend their lives paying for it. They count on it. But each year, 1,500 people have their insurance taken away, just when they need it most and for the very reason why they bought the insurance in the first place, because they are gravely ill or in need to extensive medical care or some other extraordinary reason. 
These 1,500 people run into the lifetime limit on their health insurance policy. When that happens, the insurance company won't spend a single cent to help that person cope with his or her health care costs. But the need for medical care continues. And the bills keep coming. 
The $1 million limit, first used by insurance companies to give their customers peace of mind and security in the 1970's, is widely out-of-date and hugely insufficient. According to Price Waterhouse, had the limit kept pace with medical inflation, it would be more than $10 million today. In fact, a $1 million health insurance policy in 1970 would buy you about $100,000 in health benefits in 1997. 
When a family runs into the lifetime limit, they have no choice but to spend themselves into poverty in order to qualify for Medicaid. This drains families of their assets, their self-esteem and costs Medicaid several billion dollars in additional health care costs. Many people have to give up everything--their house, their savings, and their kids' education in order to get the medical care they need through Medicaid. 
In my home State of West Virginia, Mike Davis hit his $1 million lifetime cap in 1994. That was 14 years after his son Todd was hit by a drunk driver, causing severe brain injury. Before Todd qualified for Medicaid, his father received a $90,000 bill for his son's care--a bill he's still struggling to pay. 
This can happen to anyone. Catastrophic injury, chronic illness or significant disability are arbitrary. They hit young and old, rich and poor. You plan for routine illness, but no one plans for this kind of illness or injury. At least if you have a health insurance policy without a $1 million cap, you can get the medical treatment you need. 
Most people don't even know if their insurance policy has a lifetime cap. The insurance companies don't talk about them. The caps are stuck in the fine print. People assume that if you buy insurance, you're covered. Unfortunately, that's not the case. About 60 percent of employer-sponsored health plans have lifetime caps. 
Several modifications were made to this year's bill. We include an exemption for small businesses. We give all businesses 2 years to comply. We phase the cap in--first raising it to $5 million and then lifting it to $10 million by the year 2002. We're talking about a roughly 1 percent increase in premiums, according to Price-Waterhouse. That's it. 
The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program doesn't allow participating insurers to set lifetime limits on their basic health insurance polices for Federal employees. Members of Congress don't have lifetime caps. We know our health insurance will be there when we need it. All Americans should have that same security. 
Raising the cap is something we can and should do. It's the right thing to do. It's good policy and it can save Medicaid up to $7 billion over the next 7 years. Mr. President, the idea behind insurance is simple: no matter how sick you are, you're covered. It's about basic decency and fairness.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I also appreciate very much, as I always do, what my good friend, the Senator from New Mexico, said. I would draw one small point, however of difference. That is, in the miners' health retirement bill there has never been any thought, any action, any suggestion that any of that money should be used for anything but the health care of miners, period. It doesn't go anywhere else. In the case of what we are now talking about, the universal service fund, it is something which was set up for one purpose and which is being used for an entirely different purpose. The Senator may wish to come back--

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly agree with what Senator Dorgan of North Dakota has said. I expect that, if the Presiding Officer were in a position to take the floor, he might say something not that dissimilar. 
There is an enormous amount of anger among those of us who worry about rural America, that for the first time in its history --hopefully for the last time in its history--the universal service fund is literally being raided for the purpose of a gimmick. The Senator from New Mexico is correct, I think, in the way he describes the process of what will happen. He is incorrect in one small matter, which doesn't really make that much difference but happens to make some difference to me as a Democrat, and that is that the idea came first from the Congressional Budget Office, not from the White House. It came from the Congressional Budget Office, this so-called gimmick fix. Then it was upheld by, so to speak, the Office of Management and Budget, which is something that I am very angry about, as a Democrat, because that happened on the President's watch. 
I think the problem with this is that universal service is sacred. When the Senator from North Dakota described equal phone calls--as he sometimes says, Donald Trump can call into Minot, ND, and that is good for Donald Trump in New York City and that's good for Minot, ND, and the possessor of that phone. But the purpose of universal service is, in fact, that rural areas are able to be sustained in part of their rate-paying because some States have to be more generous than others. That is what universal service is about. That is what the money is there for. It is not there for black lung, it's not there for retired miners, it's not there for environmental purposes. It's there for one purpose, and that is to guarantee that universal service on the telephones is available and affordable by people no matter where they live, and people particularly in rural areas. 
Part of my objection to all of this, of course, is that this whole process of working out this reconciliation bill--which I do support. I am not jumping up and down, but I do support it. That will be another speech at another time. But basically there were a lot of meetings held in a lot of rooms in which a lot of us were not allowed to be. I have a feeling that 
this decision was made at the last moment by OMB. Their people tried vainly to convince Senator Dorgan and his folks and myself and my folks that this was all really nothing but just a shifting of money here and there. But that is not the case. If you look at the historic proportions of raiding the universal service fund, no matter for what purpose--it's not for telephone service, it's not for making it possible in rural New Mexico or rural West Virginia or rural North Dakota for people who have telephones not to have to pay exorbitant rates. 
So here we have this one very unfortunate example. It's a budget gimmick. It's lousy policy. It's using the service fund as a piggy bank. There is no excuse for it. It's in the bill. I understand that we are probably not going to be able to do very much about it, but it is wrong. It is not only wrong because of what it does to universal service, but it's also very wrong because of what it does to libraries and schools and health care center telemedicine programs, which I will talk about in a moment. 
I will say the fact that Senator McCain was on the floor, that Senator Stevens has strong feelings about this, and Senator Hollings has strong feelings about this, Senator Daschle has strong feelings about this, Senator Dorgan, myself, many others, Senator Snowe--many others--this is a problem that we are going to come back to and fix. As the Senator from Arizona indicated, he's going to hold hearings. But we are going to come back on this until we can fix this problem. We can't fix it today, but we will be back, we will be back again, until we get this eliminated--eliminated and changed. Because it is wrong. 
I recognize the universal service fund isn't recognized by most people. They don't know what it means. But it's something of such incredible importance to affordable phone rates for rural citizens that it is something people better understand very, very thoroughly. When a group of us passed and fought hard for something called the Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment, we extended the promise and the idea of universal service to something which fits in that category; that is, schools, libraries and rural health care facilities that use telemedicine. There are 116,000 schools in this country, Mr. President, and we are going to make every classroom applicable and every one of those classrooms, every one of those schools, we are going to make them fully wired up, ready for Internet, so there won't be any first- and second-class society in our country. 
I never, ever thought during the battle that we had to get to pass that Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment, I never ever for a moment thought that we would be dealing with budget negotiators, but much more significantly I think, in this case, the Office of Management and Budget and their intransigence in trying to work out some kind of a Federal budget worked out that was not--I was shocked when I heard about that. 
Unfortunately, the budget has a neat trick, and as the Senator from New Mexico points out, it will work. It will loan universal service funds in the year 2001 and it will repay that in the year 2002, solely to have enough money appear on the books to make it possible to say that the Federal budget was balanced in that particular year, 2002. It violates the promise made to telecommunications providers that the universal service money was for telecommunications only. They are offended by it.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The provision that will probably become law, in this gigantic stack of papers, is opposed by telecommunications companies. It is opposed by education groups. It is going to be opposed by a lot more groups before this process is finished. 
The universal service fund is private money. It comes from telephone companies. We don't own the telephone companies. They are their own property. It is managed by nonprofit NECA, the National Exchange Carriers Association. This is private money--private money--that should not be used for budget gimmicks. 
At this point, we are caught between a rock and a hard place. The bill is before us. It is a good bill on balance. It is a bill that I am going to vote for. It is something that all of us have worked hard for since 1993, and probably before that. It is going to have to be changed, I fear, in the future. I tried to reach Franklin Raines this afternoon. I could not do so. I have spoken to the Vice President about it. I have spoken to everybody I possibly could, because it is terribly bad public policy. 
I am committed to protecting the integrity of universal service, and I intend to work with Senator Dorgan, Republican colleagues, industry leaders, and advocates to protect universal service and its promise of affordable access to rural America. 
I urge interested parties to join me in this fight. Universal service is not just about putting computers in classrooms. It is about fairness to rural Americans. It is a sacred trust. The universal service fund has been briefly violated. One can hope that this will be the only time, and one can hope that even this time, it will only last for about a year before we clear it up. 
Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States for their program called Operation Uplink. Through private donations, the VFW has been able to distribute more than 11,000 hours worth of free long-distance calling time to hospitalized veterans and active duty troops overseas who might not otherwise be able to talk with their loved ones back home. Since I represent a State which especially honors national service and has the most combat veterans per capita, you can be sure that this is an issue I care about deeply. 
Shortly after I joined the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I learned that none of our country's veterans' hospitals had bedside phones. Patients had to collect change to use at a pay phone, or wait for a nurse to wheel a portable phone into their room. Not only did this inconvenience patients greatly, it added to the burdens of an already overworked nursing staff. 
We all realize that a phone is more than a modern convenience; it is a lifeline to the outside world for a sick veteran. That is why I fought for, and won, $1.5 million in 1993 to support the work of the bedside phone project, P.T. Phone Home, in West Virginia and elsewhere. 
A couple of years ago when I was in West Virginia visiting the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, I spoke with a World War II combat veteran, Kenneth Getz. Mr. Getz had been experiencing serious medical problems, but he was much more concerned about his blind wife than his own health. He told me, `We start the day with a phone call and end it with a phone call. Phones should have been in here years ago.' And he is exactly right--we have an obligation to make certain that every veteran receives the same quality care you or I would want for ourselves. 
Unfortunately, too many poor veterans are not able to take advantage of the bedside phone service, since for many, home is not a local call from the hospital. The thought of a sick or wounded veteran, lying in a distant veterans' hospital, cut off 
from family, children and friends, is very troubling to me. It is plain wrong. 
I highly commend the VFW for recognizing this problem and taking action. We know that in the long run, veterans who can talk to their spouse or children are not only happier, but also have higher morale, and that can go far in improving their health. I can just envision the comforting effect on a patient like Mr. Getz in having the opportunity to talk to his son in Houston or wife in Charleston--all of this made possible by the VFW initiative. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending a warm thank-you to the VFW and its members all across America. I am especially pleased to note that this service is being provided by private donations, thus protecting the already beleaguered Federal budget. This project is a tribute to the many veterans who believed in the principles of freedom and democracy strongly enough to risk their lives in the name of freedom. By providing prepaid phone cards to sick vets and overseas troops, the VFW truly `Honors the dead by helping the living.'

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to commend the members of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee for including $1,675,000 for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology [EPSCoT] in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations request. This program model is based on the successful National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR]. 
EPSCoR has a strong track record in helping to promote quality research in States, like West Virginia, that are traditionally under represented in Federal research and development funding. EPSCoT is intended to promote similar activities for technology transfer. 
This is a wise investment with bipartisan support. Senator Burns and I have discussed this concept and its potential, and we have sought the comments of leaders in our states and regions. 
Technology plays a vital role in economic growth. According to the Congressional Research Service, experts widely believe that technological progress is responsible for up to one-half of the growth of the U.S. economy and is one principal driving force in long-term economic expansion and increases in our Nation's standard of living. Given this compelling point, it is essential to ensure that technology is successfully transferred to business and industry in every region, including those regions which historically are under served. Our Nation will not thrive if some regions are left behind in the key sectors of R&D or technology transfer. 
The National Science Foundation's EPSCoR program has considerably helped States enhance their capacity for research and development. The Department of Commerce is now looking to use this successful model for technology transfer. It is important to note that this initiative has been debated and considered for quite some time. Commerce officials have worked closely with Governors and U.S. Innovation Partnership. 
As a longstanding advocate for EPSCoR, I am enthusiastic about the potential for this new Commerce initiative, EPSCoT, to effectively build partnerships at the State level and promote technological advances that will lead to long-term growth in regions of our country that traditionally have been left behind. I am confident that West Virginia and other States can benefit enormously by such a targeted incentive program. This appropriations is a good start in the right direction on technology transfer.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a duty suspension bill that will not only benefit the chemical workers in my state of West Virginia, but also will enable U.S. farmers to grow more crops at lower cost and protect the environment at the same time. 
This legislation will suspend the U.S. duty on a hydrochloride known by its code name of KN001. This substance is a key raw material in a new, environmentally safe family of agricultural chemicals invented by DuPont in the 1980's. These new agricultural chemicals, called sulfonylureas, are used in extremely small amounts by farmers to control weed growth in their fields without harming the crops that the farmers are trying to grow. By suppressing weed growth, these chemicals make sure that all of the available soil nutrients and moisture go into growing the crops instead of growing weeds. Because sulfonylureas operate on plant enzymes, they do not affect insects or animals, and because they biodegrade rapidly, they are among the most environmentally friendly crop protection chemicals in use today. 
An additional benefit of suspending the duty on KN001 is the effect it will have on jobs in my home state of West Virginia. DuPont is in the process of constructing a $20 million revitalization project at their plant in Belle, West Virginia, and KN001 is the cornerstone of that project. The new investment will enable the production at Belle of a new sulfonylurea product family that uses KN001 as a feedstock. This revitalization project will preserve 50 existing jobs at Belle and create over a dozen new jobs. 
On top of all that, I've been told that this duty suspension is unlikely to result in any substantial revenue loss to the U.S. Treasury. Because it is used in the manufacture of new products, U.S. imports of this chemical are very small, and the resulting duty is also small. Equally important is the fact that this substance is not manufactured in the United States by another company, so no U.S. producer should be disadvantaged by the duty suspension. It's rare that we get a chance to support legislation that benefits workers, farmers, and the environment at virtually no cost to the Treasury. This is one of those times, and I hope the Senate will look favorably on this modest measure at the appropriate time.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to reflect on the positive results of our country's growing commitment to equal opportunities for women in college sports and to the elimination of discrimination in our Nation's educational programs. During this time of commemorating the 25th anniversary of title IX, Americans recognize the success of our Nation's athletes as they continue to grow both on the field and in the classroom. 
I take this opportunity to commend the achievement of women in college and university sports and to support their advancement in the athletic world. Expanded opportunities for women as a result of title IX have enabled more young women from all arenas to challenge themselves and each other, develop the competitive spirit, and truly enrich their academic lives. 
In West Virginia, title IX's impact on college and university sports is made clear by the success of their women's athletic programs. It pleases me to see the competitive spirit grow within West Virginia and to include the aspirations of our daughters as well as our sons. I am proud to commend our individual athletes who deserve praise for their constant and persistent efforts. 
Over the past years, West Virginia's fine institutions that include, to cite just one example, Bluefield State College, in Bluefield, WV, have given scholarship money that significantly increased participation in women's athletics. Alderson-Broaddus College in Phillipi, WV, in this past year alone has had an award-winning WVIAC women's softball team, with players like Laura Granger, who balances a competitive sports schedule, her honors GPA, and her enrollment in a difficult sports medicine program. 
At the University of Charleston [UC], the Golden Eagles Volleyball Team complied an impressive 29-4 record in 1996 and continues to strive toward success. UC's basketball team is also on the high rise with athletes like Jodie Prenger, who plays Division II basketball and spends the rest of her time devoted to academics. 
With a devotion to the team and to their own growth as individuals, these women athletes will provide role models for our future daughters. I can see how perseverence learned in athletics contributes to the academic lives of these high-achieving students. 
I am pleased to hear of the progress we as a State have made by supporting greater opportunities for women in sports, and I want to continue to honor such dedication on the parts of our athletes and school administrators who prize and promote such equality. As the struggle to root out discrimination from all realms of life continues, I am very proud to say West Virginia is a strong part of the extraordinary progress that America is celebrating during title IX's anniversary year.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to reject the amendment offered by Senator Brownback that is designed to weaken a program absolutely critical to the country's technological strength. I thought that the fact that this bill contains the $200 million in funds needed for the Advanced Technology Program was a sign that we could finally get past a debate that is nothing but a distraction and a danger to our own economy. 
I stand here today just as I did last year and the year before to defend this program--this investment in America's economic competitiveness. As I, along with many others in this Chamber, have stated before, this program supports American industry's own efforts to develop new cutting edge, next-generation technologies--technologies that will create the new industries and jobs of the 21st century. 
Let me remind my colleagues that ATP does not, and I repeat, does not fund the development of commercial products. Instead, this program provides matching funds to both individual companies and joint ventures for pre-product research on high risk, potentially high payoff technologies. 
The Senate should give credit to Secretary of Commerce Daley, and let us work with him through the authorization process to improve the program. Secretary Daley just met his pledge to conduct a 60-day review of the program to assess the ATP's performance and the criticisms that have been levied against it. 
Sure enough, his review took into account comments provided by both critics and supporters of ATP. The Department of Commerce notified more than 3,500 interested parties, soliciting comments about ATP. In fact, Senators Lieberman, Domenici, Frist, and I joined together and provided 1 of the 80-plus comments the Department received. 
I commend Secretary Daley for the job he did in undertaking this review. As we all know, there is not a department or program that can't be improved. And as a long time and avid supporter of ATP, I believe that after 6 years of operation, experience shows us some areas that indeed can be improved. This review has done just that. I agree with his suggestion to place 
more emphasis on joint-ventures and consortia and more emphasis on small and medium-size single applicants. I also support his proposal to shift the cost-share ratio for large single applicants to 60 percent, and I will further review his suggestions to encourage state participation. 
As ranking Democrat on the Science and Technology Subcommittee, which has oversight of the ATP, I look forward to working with my colleague Senator Frist to review this report and to make any necessary legislative changes during consideration of legislation to reauthorize the Technology Administration. 
Secretary Daley's review could not have been done at a better time. As I stated, this program has been in existence for 6 years, and this review was conducted on those 6 years of experience. The proposals set forth in this review strengthen a very strong program that is one of the cornerstones to the Nation's long-term economic prosperity. 
Some of us in the Senate, Senator Hollings, Senator Burns, Senator Lieberman, and myself, to name just a few, have been fighting every year for the past 4 years to keep the ATP alive. We welcomed the Secretary's review because we knew that it would validate the arguments we've been making for the past 4 years. A new element also is emerging in this debate that is validating what we have been saying. That new element is the success stories that are finally emerging. The mere ideas receiving grant money 4, 5, and 6 years ago are now technologies entering the market place and enhancing our economy and our livelihood. 
Let me close with some success stories that are starting to emerge. 
In Michigan for example, there are already two success stories, the first relating to the auto industry and the second relating to bone marrow transplants. 
In September 1995, an ATP-funded project, the `2 millimeter (2mm) program,' was completed. As a result of this grant, new manufacturing technologies and practices that substantially improve the fit of auto body parts during automated assembly of metal parts was developed. This technology has substantially improved the fit of auto body parts during assembly, resulting in dimensional variation at or below the world benchmark of 2 millimeters, the thickness of a nickel. What does this mean for this Nation's economy? It means that U.S. auto manufacturers can make cars and trucks with less wind noise, tighter fitting doors and windshields, fewer rattles, and higher customer satisfaction. In addition, there is a cost savings between $10 and $25 per car to the consumer, and maintenance cost savings is estimated between $50 and $100 per car. In addition, this improved quality is estimated to give the U.S. auto manufacturers a 1- to 2-percent gain in market share. Equally important is that this newly developed 
technology is applicable in the sheet metal industry, and industries as diverse as aircraft, metal furniture fabrication, and appliance manufacturing. Quality improvement from this technology could result in an increase in total U.S. economic output of more than $3 billion annually. 
In 1992, Aastrom Biosciences, a 15-person firm in Ann Arbor, MI, proposed a bioreactor that would take bone marrow cells from a patient and within 12 days produce several billion stem, white, and other blood cells--cells that can be injected into the patient to rapidly boost the body's disease-fighting ability. The technology looked promising but was too risky and long-term at that point to obtain significant private funding. 
The national benefit of this program was that it provided a reliable device that would allow blood cells from a patient to be grown in large quantities would reduce health care costs, require fewer blood transfusions, and greatly improve the treatment of patients with cancer, AIDS, and genetic blood diseases. Aastrom submitted a proposal identifying the economic opportunity and technical promise, and in 1992 the ATP co-funded a research project that developed a new prototype bioreactor. Today, after completing the ATP project and proving the technology, the company has over 60 employees, and another 30 providing contract services, a practical prototype, and over $36 million in private investment to develop their new blood cell bioreactor into a commercial product. 
In North Carolina, Cree Research of Durham, won an ATP award in April 1992 to develop improved processing for growing large silicon-carbide crystals--a semiconductor material used for specialized electronic and optoelectronic devices such as the highly desired blue light-emitting diodes [LED's]. In 1992, this market was limited because of difficulties in growing large, high-quality single crystals. With ATP support, Cree Research was able to double the wafer size, with significant improvements in the quality of the larger wafers. Since 1992, LED sales are up by over 850 percent as a result of the ATP-funded technology. 
In Texas, a company has developed a cost-effective, microchip-based DNA diagnostic testing platform which contains both a family of diagnostic instruments and disposables. This successful prototype has demonstrated single molecule detection at a tenfold throughput advantage over conventional technologies. Numerous patented products will result from this technology in a market--molecular tools for diagnostics--which is expected to reach $2 billion by the year 2004. 
ATP funded projects from 5 and 6 years ago are becoming success stories all across the Nation. 
Mr. President, ATP is working, and the U.S. economy is benefitting; 288 awards have been given thus far, including 104 joint ventures, and 184 single applicants. Small businesses account for 106 awards and are the lead in 28 of the joint ventures. For the $989 million in ATP funding committed by the Federal Government, industry has committed $1.03 billion in cost sharing. The success stories, however, show us Mr. President, that the Federal funding and the cost sharing is just the seed money for enormous contributions to our national economy and our global competitiveness. Necessary seed money that bridges the innovation gap in this country between basic research and emerging technologies. I encourage my colleagues to continue their support of this worthy and successful program, and to reject this amendment that will take us backwards and help our foreign competitors while weakening our own economy.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the junior Senator from West Virginia wishes to continue, a little bit, the comments that were made by the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. Needless to say, the Senator from West Virginia not only wholly agrees with him, but would carry the argument even further. 
The concept of universal service is literally sacred in our country. For the majority of the people of our land, which is rural land, it is the only lifeline they have potentially to the present day and to their future day. They are able to afford certain kinds of rural rates. But if people start to take the universal service fund and use it for any other purpose other than what it was originally intended, the whole system of equality between rural States and urban States, of user States and using States, disappears. The concept of universal service is ended.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is another aspect which worries me greatly. I have heard so many people talk about the importance of technology and the importance of understanding that technology is our future and the fact that so many of the people in our rural areas and in our urban areas are not hooked up to the Internet and hooked up to all of the advantages that technology and the computer brings us. It was with that in mind that during the consideration of the Telecommunications Act, a number of Senators, led by Senator Snowe of Maine, put forward an amendment which would allow, for the very first time, money to be used with the full consent of the carriers, to be used to wire up 116,000 schools in this country, endless numbers of public libraries, enormous numbers of rural health clinics so that they could develop in the practice of telemedicine and other new technologies that are now and will be available. 
If what is being contemplated by those who are working on the reconciliation process is the use of universal service money to plug up a potential shortfall in the spectrum auction, the entire Snowe amendment, which relates to whether or not we are going to have a first- or second-class citizenry in this country --first-class being those who have the money to have computers in their schools and at home and then the second class, and that being the majority, being those who do not--all of that will go down. 
I make the further point that this is not the Government's money. Some may try to argue that it is, but it is money that is paid into a special fund and it is money which is being administered by something called NECA, which is the `national exchange cable association'--I believe that is what it stands for. They are private. They are private. They are a private entity administering this fund. 
This has been through a Senate process where it was agreed to in a bipartisan debate, 98 to 1. It has been through a joint board, FCC process, that is State and FCC together, voting 8 to nothing, and through a further final FCC process, 4 to nothing--unanimous, virtually the entire way through. 
If the budget negotiators use this universal service fund for any purpose other than for the purposes that the universal service fund is meant to be used for, I think it begins a tremendous downfall in not only our future in terms of rural rates, but also in terms of learning and technology. The Vice President of the United States, our former colleague, Albert Gore, said that in his view the Snowe amendment, relating to 116,000 schools, more public libraries and more rural health clinics, was the biggest and most important thing that had happened in education policy in the last 30 years. He may have said, in this century. 
In any event, all of that is in jeopardy, and the resolution, which is being circulated, I hope will be carried by staff members and others who hear the voice of the Senator from North Dakota and myself, to their Senators to know that something called universal service is in dire jeopardy as of this moment, because the tampering with that universal service is now in the bill that may come before us. There has to be a change made. Change is hard to come by. In other words, we really are at the ramparts on this issue. 
I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the next few days could make the difference between every working family getting the benefit of the child care tax credit in the budget--or the benefit of the child credit only going to families earning more than $30,000. The next few days could make the difference between whether or not more than 25,000 West Virginia families get the benefit of child tax credit or not. Nationwide we're talking about almost 5 million families who could get left out if we don't make the child credit fairer to all families. Democrats want all hard working families to get the benefit of the child credit--under the tax bills that passed the House and Senate they won't. As congress and the President try to wrap up the bipartisan budget deal and its family tax cuts, we need to improve the child tax credit so it helps American families that need it most. 
The average family in West Virginia has an income of $27,500. What that means is that about 25,000 West Virginia families won't benefit from the Republican child credit plans under consideration unless we change the tax bills so that all working families share in the benefits of the child tax credit just like middle income families do. The President has a child tax credit proposal that benefits all working families. 
We should adopt it as part of our tax cut package or too many West Virginians and lower-middle income families across the country will be left out. 
For the average hard-working American family to get a direct, real benefit from this year's budget agreement, we need to make sure that all working families get the benefit of the $500 child tax credit. 
Average American families don't have multi-million dollar estates, and they're not playing the stock market. They don't have enough money to invest in IRA's. They go to work every day, often both parents work full time, and they have a tough time paying their bills, putting food on the table, making the mortgage, and seeing to it that their kids grow up safe and healthy. Those are the families who I think this budget agreement should deliver for first and foremost--before we give the wealthy a chance to save tax-free, benefit a handful of the wealthiest Americans with big estates, or provide a capital gains tax cut. 
Extending health care coverage to the children of working families who don't qualify for Medicaid is the other major benefit of this tax bill for working families. 
Right now, we don't know if these families will get real health care coverage from the final agreement, with health care benefits they can count or not. That is another major issue which could be decided in the next few days. I am here to tell my colleagues and the American people that there is simply no choice but for us to stand up for hard working American families and give them the family tax credit they were promised, and the health insurance coverage their children need. 
It defies common sense to allocate $85 billion in net tax cuts--as called for under the bipartisan budget agreement--and leave out the working families who need it most. The President's proposal directly benefits families who work and who pay taxes--it is not welfare--it is the helping hand they need. 
These families deserve to share in the benefits of the tax cut. These families are the families of a rookie cop in West Virginia, a public school teacher, a bank teller, or a fireman. Middle class families deserve a break, so do families who are lower-middle class, and we don't have to choose between them. Working families all can benefit from the child tax credit as it is constructed in the President's child tax credit proposal. It would treat the children of all working families equally--all the families who are working hard and pulling the proverbial wagon should benefit from the child tax credit. 
The Children's Commission unanimously endorsed this kind of child tax credit. This tax bill is where we can deliver. 
I am here to report that in the next few days or over the next few weeks as we complete our work on this historic budget agreement, I will not stop fighting for the families in West Virginia who deserve a child tax break, who deserve health care coverage for their kids, and who deserve our help, now.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am pleased to express my support for S. 1034, the fiscal year 1998 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriation bill, and most particularly for title I, the part of the bill dealing with VA. 
I realize that this has again been a very difficult year for funding issues, with a reduced 602(b) allocation, agency spending being cut by reconciliation measures, and increased competition for what limited funding remained available. The Chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, and the other members of the subcommittee deserve credit for their remarkable efforts with regard to veterans' needs, as evident in this bill. 
Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the budget resolution included proposed reductions in VA spending below the current fiscal year 1997 level, and below what is generally considered the current services level. At the time that the Senate passed the balanced budget resolution, I took strong exception to the proposal funding for veterans. In my view, the budget resolution asked veterans to carry a disproportionate share of the burden to balance the Federal budget. Realizing, too, that slashing discretionary spending--especially for health care--was inappropriate, the Committee on Appropriations [Committee] saw fit to alter the spending priorities for veterans. Instead, the committee was able to increase funding for VA medical care, research, and the State Veterans Home Program. This is a tremendous achievement. While I would always want to increase support for veterans programs further, I am enormously pleased with the result of their efforts, and would like to highlight several accomplishments in particular. 
For health care, the committee recommended $17.02 billion for VA medical care, an increase of $68 million over the President's request. The committee also recognized that VA is to retain, under new authorizing legislation which is part of the budget agreement, the so-called medical care cost recovery [MCCR] collections estimated to reach $604 million in fiscal year 1998. Because collections of these third-party receipts has grown from $267 million in fiscal year 1991 to over $557 million in fiscal year 1996, I am encouraged by VA's ability to generate nonappropriated revenue. I note with caution however, that VA's outpatient billing remains problematic. Along with my colleague, Senator Mikulski, I intend to be attentive to VA's collection activities. 
When combined, the committee's recommendation and the authorization for the retention of insurance moneys bring total discretionary resources for medical care to $17.6 billion. As we proceed with Senate approval of the VA appropriations bill, it is important to note that this amount constitutes an increase of $617 million over current spending. 
I am also particular gratified by the committee's report language on the need for a community-based outpatient clinic [CBOC] in Charleston, the capital of my home State of West Virginia. Indeed, the committee noted that a Charleston CBOC would improve service to more than 27,000 veterans in Kanawha and surrounding counties, including Boone, Putnam, Lincoln, and Logan. Thousands of these veterans reside in rural areas, many miles from the nearest VA medical center. Many of them live in areas with no public transportation, where just a trip to the doctor can take several hours of driving time on winding, mountainous roads. A VA outpatient clinic in this part of West Virginia is long overdue. 
Throughout my tenure on the Committee on Veteran's Affairs, I have witnessed the direct benefits of a strong research program, such as higher quality clinicians and discoveries in prosthetics, cancer, AIDS, and aging. These discoveries directly affect the everyday activities of veterans. After several years of flat funding, I believe that the time has come to increase the VA research appropriation. The Appropriations Committee agreed and included an increase in the VA medical and prosthetic research account. Although the increase--$5 million--is modest, it sends an important signal to the VA research community that we value their work and the direct impact it has on our veterans. 
The increase in research funding will help support important work on the health problems of atomic veterans, Vietnam-era veterans, and gulf war veterans. Over the years, we have witnessed the emergence of special health problems associated with each war. In response, VA researchers have made important gains in the understanding of each of these populations and their clinical needs. Their challenges continue, and we must make sure that their research efforts are well supported. 
I also express my strong support for the committee's action to fully fund the Court of Veterans Appeal's Pro Bono Representation Program. This program is of utmost importance to our Nation's veterans. At a time when the court is experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of appeals filed, it would be devastating to cut the funding of a program that matches up pro bono attorneys with indigent veterans. It is a small program, but it's impact is great. In fact, the Pro Bono Program will be assigning its one thousandth case to a pro bono attorney on July 24, 1997. 
Mr. President, although I am pleased with the overall outcome of this bill, I have concerns about the effect of the bill's appropriation for VA's general operating expenses account. The bill provides for $786 million, which is $41 million below the current budget and $60 million below the budget request. This is a significant cut for VA to absorb, especially at a time when it is still taking VA an average of 135 days to process an original compensation claim. However, as we strive toward deficit reduction, Congress cannot continue to throw money at problems in the absence of effective leadership at agencies to bring about the change that is needed. Sadly, that absence has been profound at the Veterans Benefit Administration in recent years. It is time for VA to manage the benefits process, not just administer it. It is past time for VA to change, in major ways, beginning with the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the recent reports of the Veterans' Claims Adjudication Commission and the National Academy of Public Administration. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt that this is a very exciting time. VA has the potential for meaningful change. Whether it is in the area of a medical care or benefits administration, I believe that, on balance, the Committee on Appropriations has given VA the resources it needs to move forward with much needed reforms. I applaud the leadership of all the members of the Appropriations Committee, and especially those members on the VA-HUD Subcommittee. 
Mr. President, in closing, I express my deepest gratitude to my esteemed colleague, Senator Mikulski, the ranking Democrat on the Senate VA-HUD Subcommittee, for her continued efforts with respect to veterans' programs. This year, as she does every year, Senator Mikulski has shown her unwavering support for veterans. I am pleased to call her my colleague and friend.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize a worthy school in my State. 
The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program annually identifies elementary and middle schools which attain high academic standards, foster an educational community, productive communication and strong leadership, and indicate a hopeful future. These schools are acknowledged for their achievements and held up publicly as models for other schools. 
In testament to West Virginia's strong commitment to education, I am proud that my State contains more blue ribbon schools this year than most others--7 schools out of the 263 honored across the country. Of these, I wish to highlight the achievement of one today: Pleasant Hill Elementary School in Grantsville, WV. 
Pleasant Hill's two-story brick building is tucked among the forests of Calhoun County, far from any city or even a fast-food restaurant. It is a place where West Virginians face many financial challenges, yet those at Pleasant Hill have struggled and succeeded in the face of these obstacles. They see that education is the way to a better future. 
For 8 years, under a community vision that every child must first master a backbone of basic skills, the school has steadily improved its standing. When teachers were not satisfied with math scores, they examined their teaching methods and implemented a new approach which emphasized practicing skills after they were learned. Now Pleasant Hill students placed in the 91 percentile in math. With this strategy, directing attention to one needy area at a time, the whole school has raised itself to a level which deserves notice. 
But the whole community--not just the teachers--has also changed the atmosphere at Pleasant Hill. Under the leadership of administrators like Principal Lawrence Stinn, the faculty and parents see themselves as members of the same team aspiring together to teach the children. When a school community is so united, perhaps the most important aspect of education is already achieved: a sense of optimism. And the Pleasant Hill community certainly has reason to see a bright future. 
During a time when our public schools face innumerable obstacles, it is comforting to see places like Pleasant Hill. They reassure us that, with a little determination, all schools in America can improve. Thus I am pleased to congratulate the accomplishments and continuing efforts of the people of Grantsville. I am proud they are from West Virginia and know that they will continue to represent the best that our State has to offer.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Harrisville Elementary School of Harrisville, WV. This fine public school was recently selected as a 1997 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. It was 1 of 7 elementary schools in my State to receive this prestigious award, and 1 of 38 West Virginia schools that have been recognized since the National Blue Ribbon School Program began in 1982. 
Schools are judged on curriculum, leadership, teaching environment, student performance on standardized tests, parent and community support, graduation rates and post graduation pursuits. Harrisville Elementary's goal is `to educate all students to their maximum abilities.' Although 65 percent of the students are from low socioeconomic backgrounds, a high level of achievement is expected of all students. Along with Principal Marion Roby; teachers, support staff, parents, and community members work together to provide students with quality learning experiences. This dedication to student success and academic excellence is evident in the remarkable growth the students have achieved. Student total battery scores on the CTBS/4 test have increased from the 47th percentile to the 88th percentile. 
Located in the north-central part of the State, Harrisville Elementary School was the first school in Ritchie County to have a networked computer lab where all students have daily scheduled class. The students also participate in STARS (Special Time with At-Risk Students) and take part in GATORS (Guiding Attitudes Toward Outstanding Responsible Students). These two staff designed programs promote life-long decisionmaking skills and build self esteem. The school piloted a comprehensive health program, Know Your Body, which was later adopted by the rest of the country. The school's staff is one of the best in the State with four Ritchie County Teachers of the Year, including the 1996 honoree. 
As a National Blue Ribbon School, Harrisville Elementary School is a role model for other schools across the country on how teachers, administrators, parents and students can work togther to create an educational environment that helps children excel. Everyone in the Harrisville community should be proud of the notoriety that their local institution has achieved. It is my pleasure to publicly congratulate this school for its commitment to academic success. I know that this school will continue its good work and represent West Virginia proudly on a national level.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to further a valuable, mutually beneficial affiliation between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans' Affairs by authorizing a $15 million increase for the DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program. This program encourages health-related research which benefits both veterans and active duty military personnel. In fact, fostering this collaborative relationship was the original intent of the DOD appropriation, back when this program began in 1987. It has been funded every year since then. Funding for this amendment is made available from the Army procurement, specifically, special equipment for user testing. 
Each year, the DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program begins with jointly selected, specific research topics, and the Departments, working together, come up with priorities for research areas and the appropriate funding levels. The VA and DOD jointly designate representatives to oversee the entire process. The result is research which provides a strong, direct link between DOD and VA investigators to pursue research of mutual interest, and facilitates research that follows the natural course of disease or injury in individuals, first as active duty military personnel, and then as veterans. 
I am cosponsoring this amendment with Senator Durbin and Senator Specter who also believe that the joint research program reaps tremendous benefits. I thank the distinguished junior Senator from Pennsylvania for his willingness to reach agreement on this amendment. 
In fiscal year 1997, DOD and VA agreed to spend the funds provided for this program on such areas as a new Environmental Epidemiology Research Center and studies on combat casualty care including bone healing, blood replacement, skin repair, vascular repair, and spinal cord injury. Last year's program also yielded expanded research on prostate cancer and emerging pathogens. 
In addition, I am particularly encouraged by a new research program on psychiatric disease and post-traumatic stress disorder targeted at identifying risk profiles for soldiers who might have a higher probability of developing PTSD. This PTSD-prevention program will be developing methods to screen potential combat-ready soldiers for PTSD. As the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed the devastating effects of PTSD on the lives of former military personnel, and I am enormously encouraged by research which may prevent the onset of PTSD. 
Because of the collaborative nature of the joint program, this amendment does not specify research areas for focus. Rather, it leaves that decision with the Departments. Given the number of unanswered questions surrounding the illnesses and health problems of gulf war veterans, however, I am optimistic the DOD and VA will want to pursue more research in this area to help identify effective treatments and recognize the battlefield risks that our troops face in today's warfare. This research would not only address the current health problems of gulf war veterans, it will also help identify prevention measures for future deployments. As the nature of war changes, the modern military must cope with threats that include environmental hazards and possible biological or chemical warfare, as well as the more traditional hazards of combat. Research is needed to ensure that we are ready to meet these new risks.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to take a moment to pay tribute to a very special West Virginian, Coach James G. Lilly of Oak Hill, who recently passed away after coaching the Oak Hill Red Devils for 27 years. 
Coach Lilly was a dedicated high school basketball coach and a true humanitarian. He retired in 1989 ranking third on the State's all-time high school winning list, with a career record of 591-291. Coach Lilly led the Oak Hill Red Devils to two class AAA State championships in 1984 and 1989, and his Red Devils were runners-up in the 1969 and 1986 tournaments. 
However, there was much more to this three-time coach of the year than just winning basketball games. Jim Lilly tirelessly worked to fulfill many of his players' human needs. He gave generously of himself, looking out for his players in the southern coalfields of West Virginia. 
Coach Lilly became a father figure to hundreds of young teens throughout his 38-year career. `He knew that certain kids needed certain things, a little extra food or maybe an extra dollar . . . he looked out for you and he was very giving . . . my dad died when I was 9 and he was the most pivotal older male in my life,' said Sam Calloway, a former player and now coach. 
He was a man of dignity, a man of class, a man of compassion, and he will be deeply missed by the community and coaching profession. Lilly's dignity was not only displayed through his life, but through his players' lives. In six State tournament appearances, the Oak Hill Red Devils won five sportsmanship trophies in the eighties. `Sportsmanship was a direct reflection of the coach,' said Calloway, `and when we were on the floor, we represented him.' 
His contemporaries had an even greater respect for his coaching genius. He was devoted to the game and devoted to the kids he worked with. Coach Lilly demanded a standard of excellence that is unsurpassed in West Virginia's coaching ranks. 
Coach James G. Lilly reminded all of us about the importance of sportsmanship. He was dedicated to the game, but more importantly, he was dedicated to the young athletes. His death is certainly a loss to West Virginia. He will long be remembered.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill that would restore funding for bioassay testing of atomic veterans. I urge all of my colleagues to join in support of this important measure. 
In my role as the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have heard firsthand of the difficulties experienced by veterans exposed to ionizing radiation during their military service when they have tried to get their radiation-related diseases service connected by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The main reason for this difficulty is the sometimes impossible task of accurately reconstructing radiation dosage. 
The law currently distinguishes between two groups of veterans: those who warrant presumptive service connection for their radiation-related conditions because of their participation in an atmospheric nuclear test, the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or their internment as a prisoner of war in Japan during World War II, which resulted in possible exposure to ionizing radiation--and those who may have been exposed to ionizing radiation in service under other circumstances, such as service on a nuclear submarine. Those veterans who do not receive presumptive service connection and suffer from radiogenic diseases must prove their exposure to radiation by having the VA and DOD attempt to reconstruct their radiation dose through military records. VA looks to the DOD to perform these dose reconstructions. 
This amendment is so important because the White House Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Activities has acknowledged that there are inadequate records to determine the precise amount of radiation to which a veteran was exposed, and what the long-term risks associated with that exposure are. As of September 1996, VA had only granted service connection to 1,977 out of 18,896 veterans who had filed claims based on participation in all radiation-risk activities. VA estimates that it has granted fewer than 50 claims of veterans who did not receive presumptive service connection. 
This amendment would authorize $300,000 for the completion of the third and final phase of Brookhaven National Laboratory's testing of radiation-exposed veterans. Brookhaven's fission tracking analysis could provide a more accurate measure of an individual's internal radiation dosages. I have contacted VA in support of the Brookhaven project in the past. VA's response indicated that it is the Department of Defense, not the VA, who has the responsibilty to provide dose estimates for veterans exposed to ionizing radiation. That is why we must restore funding to the Brookhaven project in the DOD authorization bill. 
As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have seen the struggles of America's atomic veterans and their survivors. I have heard testimony of the veterans who bravely served in our military, and who are now sick and dying and cannot get the compensation they have earned by their service to our country. These veterans were placed in harm's way, sworn to secrecy, and abandoned by their government for many years. It is critical that we search for a better way to assess their exposure to radiation. It is vital that we restore funding to a program that can renew hope to atomic veterans and their families.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. This amendment would better coordinate DOD's and VA's response to Persian Gulf war illnesses and would provide a plan to better protect the health of our troops during future deployments. 
At the outset, it is important to note that DOD and VA have made a lot of progress on the important issues surrounding the illnesses suffered by veterans of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war. They have coordinated their efforts in areas of evaluation, research, and outreach in ways that will benefit gulf war veterans as well as veterans of future deployments. But I think we all agree that there is still much to be done. This amendment builds on the coordination and progress that has been made so far. Therefore, I encourage all of my colleagues to join in support of this important measure. 
As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed firsthand the human costs of the gulf war. It is my belief, and that of many others, that the casualties of this war continued long after the battles were over. This is true of many wars, but the chronic health problems of many of the men and women who served in the gulf war have been particularly devastating as they have had to continue to fight to be heard and to get the care and benefits they have earned. Their battles should have been over by now, but their struggles are still ongoing. This amendment would go a long way to help address some of their concerns, and it puts some measures in place so that hopefully, we will not repeat our mistakes with the next deployment. 
This amendment is important because it would require a joint plan from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for providing appropriate health care for veterans of the gulf war, including those serving in Reserve units. It would require that this care be appropriate to the specific health problems or illnesses of gulf war veterans and that the quality and effectiveness of their health care be carefully monitored. 
This amendment also attempts to address some of the lessons we have learned form the gulf war. It calls for DOD to improve medical tracking of service members deployed overseas in contingency or combat operations through the use of pre- and post-deployment medical examinations and through improved recordkeeping of immunization and health records. It calls for a plan to improve collection and maintenance of troop location information so we can better reconstruct risks and exposure data when unanticipated exposures such as Khamisiyah occur. It also would provide that service members receive timely notice of use of unapproved or investigational drugs, and it would require adequate record keeping of the administration of such drugs. 
This amendment would authorize $4.5 million for the funding of clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols for gulf war veterans who present with ill-defined or undiagnosed conditions. It would call for a review of the previous Federal research efforts examining gulf war illnesses, as well as recommendations for the direction of future research efforts. 
In my rule as ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed the struggles of America's gulf war veterans. I have heard their testimony in our hearings and I have met with them in hospitals and in their homes. I have received testimony from representatives from DOD and VA and I have heard their concerns and explanations. The course of events stemming from the gulf war, the resulting health problems, and our Federal response have contributed to a lack of public trust on this issue. This amendment is a step toward making things right and restoring our veterans' trust. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment and I encourage my colleagues to support it as well.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in preventing unnecessary injuries and illness among the men and women who serve in our Nation's military forces. The risks that these brave men and women face in combat are reduced through superior equipment and excellent training, but some risks remain unavoidable. As we continue to learn from the lessons of the gulf war, 6 years after the battle, the complete risks of military service are still not known. Thus, it is simple common sense to ensure that we do all we can to prevent those risks outside of combat that are foreseeable. One such foreseeable and preventable risk is eye injury on military firing ranges. 
I thus propose an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill, the military eye injury assessment amendment. This amendment would address a military public health and prevention issue that was brought to my attention by a retired Air Force optometrist, Dr. John Meinhold. Dr. Meinhold was concerned about the rate of eye injuries that occurred in the Armed Services, particularly at military firing ranges. Unlike other public and private firing ranges throughout the country, military firing ranges do not require the mandatory use of safety eyewear to prevent eye injuries. Most, if not all, eye injuries at firing ranges could be completely prevented with a very inexpensive and low technology intervention, safety eyewear. 
The requirement for protective eyewear at public and private firing ranges is a liability issue, rather than one controlled by State or Federal regulations. However, there is no threat of liability for the armed services because of the so-called Feres doctrine, which is based on a Supreme Court decision that ruled that service members generally cannot sue the Government for injuries occurred during service. These unnecessary eye injuries potentially affect military readiness, and in cases of severe injury, a soldier's military career may be suddenly ended. The lifetime costs of a single catastrophic eye injury has been estimated to be $1 million per eye by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the human costs are immeasurable. 
A study by the Army found that eye injury data are not always tracked at the local level, and minor eye injuries may not always be reported to safety offices. It is estimated that while 90 percent of all eye injuries are preventable, the incidence of wartime eye injuries has increased steadily over the last 20 years. 
Given these statistics and the human costs of such injuries, I wrote the Department of Defense earlier this year to ask about this important safety issue. After a series of letters and inquiries, the official response I received was that no further action was needed to prevent eye injuries since DOD officials had determined that the risk was too low to warrant spending funds on prevention. In reviewing the Department of Defense's very own statistics and studies, and in talking with their health professionals, I cannot come to the same conclusion. 
Any preventable injury that puts our service men and women at risk is sufficient for our concern, especially when it is one which is as easily prevented as this one. Even one service member who suffers from a permanent eye injury at a firing range is one too many when that injury could have been avoided. I am proposing that we simply assess whether our military firing ranges should be brought up to the same safety standard that all other firing ranges in our country must meet. 
My amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to provide funding for a 6-month study of eye safety at military firing ranges. This study would evaluate the current medical surveillance of eye injuries at small arms firing ranges across the service branches, and examine current safety reporting practices and other analyses as necessary to establish military eye injury rates and trends. It would also develop a uniform protocol for reporting eye injuries across the service branches. The results would be reported to the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee upon completion of the study. 
I am proud to offer this amendment to protect the safety of the members of our armed services, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their support and their fine staff for helping to perfect this amendment.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the veterans' community is about to lose one of its best and strongest champions--Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse Brown. After 4 years as the Secretary, Jesse Brown is retiring from Government service. He will be deeply missed by millions of veterans and their families, and everyone else who has had the good fortune of working with him. 
Secretary Brown is one of the staunchest advocates the veterans' community has ever known. A veteran himself, injured during the Vietnam war, he articulated passionately and eloquently the needs of veterans, and the obligation of our Government to take care of those who served, often at great personal sacrifice. His oratory could move an audience to tears, and there was never any question but that his concern was genuine and sincere. He truly was a `veterans' veteran,' as he was often called, and he fought to the last to further and protect veterans' best interests. 
Jesse Brown undertook an ambitious agenda as Secretary. Under his watch, the Veterans Health Administration was reorganized into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISNs], the VA health care system began the transition from inpatient to outpatient care, the Veterans Benefits Administration moved to reduce its tremendous backlog of cases, and benefits were extended to Persian Gulf war veterans suffering from undiagnosed illnesses and Vietnam veterans' children born with spina bifida. Most significantly, he was tremendously successful in protecting his department from some of the deep budget cuts suffered by most other Federal agencies. 
Secretary Brown's departure is a great loss. I wish him every success in the years ahead--and I have every confidence that he will succeed in whatever he undertakes.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have talked with Senator Moynihan and with Chairman Roth about what I am now going to say. That is, I am going to vote for the Daschle alternative. It is a more difficult decision if you have been on the Finance Committee, because of what the others who have spoken of which has been referred to as the oath that we took, to support the bill. I view my oath as being upheld, and I say so for the following reasons. 
This is a moral issue with me as well as a political philosophy issue. The piece of paper that we bound ourselves to, I will stick by. I was not satisfied, for example, with the earned income tax credit/child tax credit relationship that came back. I read it to be a certain thing. It did not turn out to be that way. On the other hand, for those eight pieces on that piece of paper--Finance Committee members will know what I am talking about--I did say that I would uphold those on the floor. And I will continue to uphold those. If, for example, a Democrat offers an amendment which would bring the EITC, child care credit, or child tax credit--bring it more in my direction, the way I would like it to be, then I will oppose that even though it is in the best interests of the country, and, I think, the right policy in our country. I will do that because that is what I consider I took my oath of loyalty to. It was not an oath of loyalty in some military sense. It was simply a matter of the way a very complex and difficult, bipartisan committee like the Finance Committee works. If you are bound together and you bind yourself together through the act of raising your hand, et cetera, that has an implication; it expects a response and that response will be forthcoming from me if individual amendments are offered which are related to the deal. 
On the other hand, we have Democrats and we have Republicans in this body and I do think that the Democratic alternative being offered by Leader Daschle--and I greatly respect him and the work he has done on this, in a very trying period in his personal life--is a better alternative. Because I think it is a better alternative, it becomes--although I think that most people would understand it is probably not going to prevail--I think it becomes very important to say this is a better alternative. If we were doing it, if the Democrats had control of this body, this would be more likely the way we would do it. That is the kind of statement I wish to make in making my vote. 
I care very much about what happens to the people of West Virginia. The economy of West Virginia is more fragile, the individual incomes in West Virginia are more fragile, especially as they are particularly young or particularly old, and I have a strong responsibility to that, as I do to my own sense of honor and my own word, within my work in the U.S. Senate and the particular nature of the Finance Committee. 
So I gladly say I am going to be supporting the Daschle amendment because it is the better approach to solving our country's problems. Just as I was very glad, back in 1993 when Chairman Moynihan turned to me and said I want you to cut $59 billion out of Medicare in order to ensure its solvency--I did not say slow the rate of increase, I said cut--and I went ahead and did it. And I helped put our economy in a position where we have been able to do things like provide a tax credit to hard working American families, and a number of other things which have been talked about on the floor. 
But I want to make the reasons for my vote clear. It is something important and delicate because of my respect not only for my Ranking Member Moynihan and Chairman Roth, who has been eminently fair and bipartisan in the way he has conducted the Finance Committee, and his fine staff, all of them have been very fair. I want to make it clear I think the Democratic approach is a better one and I will be voting for it for that reason. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank both my ranking leader and the chairman of the committee. I say to my good friend, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, that having witnessed this process, Senator Hatch fought like a tiger, would not yield in very close quarters, in order to get the additional $8 billion added on for children's health insurance, along with Senator Chafee, myself, and others. I think that ought to be very clear. 
As Senator Chafee said when Senator Chafee and this Senator's bill failed, we managed to raise the standards of the bill to pass to such a degree to being very effective. As for not covering all children, that will be a matter of debate because of the uninsured already eligible and how to get to them. 
I urge support of the committee amendment.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, improvements in health care provide America with a sense of security. Knowing there are advancements in the medical field every day gives people hope that someday we will find cures for cancer, AIDS, leukemia, and other serious diseases. Although these advancements are notable, we cannot forget the small town doctors who are doing their part to help our fellow citizens stay healthy and fight medical problems. 
That is why I take this opportunity to express admiration and appreciation for an outstanding West Virginia physician. Dr. Daniel B. Doyle has recently received the 1997 National Rural Health Association's Practitioner of the Year Award. 
For 20 years, Dr. Doyle has served the health care needs of southern, rural West Virginia. Since 1977, he has directed the New River Family Health Center in Scarbro, WV. As its director, Dr. Doyle developed all the clinical systems, recruited staff, and helped guide the center's institutional policy, budget, and strategic planning. As a result of his tremendous efforts, the center now serves a county of over 50,000 people. 
Today Dr. Doyle is a full-time family physician for the New River Family Health Center. Along with serving as the Director of Medical Education for the New River Health Association, he is also the director of the Fayette, Raleigh, and Nicholas rural health initiative consortium. As a small part of his endeavors with the New River Health Association, Dr. Doyle also works with the Hidden Valley Health Care Center, a 60-bed nursing home. 
One of Dr. Doyle's colleagues, Jacquelynn A. Copenhaver, coordinator of the Rivers and Bridges Rural Health Education Partnerships Consortium, said, `Doyle is involved in his community through his willingness to serve his patients whenever the need arises. He does not hesitate to make home visits, and by making those home visits, he meets the needs of the families of his patients as well as the needs of the patients themselves.' 
I am extremely proud that one of this country's finest doctors is dedicated to serving the people of West Virginia. Knowing that the health of West Virginians is in such capable hands, I have added confidence that the future health of our State and Nation will get better and better.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I point out that this amendment would help seniors making, on an annual basis, between $9,500 a year and $11,900 a year. It would simply take the principles of the Medicaid Program and carry them forward, and simply say those folks deserve to get help in the Medicare payment because they are so desperately poor. This is well established in Medicaid. We are now applying it to a new area and saying, rather than 120 percent of poverty, we are saying 120 percent of poverty to 150 percent of poverty. It is very sensible. It helps people. 
This program is going to sunset in 5 years, but their costs are not going to sunset in 5 years. We think it is an amendment which both sides are willing to vote for.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I urge my colleagues to vote no, against the motion to waive the Budget Act, so that we protect patients in these sorts of very special Medicare Choice programs who, unless we give them the protection, unless we vote no, doctors are going to be able to charge whatever they want. Everybody else under Medicare is under something called balanced billing. Balanced billing means you can only charge 15 percent more than what Medicare pays for it. This was agreed to in 1989 when we did a massive Medicare reform. 
We should not be able to take a sort of special fee for service part of the new Medicare Choice and suddenly say that the doctor can charge them anything they want. They have no protection from balanced billing rules which protects all other people who are under Medicare. And it is the law of the land. It is a very important principle, a very important point. And since we have done this in 1989, since we have put a cap on the balanced billing, which the other side would have us let go, seniors have saved $2 billion since 1989.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I think the majority leader is exactly right, and I congratulate him, as well as Senator Roth and his excellent staff, as well as Senators Chafee, Jeffords and many others who worked on it. 
As the majority leader has indicated, it has been a very laborious, long process in which things sort of just gradually, tectonically moved together, but very, very slowly. 
The point is that we can say now children are going to have good benefits, and that doesn't mean that they have to pick a particular plan. There is not a mandate in this that they have to pick this plan or that plan, but they will be able to get the kinds of benefits that we have as Senators, as Federal workers. 
I think, frankly, we have an obligation to make sure our children have plans. Preventive care, hospital care, doctor care, prescription, vision and hearing is in this. That is very important for early years, preventive care. 
So I think, frankly, it has been extremely complicated, it has taken a long time, but I think it is a good compromise, a good agreement, and I congratulate those who brought it together.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, one thing that occurs to me listening to this debate is that some very, very important principles followed by amendments are being put before the Senate in a context that the American people do not fully understand nor have they any reason to because it has not really been discussed with them. 
In speaking quite honestly, this sort of grew up within the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, and it became a kind of a fluent subject within the Finance Committee. It got a credence--had people for it, had people against it--it got its own momentum, and the Finance Committee was acting apart from the rest of the Senate, and apart from the rest of America. 
I am not by definition innately opposed to means testing but I am oppose to doing things before they receive what I call a larger consideration, which I think falls into the commission on Medicare which is what I introduced as a bill 2 years ago. It seems to me when you are dealing with something in a State, for example, like West Virginia, where the average senior citizen income is $10,700 a year, you really do not make decisions like this--or like a number of other issues that have been before us --without a larger discussion with the American people, a larger context being placed before the American people. We have traditionally done that with major pieces of legislation. 
This discussion has come out of a kind of sanctuary of privileged discussion. I am not saying it is not without merit at some point, but I do not think it is at this point, because of the absence of the larger discussion of the American people. When you are dealing with people that have $10,700 a year to live on, every deductible, every single decision about a means test, all of it counts, and it really does in human terms. I am not being evasive. I am simply reflecting what a whole lot of people in this country are very afraid of. 
So my plea would be that we would not let up on this but that we would continue this, but in the larger context of the commission on the future of Medicare, which I think is the only place to really do that. That reflects not just my feeling about this amendment but other amendments that I have voted on during the course of the day in a way which I might not vote on after a commission had discussed it and a national discussion had been held. That has not taken place to this point. It is kind of a privileged conversation, and it is not one I am entirely comfortable with on behalf of the people I represent.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from the State of Rhode Island. My comments on the amendment, this Senator's comments, would echo those of the Senator from Rhode Island. 
In the present bill before us, there is a requirement that benefits provided be actuarially equivalent to the benefits provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or FEHBP, it sounds good. But, in fact, since there are so many plans out there, you do not know what kind of benefits that is going to get you. Actuarial equivalence simply guarantees a dollar amount that the insurance for each child has to add up to. It does not specify an actual level or set of benefits, which is the true meaning of decent and necessary health insurance. In fact, the child could very well not get inpatient services or not get outpatient services or not receive prescription drugs. Our amendment ties benefits that would need to be provided to a child to a specific health plan that is available under FEHBP. Sixty percent of Federal workers select the BC/BS standard PPO option. Our amendment says that benefits provided to children must be at least up to that level, plus vision and hearing. We want our children to get hospital care, we want them to get primary care, we want them to get preventive care. Basic protections that a majority of Federal workers choose for their own families. 
The cost sharing requirements in our amendment would also set a standard that would allow nominal cost sharing for families with incomes under 133 percent of poverty. For children in families with incomes above 133 percent of poverty, the Secretary must certify that the cost sharing requirements are reasonable. 
Mr. President, GAO did a study that found that several States fell short in terms of providing adequate benefits. Alabama only provides outpatient care. Pennsylvania, which has been a national model, provided only limited inpatient care. According to a NGA survey of 30 statewide voluntary programs, only 8 States provide dental care, only 11 States provide hospital care, only 14 provide vision care, and less than half cover physical therapy services. 
With the fresh infusion of Federal dollars that the Senate Finance Committee is choosing to commit and spend on health insurance for children, there needs to be an assurance that the benefits provided are adequate and geared to meet the health needs of children. Under the proposal before us, the Federal Government will be picking up more than half of the costs of children's health insurance.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Could I just point out one thing? I want to compliment the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and his staff because they were, in fact, as I understand it seriously considering accepting a version of our amendment. It was not ultimately accepted apparently because some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not want to have hearing and vision services included in the benefits package. I deeply regret that. This really is a good amendment, does deserve support, and reflects thinking on both sides.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I don't pretend to speak for the chairman of the Finance Committee, but I think it would be helpful to the Senator's concern by expressing this. 
There are 10 million uninsured children in this country, and that was deemed to be unacceptable. The first approach was to try and insure 5 million children. That is what the $16 billion was for, to try to get the first 5 million uninsured children covered. This came from the Senator's side of the aisle in the Finance Committee. We thought that maybe we could go beyond that and approach beyond 5 million. But to be quite honest, I think as we have gone our way through this process, we have come to understand that we can't judge exactly what the States are going to do and we can't be entirely sure. So the CBO is now beginning to give us figures that suggest we won't be able to reach the 5 million children mark, perhaps even with both the $16 billion and the $8 billion program. But then again, we are not sure. But we know we have to try because having uninsured children is not acceptable in America. It is not a question of throwing money at a problem or suddenly a discovery of a new source of money. There was simply the desire that we ought to get health insurance to the 10 million children who do not have it. We worked within the Finance Committee to try to accomplish that.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will further yield, I simply say that I really don't think this was a money chase where, in trying to find a solution, they had to go find the problem. The problem was there. One of the most outstanding problems, which is vexatious, is there are 3 million children out there right now who are eligible for Medicaid, but their families do not know; they do not know that they are in fact eligible for Medicaid. So part of the problem was, how do you find, through various public and State agencies, those 3 million children across the country who are already eligible?

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator up front, the Senator is asking for kind of an exactitude in an area where exactitude is really very difficult, which is the whole area of the uninsured--how much it would cost? Where are they? How long will they be on Medicaid or insurance? When will they go off? Does the State know about it? Will the State, under a block grant money program, take children already on Medicaid and substitute that money, thus freeing the other money? I can't worry about that. 
I have faith in the chairman of the Finance Committee. I think this was a bipartisan decision to do something about a problem that has been with us throughout our history, which is no longer deemed acceptable. The Senator is entirely correct when he says there are no simple answers. I want to assure the Senator--because I sat through, obviously, all the Finance Committee meetings, both public and private--there was never an attempt to sort of grab at money for the purpose of saying let's put that toward health insurance for children. It was a sense that we have a real problem here and we want to try to 
address it as responsibly and carefully as possible. That was followed by a bipartisan discussion and agreement.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, tomorrow is a special day for me, as well as my fellow West Virginians. On June 20, 134 years ago, the citizens of West Virginia separated from Virginia and formed the 35th State to join the Union. 
They had a saying back then, and it was so popular they made it the state motto. Our motto is `Mountaineers Are Always Free.' In fact, freedom is what West Virginia is all about, but attaining freedom is often a challenge. I would like to take a moment to recognize our Mountaineer forefathers for their courage in leaving the Old Dominion State and taking up the struggle for the freedom of all Americans. I commend these people as well as all West Virginians who have fought for freedom and liberty by serving our country. I mention this because it is in this spirt that our great State was born and still lives. It is this unbridled love of freedom that is alive in all our people as well as our beautiful environment. One can observe it in the ravishing yet perilous gushing rapids of the New and Gauley Rivers, as well as the snow-covered Appalachian Mountains, which test the resolve of thousands of visitors each year. If one were to have the chance encounter with the majestic black bear or cast a fishing line into one of our crystal clear lakes, they would quickly come to an appreciation of the freedom we West Virginians hold dear. 
Times also have changed. While the once-rudimentary log cabin has been replaced by the modern home, full of televisions, microwaves, and computers, the values of West Virginians have remained much the same. There is a dedication that can be seen in the work of our miners, who produce an inexpensive energy source that drives not only the economy of West Virginia but the steel mills of Pittsburgh as well as powerplants all across America. Whether it is the extra assistance of a park ranger, or the friendly smile of a checkout clerk, there is no doubt that there exists a pride and dedication in West Virginians second to none. 
It is for these reasons as well as many more that I'm proud to be a West Virginian. So it is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this 134th West Virginia Day.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Birth Defects Prevention Act and want to urge all of my colleagues to join in support of this important measure. I am especially pleased that the legislative logjam that prevented the Senate's consideration of the bill earlier this week has now been broken, permitting us to do the work of the Senate. 
In my roles as the president of the National Commission of Children and cochair of the Health Alliance, I have had occasion to learn firsthand of the daily struggles of families of children with birth defects. These parents must be tireless advocates for their children each and every day to ensure that their child's health and education needs are met and to see that their child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. The struggles that these families face in their fight to get adequate insurance coverage for their children's medical needs are trials that no parent or child should have to endure. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that in many cases, these birth defects could have been prevented, if only the parents had access to information on adequate nutrition and to quality prenatal care, or if our researchers had adequate funding to pursue their questions. That's exactly why this bill is so important. 
The Birth Defects Prevention Act would authorize $42 million for the establishment of a comprehensive national system of birth defects prevention programs with oversight by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would provide for a national, State-based birth defects surveillance system. It would authorize funding and CDC expertise to establish regional prevention research centers, as well as local prevention and intervention programs. It would also establish a national advisory committee on birth defects and a National Information Clearinghouse on Birth Defects. 
This legislation is important because at the present time, less that half our States have a birth defects surveillance system. This has greatly limited our understanding of birth defects as well as our ability to prevent them. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, responsible for one out of every five infant deaths. Each year, 150,000 children are born with a serious birth defect. Birth defects are also the leading cause of childhood disability. Yet despite the high numbers of babies born each year with birth defects, we still do not know the causes of most birth defects. The establishment of a national tracking system would significantly advance our scientific understanding of birth defects. 
As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have seen the struggles of men and women who worry that exposures to chemical agents they may have encountered in military service in Vietnam or the Persian Gulf may have contributed to birth defects in their children. I have heard testimony of men and women who bravely served in our military and who now are afraid to start a family or have more children because of these fears. The Institute of Medicine reported an association among our Vietnam veterans between exposure to Agent Orange and a greater risk of having a child with spina bifida. Now we are faced with the very difficult and emotional question of whether there is an increased rate of birth defects among gulf war veterans. The studies are underway, but none has provided a clear answer that will adequately address our concerns. The studies will continue, but some of our difficulty in answering questions about veteran populations has to do with our poor understanding of birth defects. This legislation will help with these issues by increasing our scientific understanding of birth defects and increasing current prevention efforts in all populations. Therefore, I am proud to cosponsor this important bill.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note with great sadness the departure of someone who had become a veritable institution on the staff of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--minority general counsel, William E. Brew. 
Bill retired from the Committee on April 4, 1997--19 years and 1 day after he came for what he believed, at the time, was a less than 2-year commitment. How fortunate we all have been that those 2 years stretched out for almost 2 decades! 
When Bill joined the committee staff as associate counsel in April 1978, the Committee was still fairly young--it had only been established in 1971. So, the fact is, Bill has been with the Committee for almost as long as the Committee itself has been in existence. Ask him about any piece of legislation that came before the committee during his tenure, and he can most likely give you a blow-by-blow description of its legislative history, the major players involved, subsequent modifications, etc. Everyone who has heard of Bill's departure has commented on how great the loss of his institutional memory will be. 
Bill is truly a fountain of knowledge about veterans legislation. But his is no dry history lesson. Bill is a wonderful storyteller, whose recounting of the past is full of humor and the little details that bring those events to life. 
And no one shares his knowledge more generously and willingly than Bill. He is a gifted teacher. Countless young--and not so young--legislative staffers have benefited from his unique expertise. Bill's patience is legendary. No matter how many times he explained something, he was always willing to take time to go over it again. His mentoring of younger staffers was particularly meaningful to many with whom he discussed not only work issues, but life goals and philosophies. 
Bill anchored the committee through times of change. He saw the committee through several shifts of control from Democratic to Republican Congresses, and although a committed Democrat himself, won the respect and appreciation of both Democratic and Republican chairmen alike. He was tremendously helpful to me at the time I assumed chairmanship of the committee in 1993. He has truly been a mainstay of the committee. 
Bill is a graduate of Notre Dame (B.A.) and Catholic University School of Law (J.D.), a two-term veteran of the Navy, including 18 months duty in Vietnam, and a devoted family man, the father of five children. He is a role model of old-fashioned values--honesty, integrity, fairness, service to others, modesty. He is a true team player. He never claimed the spotlight, but was always there, behind the scenes, to offer his wise counsel, expert guidance, and astute judgment. 
Bill thoroughly understood the legislative process and was a highly effective advocate for veterans. He is a master of negotiation, able to sort through complex issues and focus on realistic solutions that weigh the ideal vs. the attainable. Whether or not they agreed with him on an issue, all who dealt with him knew him to be fair-minded, balanced, and an often calming voice of reason in the heat of intense discussions that shaped important legislation. 
Bill's accomplishments are many. Most significant among them are legislation leading to establishment of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals for judicial review of veterans claims, and the Veterans' Claims Adjudication Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the claims process; expansion of programs relating to the readjustment needs of Vietnam and post-Vietnam veterans, including creation of a National Center on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; implementation of several initiatives to address the problem of nurse shortages at VA hospitals; changes in VA's procedures responding to the needs of women veterans sexually assaulted while on active duty; and revision of VA health care eligibility rules. He also collaborated with the General Accounting Office to design and conduct a study evaluating the supervision of VA surgical residents, and then worked with VA to carry out recommended changes leading to increased quality of surgical care. 
Bill left behind big shoes to fill. He is enormously missed by all of us who worked with him.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues an opinion piece from Eric Behnamou, Chairman and CEO of 3Com Corp., regarding the Federal Communications Commission's [FCC] May 7th decision regarding universal service and the Snowe- Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment. 
While this op-ed piece speaks for itself, I think it is good to note the interest and support of business leaders for education technology and the specific initiative to link classrooms and libraries to the information superhighway. Thoughtful business leaders understand the importance of computer literacy. A California study estimated that 60 percent of the new jobs by the year 2000 will require skills possessed by only 22 percent of workers--clearly we must do better. I believe that linking up our classrooms will help a great deal.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a historical milestone in my state of West Virginia. In 1797, Brooke County, named after Gov. Robert Brooke of Virginia, was officially born. I take this opportunity to congratulate Brooke County on its bicentennial celebration. 
Brooke County, located in the northern Panhandle of West Virginia, was created from part of Ohio County. The first session of the Brooke County court took place in the home of William Sharpe on May 23, 1797. Since that day, the residents of Brooke County have played a vital role in the development of West Virginia and the Nation. Its residents fought to protect our Nation in the War of 1812 and to keep it intact in the Civil War. They founded Brooke Academy, the first educational institution on the Ohio River, south of Pittsburgh and west of the Alleghenies. However, they are not only sound in body and mind, but also in their souls, as the Christian Church, the Disciples of Christ, and the Church of Christ all have their early roots in 19th century Brooke County. 
From the Duval Glass House, the first glasshouse in West Virginia, to the delicious Grimes golden apples, the residents of Brooke County have been steeped in a tradition of innovation. Their accomplishments are numerous and far-reaching. Part of the highly industrialized Ohio Valley, Brooke County has seen its innovation at work, as their industries have grown from early paper bag and marble manufacturers to a variety of steel industries including the most modern steel coating mill in the world. 
On behalf of all citizens from the Mountain State, I would like to once again commend Brooke County on its 200th birthday and ask that my distinguished colleagues join with me in recognizing its rich history of accomplishments and innovation.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I was listening to his speech. It was very interesting. 
Mr. President, I should say at the beginning, I am an original cosponsor, of Senator Kerry's bill, and proud to be the second on a distinguished list. I think there is a tendency in this body, when we do something for children--let's say we do a tax credit or we do something in Head Start or where we do something in health care--to say that we made a dent and we can go on the next issue in the next year. I think of all the areas of life that we deal with in the Senate, that is the most inaccurate assessment and approach. When it comes to what our children need to prepare for their futures and what they are going to be like as adults, we need to follow through. And we must begin in the earliest years. 
I spent a number of years in Japan. In Japan, when a baby is born, and while the baby is growing to a certain age, they do not have cribs. They do not have cribs, because in Japan the baby sleeps between the mother and the father. Why is that so? That is so because they, as a matter of culture and history and instinct, know that bonding has to start at the beginning. That is about the clearest form of bonding that there can be. 
But even before that, there is a Japanese word called taikeo, in which the pregnant mother talks to--and this is standard in Japan--they talk to the baby in the womb on a regular basis. That would make a fairly strange sight, I guess, walking down the streets of Washington, DC, or West Virginia. But the Japanese understand something that Senator Kerry showed with his graphics there about the two brains, that we clearly don't. They understand when you are looking at the raising of children and their future, you have to take a holistic approach. You have to start with early childhood development. You have to follow through, and keep providing the support, education and development support. And you must keep at it. That is both enormously frustrating, but, in a nation which purports to care about its children, it is absolutely essential that we understand that helping children and strengthening families is an unending job. The work on behalf of children is never finished, no matter how much we do. In the private sector, as individual parents, it is not good enough. No matter what we do in the public sector, there will be more that could and should be done if we are serious about the real definition of children's future--and we must be for their sake, and the sake of our society. 
I spent, as I have said before, as this Senator said before on this floor, 4 years as the chairman of the National Commission on Children. We took a comprehensive look at children's needs--income security, health care, education, values, and the effects of media. We did everything, and we came out of it with a unanimous report. I picked the name for the publication that we put out. I liked it. It was called Beyond Rhetoric. That is what we have to come to terms with in this body, that we are very good at the rhetoric. In fact, on children--our rhetoric tends to be more bipartisan than other subjects which is good. And we actually do some good things, insofar as the public has any role in that, as apart from parental responsibility and even children's responsibility to themselves. 
But we are in a huge new world of responsibilities as parents, which I am as a private citizen and concerned father. I am also public citizen and a Member of the Senate. I have obligations to children as both a private citizen and member of my community, and as a public official as well. We are just not going to get off easily if we accept the challenge to move beyond rhetoric and really do something for children. 
So I think on this floor, we are going to have to start thinking about those graphs, about those two brains. They are studies of contrasts--both kids' brains, one kid getting attention, one kid not getting attention. What a difference it makes. 
I will say another final thing. We do not purport or believe that we are doing everything for the future now with this amendment. What we are trying to do here is a reserve clause to capture the attention of the people. An argument that gets used here often, but not very effectively, is extremely compelling in this case--we need to take action because of the children, but we also need to act to save money for the taxpayers in the future. 
We hear that a lot. People discount it. They say, `That's nice that for Head Start, you save $10 for every dollar you put in now.' But, we have to spend the money now, to save the long-term costs of neglecting our children's early development. That is what our problem is. We are in a budget resolution here. 
But in the case of children, we are talking about spending billions and billions of dollars more on crime and remedial education, if we do not do the right thing in the early years for children. 
Senator Kerry has focused on the zero-through-6 period. He is doing that with an intensity, with a passion which is absolutely unmatched and which attracted me. I tend to be a Member who votes against amendments on this floor to protect the integrity of this budget deal, which I think we have to adopt. But I feel so strongly that he is on the right track and he is doing the right thing and that I support the Kerry amendment. We have to learn to discipline ourselves to exempt children from the way we ordinarily look at problems: Pass legislation, get the private sector to do something, and then go on to the next thing. Children, their problems, their growth, their development are vital and with us forever. The time to start thinking about children and their futures is right now. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have made the decision to vote in favor of the budget resolution before us to achieve a balanced budget and invest in key priorities for the country. This is not a vote to claim that this budget plan is perfect or a replica of the specific way I would best like to see the budget balanced and my own State's needs addressed. However, as a result of President Clinton working with Congress to reach this agreement, this plan represents a responsible course for completing the job of deficit reduction and launching essential steps for our future. 
This budget plan is also a victory against the dangerous and reckless efforts we have seen over the past 2 years in the name of balancing the budget, reforming Medicare, and other attractive but misleading labels. I am extremely proud and now relieved that some of us succeeded in defeating the extreme cuts proposed in the budget plans offered by Republicans that would have done such grave damage to Medicare, education, infrastructure, and other priorities. The Republican plans literally raided Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, and would have put crushing burdens on working families and our communities that were totally unnecessary and wrong. 
This budget plan now before us is possible because of the tough choices and hard work done by President Clinton, with the sole help of Democrats and not a single Republican vote, in 1993 to enact a historic package of deficit reduction and economic growth measures. Instead of the horrors predicted by opponents, that 1993 budget and economic plan cut the deficit from $290 billion to $67 billion. Over the past 4 years, we have watched the economy grow steadily, interest rates come down and stabilize, inflation remain low, and unemployment reach record lows. 
Some of the critics of the bipartisan budget agreement before us now seem to be upset because this plan doesn't hurt enough. Since when is pain or sacrifice the goal of a Federal budget? The goals should be fairness, balance, priority-setting, and investment as we hammer out a budget that also adheres to fiscal discipline. And the reason we can now proceed to finish the job of balancing the budget is because some of us have been hard at work over the past years to limit spending, set priorities, and make the real choices. 
This budget agreement is a plan with the necessary spending cuts and reform to balance the budget, with investments in urgent needs that Americans want us to address. This means accepting tradeoffs and limits. In fact, I have been obligated to vote against certain amendments in the past few days to increase spending in areas that I have a strong commitment to, from childrens programs to highway spending. But in order for this agreement to go forward, and enable us to fill in the details and even work out revisions, I feel a responsibility to help the bipartisan leadership maintain the fabric of this agreement. 
Mr. President, I am especially pleased that this agreement includes $16 billion for 
expanding health care coverage for children. My hope is that this will translate directly into enacting the legislation introduced by Senator Chafee and myself, with broad, bipartisan support, to use the Medicaid Program to insure up to 5 million children with the most urgent needs. Our approach would build on a foundation that serves children and families well, in a cost-effective and targeted manner. 
As the former chairman of the National Commission on Children, I view this budget agreement as the bipartisan commitment needed to fulfill other parts of the agenda we recommended to make children a higher priority in deeds, not just rhetoric, in America. With the education tax cuts promised for families, a children's tax credit, and more investment in early childhood and education, along with the childrens health care initiative promised, we can make sure this country prepares more of the next generation to be ready for the incredible challenges ahead of us. 
Mr. President, while I generally support the provisions of the balanced budget resolution, I want to make a special point of the fact that I take strong exception to the proposed funding for veterans. It is my view that veterans, who have sacrificed for this country, are carrying a disproportionate share of the burden to balance the Federal budget. 
As the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, this part of the budget is the area that I have a special responsibility to review in great detail. In addition, it affects West Virginians in countless ways. It is a sad statement that spending for veterans was not included in the list of protected programs by the President or congressional leadership. The result is that veterans benefits and services have been cut. In fiscal year 1998, discretionary veterans programs covering medical care, construction, and general administrative expenses will be decreased by $132 million in fiscal year 1998. To me, this represents a serious cut in veterans programs. Veterans groups and their advocates have agreed over the years to pull their weight in a concerted effort to balance the budget. However, this agreement does not reflect a sense of fairness. Aside from the deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and receipts from spectrum sales, veterans face the largest cuts in programs, and this is unacceptable. 
The budget resolution effectively flatlines the Department of Veterans Affairs' [VA] medical care appropriation to $16.959 billion over the next 5 years, and in an attempt to supplement this funding shortfall, builds in a new revenue stream. 
For the first time, VA will retain all third-party payments collected from insurance companies, and the budget agreement assumes that these fees will be available to support discretionary spending for VA medical care. In policy, I have always supported retention of these so-called Medical Care Cost Recovery [MCCR] collections on the basis that these collections would enhance medical services for veterans. Unfortunately, even with these new funds--$604 million in fiscal year 1998--the resulting level of funding would not be sufficient to support current services in fiscal year 1998. Projected outyear medical care spending would rise by less than one-half of one percent, while at the same time, the number of unique patients VA treats is projected to rise at an average annual rate of over 3.5 percent. If this same growth rate were applied to Medicare, America's seniors would rightly be marching on the Capitol. 
Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that when we speak of the funding level for VA medical care, we are really talking about such concerns as the long-term care needs of our World War II and Korean war veterans, the health care needs of ailing Vietnam and Persian Gulf war veterans, specialized services provided to veterans who are catastrophically disabled, and basic health and preventive care services provided to all our veterans. 
Under the budget agreement, veterans seeking medical care from the VA would be dependent upon uncertain funding, including a base appropriation which is $54 million less than the previous year; an untested plan to secure funding from insurance companies; and another controversial proposal, Medicare reimbursement, which will require congressional approval. I believe that the Government can be fiscally responsible and reduce the Federal deficit and debt, and still fulfill our commitment to our Nation's veterans. Asking veterans to rely upon tenuous funding mechanisms for their medical care does not meet this basic criteria. 
This proposed level of funding will also be particularly troublesome in those areas of the country which are losing VA health care funding as part of VA's new resource allocation model. Those facilities which are already slated to lose resources, including the Clarksburg VA Medical Center in my home State, will be hit even harder by the low level of fiscal year 1998 funding. 
Mr. President, some have viewed this budget agreement as a victory for veterans. This is simply a misunderstanding of the facts. Veterans groups know and understand that a frozen appropriation coupled with cuts in other programs will translate into a reduction of services and benefits, and I understand that they will be opposing the resolution. I will be working throughout the appropriations process to assure that these cuts are diminished. In sum, the appropriators will have to do better if we are to honor our commitment to veterans. 
Before concluding, I also warn my colleagues who are such strong proponents of capital gains and estate tax relief that these requirements are going to be subject to intense scrutiny by Americans who have every right to ask some tough questions. When working families struggle as hard as they do to make ends meet and give their children opportunities to succeed, they want to see a Federal budget with priorities that make sense. 
Every year, when faced with the budget process and debate, I have to weigh the various principles and goals that guide me in all of my work as the Senator of West Virginia. I have fought certain plans and proposals strenuously, because of their tilted and unfair approaches. In the case of the budget agreement before us, I believe it is an effort that should go forward. It is a work-in-progress, and I will be working hard to improve it. But at the same time, it captures the basic goals that the people of West Virginia and the country are asking us to pursue. We need to complete the job of balancing the budget. We also need to take new steps to address the opportunities and needs of Americans, in education, health care, research, and other key areas. With a bipartisan budget agreement resolved to pursue these goals, I will vote to get the job underway.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. A couple of quick points that ought to be made. This amendment, the amendment of Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, reduces the budget deficit. I hope that point has been made. It does reduce it by $10 billion. That is specifically the amount. It does not change a single spending cut or tax cut that has been proposed in the budget agreement. It does none of that whatever, and it is consistent with what is already in the budget agreement. It would help children that do not have health insurance. It is very complementary to the budget resolution. 
Let me say this. When I went to West Virginia 33 years ago, I went as something called a VISTA volunteer, sort of an untrained social worker trying to do good in West Virginia. I worked in a small coal mining community, and my life at that point was involved entirely with children who did not have any health insurance, or any education, for that matter, because the schoolbus would not come to pick them up. 
Something that has stayed with me forever, since I was a VISTA volunteer, which I have acted on in terms of moral angst and fervor since then, has been the condition of children, particularly regarding health care. I have to report that the children of the children with whom I was a VISTA volunteer do not have health insurance. In fact, 12 percent of our children in West Virginia do not have any health insurance. 
We talk about the most industrialized nation in the world, and that is true, but when you think of certain situations on a case-by-case basis, how can it be that, as a society that has our resources and our capacity, that takes 10 million children, and says they cannot have health insurance even though the majority of their parents are working, it is not fair. America and democracy are based like the progressive income tax, on a concept of fairness. To take 10 million children, most of whom have a parent or parents working, playing by the rules, paying taxes, and saying you cannot have health insurance because the person for whom your parent works does not provide health insurance and you, on your own, cannot afford it, and therefore you--this particular child--are not going to have health insurance, is fundamentally morally repugnant. I think every Senator, in fact, would agree with that. 
So here we have a marvelous opportunity to help them, and not only to help them in this amendment, but to help them in the budget agreement. 
Mr. President, if your heart does not persuade you to this position, your head ought to. That point has been made. That is, we are talking about preventive medicine for the budget in the future, as well as preventive medicine for children in our immediate time. How can we expect these children to excel at school; how can we expect them to perform at school and learn the skills they need if they do not have basic health insurance? 
Between 1987 and 1995 the percentage of children with job-based insurance actually declined from 67 to 50 percent. Every minute that goes by, another child loses his or her private insurance. 
This is the year that can make history for Republicans and Democrats alike. It can be the year remembered as the one we prove that we can do something, together, about a problem we all acknowledge, we all know doesn't make sense, and we all say needs a response. 
I want to congratulate the Hatch-Kennedy amendment because it takes the next step. Senators Hatch and Kennedy once again have paved the way for true bipartisan, common sense action in an area where Americans are very clear. Children count. Even better news is that this partnership of two Senators reflects broadening support and momentum that now must build into real results. The budget resolution before us includes $16 billion to expand health care. Money that can fund the Medicaid-based bill that Senator 
Chafee and I have proposed to expand coverage for children, with the bipartisan support of many of our colleagues. 
This amendment should pass. The Hatch-Kennedy amendment takes the next step, with the money to make it possible to get most or all uninsured children the health care they need. 
I am in the leadership on the Democratic side over here, and I am voting against virtually all amendments to protect the integrity of the budget agreement. But this amendment, as Senator Hatch said, is a big daddy. It is a big, big daddy. We are discussing health care, again, on the Senate floor, and we are discussing it for children, which is the place where we ought to be beginning. 
I have spent too many years in a State that I love, in a country that I love, as president of the National Commission on Children, going around this country, going around my State, seeing children who do not have health insurance, seeing what happens to them, to not be extremely supportive of an opportunity to pass an amendment and to cure that problem.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Hatch-Kennedy bill, I am extremely hopeful that this amendment will pass. If this 
amendment passes it will enable us to come very close to achieving universal coverage for all of America's children. 
However, like Senator Chafee, if the Hatch-Kennedy amendment fails, then we simply must target our efforts in the Finance Committee at strengthening the Medicaid Program to achieve health care coverage for the children who should be our most urgent priority. The Medicaid Program has a proven track record in providing cost effective care and it has served as a vital safety net for millions of working families. Because of past bipartisan legislation that delinked the Medicaid Program from the welfare program, the vast majority of children on Medicaid have at least one working parent. In other words, these are children in families who are struggling to avoid welfare, play by the rule, pay taxes--but they are the ones who don't get health insurance for their children through their jobs and cannot afford it on incomes where ends barely meet. 
So I look forward to working with Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords, Senator Breaux, and the majority of my colleagues on the Finance Committee who have already signed on to our bill, to expand coverage for millions of children in the most cost-effective, targeted way possible through the Medicaid Program.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with a mixture of happiness and sadness that I pay tribute to Edward P. Scott, VA's Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs, as he retires from Federal service--happiness for Ed and his family as they embark on a new phase of their lives, and sadness for those of us who will miss Ed's wise counsel and assistance as we carry on our work on veterans issues. 
Mr. President, Ed has had a long and distinguished career, including 16 years here in the Senate where he served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee as general counsel, minority general counsel, and in the 102d Congress, as chief counsel and staff director. I first became familiar with Ed's work when I joined the Veterans' Affairs Committee in 1985 when I first came to the Senate; I have recognized and relied on his great professionalism and integrity ever since. I particularly appreciated his assistance in 1993 when he worked tirelessly to ensure that my transition to the chairmanship of the committee went as smoothly as possible. 
For the past 4 years, Ed has served ably in the often challenging job of Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs at the Department of Veterans Affairs. He is enormously knowledgeable about veterans' programs and laws, and both the committee and the Department have relied heavily on his expertise and keen insight. He has worked hard to keep his various constituencies--most particularly, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse Brown and the authorizing and appropriating committees of both the House and Senate--informed and working together. On any number of occasions, Ed has kept the train on the tracks when it was threatening to tumble off. 
During these 4 years, Ed has played an important role in working with Congress to ensure passage of significant legislation to improve benefits and services for the service men and women who have sacrificed so much for our great country. He was particularly instrumental in working with the Congress last year to enact health care eligibility reform legislation, Public Law 104-262. Ed has also been in the middle of efforts to make sure that the Congress understood what the administration was doing in response to the concerns of veterans of the Persian Gulf. 
Ed's high standards--in doing the job and doing it right, in being a person of unassailable integrity, and in working with all parties concerned to find solutions that all could embrace--have inspired all who have worked with him. 
Mr. President, Ed's earlier career was equally distinguished. He graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School where he was an editor of the law review. Following a clerkship with a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, he entered active duty in the Air Force and served as assistant staff judge advocate at Keesler Air Force Base, MS. He then served with the Peace Corps, first in the Office of General Counsel, where he served as the deputy general counsel, and then as the Peace Corps country director in Korea. Ed also worked at the Mental Health Law Project here in Washington, an experience that gave him significant expertise on mental health issues which he has brought to bear on any number of VA mental health matters. 
Mr. President, I am certain that all in the Senate who have had the privilege of knowing and working with Ed Scott join me in wishing him well as he retires from a distinguished career of Government service. We will be the poorer for his going, but the richer for his having worked among us.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Frist, Harkin, and Kennedy, and all the others that worked so long and hard to develop this bipartisan legislation. This is a carefully crafted compromise to balance the rights and concerns of school administrators and teachers as well as students and parents. 
Because of attending a family memorial service in New York City, I could not be here for the final votes. Had I been in Washington, I would have supported the leadership and voted for final passage of the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. 
Our country should be proud of our efforts to provide education and opportunities to individuals with disabilities. Thanks to the IDEA, we opened schools to disabled children over 20 years ago and everyone in our society benefits from such inclusion and education. 
In forging this legislation, leaders had to deal with difficult issues, including discipline problems sometimes involving weapons or drugs. Groups worked long and hard to develop an approach that would ensure that our schools are safe but that a disabled student's rights and education are are also protected. Classroom teachers will now be included in the planning and process which is a major change and important improvement. 
Federal funding and leadership on IDEA is crucial, but this program is a partnership with States and local schools. West Virginia, like other States, assumes the lion share of education funding but Federal funding provides incentives and leadership. As always with a comprehensive reauthorization package, there are some lingering issues and questions. On balance, this legislation is a tremendous achievement that continues our Federal commitment to help disabled students in West Virginia and every State in our country.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the end of a significant week in our Nation. May 4 through May 10 was National Arson Awareness Week around the country. This year's theme was `Target Arson.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], along with local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and teachers chose a tremendously important and vulnerable group close to my heart for special emphasis in their crusade to promote safety and crime prevention--children. Their mission was and is to educate children on the dangers of fire by asking parents to control their children's access to matches and cigarette lights, and asking all adults to set a good example for our Nation's youth. 
Arson affects all Americans. It accounts for more than 700,000 deaths nationwide and causes more than $2 billion worth of property damage. The cost to the community as a whole is great when we consider that the taxpayer must foot the expenses for the fire, police, and medical personnel who are needed when a fire occurs, and not to mention the losses to a community when a church, business, or home is destroyed. That is why it is imperative that we work together to prevent arson from destroying another community, and most important, another life. 
Today I commend FEMA and communities across the country for their laudable efforts in raising awareness about the tragic consequences of arson and its devastating effect on our communities.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Senate Finance Committee colleague, Senator Nickles, in introducing an Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT] reform bill. Our bill will: first, allow businesses to use the same depreciation system for AMT as they do under regular tax, and second, permit businesses to use their AMT credits more easily than under current law. It will help make it easier for U.S. businesses to compete and reduce the unintended inequity of current law. 
For several years, I have looked for an opportunity to fix the problems that AMT creates especially for capital intensive industries. Two years ago, I introduced my own bill to reform the aspects of AMT that I believe are most detrimental to businesses for which AMT is frequently their method of tax payment. Unfortunately, with the controversies and difficulties that made it impossible to enact a budget plan in the last Congress, there was no ability to move that effort forward. 
This year, I am pleased to work with Senator Nickles to make the AMT fairer. I hope this means we have a real chance of working together in a bipartisan manner to compel Congress, the Finance Committee in particular, to figure out a way to deal with some of the unintended consequences of AMT as part of this year's budget deal. I think previous efforts at AMT reform have failed in the part because it is very tough to focus on the merits of certain corporate tax changes. That remains true today in the context of a larger budget agreement, but if we keep our perspective, I think AMT reform will win support on its merits and Congress can responsibly find a way to finance it. 
I am well aware of the fact that as we introduce this legislation, there is no specific provision for AMT relief in the budget deal which the President and Congressional leadership have struck in outline form. As I have noted, the constraints of balancing the budget will require us to carefully examine how much AMT relief is practical this year, as part of an agreement to balance the budget over the next 5 years. I understand that very well, as does Senator Nickles. I think that means we will have to zero in on the aspects of AMT relief that are most doable this year--and which can be financed without harming other priorities. I am prepared to do that and recognize that it also means the scope of the AMT bill we submit today will have to be tailored accordingly. That does not mean that we should put off AMT relief for another day, it just means we will have to be honest about what is critical to do and what portions of this bill will have to remain on the to-do list. I say all this because it is important to understand the context for our introducing this relief bill now, and as the budget agreement places some high hurdles on what can realistically be accomplished. 
I also would like to say that it is my strong belief that the excruciating specifics of the budget agreement which relate to matters under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee are best left to the expertise on that Committee. The Finance Committee serves an extremely important role in the legislative process. That role cannot and should not be supplanted by private negotiations between the administration and congressional leadership--however worthwhile the overall purpose. Reaching consensus on the approach to balancing the budget and protecting priorities of the administration and both sides of the aisle in congressional leadership provides the Finance Committee with the framework for its detailed work. The Finance Committee will soon have to work its will within the appropriate parameters of its reconciliation instructions. When that happens, I think the committee must address AMT relief, and I intend to work to build support for it as we wend our way through the committee process. 
Let me return to the substance of the bill we submit for our colleagues' consideration today. First, I want to make it absolutely clear--this bill does not repeal AMT. AMT has created during the 1986 Tax Reform Act in response to the problem raised when companies would report profits to stockholders and yet claim losses to the IRS. However, in an effort to simplify the code depreciation under AMT was treated as an adjustment--which amounts to an increase in income. This penalizes low-profit, capital intensive companies, like steel companies. Compared to other countries, after 5 years, a U.S. steelmaker under AMT recovers only 37 percent of its investment in a new plant and equipment. The recovery of investment in other countries is much higher--for example, in Japan it's 58 percent, in Germany companies recover 81 percent, Korea is 90 percent, and in Brazil it's 100 percent. 
The problem is not unique to the steel industry though. Other capital-intensive industries that also have long-lived 
assets lose under the current AMT. The chemical industry has 9 1/2 years to depreciate under the AMT, as opposed to 5 years under the regular tax. And for paper, they have 13 years to depreciate under the AMT, as opposed to 7 years under the regular tax. We need to fix the AMT so that industries with very high capital costs which they cannot recover for years are not put at such a disadvantage. 
Today's AMT discourages investment in new plants and equipment, while under our regular tax system depreciation investments are encouraged. The need to improve our tax system to make it fairer to capital intensive industries is clear--fixing the AMT is one way to do that. 
U.S. companies have to be able to compete in an increasingly competitive global market--that's almost an adage. It's what our trade laws and agreements seek to ensure. We'll never be able to sufficiently promote U.S. exports if we don't being to equalize the effects of our tax laws on American companies as well. 
This bill would eliminate depreciation as an adjustment under AMT--treating AMT taxpayers the same as those companies that pay under our regular tax system. It would also allow tax payers who have not used their accumulated minimum tax credits which are at least 5 years old to use those credits to offset up to 50 percent of their current year AMT liability--with a provision to ensure that taxpayers could not reduce their current payment below their regular tax liability for that year. 
AMT has become the standard method of tax payment for many of our Nation's capital intensive industries and it is not working the way Congress initially intended. It's time to fix it. 
The bill Senator Nickles and I submit for your consideration today will fix the AMT so it works the way I believe Congress originally intended. It will have the consequence of improving the competitiveness of American business. It is time to stop talking about AMT and do something that figures out how to address this real problem. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with me and my Finance Committee colleagues to find a way to act on this important issue in this year's budget bill.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my great honor today to rise to congratulate Kelly L. George of Cabell County in West Virginia. Kelly has been selected by American Mothers, Inc., as the West Virginia Mother of the Year, and I commend them for their choice. 
As a father of four children, I know how important it is to have a strong mother figure in the family, and Kelly is exactly that for her family. She continues to instill the value of high academic achievement to her children Vincent, Victor, Valerie, Von, and Vanessa. She works very hard to provide a spiritual foundation for her children, and she also takes on the enormously important task of teaching strong family values. 
But this is not all that Kelly George does. Like my wife Sharon, Kelly balances her tasks as a mother with her duties in an active career. Kelly has an impressive list of accomplishments outside the household. She is on the Thomas Hospital Board of Trustees, is a Kanawha County Parks and Recreation Commissioner, and chair of the West Virginia Board of Risk and Insurance Management. She is also a life member of General Federation of Women's Clubs and the National Committee of State Garden Clubs, as well as international chair for the Pilot International World Association. On top of all this, she is a legislative analyst, a historian, and the author of `Rhythms, Remembrances and Recipes.' 
Imagine combining all of these activities with her educational background in the West Virginia public schools, Marshall College, Cambridge School of Radio and Television, and Drake School of Drama and with the tremendous job of being a mother. Most of us would find difficulty in staying active just in these tasks outside the home, but Kelly is able to balance those with her role as a mother. 
I know Kelly personally and know that she is a phenomenal person who is enormously talented. I am proud to say that Kelly George is the West Virginia Mother of the Year for 1997-98. And I congratulate her on this tremendous achievement.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to pay a tribute to an individual who, in his service as a staff member in the U.S. Senate, has exemplified the qualities we all look for in a public servant, colleague, and human being. Patrick H. Windham just completed well over a decade of service in the Senate, always in some association with the Senator of South Carolina, Senator Hollings, whom he holds in such obvious and deep esteem. Pat and his family are relocating to California to begin new professional opportunities. He will be sorely missed here by a wide range of admirers and colleagues in the Senate, the Clinton administration, and the extensive circle of people and organizations concerned with the issues that Pat has been so intensely involved with. 
Educated at Stanford and Berkeley, and dubbed the `Godfather of Science and Tech' by colleagues, Pat began his public service career in 1982 as a legislative assistant to Senator Hollings. Two years later, Pat was assigned to the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space and since has served as a invaluable senior advisor on this extensive range of issues to various members of the committee. Over the years, Pat has served with strong loyalty to the Senate and dedication to the public policy interests of the country as a whole. 
My relationship with Pat stems from my own service as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and when I became chairman of the Science Subcommittee. With Pat assigned to the subcommittee, we have worked closely for years on legislative endeavors and the issues that fall in this jurisdiction. No one matches Pat's breadth of expertise, professional dedication, and personal commitment. I feel highly fortunate to be the beneficiary of his extensive talent and contributions. 
Pat Windham's involvement in science and technology policy and legislation could fill volumes. Pat was instrumental in the 1988 conversion of the National Bureau of Standards [NBS] into the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]. He strongly advocated expanding the mission of the old NBS. Thanks in large part to Pat Windham, NIST's mission now explicitly includes enhancing the competitiveness of American companies by providing appropriate governmental support for industry's development of precompetitive generic technologies and diffusing Government-developed technological advances to use in all segments of the American economy. Pat has tirelessly continued his involvement in framing NIST's role in U.S. policy in today's era of cutbacks. 
Pat also contributed heavily to the development of The Advanced Technology Program [ATP] and the Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership [MEP]. Each of these programs grew out of real concerns over the competitiveness of American companies in the global marketplace. Created by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, ATP encourages public and private cooperation in the development of precompetitive technologies with broad application across industries. Pat argued fiercely for retaining this successful program in the face of last Congress' attempt at eliminating this public-private industrial partnership. His dedication to these issues certainly contributed to the President's support of the ATP program, and its continued success. The Clinton administration's strong support of a program led to an increase in ATP funding in fiscal year 1997. And, today, the ATP awards almost 300 public-private partnership projects. 
Pat Windham's contributions do not end here. He has been involved in technology-related projects including efforts promoting national metric conversion. He has steadfastly encouraged and promoted the translation of Japanese scientific and technological documents for use by scientists and engineers across the globe. His public policy concerns also have included legislative efforts to ensure that foreign-component parts meet U.S. standards for quality. 
The Senate, and that includes me in particular, will miss Pat and his superb abilities as we address the vital issues in which he has been part. His dedication and loyalty have served as a role model for all those around him. On behalf of my own staff and myself, I offer good wishes to him and feel confident Pat will continue making a vital contribution to his fellow citizens and the country in his next chapter.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a private relief bill that is based on careful reflection and a sincere desire to help a family of importance to me and my State of West Virginia. 
This is an effort to assist an individual named Jack Sun who is a prominent international businessman and multinational manager with permanent residence status in the United States. Mr. Sun sought and obtained permanent residence in the United States to enable him to pursue economic business and ties between his native Taiwan and the United States. 
Of great significance to West Virginia, in his capacity as Chairman of Taiwan Aerospace Corp., Jack Sun has been instrumental in forging a Taiwan/United States joint venture named Sino Swearingen, Inc., that will build state-of-the-art business jets in my home State of West Virginia. Taiwan Aerospace Corp., and its Taiwanese coinvestors have to date committed an amount in excess of $150 million to finance this joint venture. Sino Swearingen, Inc., is expected to employ around 800 people at this West Virginia site when it becomes fully operational. 
As someone who knows Jack Sun personally and has worked closely with him to pursue this new investment and jobs opportunity for West Virginia, I know him to be an honorable individual. He is an internationally respected business leader, well known to the American business community. Jack Sun has worked extremely hard to develop and maintain strong personal and business ties in the United States. In addition to his business activities, Jack Sun is active in the cultural and academic life of both Taiwan and the United States. He also sits on the University of Southern California School of Business Administration's CEO board of advisors. 
Jack Sun, in his capacity as president of Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co., Ltd, has, over the past 10 years, directed significant investments into the United States and has created thousands of jobs for Americans. Mr. Sun is the president of Pacific USA Holdings Corp. headquartered in Dallas, TX. Pacific USA Holdings Corp. is a diversified holding company whose business activities encompass commercial banking, home building, mortgage and investment banking, property development, insurance and technology services, to name but a few. Pacific USA Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries now employ more than 2,000 U.S. workers. 
Jack Sun also serves as director of the Iridium project which is an international alliance sponsored by Motorola, Inc., 
whose purpose is to create a global network of telecommunications systems through the use of low-orbiting satellites. 
The purpose of this private bill is to attempt to assist Jack Sun in expediting the completion of the permanent residence process that is well underway through conventional procedures for his two youngest children, Ching-Jou Sun, age 8, and Ching-Hsun Sun, age 6. Jack Sun's three eldest children received their permanent residence status on April 28, 1992. 
Regarding this bill, in July, 1995, a petition for alien relative was filed on behalf of ching-jou and Ching-Hsun Sun. The Immigration and Naturalization Service approved the petitions on January 30, 1996. Upon approval of the petitions, the children were assigned a priority date of July 26, 1995. 
However, Jack Sun and his attorney have been informed by the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, that in the preference category for which Ching-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun have been approved, the number of people approved for issuance of visas far exceeds the number of visas currently available for actual issuance. Consequently, the children have been assigned a priority date that is a place on the waiting list. The National Visa Center states that based upon the current conditions and backlog, the priority date held by Ching-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun will not be reached for more than 4 years. 
Ching-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun are now in the process of waiting for their green cards which would enable them to live and go to school in the United States with their sisters and brother. To add to the problem, during this waiting period, the children cannot even travel with their father and family in the United States. The children cannot obtain even a visitor's visa because they have already indicated their immigration intent. 
Although the petitions were approved on behalf of Ching-Hsun Sun and Ching-Jou Sun, the prolonged continuation of the waiting period has created personal hardships for Jack Sun, and his family. Jack Sun's three oldest children permanently reside in Pasadena, CA. The two oldest daughters presently attend the University of Southern California. Jack Sun simply would like his family to be together as much as possible. This means he wishes to be able to travel with his children to the United States, and to unify his family. Under the present circumstances, the family is split, three children holding permanent residence status and living in the United States, while the two youngest children have to remain in Taiwan during this prolonged waiting period and the potential 6 year delay before achieving visas for permanent residence status. 
This forced separation creates a particular hardship because of the ages of the children. The children are not permitted to travel with their father and are separated from their father and siblings for years to come. Jack Sun frequently and extensively 
travels to the United States to oversee his business operations. 
There is simply no further administrative procedure to use to resolve this situation for the Sun family and these two children. They are confronted with an extraordinarily long delay waiting for visas already approved to actually become available. No administrative remedy exists to cure this situation. No further relief is available from the Immigration and Naturalization Service or any other agency. The relevant administrative agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the National Visa Center at the State Department, have informed Jack Sun and his attorney that there is no administrative vehicle to expedite conclusion of the permanent residence process. 
Therefore, I have decided to seek a legislative remedy for Jack Sun's family. After carrying out all the steps needed to obtain approval for resident status, they face a 6-year waiting period that now condemns a father and children to prolonged periods of separation. 
Because of my respect for Jack Sun and deep appreciation for the role he has played in locating a major new source of jobs and opportunity for West Virginians, I am asking Congress to take the legislative action required to relieve a family of undue hardship and separation solely resulting from the grim reality that two children would otherwise have to wait 6 years to get visas they already have been approved for. I believe this is just the example of an extraordinary personal situation that merits congressional assistance and action.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased and proud to be introducing legislation today with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. As my colleagues in the Senate already know, Senator Chafee has long been a leader in the area of health care, especially when it comes to the health care of children. I am also extremely pleased to be introducing this bill with the help of Senator Breaux and the newest member of the Finance Committee, Senator Jeffords. We are excited to be joined by so many of our colleagues on the Finance Committee, Senators Moynihan, D'Amato, Baucus, Hatch, Bryan, Kerrey, and Moseley-Braun, and with so many of our other colleagues who have joined us as original cosponsors, including Senators Collins, Bingaman, Snowe, Kennedy, Kerry, Dodd, Robb, Hutchinson, Inouye, Daschle, and Specter. 
Mr. President, our legislation already enjoys broad bipartisan support because it meets a serious need and it meets that need in a very cost-effective manner. Our legislation builds on an existing program and employs an approach that the Finance Committee has used repeatedly over the past decade to expand health coverage to children and pregnant women. Our legislation is, therefore, not new, original, or terribly innovative. But, we know it works. 
For me personally, this legislation fulfills another part of my promise to work tirelessly to turn the recommendations of the National Commission on Children, which I was honored to chair, into reality. That blue ribbon panel of children's leaders from many fields, representing a wide spectrum of views, successfully developed a unanimous report to recommend an action plan to give America's children a real shot at becoming productive, healthy citizens. During our deliberations, we recognized that ensuring basic health care for children should be one of the country's highest priorities. The bill we are introducing today challenges Congress to make the commitment to this basic objective that is so vital for the entire country's future. 
Our legislation is complementary to many of the other children health bills that have been already proposed this year. That is one reason why I am also a cosponsor of other health bills that have been introduced by Senators Hatch and Kennedy and Senator Daschle. These bills are not competing bills. They all seek to expand the number of children with health insurance and they could all easily fit together to meet a large, and I am sad to report, a growing need in this country. 
A total of 10 million children in the United States do not 
have health insurance and as a result, the vast majority of them do not get necessary health care. Numerous studies have shown that uninsured children do not receive basic preventive care and immunizations. They are less likely to see a doctor for both acute and chronic illnesses and are more likely to delay seeking necessary care. Uninsured sick newborns receive fewer services in the hospital than those with health coverage. Children without insurance are less likely to have a regular source of medical care. This means that these children miss out on getting properly screened for problems that could be easily treated early or that need to be monitored on a routine basis. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, having a regular source of medical care could reduce per-child health care costs by 22 percent. 
Those are the facts. But let us not forget the emotional turmoil a parent goes through trying to figure out when, or if, to get an earache treated or a rash checked out. Imagine how hard it must be for a mother and father to decide to wait just one more day in hopes that a troubling symptom will disappear only to have those symptoms worsen in the middle of the night. Some families don't even allow their children to play sports for fear of an injury. Having millions of families and children in these types of situations is just plain wrong, and we must try to help. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of uninsured children live in families where a parent works. Unfortunately, many of these families are unable to afford coverage offered by their employer when it is offered. In too many instances working parents don't even have that option. The trends for job-based insurance are very disturbing. Between 1987 and 1995 the percentage of children with job-based insurance declined from 67 to 59 percent. But this downward trend is not new. Between 1977 and 1987 job-based insurance declined by 5 percent. Every minute that goes by another child loses his or her private health insurance. 
Mr. President, our bill is very simple. We encourage States to expand coverage for children by offering them an enhanced Federal match. Under our bill, the States would be eligible to receive a 30-percent increase in their current Federal matching rate if they choose to expand coverage for pregnant women, infants, and children up to 150 percent of poverty. We cap the Federal match at 90 percent so that all States would be required to contribute some additional funding. Under our bill, Rhode Island would be eligible to receive an enhanced Federal match rate of 70 percent up from 54 percent. West Virginia would be eligible to receive a 90 percent Federal match, up from 72 percent. 
Our legislation targets those families earning less than one-and-one-half times the poverty level or about $24,000 a year for a family of four. Only a quarter of families at or 
below this income level have job-based insurance. By comparison, 81 percent of families earning wages above 150 percent of poverty have job-based insurance. The concern of replacing private insurance with public coverage--the so called crowding out effect--is minimized when so little job-based coverage even exists for families at these income levels. 
Under current law, Medicaid eligibility varies based on a child's age and a family's income level. Our legislation aims to establish uniform level of eligibility. I recently heard from a West Virginia mother desperate for health insurance for her 1-year-old. She and her husband work and earn about $22,000 a year. When their daughter turned 1, she lost her Medicaid coverage. She qualified for Medicaid when she was an infant but because Medicaid's income standard for eligibility is different for a 1-year-old she no longer qualified after her first birthday. The mother's employer offered health insurance, but at a cost of $289 a month or $3,500 a year. They could not afford to buy it. This mother was absolutely desperate for assistance because she knew her daughter needed immunizations and other well child care services. 
Mr. President, our legislation seeks to end instances of children losing their Medicaid coverage just because they have a birthday. Our legislation seeks to end instances of children in the same family having to meet different income standards. 
We do this not by mandating States to expand their Medicaid Program. We believe that by providing additional Federal money States will be able to move beyond their current eligibility levels. Our legislation would also allow those States that have already exceeded 150 percent of poverty to receive an enhanced Federal match. This match would be for those children they are already covering between 100 percent and 150 percent of poverty. We did not think it was fair to penalize those States who have already tried to improve coverage for children. 
A key way to expand the number of children enrolled in Medicaid is to guarantee eligibility for 12 months. Some 3 million children are currently eligible but not enrolled in the Medicaid Program. Some of these children qualify for a few months of Medicaid coverage. But because of slight changes in their parents' income, they lose coverage over the course of the year. Our bill would require States to guarantee 12 months of eligibility for all children on Medicaid as a condition of receiving an enhanced Federal match. 
Expansions of Medicaid in the late 1980's resulted in a decreased number of low birthweight babies, improved access to health care, a decline in infant mortality rates, and millions more children in working families with health insurance. We can build on these successes with this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and in the House in advancing this bill. I am excited at our opportunity to meet a very real and vital need of millions of America's children.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thought it would be helpful to share some thoughts about other important issues that I hope the Congress will address once action is taken on the bill before us to prohibit Federal funding for physician-assisted suicide. 
Because of my involvement in health care issues and the Medicare Program specifically, I have spent some time in recent months taking another look at the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their family members, and their physicians when confronted with death or the possibility of dying. In almost all such difficult situations, these people are not thinking about physician-assisted suicide. The needs and dilemmas that confront them have much more to do with the kind of care and information that are needed, sometimes desperately. 
I am learning more and more about the importance of educating health care providers and the public that chronic, debilitating, terminal disease need not be associated with pain, major discomfort, and loss of control. We need to focus on the tremendous amount that can be done to control a wide range of symptoms associated with terminal illness, to assure that the highest level of comfort care is provided to those who are dying or have chronic, debilitating disease. 
The tremendous advances in medicine and medical technology over the past 30-50 years have resulted in a greatly expanded life expectancy for Americans, as well as vastly improved functioning and quality of life for the elderly and those with chronic disease. Many of these advances have been made possible by federally financed health care programs, especially the Medicare Program that assured access to high quality health care for all elderly Americans, as well as funding much of the development of technology and a highly skilled physician work force through support of medical education and academic medical centers. These advances have also created major dilemmas in addressing terminal or potentially terminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of control by many with terminal illness. 
I believe it's time for Medicare and other federally funded health care programs to assure that all elderly, chronically ill, and disabled individuals have access to compassionate, supportive, and pain-free care during prolonged illness and at the end of life. As we discuss restructuring Medicare during the present session of Congress, this will be one of my primary goals. 
Much of the knowledge necessary to assure individuals appropriate end-of-life care already exists. Much needs to be done, however, to assure that all health care providers have the appropriate training to use what is known already about such supportive care. The public must also be educated and empowered to discuss these issues with family members as well as their own physicians so that each individual's wishes can be respected. More research is needed to develop appropriate measures of quality end-of-life care and incorporate these measures into medical practice in all health care settings. And finally, appropriate financial incentives must be present within Medicare, especially, to allow the elderly and disabled their choice of appropriate care at the end of life. 
I will soon be introducing legislation that addresses the need to develop appropriate quality measures for end-of-life care, to develop models of compassionate care within the Medicare Program and to encourage individuals to have open communication with family members and health care providers concerning preferences for end-of-life care. These are the issues that truly need to be addressed by Congress and encouraged through Federal financing programs for health care, and I am very committed to promoting the action that Americans and their physicians are looking to us to help them with. By addressing end-of-life issues in this manner, there may be a day when the divisive debate over physician-assisted suicide will become unnecessary.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, children who are at risk of abuse and neglect are among the most vulnerable group in our society, and we have a compelling obligation to do a better job in protecting such children. I am proud to join Senator Chafee and others in a bipartisan effort to improve our federal child welfare programs. 
Almost a decade ago, I had the opportunity and privilege to serve as the Chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on Children. Our diverse group spent several years traveling the country to meet with families, officials and advocates to delve into the needs of children and families. We issued a unanimous report in 1991 with a comprehensive strategy to help children and strengthen families. One of the chapters of our report was directed toward helping children at risk of abuse and neglect. Since the Children's Commission, I have been working to convert our bipartisan recommendations into policy and programs. 
The Children's Commission basic recommendations called for a more comprehensive strategy for child protective services. The panel noted the need for a range of services so that children and families could get what was needed on a case-by-case basis. Our report call for intensive family preservation services when appropriate. If children must be removed from their homes, reunification services need to be available to prepare children and parents for a safe return. There should be better training for foster parents and child welfare staff. Adoption can be the best option for some children so adoption procedures should be streamlined. 
The SAFE Act--Safe Adoptions and Family Environments--follows through on the Children's Commission recommendations. Our bill stresses that a child's safety and a child's health must be a primary concern by clarifying current law known as `reasonable efforts.' It is designed to encourage states to move children into stable, permanent placements quickly. For some children, this will be adoption. For others, appropriate intervention and support services can enable children to return home safely. This bill will direct states to establish a permanency planning hearing for a child in foster care within 12 months, instead of the current 18 months which will cut by one-third the amount of time a child is without a plan for a stable home. Our bill also offers states incentives to reduce the backlog of children waiting for adoption. 
I have fought for children and family programs throughout my career, and will continue to do so. Last Congress, I argued strongly that there is a fundamental difference between welfare reform and child welfare and foster care. I opposed a block grant approach to foster care because abused children should not be placed at further risk or face time-limits. Ultimately, I voted for the block grant of welfare reform. 
While I opposed attempts to convert child welfare and foster care into a block grant last year, I acknowledged the problems in the system and pledged to work on ways to strengthen and improve programs for abused and neglected children outside the context of welfare reform. Today, we are delivering on that commitment and working in a bipartisan manner to encourage reform. 
Reform is desperately needed. Reports indicate that more than 1 million American children suffered some type of abuse and neglect. Over 450,000 children are in foster care in our country. In my home state of West Virginia, referrals to Child Protective Services are expected to increase from 12,500 reports in 1991 to 17,000 this year. Foster care placements in West Virginia has jumped to 3,113 children in January 1997, up from 2,900 children in January 1996. 
Clearly, we must work together with the states to address the complicated needs of abused and neglected children. 
While our legislation may seem technical in nature, its goals are focused on protecting children and ensuring that every child moves swiftly into a safe, permanent placement where they can grow up healthy and secure. To achieve such basic goals, we need to invest in a range of services--from prevention of abuse, family reunification, and adoptions. 
Protecting children and helping families should be a bipartisan, community based effort. We must forge partnerships with states and advocates. This legislation reflects this spirit and commitment.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I come here to echo the words that I caught of my predecessor in speaking, and that is Senator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey, who is the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. 
I, too, am frustrated. I mean, there are lots of things to be frustrated about this year. The pace has been slow. There are things we should have been doing. There are distractions hither and yon. 
One thing we should be doing is the budget. The budget is the statement of priorities of the Congress, representing to the American people what needs to be done in this Nation. The budget, although it comes in a very thick book and has a very sterile appearance, in fact is a powerful and humane document about what our priorities are. It is the ultimate statement of what you believe in. 
I do not want to see a Government furlough, and I do not want to see a shutdown. I know the Presiding Officer does not want to see that. The American people certainly do not. In fact, it had a rather devastating consequence, far beyond what I thought would be the case, in States not only close to Washington, DC, but around the country. 
There is another reason I worry, and that is what we do know about the Republican budget, which to this point basically is tax cuts. It is not just a question of tax cuts, but the fact that the tax cuts are not paid for. There is no statement or sense or hint of where the money will come from. 
So, first, there is not a budget, and, second, to the extent there is a budget, it only relates to tax cuts. The Republican tax cuts add up to $526 billion over a 10-year period. They backloaded it so that, to the public, the more reasonable approach to a tax cut would be the first part, and then at the end the tax cut really bulges and the beneficiaries of that really benefit. 
What is interesting is that we have been through this exercise. The American people, and I thought the Republicans themselves, had rejected the idea that we could do the kinds of tax cuts that we were talking about and that we are now talking about, and that is tax cuts that favor the rich, tax cuts that do not favor working American families, the American middle class. Yet here they are back again. 
That is frustrating to me. I do not understand that. I am not being partisan in saying this. I am genuinely perplexed by it. I am more than perplexed, I am annoyed by that. But, first of all, I am perplexed. 
Why this statement of $526 billion? Incidentally, $526 billion--in the last 4 years of the 10 years, 325 billion of those dollars flow into the back pockets of those who benefit. So, therefore, those who benefit and those who do not is obviously very important. And I will get to that in a moment. 
There is a child tax credit the Republicans have put forward and a child tax credit the Democrats have put forward. That is something I feel very, very positively about, both in terms of Republicans and Democrats--with one exception. 
There was a policy that I helped advance, along with at that time Gov. Bill Clinton, on something called the National Commission on Children and Families, which I chaired for 4 years. We put forward the idea of the $1,000 child tax credit. It is put forward really by both parties to the extent of $500, but there is a difference. 
The Democrats adjust theirs, change theirs, with inflation. It is very expensive to bring up a child in this country. People do not think of it that way. You know, they do not quantify so much per child. But it costs about $7,000 a year on average to bring up an individual child in this country. If you have four, then it costs $28,000 a year. That is averaging in from the time that you are buying Pampers to the time you are paying college tuition. Obviously, it is an average, but it is a very expensive average. So it is a very good proposition, the idea of a tax credit, but it ought to be indexed to inflation. The Democratic tax cut is. The Republican tax cut is not. 
So, if my colleagues would just listen for a moment about what the experts found out about the Republican tax cut proposals and who gains and who does not, more than 75 percent of the Republican tax cuts would go to the top 20 percent of taxpayers. Well, that does not ring right. And it should not ring right. 
I mean, this is a country which is constantly--we have all watched, hopefully, the public broadcasting thing on Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of Independence. In that he talked about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There was 
a sense of equality. People were created to be equal, to have equal opportunity. 
Well, that does not mean that all people work as hard as others. But does it mean that if you are in the middle class and you are a working family, much less a two-parent working family, and you are working very, very hard and you are working at a job that pays a lot less money, then should you be treated substantially differently than somebody who works hard but makes a whole lot of money or somebody who does not work hard and who makes a whole lot of money through unearned income? The fact of the matter is that only 8.6 percent of the benefit of the $526 billion in Republican tax cuts would go to the bottom 60 percent of the American people. Let us call it 9 percent. Nine percent of the benefit of $526 billion would go to 60 percent of the American people who happen to be at the bottom of the economic scale, that is, to the extent that you are within the 60 percent. It ranges, obviously. 
This means that middle-income Americans with an average income of $26,900, which is high cotton in West Virginia, would get a $186 tax cut from the Republican tax package. That is just the fact. But the top 1 percent of Americans, myself included, I suppose, and people whose incomes average $645,000, would get $21,000--actually $21,306 in tax cuts. 
That is not the American way. That is not why we are what we are as a country. I understand that some people do better than others in life. And I understand that some people are propelled, through good fortune or through exceptional brain power, to be in a position to make more money. Often that is a circumstance of birth and often that is a circumstance of education, often that is simply a circumstance of life. And sometimes it is simply a matter that you really did it and you deserve it. 
But you cannot take something called the working middle class, people who work in steel mills, who work in factories, who work in grocery stores but who work all the time and work every day and pay taxes, and for whom every $10 or $100 is important, and say to them, `You don't count.' You do not do that in a budget. We do not do that, at least in a Democratic budget. 
So, Madam President, I appreciate your courtesy in listening to these short pronouncements on my part. But I think the budget process should begin. I think we should take the crazy idea of trying to cut $526 billion of taxes, much less figure out how to pay for it, take it and sort of lay it outside the door and let it rest there for time immemorial. In the meantime, let us do a budget. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose amending the U.S. Constitution with a rigid requirement that every year the Federal Government must have a zero budget deficit. I don't think it is appropriate to use our Nation's most revered governing document to lock in a budget and economic policy that cannot respond to changing needs and circumstances. And I do not believe such a requirement could be enforced without forcing a constitutional crisis. 
In my view, Congress does not need an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to perform its responsibility to enact responsible, balanced Federal budgets. The President and the Congress have all the tools they need to reduce the deficit, to respond and adapt to the country's changing needs, and to keep us militarily and economically strong. It is not a constitutional amendment that makes these choices, but strong leadership and judgment. We must make the choices through realistic cuts in spending, reasonable and fair tax policies, and the setting of obtainable goals that show the specifics--every spending cut and every tax. 
Congress can and should act to reduce the deficit. A Democratic Congress did just that in 1993, and the deficit has been cut by more than 60 percent. Including an artificial, unworkable mandate in the U.S. Constitution is not the appropriate path to fiscal responsibility. 
I offered and withdrew an amendment which would have protected Medicare from the autopilot of the balanced budget amendment. I offered the Medicare amendment with the intention of engaging in a debate that would expose the balanced budget amendment for the budgetary strait jacket that it is. I offered the amendment with the firm belief that a debate about the effects of a balanced budget amendment on Medicare may help some of my colleagues think through what their actions will mean. People don't want Social Security to be used to balance the budget--and, I believe Medicare is just as important to our constituents as Social Security. Medicare provides West Virginia seniors with health care security--Social Security with a measure of retirement security. My amendment says that the pursuit of a balance budget should not rob seniors of the health care security they need and deserve. 
The current constitutional balanced budget amendment, if passed, would force deep and devastating cuts on the Medicare Program. Such cuts would increase the already too high out of pocket costs senior citizens are forced to pay for basic health care. The pending constitutional amendment is sure to drive up the percentage of a senior's total income they must spend on health care services. Currently, seniors' out of pocket costs are, on average, about 21 percent of their total income. This balanced budget amendment is likely to force seniors to spend 25, 30, 35, or even 50 percent of their total resources on the health care services they need. This increased burden on seniors would force many seniors into poverty and make a greater proportion of them dependent on Medicaid services, in essence, shifting 
even more health care costs to the states. 
I want my colleagues to recognize the real world consequences of their vote for an automatic, constitutional balanced budget--the imposition of devastating cuts in the Medicare Program. Every Senator who I have heard speak publicly about Medicare has said they want to protect, preserve, and strengthen the program. A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution will do the opposite by devastating Medicare--simple math tells us this is true. If my colleagues mean it when they say they want to protect Medicare, they will oppose this constitutional amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against Medicare being used as a piggy bank to be raided at the end of the year, when the budget isn't in balance, for whatever unforseen economic reason. 
I think my colleagues should consider the admonition of the Secretary of the Treasury about the consequences of a Constitutional balanced budget amendment for Medicare beneficiaries. I asked the Secretary what he thinks would happen to Medicare beneficiaries under a balanced budget amendment when he appeared before the Finance Committee two weeks ago. Here is our exchange about the effects of the balanced budget amendment: 
Senator Rockfeller. Now we have this thing called a balanced budget amendment, which, according to one of the papers this morning, may lose steam in both chambers, and I hope that is the case. 
But, in the event that it is not, it will be, I think, very problematic for Medicare if we go into a situation where, let us say--Senator Moynihan has heard me talk about this many times --back in the early 1980's in West Virginia we had unemployment that ran up to 21 percent, and devastation to the extent that we were laying off tens of thousands of workers. And this was not common just to West Virginia, it was true in the industrial heartland, as we were making a major economic shift that was painful. 
Now, if that were to happen again, and I see no reason why it will not; Japan is now going through exactly that same kind of difficulty, one that we would not have guessed that they would have gone through 10 years after we did, but they are. They are very down about it. They are going to be fine in the long-term. 
But if we were to run into that situation again in this country and we had a balanced budget amendment and we had to balance by the end of the year and we had to do our part here in Finance, would we not run into what we used to call sequestration? 
Secretary Rubin. I think that you could easily run into a situation, Senator. I think this is only one of the many problems that a balanced budget amendment creates, and that is, I do think it creates an additional threat to Medicare, if that is what you are saying. If you get to the end of the year and there is a very large, unexpected shortfall, which happens from time to time, then I think the President could be in a position where he would be forced to simply cease sending out all checks. 
Well, if you cease sending out all checks you will cease sending out Social Security checks, you will cease sending out Medicare checks, and you will cease sending out all other kinds of checks, I think, instead of being able to deal with it in some sort of a reasonable and sensible fashion. 
The Medicare trust fund should not be used as a cash cow to balance the budget in an effort to meet the restrictive requirements of a constitutional amendment. I believe it is clear that one consequence of Senate Joint Resolution 1 would be the Medicare program, which provides health services to 38 million senior citizens, will be cut in excess of what is required to protect seniors and beyond the dictates of good health policy. 
I am committed to charting a positive course for our Nation in the 21st century, and I believe that we are moving in the right direction. Some of us have worked very hard in the recent years to do the job of digging out from the exploding deficits of the 1980's, by reducing the deficit, and changing the priorities of the Federal budget in order to cut waste and increase investment in America's future. I have cast many votes in recent years for actual cuts, for detailed changes in policy, and for specific budget plans. These are the kinds of real votes that have cut the deficit. 
By working out a balance between what must be done to invest in our people, and using their hard-earned tax dollars more wisely, we have a course that is far less reckless and dangerous than strapping this amendment onto the U.S. Constitution. I truly believe we can achieve the real goal of a balanced budget amendment--fiscal responsibility--if we are brave enough to tackle the real challenges that confront us. For the sake of real fiscal responsibility and the sake of West Virginia's future, I cast my vote against the constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to express my extremely strong, very enthusiastic support for the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky to be our U.S. Trade Representative. This is an important vote for America, for its future. I urge my colleagues to give her the unanimous vote of confidence that she has, in fact, already earned through her record of incredible fortitude, ability, and a long list of trade accomplishments, even as acting USTR. 
The President has put forward, frankly, a most unusual person--unusually skilled, highly qualified, for one of the most important jobs in the U.S. in Government, 
and that is being our Nation's lead trade negotiator and keeping up with all developments all over the world all the time. It is an incredible job. 
She now should have the official title to proceed with the job awaiting her in trade negotiations and efforts that offer immense opportunities and extremely high stakes for our industries, for our workers, and for our economy. 
In just the last year alone, on a whole host of other things, as our acting trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky has concluded a renewal of our critical semiconductor agreement with the Japanese; seen through an agreement to remove tariffs around the world on information technology products; and won agreement of a massive telecommunications pact that promises more than $1 trillion in worldwide economic benefits through the year 2010, all of this as acting trade representative. 
Beyond that, I would point to one of Charlene Barshefsky's strongest qualifications: Her masterful grasp of complicated issues surrounding China's integration into the global economy. 
We have all read, hopefully, all of the writing that has come out about China since the death of Deng Xiaoping. I believe that China is the single biggest long-term macroeconomic challenge facing the United States. We cannot duck it. We must handle it intelligently. 
China is the world's largest country, in terms of population, and its economy will surpass ours sometime in the not too distant future. If its accession to the World Trade Organization, in particular, is not handled properly, the ramifications for the United States could be serious and long lasting. This takes the hand of a master. That hand belongs to Charlene Barshefsky. 
We are also very fortunate to count on Ambassador Barshefsky as we face the challenge of our trade relationship with Japan. This winter I took, as I always do, a delegation of West Virginia business people to Japan and Taiwan. One of the messages we heard, in a troubling fashion very frequently, was that Japan was looking much more toward turning to the World Trade Organization for the settlement of previously negotiated bilateral trade agreements, turning, therefore, away from the bilateral process which has traditionally characterized our negotiating relationship with Japan. 
I don't blame them if they are trying to avoid a U.S. negotiating team headed by somebody as forceful and capable as Charlene Barshefsky. My response is that overall United States-Japan relations depend on our ability to deal with one another, on a bilateral basis, on our trading issues, and then have occasional recourse to the WTO, but none of this could we do any better than by having Ambassador Barshefsky at the helm representing our country, our people, the people from my State. 
It is impossible for me to explain how strongly I feel about the nomination and the confirmation of that nomination hopefully on this day. 
To turn to the amendment we are now debating, the Senator from South Carolina is one of the most forceful advocates in the Congress for American interests in the global economy. I learned a great deal about issues coming from discussions with him about the globalization of the economy. He talks about it a great deal with great erudition, and I admire and share his intense commitment to American workers and industries. 
The Senator from South Carolina also has a very long-time interest in the issue of foreign ownership of American telecommunications services, which, in fact, happens to be the root cause of the Senator's amendment, although this dispute is not about broadcast rights but about telecommunications services--not about broadcast rights but about telecommunications services--like cellular or international calling. 
Clearly, there is a difference of opinion about what U.S. law allows in the area of ownership of telecommunications services. This is a difference of opinion, not only between the Senator from South Carolina and USTR, but between the Senator and something called the Federal Communications Commission, which he declines to recognize on this matter. 
The Senator, as the former chairman of the Commerce Committee and the ranking member now, also disagrees with the current chairman of the committee, Senator John McCain, who has just spoken, as well as the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Bliley, over this law. 
As I understand it, the U.S. offer in the telecommunications agreement tracks U.S. law, meaning this dispute is really over the interpretation of current U.S. law by the FCC, which the ranking member of the Commerce Committee does not like, not the trade agreement reached by USTR. 
I thoroughly agree with the Senator from South Carolina that Congress must assert its constitutional right and responsibility to oversee international trade and international commerce, and I am in full agreement Congress should act when a trade agreement makes commitments that differ from current law. But that is already the law of the land. That exists now under the current law. 
If a trade agreement reached by the executive branch requires a change in law, Congress must act to implement the agreement. When the President agreed to the Uruguay round, Congress had to pass implementing legislation for us to meet its terms, which we did. However, to cite another example, when the President agreed to the shipbuilding agreement at the OECD, Congress did not agree to change American law to implement that particular agreement. 
As somebody who, like the former chairman and ranking member of the Commerce Committee, opposed NAFTA as I did, I am certainly not saying that we should signal that this or any other administration has a blank check to make trade agreements that are not in America's interest. But that is not what the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina is about. This amendment would create a whole new role for Congress that could have a chilling effect--would have a chilling effect--on trade negotiations that, in fact, seek to serve and strengthen U.S. interests, which he talks about. 
My problem with the Senator's amendment is that it would do much more to reaffirm Congress' role in responding to trade agreements that require a change in our laws. By using the language in the amendment which says that any trade law which would--and then the keywords are--`in effect amend or repeal statutory law,' I am afraid it would entangle Congress in a constant, complicated, unnecessary process of acting on trade agreements that do not embody actual changes in U.S. law and don't require congressional involvement to obtain the benefits of those agreements. 
I respect the fact that the Senator questions a part of the new telecommunications trade agreement negotiated in Geneva. Disagreements between members of the legislative branch and executive branch are very common, even on an intraparty basis. But we have existing procedures to resolve disputes like that when they come up. A challenge can be taken up with the courts or something called legislation can be offered to change the particular practice in dispute. 
The problem with the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina is that instead of proposing a specific change of law, which addresses his interpretation of the law affecting ownership of telecommunications services, he is proposing a new, generic, far-reaching role for Congress that could affect nearly all future trade agreements. 
For example, USTR recently concluded an agreement which would eliminate tariffs that were on some widely sought after anti-AIDS drugs. Under current law, this could be put into effect--under current law--in 60 days under Presidential proclamation authority. However, if the Hollings amendment were to pass, such routine and noncontroversial changes would require a new act of Congress that could mean waiting months or maybe even watching the benefits of this trade agreement never materialize. 
The amendment by the Senator from South Carolina calls for a major shift in U.S. trade policy. It has not been discussed or considered in the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over all reciprocal trade agreements. 
Finally, even if all these questions could be answered, the House has already said that they will `blue slip' the waiver resolution if it contains this amendment, because it goes against the constitutional provision that all measures which affect revenues must originate in the House of Representatives. So this amendment on the waiver resolution would doom the underlying nomination, and Charlene Bar- shefsky is too good a nominee to see that happen. 
With respect for my colleague from South Carolina, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against his amendment. This is not the way, not the time, nor the policy to use in resolving the Senator's dispute over a specific provision of a specific trade agreement. That disagreement should be pursued through other avenues that all of us use on a very regular basis. In this case, the amendment would establish an entirely new process, a new law, a new role for Congress regarding all trade agreements. It is a role that is unnecessary and could prevent our trade negotiators from doing the kinds of work that we charge them to do in representing our best interests. 
Rarely, if ever, have I seen an international agreement that has virtually no opponents in either the business community or from American workers. Usually, people point to winners and losers in international trade agreements. Sometimes people are afraid they could lose their jobs, or they feel that their business could be disadvantaged relative to their competitors. But on this Telecom agreement, notwithstanding the objections of the Senator from South Carolina and a couple of others, I've heard barely a peep. 
This international telecommunications agreement truly breaks new ground. For the first time ever, an international trade agreement effectively guarantees competition. The United States put forward regulatory guidelines modeled on our own telecommunications law, and 65 countries agreed to adopt most, if not all, those procompetitive principles. That is extraordinary. 
This agreement between 69 countries will open nearly 95 percent of the worldwide telecommunications services market to competition. A market which will exceed $600 billion in gross revenues this year alone. Mr. President, I'd point out that in April of last year, Charlene Barshefsky walked away from the talks when only 40 countries had made offers, representing only 60 percent of global revenues. 
Included in this agreement are local, long-distance, and international calling services; submarine cables; satellite-based services; wide-band networks; cellular phones; business intranets; and fixed wireless services for rural and underserved regions. What this agreement did not cover are broadcast services. 
It is believed that competition by telecom service providers is expected to lead more than $1 trillion in economic benefits for consumers around the world through 2010. While U.S. consumers have already reaped much of the benefit of deregulation and increased competition, the FCC has pointed to billions of dollars of savings from this deal for American consumers due to the eventual lowering of costs for international calling by 80 percent--from more than $1 per minute to less than 20 cents--the actual cost of placing such a call. 
I'll admit that I am disappointed that some countries, such as Japan, Korea, and Canada, didn't offer to open up their markets quite as much as the United States did, but reaching this agreement doesn't in any way prevent us from further negotiations with them in this area. 
I'd also point out two things. First, even though these countries, and some others, maintained limits on purchasing existing providers, in most cases, American firms can still go in to those same countries and compete on their own--and the regulatory principles will guarantee that they are not blocked from connecting to existing telecommunications networks. 
Second, if it is Japan we are talking about, the idea that anyone plans to purchase more than 20 percent of NTT any time soon, is ridiculous. NTT is the world's largest company, worth well over $100 billion--I'm told that 20 percent would cost about $23 billion. Right now, 3 percent of NTT is owned by foreigners, and I haven't heard that anyone plans to buy much more than that. What American firms are talking about is the chance to start or invest in new common carriers in Japan, such as Japan Telecom, which is connected to the Japanese Railroad, and which anyone can invest in with no limitations. I'll admit that I am concerned with the 20-percent limitation on KDD, which is a much smaller company than NTT--about the size of one of our Baby Bells, but I'm hopeful we can work this out in future negotiations. 
To conclude, today we have finally reached the moment to extend the title of United States Trade Representative to somebody who I think is magnificently qualified to take that job. Superb qualifications, superbly tested, and now prepared to advance America's interests even further. What we are going through today threatens to block her, which hurts her in China, which hurts her in Japan, which hurts her all over the world, and therefore through hurting her, our interests. 
So I urge the unanimous vote that she deserves, that she be made Ambassador, the granting of the Dole waiver that is required, and the defeat of the amendment that does not belong here and has consequences that could truly harm, not help, American interests. I yield the floor and thank the distinguish Finance chairman.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on February 28, 1872, the West Virginia State Legislature passed a proposal to create the Concord State Normal School. Now, 125 years later, Concord College, as it is commonly referred to, educates some 2,400 students in a wide range of programs. I wanted to take this opportunity to share with my colleagues my pride in this remarkable institution that celebrates its 125th year of bringing southern West Virginia's best and brightest together. 
The enabling legislation that created Concord provided no State funds for the school. So the townspeople raised $1,700 by subscription to erect the first building on land donated by Mr. William Harvey Martin. On May 10, 1875, 70 students attended classes that first session in a rough frame building. In 1885, under the leadership of principal Capt. James Harvey French, the school received $5,000 in State funds to build a new brick building to recognize the service given the State by the school. That new building was completed in 1887, and the first dormitory was built in 1891, on North State Street. In 1896, the town in which the college is located changed its name to Athens in recognition of Concord's role as a crucial and influential center of education for southern West Virginia. 
In November 1910, the downtown facilities were destroyed by fire. The faculty and students were resilient, as typical West Virginians are, and they began holding classes the next day in other locations about town. The current campus site on Vermillion Street in Athens was bought by the town in early 1911. The campus endured a second and even more damaging fire in 1912, but Concord rebounded stronger than ever. 
On July 1, 1919, Concord gained its independence from the State Normal School in Huntington. The title of principal of the institution was changed to president. The school awarded its first baccalaureate degree to three graduates in June 1923. Eight years later the school changed its name to the Concord State Teachers' College. Under the direction of President Joseph Franklin Marsh, Sr., the named changed again in 1943, to the current Concord College. 
President Joseph F. Marsh, Jr., one of the longest serving presidents, oversaw the construction of the Alexander Fine Arts Center, Centennial Hall, three residence halls, the faculty housing units at Witherspoon Park, and the maintenance building. Years later, in the administration of President Meredith N. Freeman, enrollment grew and several new academic programs were established. And as of 1991, under the direction of current president, Jerry Beasley, Concord became one of the first institutions in the Nation to join the prestigious Bonner Scholars Program. The Bonner Program rewards students who are actively involved in public service by helping to finance their college education. 
This program, in particular, is very dear to me. In 1964, I moved to West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer. To see that our young people want to be involved in community service warms my heart and gives me hope for the future. 
In recognition of the legislative act founding Concord State Normal School, an anniversary convocation has been designated for today in Athens. 
Mr. President, Concord College is an enormously important part of West Virginia higher education, and continues to be an institution West Virginia residents are proud of. The 125th anniversary convocation taking place today is a program commemorating the college's beginning--and its future. I have no doubt the school's future will continue to be a bright one.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be reintroducing a modest but important bill that would establish a demonstration project to assure Medicare beneficiaries with cancer that Medicare will cover their routine patient costs when part of a clinical research trial. I am especially proud to have Senator Mack joining me again as my key cosponsor. It is a privilege to work with Senator Mack, who knows the anguish of fighting cancer only too well. And, we are especially glad to be joined by so many of our colleagues, including Senators Frist, Moynihan, Kennedy, Abraham, Kerrey, Craig, Wellstone, Cochran, Mikulski, Campbell, Leahy, Jeffords, Hutchison, Hollings, and Faircloth. 
Mr. President, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Medicare beneficiaries account for more than half of all cancer diagnoses, and 60 percent of all cancer deaths. Over 12,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed this year in my own State of West Virginia. 
Access to clinical trials is especially important in the field of cancer. With today's rapid discoveries of new cancer therapies and the lack of effective treatments for some cancers, peer-reviewed clinical trials often provide cancer patients the best available care. Given differences in biological responses according to age, research is needed on the particular effects of cancer and cancer treatments on those age 65 and older. Our legislation will promote that vital research. At the same time, it will provide the Health Care Financing Administration with the information it needs on whether coverage for experimental therapies and treatments should be eventually extended to the entire Medicare population. In the long run, the coverage of patient care costs in clinical trials will save the health care delivery system millions of dollars by telling us at the earliest possible time which medical interventions work and which do not. 
Our legislation is an effort to give Medicare beneficiaries the security and decency of knowing that if they are diagnosed with cancer, their treatment options will be determined by whatever therapy they and their doctor decide will give them the best shot of beating the disease. These life and death decisions should not be guided by what may or may not be paid for by the Medicare Program. 
Currently, Medicare's payment policies are unclear and, as a result, unpredictable. There is anecdotal evidence that Medicare, in fact, usually pays for the routine patient care 
costs associated with clinical research trials. But when denials do happen, they tend to be arbitrary and random. This unpredictability discourages Medicare patients from enrolling in a clinical trial, even when it may medically be their best treatment option. 
Three winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology have written me and Senator Mack in support of our legislation. They wrote, `clinical trials represent the standard of care and are often the best hope for a successful treatment outcome. Only by supporting clinical research will we be able to advance the state of medical knowledge and learn more quickly which medical interventions are effective and which are not.' 
Mr. President, our legislation is very targeted to give older Americans their best shot at fighting cancer. This bill does not create a new benefit. It merely ensures that patients enrolled in clinical studies receive Medicare coverage for the same type of routine patient care costs, such as hospital and physician fees, that would be covered outside of a trial setting. We are not asking Medicare to pay for the cost of research. These expenses will still be covered by trial sponsors, including pharmaceutical companies. 
In establishing a demonstration project, this bill will also provide valuable information about the costs and benefits of providing coverage for clinical trials for other life threatening diseases. We started with cancer first because cancer is a major affliction of Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, there is a well-established national cancer clinical trial system to deliver this patient care. 
Mr. President, this is the year to enact this bill into law. This proposal is a key Medicare reform to include in the action expected in the upcoming budget process that will deal with Medicare spending and policy.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be reintroducing a bill with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, to improve the security and protection of Medicare supplemental policies, so-called MediGap policies. I am especially pleased that Senator Jeffords, both the new chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and one of the newest members of the Finance Committee, Senator Frist, and Senator Collins have joined us this year as original cosponsors of our legislation. And I continue to be pleased that similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by the bipartisan team of Representatives Nancy Johnson and John Dingell. 
When enacted, our bipartisan, bicameral bill will make MediGap policies more portable, more reliable, and more accessible for almost 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, including 5 million disabled Medicare beneficiaries. 
Last year, when we introduced this bill, we were not terribly optimistic that it would get enacted before the end of the 104th Congress. But we put forward our legislation anyway to share our proposal and objectives, begin building momentum for changes we feel are necessary, and to preview the fact that we would be back in the 105th Congress with a concerted effort to make this a legislative priority. As it turns out, having identified MediGap improvements as an area of bipartisan concern, President Clinton has responded directly by adding the same goal of new MediGap protections as a priority he shares and included it in his recently submitted budget proposal. We are very happy that our bipartisan support for improved MediGap protections got noticed by the President and will be pursued by his administration in the upcoming budget process. 
Mr. President, too many Americans are falling through the gaps in our health care system. For example, consider the situation of a 44-year-old disabled man from Capon Bridge, WV. He earns too much money to qualify for Medicaid and is unable to buy a private MediGap policy because of his medical condition. And, there is the 47-year-old woman from Slanesville, WV, who is in a similar situation. She was uninsured before qualifying for Medicare because of kidney disease. She and her husband have too many assets to qualify for Medicaid and they can't afford the $300-a-month health insurance policy offered by her husband's employer. They have not been able to find an insurer willing to sell them a MediGap policy to help with Medicare's hefty cost-sharing requirements. A MediGap policy would be more affordable for them than the insurance policy offered by her 
husband's employer which duplicates, rather than supplements, Medicare's benefits. Many of the 50,000 disabled West Virginians who qualify for Medicare are in a similar situation. This is wrong and we can do better. 
Mr. President, almost 8 in 10 older Americans have opted to purchase policies through private insurance companies to fill gaps in their Medicare benefits. This MediGap insurance commonly covers the $756 deductible required for each hospital stay, the part B deductible for doctor visits and doctor copayments. MediGap policies also cover copayments for nursing home care, extended rehabilitation, or for emergency care received abroad. Some MediGap policies cover prescription drugs. 
But even MediGap policies have gaps because of insurance underwriting practices which prevent beneficiaries from switching MediGap insurers or, as in the case of the Medicare disabled, from even initially purchasing MediGap protection. 
Employers, looking to lower their health care costs, are increasingly cutting back on retiree health benefits. In just 2 years, employer-sponsored retiree health benefits has dropped by 5 percent. These retirees are forced to go out on the private market and purchase individual MediGap coverage. Those lucky enough to find insurance will find their coverage compromised by preexisting condition limitations. Some won't find an insurer willing to sell them a policy at any price. 
In 1990, I worked with Senator Chafee, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and the then-chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bentsen, On enacting a number of measures to improve the value of MediGap policies. We also successfully enacted legislation that standardized MediGap policies so that seniors could more easily compare the prices and benefits provided by MediGap insurers. 
At that time, Congress also mandated that insurers must sell a MediGap policy to any senior wishing to buy coverage when that person first becomes eligible for Medicare, without being subject to medical underwriting. At the time, there was a worry that including the Medicare disabled population in this open enrollment period would escalate premiums for current MediGap policyholders. As a result, the disabled were not included in this guaranteed issue requirement. Since then, 12 States have moved ahead and required insurers to issue policies to all Medicare beneficiaries in their States, including the disabled. To my knowledge, not one State has reported large hikes in premiums as a result of their new laws. 
We have also asked the American Academy of Actuaries for an independent analysis of our legislation. We are confident 
that their evaluation of our bill will lay to rest any concerns about wild hikes in MediGap premiums because of our provision to end the current law discrimination against the disabled. 
Mr. President, our bill would protect all Medicare beneficiaries by guaranteeing them MediGap coverage if they are forced to change their MediGap insurer, or if their employer stops providing retiree health benefits. Specifically, our bill would require MediGap insurers to sell Medicare beneficiaries a new MediGap policy without any preexisting condition limitations if an individual moves outside the State in which the insurer is licensed, or the health plan goes out of business; if an individual loses their employer-sponsored retiree health benefits; if an individual enrolled in a health maintenance organization [HMO] or Medicare Select policy moves outside of a health plan's service area, or if the HMO's contract is canceled; or if an individual enrolled in a HMO or a Medicare Select policy decides during their first 12 months of enrollment to return to a MediGap fee-for-service policy. 
Mr. President, our bill gives Medicare beneficiaries an opportunity to try out a managed care plan without worrying about losing their option to return to fee-for-service medicine. Understandably, many seniors worry about enrolling in a managed care organization if it means losing access to their lifelong doctor. Our bill would encourage Medicare beneficiaries to try out a managed care plan to see if it suits them, but our bill gives them a way back to fee-for-service medicine, if that ends up being their personal preference. 
Our legislation bans insurance companies from imposing any preexisting condition limitation during the 6-month open enrollment period for MediGap insurance when a person first qualifies for Medicare. This change from current law makes the rules for MediGap policies consistent with the recently enacted Kassebaum-Kennedy bill for the under-65 population, and with Medicare coverage which begins immediately, regardless of any preexisting conditions. 
Mr. President, our bill also includes a section to help seniors choose the right health plan for them by ensuring that they get good information on what plans are available in their area. It allows them to compare different health plans based on results of consumer satisfaction surveys, and will include information on benefits and costs. 
Our bill does not directly address affordability. And, even since we introduced our original bill last September, there is growing evidence that MediGap premiums are skyrocketing. I am hopeful that the Finance Committee will take a closer look at this issue during its deliberations on 
other Medicare reform initiatives. Between 1995 and 1996, large numbers of seniors received double-digit increases in their MediGap premiums. These increases were far in excess of Social Security cost-of-living increases and varied dramatically across States. In my own State of West Virginia, MediGap policies sold by the Prudential Insurance Co. increased by 17 percent between 1995 and 1996. In Ohio, premiums increased by 30 percent and in California by 37 percent. 
Congress has considerable history in trying to guarantee at least a minimal level of value across all MediGap policies. Under the current law, individual and group MediGap policies must spend at least 65 and 75 percent, respectively, of all premium dollars collected, on benefits. If a MediGap plan fails to meet these minimum loss ratios, they must issue refunds or credits to their customers. 
Mr. President, while Federal loss ratio standards help assure a minimum level of value, they do not prevent insurance companies from annually upping premiums as a senior ages. This practice, known as attained age-rating, results in the frailest and the lowest income seniors facing large, annual premium hikes as they age. I would hope that more States would follow the lead of the 10 States that have already banned attained age-rating. This would vastly improve the affordability of MediGap for the oldest and frailest of our seniors. 
Mr. President, to repeat what I said last year, our bill is a targeted, modest, proposal. But it would provide very real and very significant help to millions of Medicare beneficiaries who, year in and year out, pay out billions of dollars in premiums to have peace of mind when it comes to the cost of their health care. It is wrong and unfair when senior and disabled citizens in West Virginia and across the country are suddenly dropped by insurers or denied a MediGap policy just because they move to another State, or their employer cuts back on promised retiree health benefits, or because they're disabled. 
Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to be working on legislation with the Senator from Rhode Island. Senator Chafee has a long, impressive, and, more important, successful record in enacting legislation that has helped millions of seniors, children, and disabled. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Jeffords, Frist, and Collins in cosponsoring this bill, and to help us extend more of the health care peace of mind that older and disabled Americans ask for and deserve.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am submitting this statement to express my support for the nomination of my former colleague, William Cohen, to be the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America. Unfortunately, as with today's earlier vote for Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State, I am necessarily absent from the Senate, and am unable to cast my vote for Senator Cohen. Again, because of plans that had to be scheduled long ago, I am presently leading a group of more than 30 West Virginians on a trade mission to Japan and Taiwan that is called Project Harvest II. 
I personally regret, however, that I am missing a chance to vote on the nomination of William Cohen. Senator Cohen and I served together in the Senate for twelve years, and in that time he distinguished himself as a serious legislator with a keen intellect who continually transcended party boundaries to build bridges and advance America's national interests. 
The challenges facing Senator Cohen today are no less daunting than those faced by Secretaries of Defense in times of war and cold war. The United States stands today as the only military superpower in the world. That brings with it great responsibility to lead in all corners of the globe. Bill Cohen is uniquely talented to take on these challenges, and like my colleagues I applaud him for agreeing to take on this challenge, and the President for nominating him.

 Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am submitting this statement to express my strongest support for the nomination of Madeleine Korbel Albright to be the Secretary of State of the United States of America. Unfortunately, I am necessarily absent from the Senate, and am unable to cast my vote for Ms. Albright. Because of plans that had to be scheduled long ago, I am presently leading a group of more than 30 West Virginians on a trade mission to Japan and Taiwan that is called Project Harvest II. 
This trade mission, the second I have led to Asia, is vitally important to the long-term economic vitality of my State. Since the first Project Harvest Trade mission in 1995, tens of millions of dollars in contracts, and many new jobs have flowed back to West Virginia. That first trip also served as a key step in bringing companies like Sino-Swearingen and Toyota to West Virginia--international investments that have changed the face of West Virginia's manufacturing profile. 
The globalization of the economy is the greatest force shaping international relations in the last years of the millennium, and the kinds of relationships that West Virginia is developing around the world are a key unifying factor in this new world order. Trade missions like Project Harvest can be an extension of America's international interest in fostering peace, stability, and prosperity across the globe. 
I personally regret, however, that I am missing a chance to vote on the nomination of Madeleine Albright. Mr. President, I don't think President Clinton could have made a wiser choice in selecting Madeleine Albright for this central post in his administration. I have known Madeleine Albright for many years, and have rarely seen such a combination of intelligence, skill, experience, principle, values, and, Mr. President, patriotism, in all my days. 
Madeleine Albright brings all these things to the service of her adopted nation. A daughter of Central European strife, she has a unique world view that brings into clear focus some of the most difficult and compelling challenges we face as the world's last true military and economic superpower. 
Of course the world today is a remarkably different place than the one we faced 50 years ago, 15 years ago, and even 5 years ago. I am further struck by the fact that we are defining this time by what it is not, that is the cold war--rather than by what it is--a transition time in the world's history where one historic power, Europe, is struggling to define itself; and another, China, is struggling to assert its place in the world. It is into this breach that Madeleine Albright has been tasked to define and promote America's global interests. 
Traditionally, American foreign policy has had Europe and the Atlantic as its focal point. While we must continue making Europe a priority, we also see Asia growing in importance in economic, military, and other terms. This means that geographically, strategically, and economically, the United States sits astride both worlds. 
Because of my own long-time involvement in United States-Japan relations and Asia issues generally, I want to voice my confidence that Secretary of State Albright will provide the needed leadership, insight, and attention to the Pacific region in her role as the Clinton Administration's chief of international diplomacy and as a key part of his national security team. She understands the challenges we face together as Pacific neighbors; she appreciates the differences and complexities that are presented; and she will be a clear and forceful advocate for America's peaceable interests and the goals we share with our allies and the people of nations worldwide. 
Mr. President, I believe that Madeleine Albright is a superb choice for Secretary of State. I ask her forgiveness that I am unable to stand and vote for her today, and I pledge to work with her in every way possible.

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very, very proud to be a part of this resolution and to thank Senator Robert C. Byrd on behalf of the people of West Virginia certainly, but also, frankly, the people of the United States and the whole process of order, which is the way we govern ourselves. I think extraordinary in history, he is the third Senator to be elected to seven 6-year terms--a remarkable accomplishment. 
The Almanac of American Politics says that Robert C. Byrd is the kind of Senator that the Founding Fathers had in mind when they, in fact, wrote the Constitution about the way the Senate ought to be. That should not come as a surprise to any of us who know him well. 
We have heard so many times the fact of his being a truly self-made person, something which his junior colleague could not claim in quite the same fashion. But we know that he is the son of a coal miner, and we know about the law degree while he was in the House of Representatives. What we have to keep emphasizing, though, is what he means not just to the State, not just to the country, but to this institution, because more than any other person that I have read about in history, or know about, he is the conscience of the Senate. When we have a lack of civility, when we lose our sense of bipartisanship, when there is anger on the floor of the Senate, when the process breaks down, he grieves. He grieves not on behalf of himself, but on behalf of this thing called `governance,' which is pretty fundamental for the future of our country. I think he worries about that. I know that he places the U.S. Senate as a particularly responsible body for what is going to happen to our future and how it will happen. Will it be done in a way that is bipartisan and civil--the business of civility in this greatest deliberative body in the world? 
I will more or less conclude on this. I really think of him in moral terms. From time to time, when I give speeches, I like to refer to when you are really doing your best work, you are following an inner moral compass. I think that I started talking about that after watching Senator Byrd, not only when I was Governor of West Virginia and before, but also here in the U.S. Senate. He really operates out of a moral compass. He does what he thinks is right. He has a very strict sense of the discipline of what ought to happen in this body. Sometimes he lectures us on that, and sometimes people are briefly impatient with that, but they always stand back because they know he is right. They know he is right. They know he speaks for the U.S. Senate, which he reveres so much. 
Let me close by saying that on this coming Saturday there is going to be a statue inside the West Virginia Capitol, which is not really much smaller than the one we stand in at the present moment. It is a statue of Senator Byrd. There is no other statue of any other political person in the West Virginia State Capitol. There will be a lot of people there, and for good reason--because the relationship and the chemistry between Senator Byrd and the people of West Virginia is something that is profoundly moving and important and refreshing, frankly. 
We honor him for serving for 50 years, which means he has been out amongst the people all this time. He has never changed. The people of West Virginia have really never changed. He is a man of values speaking to a people of values. It is interesting. As he begins to talk, you see people fall silent. They realize they don't want to miss what Senator Byrd might be saying because they know it is not going to be trivial or political, and it is going to be important. It is going to have to do with fundamental values and the fundamental nature of the way this country ought to be and the way the State of West Virginia ought to be. 
So I look forward to being with him this coming Saturday. I join with the distinguished majority leader, the Democratic leader, and the distinguished Senator from Nevada in praising and being grateful to my senior colleague.
