   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators MCCONNELL and TORRICELLI to introduce the Election Reform Act. I believe that this legislation will play an important role in improving elections in the United States. 
   The situation in Florida with different counties using different equipment, different standards and different methodologies in the conduct of the election is a clear indication that reform is needed. Although elections are within the purview of the states, if the Federal government can provide incentives and financial assistance to update equipment and administration to ensure that every vote counts, that would be a giant step forward. 
   Our democracy is based on the principle that our political leaders are chosen through a fair and accurate election process. While the aftermath of this year's election brought much 
   disagreement, it is clear that the voting system is antiquated and in need of reform. 
   This legislation establishes a permanent, federal Commission dedicated to election administration. This Commission will consist of four Commissioners appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commissioners will serve four-year terms, with no more than two Commissioners affiliated with the same political party. 
   The Commission would do the following: study various aspects of election administration and make periodic recommendations on such topics as ballot design, accuracy, security, and technological advances in voting equipment; develop and update voluntary standards for voting systems at least every four years; study accessibility to polling places and recommend voluntary guidelines to increase access to polling places; allocate $100 million in matching funds to States and localities that improve their voting systems in a manner consistent with voluntary recommendations developed by the Commission. 
   This legislation has the support of the Voting Integrity Project, the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate and the National Organization on Disability, the American Foundation for the Blind, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
   As we move forward in the 21st century, it is essential that the all Americans, and nations throughout the world, continue to have confidence in our electoral process. This means modernizing the system to include new, cost-effective technologies that can improve election administration. The reforms embodied in this legislation will permit these advances. I am hopeful one of the first acts of the 107th Congress will be to pass this legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable public servant who has been taken from us all too quickly. 
   The sudden loss of Representative JULIAN DIXON has shocked and saddened us all. Without a doubt, JULIAN served California's Thirty-Second District with passion and distinction. He was a man of the highest integrity and credibility and his departure is a terrible loss to all of us. 
   He was a gentleman in every sense of the word who was willing to work across partisan lines to improve the lives of his constituents and so many Americans. 
   I was privileged as a member of the Senate Appropriations to work with JULIAN DIXON, who was a member of the House Appropriations Committee. 
   In this role, JULIAN always put California's needs first. He helped aid small businesses in Southern California who had been hurt by military base closures and defense downsizing. He also was a champion of the Los Angeles Metro Subway and the Alameda Corridor, an underground connection between the port of Los Angeles and the major east-west rail lines. 
   He also consistently fought to maintain our Nation's commitment to civil rights and to increase the economic upward mobility of the people of the Thirty-Second District. 
   JULIAN was also a leader through his role on the Appropriations Committee to secure funds to rebuild after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and to improve public transportation throughout Los Angeles.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to John J. Hock, the devoted father of my press secretary Jim Hock. 
   John Hock will be remembered by friends and family for his deep devotion to his religious faith, family, and football. His family members recall that although he was not one to yell or scream, he always commanded great respect from everyone who knew him. His greatest treasure was his family. Jim always spoke of the selflessness of this father, who even in his last days, wanted to ensure that his family would be taken care of once he was gone. 
   A natural athlete, Mr. Hock played in the National Footfall League as an offensive tackle for the Chicago Cardinals. During the Korean war, Mr. Hock, a participant in the Olympic trials in the late 1940's, also entertained troops while on USO football teams in Japan. After returning from the Korean war, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, where he played as a guard from 1953-1957. As captain of the Santa Clara University's football team, Mr. Hock led his teammates to victory over the top-ranked University of Kentucky in the 1965 Orange Bowl. 
   During the off-season, Mr. Hock taught high school in Los Angeles to make ends meet. It was while he was working as a teacher that he met his wife, Bernadette. His family remembers how devoted they were to one another. Because her husband was too humble to promote himself, Mrs. Hock carried around his paying cards to give to friends. Their son Joseph put it best when he said that his mother and father were one. 
   In 1960, his pro-football career over and family growing, Mr. Hock moved into sales and marketing at Western Carloading, a Los Angeles-based trucking and shipping company. From 1988 until this year, he worked as a sales agent for Coldwell Baker Realty in Mahwah, spending his freetime with his grandchildren, his family members said. 
   He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Bernadette, his sister, Ruth Rahe, his children, Jay, Joseph, Jim, Mary, Susan, Anna, and Lisa, and 11 of his grandchildren. 
   Mr. President, Mr. Hock will be greatly missed, not because he entertained us, but because he stands as a reminder of the importance of family. As the holiday season draws near, let us all remember what John Hock always knew: Family and friends are truly the sweetest rewards.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support bankruptcy reform, and I voted in favor of the Senate bankruptcy bill, this past February. Simply put, people who can afford to repay their debts, should repay their debts. 
   However, I cannot support the version of bankruptcy legislation outlined in the Conference Report to H.R. 2415. The Conference Report has dropped key provisions from the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill, and has failed to protect consumers against irresponsible creditor practices. Thus, I intend to vote ``No''. 
   Let me recount my concerns. 
   First, the Conference Report lets wealthy individuals continue to purchase multimillion dollar homes that are shielded from creditors' bankruptcy claims. The Senate bill curbed this abuse, voting 76-22 to approve the Kohl amendment placing a $100,000 nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. The Conference Report replaced the Kohl amendment with a two-year ownership or residency requirement that wealthy debtors can easily sidestep. Debtors should not be able to avoid their obligations by funneling money into extravagant estates. The Conference Report lets this egregious practice continue. 
   Second, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator Schumer's amendment to prevent anti-abortion extremists from using bankruptcy laws to avoid paying civil judgements against them. The Senate passed the Schumer amendment by an overwhelming 80-17 vote. It protects a woman's right to choose and the ongoing effectiveness of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances, FACE, Act. The FACE Act has led to successful criminal and civil judgements against groups that use intimidation and outright violence to prevent people from obtaining or providing reproductive health services. I am deeply disappointed that the Conference Report has omitted this important provision. 
   Third, I had hoped that the Conference Report would work to improve the limited consumer credit card protections in the Senate bill. Unfortunately, the Conference Report has gone the other way--consumer protections have been deleted. For example, the Senate passed an amendment by Senator BYRD that would have required any credit card solicitation on the Internet to be accompanied by information from the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, that gives consumers advice about selecting and using credit cards. The Conference Report dropped this provision. 
   Additionally, the Conference Report deleted an amendment by Senator LEVIN that would have made it clear that consumers do not owe interest for on-time credit card payments. Presently, many credit card solicitations advise consumers that interest is not charged on payments made within a grace period (such as 25 days). However, in the fine print, these agreements state that if the entire debt is not paid back, the cardholder is liable for interest on the full amount charged. Say $995 is paid off of a $1,000 credit debt, most people reasonably assume that they owe interest on just the unpaid $5. Not so. The credit card company will charge consumers interest retroactively on the full $1,000. This important amendment would have brought interest charges in line with consumer expectations. 
   When analyzing legislation, it is often telling to review the opinions of those groups with no financial stake in the outcome. Overwhelmingly, the non-partisan experts on bankruptcy--the judges, trustees, and academics--have expressed serious concerns or opposition to this bankruptcy bill. These organizations include the National Bankruptcy Conference, NBC, the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, NCBJ, the National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees, NACTT, the National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees, NABT, and law professors from many of our nation's law schools.  On October 30, 2000, for example, 91 law professors wrote to me that the ``bill is deeply flawed,'' and will not achieve balanced reform. The professors state that ``..... the problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved, particularly those provisions that adversely affect woman and children.'' 
   Congress should also take note that, after soaring to record levels in the mid-1990s, bankruptcy filings declined in recent years. In 1998, bankruptcy filings totaled 1,442,549. In 1999, bankruptcy filings totaled 1,319,540 cases, a decline of almost 10 percent from the previous year. 
   A final note, Mr. President. When the 107th Congress convenes, the Senate will be evenly divided for the first time in over a century. If we are to govern, to conduct the nation's business, we have to be able to work across party lines. The bankruptcy Conference Report we are considering this afternoon is a case study of how not to govern. There was no conference; this report emerged as the product of negotiations held exclusively between House and Senate Republicans. Maybe if they had consulted with the minority, they could have fashioned a bill the minority could support. But they didn't. They deliberately excluded us. The result is a Conference Report the President has vowed to veto. 
   Bankruptcy reform requires a balanced bill that is fair to both debtors and creditors. This bill doesn't measure up. I intend to vote no on passage of the Conference Report to H.R. 2415. I hope that Congress will revisit bankruptcy reform in the 107th Congress, and work in a bipartisan way to address known abuses in our bankruptcy laws.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last month the Senate and House approved the conference report to the fiscal year 2001 intelligence authorization bill. Title VIII of the conference report is based on legislation I introduced along with Senators WELLSTONE, GRAMS, BOXER, LEVIN, and HATCH that would create an interagency process to declassify records on activities of the Japanese Imperial Government. Specifically, title VIII is based on the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, a law written by my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DEWINE, and our House colleague from new York, Representative CAROLYN MALONEY. This law requires the federal government to search through its records and disclose any classified materials it has on Nazi war crimes, the Nazi Holocaust and the looting of assets and property by the Nazis. Leading what has become the largest declassification of U.S. government records in American history is the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group, or IWG, which consists of representatives of key government departments and agencies and three public members appointed by the President. The work done by the IWG and a team of historians and experts at the National Archives has been nothing less than extraordinary. However, the law only gives the IWG just until the end of next year to complete this enormous task. After discussing this with the Senator from Ohio, we agreed that the best course of action was to extend the authorization of the existing IWG until the end of 2003, and give it additional authority to oversee the declassification of Japanese Imperial Government records. In that way, the IWG will be able to undertake an effort to search through U.S. Government records and disclose any classified materials it has on the Japanese Imperial Government similar to the declassification effort underway on Nazi war crimes. In addition, we also thought it was important to ensure that the IWG had a funding authorization to carry out its activities, including the preservation of records that are being declassified. I see the Senator from Ohio on the floor, and I ask if he has anything he wishes to add at this point.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As I understand it, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act effectively creates a process of review of records, and then a process to determine which of these records are to be declassified under the criteria provided in the act. The act contains exceptions that could be cited to justify a decision not to declassify. However, these exceptions apply only to decisions relating to declassification, and are not to be used as a reason to not review records for relevancy. As the author of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, would the Senator of Ohio agree with my interpretation?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. With that said, some people have raised concerns that the removal of the National Security Act of 1947 exemption in title VIII, which was included in the original legislation, could impede the ability of the IWG in its declassification efforts. It is my understanding, however, that the intent of title VIII, like the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, requires all U.S. Government classified records be reviewed for relevancy, including intelligence records. Is that also the understanding of the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today the Senate passed by unanimous consent important legislation Senator KYL and I sponsored that seeks to improve the United States' ability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. This bill, S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000--together with a Kyl-Feinstein amendment making a few technical changes--implements major recommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission on terrorism. 
   Let me describe what the bill would do. First, it urges that the U.S. government continue to take strong and effective actions to investigate the recent attack on the U.S.S. Cole and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. The assault on the Cole is the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It is also the worst attack on a Navy ship since an Iraqi missile struck an American guided-missile frigate in 1987, killing 37 sailors. 
   Second, the bill requires the Department of Justice to review legal authority of federal agencies responsible for responding to a catastrophic terrorist attack and determine whether additional legal authority is necessary. 
   Third, the bill requires the president to establish a program for long-term research and development to counter catastrophic terrorist attacks and submit a report to Congress on this program. It also expresses the sense of Congress that there should be more long-term research and development in this area. 
   Fourth, the bill mandates that the attorney general issue a report on how to improve U.S. controls on biological pathogens and the equipment necessary to produce biological weapons, and requires the Health & Human Services secretary to issue a report on any appropriate actions that should be taken to protect against unlawful diversion of pathogens. 
   Fifth, the bill requires that the president establish a joint task force to develop a broad approach toward discouraging the fundraising activities of international terrorist organizations and that the task force issue a report. 
   Sixth, the bill requires the FBI to report on whether it can set up a central mechanism to distribute intelligence information it gleans about international terrorists to other members of the intelligence community. 
   Seventh, the bill directs the president to review the type of information shared by U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies as well as legal limitations on the sharing of this information. The president shall provide any recommendations regarding the sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information between such agencies. 
   Eighth, the bill mandates that the CIA shall issue a report responding to the Commission on Terrorism's finding that the CIA should scrap a internal classified guideline requiring CIA agents to get approval from headquarters before recruiting unsavory individuals to act as informants about terrorism. 
   Ninth, the bill expresses the Sense of Congress that Syria and Iran should remain on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism. 
   Finally, the bill would ensure that federal counterintelligence personnel be fully reimbursed for buying insurance they purchase to protect themselves from liability if they are sued for their officially authorized activities. Currently, the government reimburses federal criminal law enforcement officers, supervisors, and management officials for one-half of their insurance expenses. These individuals purchase professional liability insurance because government representation may not be available to them. 
   However, FBI special agents and CIA officers who do counterterrorism work may not be reimbursed at all when they buy such insurance. This is particularly unfortunate because counterterrorism work is so risky--especially when the work occurs overseas. There can be few more dangerous tasks than infiltrating a terrorist cell in, say, Yemen or Afghanistan. 
   The Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is not a panacea for the problem of terrorism. Rather, it seeks to implement a number of specific improvements to our counterterrorism policy unanimously suggested by the Commission on Terrorism, a bipartisan group of experts. 
   The bill also lays the groundwork for a number of further improvements. We will be revisiting many of the issues covered by the bill in the next Congress once we receive more detailed information and recommendations from the Executive Branch. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and with the next Administration to implement S. 3205. 
   I believe that we need to take strong action to combat terrorism. There is no question that terrorist attacks will  continue and that they will become more deadly. Terrorists today often act out of a visceral hatred of the U.S. or the West and seek to wreak maximum destruction and kill as many people as possible. 
   At the same time, I believe that our counterterrorism policy must be conducted in a way that remains consistent with our democratic values and our commitment to an open, free society. 
   In many ways, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is a counterpart bill to the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that recently passed the Senate 95 to 0. That legislation, which I cosponsored, will make it easier for American victims of terrorism abroad to collect court-awarded compensation and ensure that the state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes. 
   While I strongly support assisting terrorist victims, I also believe that we need to do more to prevent Americans from becoming victims of terrorism in the first place. Thus, I am glad that the Senate has acted to pass S. 3205 with such dispatch. It is crucial to act now before terrorists strike again, killing and injuring more Americans and leaving more families grieving. I urge the House to pass S. 3205 before we adjourn. 
   In conclusion, I want to thank my good friend Senator KYL for his tireless efforts to get this bill passed. His work, as always, has been invaluable. 
   I also thank my other colleagues for their assistance in helping us pass this bill. I know Senator LEAHY, for instance, initially had a number of concerns with the legislation. I am grateful for the time he spent working through these issues with us, and I am glad that we can move this bill forward unanimously.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with Senator COLLINS on Senate passage of S. 2924, the ``Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000.'' This legislation is an important step forward in the fight against identity theft. 
   ``The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' recognizes that the crime of identity theft has entered the Internet age, and that the Federal government has a responsibility to bring our identity theft laws up to speed. The primary law governing false identification documents was enacted in 1982, well before the advent of websites and e-mail. 
   Specifically, this legislation prohibits individuals from knowingly producing, distributing, or offering for download from the Internet computer files or templates that are designed to make counterfeit identification documents. 
   While the total number of false identification documents sold on the Internet is unknown, purveyors of false identification documents have used the Internet to sell their wares to a much broader market, and to distribute these documents as quickly as they can be downloaded from a website. According to a study by the Senate Committee of Government Affairs, one web site operator reported that he sold 1,000 fake IDs a month yielding $600,000 in annual sales. 
   The ``Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' also closes a loophole in current law that permitted manufacturers of false identification documents to escape liability by displaying a disclaimer, ``Not a Government Document.'' These disclaimers, however, can be easily removed. The bill also directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate efforts to investigate and prosecute the distribution of false identification documents on the Internet. 
   I would note that this bill contains an exemption from criminal liability for certain ``interactive computer services.'' This language reflects a narrow, one-time solution and I want it to be clear that this should not be considered as a precedent. 
   Congress has debated the issue of whether the liability of certain Internet service providers should be limited with respect to particular activities of their subscribers or users of their services. This is a complicated question, requiring careful deliberation and evaluation of the short- and long-term consequences. A full debate on this issue is needed in the 107th Congress.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize California's participants in the Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad for their outstanding efforts and accomplishments. I am so proud of their performances and the dignity with which they carried themselves. 
   This year, the United States had another spectacular Games, and I am particularly pleased that Californians had much to do with our success. Some of this year's most memorable moments involved athletes from California: Marion Jones was the first woman ever to medal in five track and field events, Sean Burroughs helped our baseball team snatch gold from a heavily favored Cuban Team, Eric Fonoimoana and Dain Blanton won gold in the beach volleyball tournament, Venus Williams was the second woman ever to win gold medals in both singles and doubles tennis, and Lisa Leslie led the women's basketball team to its 34th Olympic championship. 
   The Olympics have long been the world's premiere stage where athletes compete; their performances are inspiring and, sometimes, heart-breaking. And while the world enjoys two weeks of drama and intense competition, we must remember that these athletes have chased their Olympic dreams for years, even decades, with perseverance and courage. I thank each athlete--qualifier and medal winner alike--for giving us the privilege of witnessing their triumphs. Each performance was a very personal moment in these athletes' lives, and I am inspired by their courage and resolve to pursue their Olympic dreams. These athletes competed with all their heart and they make California proud.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss one of the greatest threats facing California growers and farmers across the nation--infestations of disease-carrying pests which can potentially destroy entire crops. Just this past year, California has been victimized by a number of pest infestations that have resulted in significant quarantine and eradication programs. California's $1 billion nursery industry is being threatened by red imported fire ants. The $2.8 billion grape industry faces complete destruction due to an infestation of the glassy winged sharpshooter which spreads Pierce's disease, and there is no known cure.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate both the chairman and ranking member's willingness to work with me on this issue. Due to this loss of income, a number of growers are currently unable to pay their bills or prepare for next year's crop. 
   This assistance is desperately needed, but I believe that more emphasis must be placed on preventing future infestations. I am heartened to see that in Fiscal Year 2001, the USDA will hire 17 new agriculture inspectors for the San Diego ports of entry. This is a badly needed first step. We also need to increase the federal investment in California's Medfly Preventive Release Program. If California's fruits were quarantined from all foreign markets because of Medfly infestations, the State estimates that 35,000 jobs would be lost and economic output would be reduced by $3.6 billion.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today, by unanimous consent, passed H.R. 3235, the National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000, a bill that will authorize the Department of Justice to provide grant money to police after-school programs to reduce crime and drug use. This bill is companion legislation to S. 1874, a bill introduced by Senator GRAHAM, Senator BINGAMAN, and myself. The Senate bill has a total of 22 cosponsors. 
   I want to thank my colleagues in this body, particularly my friend Senator HATCH, for their support of this legislation. I also want to thank Representative TOM BARRETT for his work on the bill, and Representatives CANADY and SCOTT for helping shepherd the legislation through the House. 
   I also want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Police Athletic League in spreading the word about the bill. In particular, Ron Exley of the California Police Activities League labored tirelessly to build support for the legislation. 
   H.R. 3235 would create a program directing the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs to award grants to the Police Athletic League, PAL, to establish new PAL chapters to serve public housing projects and other distressed areas and to expand existing chapters to assist additional youth. 
   To do this, the bill would authorize $16 million a year for 5 years beginning with fiscal year 2001. The money would be used to enhance the services provided by the existing 320 established PAL chapters and provide seed money for the establishment of an additional 250 chapters over 5 years. 
   The Police Athletic League was founded by police officers in New York City in 1914. Its mission is to offer an alternative to crime, drugs, and violence for our nation's most at-risk youth. In the last 75 years, PAL has become one of the largest youth-crime prevention programs in the nation, with a network of 1700 facilities serving more than 3000 communities and 1.5 million young people. Over one-third of existing PALs are in California, and these chapters serve more than 300,000 at-risk youth. Off-duty police officers staff local chapters, and PALs receive most of their funding from private sources. 
   PALs currently provide kids with after-school recreational, educational, mentoring, and crime prevention programs. By keeping kids busy and out of trouble, PALs have significantly reduced juvenile crime and victimization in hundreds of communities across the country. One study found, for example, that PALs have cut crime in Baltimore by 30 percent and decreased juvenile victimization there by 40 percent. Another study concluded that PAL reduced crime and gang activity in a HUD housing development in El Centro, California by 64 percent. 
   PAL programs involve close, positive interaction between kids and cops, encouraging youngsters to view the police in a favorable light and obey the law. The programs are generally held after school, during the prime hours that some youth turn to crime and other anti-social activities. 
   PAL programs more than pay for themselves, saving taxpayers millions of dollars in crime, drug, and dropout costs. The Department of Justice has found, for example, that each youngster who drops out of high school and turns to crime and drugs costs taxpayers a staggering $2-3 million. Even so, the legislation requires any new chapter seeking a grant to explain the manner in which it will operate without additional direct federal assistance when the act is discontinued. 
   In short, this valuable legislation will help fight crime and benefit kids in California and across the country. It will now go to President Clinton's desk for signature.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my good friend Senator JON KYL in sponsoring S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000. This bill, introduced last night, seeks to improve our ability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. 
   In light of the events yesterday in the Middle East, there can be no doubt of the need for this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass this important bill. 
   All the evidence now indicates that the cowardly and reprehensible attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer U.S.S. Cole yesterday in Aden was a terrorist suicide attack. It appears that the bombers had infiltrated the port's harbor operations and carefully planned the operation. It is fortunate that the explosion did not set off Tomahawk cruise missiles or other ordnance on board, causing even more devastation. 
   If found to be a terrorist incident, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole would be the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It would also be the worst attack on a Navy ship since an Iraqi missile struck an American guided-missile frigate in 1987, killing 37 sailors. 
   My heart goes out to the families of the American sailors who were killed or injured or who are still missing. Their tragedy underlines the constant danger faced by our armed forces around the world and the need for this country to remain vigilant in protecting them from terrorist and other attacks. 
   The attack on the U.S.S. Cole was no isolated incident. In fact, just today, a bomb was hurled at the British embassy in Yemen, causing a massive explosion. 
   I believe that we need to take strong action to combat terrorism. There is no question that terrorist attacks will continue and that they will become more deadly. Terrorists today often act out of a visceral hatred of the U.S. or the West and seek to wreak maximum destruction and kill as many people as possible. 
   At the same time, I believe that our counterterrorism policy must be conducted in a way that remains consistent with our democratic values and our commitment to an open, free society. 
   To help avert attacks such as those on the U.S.S. Cole, Senator KYL and I have introduced S. 3205. This legislation implements major recommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission on terrorism.  
   Specifically, the bill aims to review legal authority for responding to catastrophic terrorist attacks and increase long-term research and development to counter such attacks, improve controls on biological pathogens and equipment that could be used in a terrorist assault, discourage terrorist fundraising, improve the sharing of information about terrorists, keep Syria and Iran on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, and fully reimburse counterintelligence personnel for insurance they purchase to protect themselves from professional liability. 
   In many ways, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is a counterpart bill to the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that just passed the Senate 95 to 0. That legislation, of which I was a chief cosponsor, will make it easier for American victims of terrorism abroad to collect court-awarded compensation and to ensure that the responsible state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes. The act also contained an amendment I authored with Senator PATRICK LEAHY that will provide faster and better assistance to victims of terrorism abroad. This legislation, which has passed the House as well, will now go the desk of President Clinton, who will sign it. 
   While I strongly support assisting terrorist victims, I also believe that we need to do more to prevent Americans from becoming victims of terrorism in the first place. And I believe that we should act now--before terrorists strike again, killing and injuring more Americans and leaving more families grieving. I urge Congress to act pass S. 3205 before we adjourn.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 conference report. While I have some reservations of some parts of the conference report, I am pleased that a number of important provisions have been included. 
   I would like to focus my comments today on three specific provisions of this report: the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, and the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act. 
   I strongly supported the Violence Against Women Act when we passed it 6 years ago. VAWA was the most comprehensive bill ever passed by Congress to deal with the corrosive problem of domestic violence. I believed then and believe now that this legislation was long overdue. 
   For far too long, there has been an attitude that violence against women is a ``private matter.'' If a woman was mugged by a stranger, people would be outraged and demand action. However, if the same woman was bruised and battered by her husband or boyfriend, they would simply turn away. 
   Attitudes are hard to change. But I believe that VAWA has helped. 
   In the last 5 years, VAWA has enhanced criminal penalties on those who attack women, eased enforcement of protection orders from State to State, and provided over $1.6 billion over 6 years to police, prosecutors, battered women's shelters, a national domestic violence hotline, and other provisions designed to catch and punish batterers and offer victims the support they need to leave their abusers. 
   The Violence Against Women Act works. A Department of Justice study recently found that, during the 6-year period that VAWA has been in effect, violence against women by intimate partners fell 21 percent.  
   However, the same study found that much more work remains to be done. For example: 
   Since 1976, about one-third of all murdered women each year have been killed by their partners; 
   Moreover, women are still much more likely than men to be attacked by their intimate partners. During 1993-1998, women victims of violence were more than seven times more likely to have been attacked by an intimate partner than male victims of violence. 
   VAWA 2000 will help us complete that work. This legislation would do three things. 
   First, the bill would reauthorize through fiscal year 2005 the key programs in the original Violence Against Women Act. These include STOP grants, pro-arrest grants, rural domestic violence and child abuse enforcement grants, the national domestic violence hotline, and rape prevention and education programs. The bill also reauthorizes the court-appointed and special advocate program, CASA, and other programs in the Victims of Child Abuse Act. 
   Second, the bill makes some improvements to VAWA. These include: 
   Funding for grants to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault who need legal assistance because of that violence; 
   Assistance to states and tribal courts to improve interstate enforcement of civil protection orders, as required by the original Violence Against Women Act; 
   Funding for grants to provide short-term housing assistance and short-term support services to individuals and their dependents fleeing domestic violence who are unable to find quickly secure alternative housing; 
   A provision providing supervised visitation of children for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse to reduce the opportunity for additional domestic violence during visitations; 
   A provision strengthening and refining protections for battered immigrant women; and 
   An expansion of several of the primary grant programs to cover violence that arises in dating relationships. 
   I was disappointed that the conference did not agree to extend the recently expired Violent Crime Reduction Fund. The money for the trust fund comes from savings generated by reducing the Federal workforce by more than 300,000 employees, and it was the primary source of money for VAWA programs. This will mean that VAWA will likely be funded directly by tax revenues. 
   However, I am pleased that the conference agreed to restore language that 
   would allow grant money to be used to deal with dating violence. Without this language, women could not benefit from VAWA unless they cohabited with their abusers. That makes no sense. In fact, the Department of Justice study on intimate partner violence found that women between the ages of 16 and 24--prime dating ages--are the most likely to experience violence within their relationships. 
   VAWA has been particularly important to my own state of California. VAWA funds have trained hundreds of California police officers, prosecutors, and judges. They have provided California law enforcement with better evidence gathering and information sharing equipment. 
   VAWA funds have also hired victims' advocates and counselors in scores of California cities. They have provided an array of services to California women and children--from 24-hour hotlines to emergency transportation to medical services. 
   I have heard numerous stories from women in California who have benefitted from VAWA. For instance, one woman wrote to me to how she fled from an abusive relationship but was able to get food, clothing, and shelter for her and her four children from a VAWA-supported center. If it was not for VAWA, she wrote, ``I would have lost my four children because I didn't have anywhere to go. I was homeless with my children.'' 
   And the head of the Valley Trauma Center in Southern California wrote me about another tragic case. Four men kidnaped a woman as she walked to her car and raped her repeatedly for many hours. Incredibly, because the men accused the victim of having sex with them voluntarily and one of the men was underage, the woman herself was charged with having sex with a minor. As a result, the woman lost her job. Fortunately, the center, using VAWA funds, was able to intervene. They helped get the charges against the victim dismissed and assisted the woman through her trauma. 
   There is no question that VAWA has made a real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of women and children in California. Let me give you some more examples: 
   Through VAWA funding, California has 23 sexual assault response teams, 13 violence response teams, and scores of domestic violence advocates in law enforcement agencies throughout the state. These teams have responded to hundreds of incidents of domestic violence, saving lives and helping protect California women and children from abuse. 
   Since 1997, eight counties in California have developed stalking and threat assessment teams, STATs. Since VAWA was enacted, there has been a 200-percent increase in the number of felony stalking cases filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney. 
   Within 2 weeks of launching an antistalking educational campaign using VAWA money, the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, LACAAW, received about 40 calls to its crisis hotline. These calls resulted in numerous investigations by the local STAT. 
   Since LACAAW receive VAWA money in 1997, it has seen a 64 percent increase in the number of victims served. Moreover, its rape prevention education program services have doubled in this period. 
   In the last 5 years, Women Escaping a Violent Environment, WEAVE, a victim service provider in Sacramento, has doubled its legal advocacy efforts and crisis and referral services. It responds to over 20,000 domestic violence and sexual assault calls to its crisis line annually and 35 requests for legal services daily. 
   In Alameda County, the district attorney's office has used VAWA funds to institute comprehensive training regarding the investigation and prosecution of domestic violence and stalking cases. Two hundred sixty prosecutors in Alameda and Contra Costa county and 350 police officers in Alameda country have been trained. The result: 30 new stalking cases and numerous new domestic violence cases being investigated and prosecuted just in 3 months. 
   Lideres Campasinas has used VAWA money to establish itself in 12 communities in California and has trained 25,000 immigrant and migrant women. Before it received this money, Lideres Campasinas did not address the problem of domestic violence among farmworker women. Now, three tribal organizations and 4 States have contacted it about setting up similar programs in their jurisdictions. 
   The California Coalition Against Sexual Assault's Rape Prevention Resource Center has, using VAWA money, assembled over 4,000 items focused exclusively on issues related to violence against women in the U.S. Over 4,000 items are currently available in its lending library. 
   In short, VAWA 2000 renews our commitment to fighting violence against women and children. I am delighted to support its passage today. 
   Let me also say a few words about the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which is also in the conference report. 
   I strongly support this bill, which will help American victims of terrorism abroad collect court-awarded compensation and ensures that the responsible State sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes. 
   Just let me talk about one example of why this new law is necessary. 
   In 1985, David Jacobsen was residing in Beirut, Lebanon, and was the chief executive officer of the American University of Beirut Medical Center. His life would soon take a dramatic and irreversible change for the worse, and he would never again be the same. 
   Shortly before 8:00 a.m. on May 28, 1985, Jacobsen was crossing an intersection with a companion when he was assaulted, subdued and forced into a van by several terrorist assailants. He was pistol-whipped, bound and gagged, and pushed into a hidden compartment under the floor in the back of the van.  
   Jacobsen was held by these men, members of the Iranian-backed Hizballah, for 532 days--nearly a year and a half. He was held in darkness and blindfolded during most of that time, chained by his ankles and wrists and wearing nothing but undershorts and a t-shirt. He has said in the past that he was allowed to see sunlight just twice in those 17 months. 
   The food during his captivity was meager--sometimes the guards would even spit in his food before handing it over. 
   Jacobsen was subjected to regular beatings, and often threatened with immediate death. He was forced to listen as fellow captives were killed. 
   As a result of this physical and mental torture, Jacobsen has been under continuous treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder since his release in November of 1986--nearly 13 years ago. 
   In August of 1998, David Jacobsen was awarded $9 million by a U.S. Federal Court. The judgement was against the Government of Iran, and pursuant to a bill that Congress signed in 1996 allowing victims of foreign terrorism to recover against terrorist nations. 
   But David Jacobsen has collected nothing. He cannot go to Iran to ask for the verdict. And our own Government has essentially turned its back. Some have estimated the United States Government has frozen more than a billion dollars of Iranian assets. Yet not one cent has been paid to David Jacobsen. The administration has invoked waiver after waiver--even as Congress has modified the 1996 bill to clarify our intent. 
   The same has been true for others victimized by agents of designated terrorist-sponsoring nations, including Alisa Flatow, Terry Anderson, Joseph Ciccippio, Frank Reed, Matthew Eisenfeld, Sarah Duker, Armando Alejandre, Carlos A. Costa, and Mario de la Pena. 
   The legislation included in this conference report replaces the waiver authority in current law to make it both more clear, and more narrow. It is my hope that once Congress has again spoken on this issue, money frozen from terrorist nations will finally begin to flow to the victims of those terrorist acts. 
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act also contains an amendment authored by Senator LEAHY and myself that will offer more immediate and effective assistance to victims of terrorism abroad, such as those Americans killed or injured in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and in the Pam Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. This amendment does not involve any new funding; all the money for victims would come out of the existing emergency reserve fund for the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime, OVC. 
   The Leahy-Feinstein amendment aims to provide faster and better assistance to victims of terrorism abroad. Under current Federal law, if there is a terrorist attack against Americans abroad, the victims and their families must generally go to the victims' services agencies in their home States to receive assistance and compensation. However, victims' services vary widely from State to State, and some overseas victims receive no relief at all because they cannot establish residency in a particular State. 
   Let me give you a couple of real-life examples created by current law: 
   Two American victims, standing literally yards apart, were injured in the bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Each received severe injuries, was permanently disabled, and spent 7 months recovering at the same hospital. However, because the two were residents of different States, they received very different victims' assistance: one received $15,000 in compensation and one $100,000. And one waited a week for a decision on the money and the other 5 months. 
   Another American was also severely injured in the embassy bombings. Because he was not able to establish residency in a particular State, he could not receive any victims' assistance or compensation at all. In fact, because he lacked health insurance, he had to pay his medical bills himself. 
   The Office for Victims of Crime has been able to get around the problem in certain cases by transferring money to the FBI or U.S. attorney's offices, which then transfer the money to victims. However, this cannot be done in some situations. Moreover, even where such transfers can be done, OVC and the 
   victims have run into a lot of redtape and delays. An example: 
   Because of current law, OVC was not able to respond directly to the needs of victims of the embassy bombings. So they transferred money to the Executive Office of the U.S. attorneys, which then transferred the money to the State Department, which then transferred the money to the victims. This triple transfer took 8 months. In the meantime, the victims and their families had to pay medical bills, transportation costs, funeral expenses, and other expenses themselves. 
   The Leahy-Feinstein amendment will immediately benefit terrorist victims. For example, the amendment ensures that the OVC can assist victims directly with regard to the upcoming trial in New York City of the individuals who allegedly bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
   The Leahy-Feinstein amendment fixes the problem in three ways. 
   First, it creates a single, centralized agency to help victims of terrorism abroad. This agency--OVC--has more expertise and resources to help overseas terrorism victims than a typical State victims' services agency. For example, OVC can much more easily get information from U.S. and foreign government agencies to process victims' claims than, say, the Wyoming Victim Services Division. 
   Second, it eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies in Federal and State victims' services statutes that result in disparate treatment of similarly situated victims of terrorism. The amendment provides OVC with much more flexibility to assist victims of terrorism directly, avoiding unfair results. 
   Third, it cuts redtape that has unnecessarily delayed services to victims of terrorism. 
   Specifically, the Leahy-Feinstein amendment: 
   Authorizes OVC to establish a terrorism compensation fund and to make direct payments to American citizens and noncitizen U.S. Government employees for emergency expenses related to terrorist victimization. The money would be used to pay emergency travel expenses, medical bills, and the cost of transporting bodies. 
   Allows OVC to pay for direct services to victims, regardless of where a terrorist attack occurs. This includes counseling services, a victims' website, and closed-circuit TV so victims and their families can monitor trial proceedings. 
   Raises the cap on OVC's emergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million. This would enable OVC to access additional funds in the event of a terrorist attack involving massive casualties. 
   Makes it easier for OVC to replenish its emergency reserve fund with money that it de-obligates from its other grant programs. 
   Expands the range of organizations that OVC may fund to include the Department of State, Red Cross, and others. 
   I would like to thank Senator LEAHY for his leadership on this issue. While he and I have sometimes disagreed on how to address the lack of victims' rights in this Nation, I am glad that we were able to work together to pass this important amendment. 
   Finally, I would like to discuss one last provision of this conference report. Specifically, I want to address the so-called Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, S. 577, now included as part of this conference report. I want it to be perfectly clear that this provision is simply a jurisdictional statute with a very narrow and specific purpose. The bill is not intended to allow the enforcement of invalid or unconstitutional State liquor laws in the Federal courts, and is certainly not intended to allow States to unfairly discriminate against out-of-State sellers for the purposes of economic protectionism. 
   The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act would add a new section (section 2) to the Webb-Kenyon Act, granting Federal court jurisdiction to injunctive relief actions brought by State attorneys general seeking to enforce State laws dealing with the importation or transportation of alcoholic beverages. It is important to emphasize that Congress is not passing on the advisability or legal validity of the  many State laws dealing with alcoholic beverages. Whether a particular State law on this subject is a valid exercise of State power is, and will continue to be, a matter for the courts to decide. 
   As you know, the powers granted to the States under section 2 of the 21st amendment are not absolute. As the Supreme Court has made clear since 1964, State power under the 21st amendment cannot be read in isolation from other provisions in the Constitution. In Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corporation, 377 U.S. 324 (1964), the Court began to use a ``balancing test'' or ``accommodation test'' to determine whether a state liquor law was enacted to implement a ``core power'' of the 21st amendment or was essentially an effort to unfairly regulate or burden interstate commerce with an inadequate connection to the temperance goals of the second section of the 21st amendment. 
   The Court said in Hostetter that ``[B]oth the 21st amendment and the commerce clause are parts of the same Constitution. Like other provisions of the Constitution, each must be considered in the light of the other, and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any concrete case.'' The Court in that case also emphasized that to draw the conclusion that the 21st amendment has repealed the commerce clause, would be ``patently bizarre'' and ``demonstrably incorrect.'' 
   Subsequently, in a series of other decisions over the last 35 years, the Supreme Court has held that the 21st amendment does not diminish the force of the supremacy clause, the establishment clause, the export-import clause, the equal protection clause, and, again, the commerce clause; nor does it abridge rights protected by the first amendment. 
   In case after case (Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 712 (1984) (supremacy clause); Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116, 122 (1982) (establishment clause); Department of Revenue v. James Beam Co., 377 U.S. 341 (1964) (export-import clause); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 209 (1976) (equal protection); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 275 (1984) (commerce clause); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 516 (1996) (first amendment)), the Court has made it clear that the powers granted to the States under the 21st amendment must be read in conjunction with other provisions in the Constitution. 
   In Bacchus Imports, the Court stated that the 21st amendment was not designed ``to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.'' Nor are State laws that constitute ``mere economic protectionism ..... entitled to the same deference as laws enacted to combat the perceived evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor.'' The Bacchus decision stands for the legal principle that the 21st amendment cannot be used by the States to justify liquor laws which, by favoring instate businesses, discriminate against out-of-state sellers or otherwise burden interstate commerce. Economic discrimination is not a core purpose of the 21st amendment. 
   Earlier this year, when the Senate Judiciary Committee considered S. 577, I offered an amendment to the ``Rules of Construction'' section of Senator HATCH's substitute to S. 577. The amendment was intended to clarify that Congress recognizes the important line of cases I have described today and does not intend to tip or alter the critical balance between the 21st amendment and other provisions in the Constitution, such as the commerce clause. I also thought it was important that we make it clear that, in passing this jurisdictional statute, we are neither endorsing any existing State liquor laws nor prejudging the validity of any State liquor laws. In making a decision as to whether to issue an injunction, the Federal judge will look at the underlying State statute and determine whether or not it has been violated and whether it is a constitutionally permissible exercise of State authority. 
   The committee adopted my amendment by a unanimous voice vote and the language of subsection 2(e) now reflects the committee's intent. It states that this legislation is to be construed only to extend the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in connection with a State law that is a valid exercise of State power: (1) under the 21st amendment of the U.S. Constitution as such an amendment is interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States, including interpretations in conjunction with other provisions of the U.S. Constitution; and (2) under the first section of the Webb-Kenyon Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States. Further, S. 577 is not to be construed as granting the States any additional power. 
   The legislative history of both the Webb-Kenyon Act and the second section of the 21st amendment reflect the fact that Congress intended to protect the right of the individual States to enact laws to encourage temperance within their borders. So both before the establishment of nationwide prohibition and after its repeal, the States have been free to enact statewide prohibition laws, and to enact laws allowing the local governments (i.e. counties, cities, townships, etcetera) within their borders to exercise ``local option'' restrictions on the availability of alcoholic beverages. Further, the States are also free to enact laws limiting the access of minors to alcoholic beverages under their police powers. 
   The language in subsection 2(e) reinforces the Supreme Court decisions holding that the 21st amendment is not to be read in isolation from other provisions contained in the U.S. Constitution. These cases have recognized that State power under section 2 of the 21st amendment is not unlimited and must be balanced with the other constitutional rights protected by commerce clause, the supremacy clause, the export-import clause, the equal protection clause, the establishment clause and the first amendment. 
   The substitute to S. 577 offered in the Judiciary Committee by Senator HATCH also made a number of other positive changes in this legislation. 
   Federal court jurisdiction is granted only for injunctive relief actions by State attorneys general against alleged violators of State liquor laws. However, actions in Federal court are not permitted against persons licensed by that State, nor are they permitted against persons authorized to produce, sell, or store 
   intoxicating liquor in that State. 
   The Hatch substitute also made other changes ensuring that the bill tracks the due process requirements of rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning suits for injunctive relief in Federal court. Under subsection 2(b), a State attorney general must have ``reasonable cause'' to believe that a violation of that State's law regulating the importation or transportation of intoxicating liquor has taken place. Further, under subsection 2(d)(1) the burden of proof is on the State to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of State law has occurred. Similarly, subsection 2(d)(2) makes it clear that no preliminary injunction may be granted except upon evidence: (A) demonstrating the probability of irreparable injury; and (B) supporting the probability of success on the merits. Also, under subsection 2(d)(3) no preliminary or permanent injunction may be issued without notice to the adverse party and an opportunity for a hearing on the merits. While the legislation makes it clear that an action for injunctive relief under this act is to be tried before the Court without a jury, at the same time a defendant's rights to a jury trial in any separate or subsequent State criminal proceeding are intended to be preserved. 
   The amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee bring both balance and fairness to this legislation. As amended, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act will assist in the enforcement of legitimate State liquor laws that are genuinely about encouraging temperance or prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. At the same time, the amended bill reflects a recognition on the part of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate, and the Congress that S. 577 is solely a jurisdictional statute and is not intended to allow the enforcement of invalid or unconstitutional State liquor laws in the Federal courts.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am pleased have worked with Senators LAUTENBERG, MACK, and KYL in getting this legislation to this point. The national security interest waiver should be used only when there is a specific national security interest greater than the interest in taking effective action to combat terrorism against American citizens; and it should be exercised on a case-by-case basis. The judiciary Committee never intended to divide victims, helping some and not others. We must ensure that all American victims of terrorism able to successfully hold foreign states responsible to the satisfaction of U.S. courts are treated fairly and aided by this and future administrations to collect their damages.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 2045, ``American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000,'' I am pleased to see this important legislation pass the Senate today. 
   One of my most sobering experiences as a U.S. Senator occurred a few years ago when several CEOs of California's leading high-tech companies told me our schools were not producing enough skilled graduates and asked me to support an increase in the number of H-1B temporary visas for skilled foreign workers. 
   Initially, I did not believe this. But subsequently the problem became very clear at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the subject. California's high-tech sector has fueled our record economic expansion, providing more than 784,000 high-tech jobs in our state alone. But that continued growth is threatened if California cannot produce an adequate number of well-educated workers. Clearly our education system needs major reform. 
   I asked TechNet, a network of the nation's leading high-tech CEOs, to help me develop a program to reduce our reliance on H-1B workers. The discussions led to a public-private plan, which Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM, R-Mich., and I offered as an amendment to the H-1B visa bill. It was approved by the Judiciary Committee in March. 
   From the funds collected for H-1B fees over the next three years, the amendment would allocate 15 percent of the H-1B fees, or roughly $23 million for National Science Foundation kindergarten through 12th grade math and science education and skills-development programs. The technology industry will match these funds and then some. This is an incredible commitment by the industry to help develop a pipeline of American students who are better prepared for the workplace of tomorrow. 
   Additionally, $35 million will be designated for post-secondary school scholarships for 16,000 to 18,000 low-income students to obtain degrees in  science, math or other technology-related disciplines so that they can compete for the cutting-edge jobs in the high-tech sector. At the same time, our amendment provides 23.5 percent, or more than $35 million per year in funding--in addition to that already being provided--for scholarships so that American students and workers can also enjoy the opportunity to work in the high tech and other industries demanding a highly skilled workforce. 
   Another $83 million, or 55 percent of the H-1B fee revenue, as a result of an amendment by Senator Kennedy, would be allocated to workforce training programs and demonstration projects to provide technical skills training for U.S. workers. I am hopeful that, in the end, we can work in a provision to increase the H-1B visa fee from $500 to $1,000. This will double the amount of funding for these important education and training programs. 
   I support lifting the H-1B visa cap, but clearly it is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. The technology industry recognizes this and has already made significant financial contributions to education training programs. These amendments represent an additional industry commitment to educating America's workforce. 
   Recent research indicates that the number of bachelor of science degrees awarded in computer science and math fell 29 percent from 1985 to 1995. Engineering degrees fell 16 percent from 1985 to 1997; computer and information sciences experience a 42 percent drop. Yet it is expertise in these very areas that businesses, especially high-technology companies, need in order to stay globally competitive. 
   Our society is undergoing a dramatic technological transformation. Information technology has changed every aspect of our society, from telephone and banking services to commerce and education. Given this, the demand for highly skilled professionals has exploded. Even excluding the biotechnology industry, the high-tech explosion has created over 4.8 million jobs in the United States since 1993 and produced an industry unemployment rate of 1.4 percent. 
   Despite the billions of dollars that companies spend annually on training, a gap still exists between professionals available in the U.S. workforce and the needs of employers. We need to raise the H-1B cap for the next few years because often employers' needs are immediate; they cannot afford to wait for workforce training or retraining while positions remain unfilled. I look forward to the day when it is not necessary to bring in workers from abroad for these positions because California's schools are producing students who can match the best and brightest from anywhere across the globe. 
   I am also pleased that the Senate has adopted as an amendment to the H-1B legislation, the provisions of S. 2586, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000,'' which I introduced earlier this year. As we seek to address the needs of the high tech industry by increasing the number of H-1B visas, I am pleased that we are also taking an active role in addressing the unacceptably long backlogs in processing other immigration applications. 
   We have all heard the horror stories of the long processing delays associated with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). What was once a 6-month process has now become a three- to four-year ordeal. When I first introduced S. 2586, the INS had roughly 2.3 million cases pending. Out of this number, California had 600,000 naturalization and adjustment of status cases pending. 
   While the INS has made some improvements in reducing processing times for some applications, the INS's overall record keeping and computer systems still suffer from serious flaws. Many forms filed during the application process have been lost, automatically disqualifying immigrants from an immigrant visa or naturalization because they missed their INS appointments. 
   It is unacceptable that millions of people who have followed our nation's laws, made outstanding contributions to our nation, and paid the requisite fees have had to wait months, and even years, to obtain the immigration services they need. These processing delays have had a negative impact on businesses seeking to employ or retain essential workers. 
   Faced with a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., many of our nation's businesses, including those in the high tech industry, must increasing rely on the INS to help provide them with access to highly skilled foreign professionals. However, long delays and inconsistencies in INS processing are causing many companies to postpone or cancel major projects that support their fiscal growth. 
   I believe the backlog reduction provisions included in this bill will send a clear signal to the INS that it is time to change the way they do business. The provisions would require the INS to process H-1B applications and other non-immigrant visa applications within 30 days, and naturalization applications, permanent employment visas, and other immigration visa applications within six months. In addition, the provisions would establish a separate account with the INS to fund backlog reduction efforts. 
   This account would permit the INS to fund across several fiscal years infrastructure improvements, including additional staff, computer records management, fingerprinting, and nationwide computer integration. Finally, the provisions would require the INS to put together a plan on how it intends to eliminate existing backlogs and report on this plan before it could obtain any appropriated funds. 
   The backlog reduction provisions are intended to provide the INS with direction and accountability, and would enable millions of law-abiding residents, immigrants, and businesses, who have paid substantial fees to the INS, to have their applications processed in a timely manner. I believe enactment of these provisions as part of the H-1B legislation will send a strong Congressional directive to the INS that timely and efficient service is not merely a goal, but a mandate. 
   Our nation has undergone a dramatic technological transformation. The U.S. economy has enjoyed unprecedented expansion, in large part because of the high tech industry. In California alone, this growth in technology has made our State number one in high tech employment by creating almost 800,000 jobs and comprising 61 percent of California's exports. I am convinced that the economy of California as well as the rest of the nation could run out of steam if the driving engine--that is, the high tech industry--does not have the resources it needs to continue its unprecedented growth. 
   Certainly, it is in our interest to ensure that these industries, which are located in the U.S. and help drive our economy, can continue to obtain qualified, highly skilled employees. This bill meets the needs of the industry by providing additional temporary visas for exceptional professional personnel. Despite the billions of dollars that companies spend annually to train their work force, a gap still exists between professionals available in the U.S. work force and the needs of employers. Often employers' needs are immediate; they cannot afford to wait for work force training or retraining while positions remain unfilled. 
   I look forward to the day when it is not necessary to bring in workers from abroad for these positions because California's schools are producing students who can match the best and brightest from anywhere across the globe.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to change the way unaccompanied immigrant children are treated while in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that the federal government addresses the special needs of thousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter the U.S. It would ensure that these children have a fair opportunity to obtain humanitarian relief when eligible. 
   Central throughout this legislation are two concepts:

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge the comments made by the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch and indicate my agreement with them. I also thank the staff people he has duly mentioned, and I want to speak particularly to the funding of the legislative branch. 
   It is my understanding on our side of the aisle that there is deep concern about the addition of the Treasury-Postal bill on this bill, largely because it contains a measure which would use 25 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. I will leave that to others to discuss. 
   Senator BENNETT and I worked in a bipartisan way on the fiscal year 2001 legislative branch appropriations bill. I believe it is a very good bill. It addresses the critical areas of concern for the legislative branch and is in the best interests of those whom we serve. We worked very hard to ensure that each agency within our legislative branch was treated fairly, and even though we were not able to fully fund every agency's request, we made every effort to distribute the scarce resources as fairly as possible. In some cases, we were able to make modest increases above last year's level. 
   I particularly note that the $97.1 million which we are providing for the Capitol Police will fund 1,481 full-time equivalents, a level which conferees believe will enable the appropriate staffing at building entrances to ensure the security of our Capitol campus. 
   Additionally, in order to address some very critical needs, the conference agreement provides to the Capitol Police $2.1 million in fiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental funds for security enhancements, and provides the Architect of the Capitol $9 million in fiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental funds to 
   move forward with a number of urgent building repairs. 
   This is my second year as ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, working alongside our dedicated and distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator BENNETT. Senator BENNETT is always very open and willing to discuss the various issues that arise in relation to this bill. He has been very accommodating to my concerns as well as to the concerns of other Members of the Senate. I know that firsthand. In fact, he never ceases to amaze me with his extensive knowledge of the various departments and agencies under the legislative branch--not only their basic structure and the function of those agencies but their legislative histories as well. It has been a great pleasure for me to work with Senator BENNETT on this bill. 
   I urge the adoption of the conference agreement. 
   I yield some time, with the approval of Senator BENNETT, to Senator HARKIN.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL, to introduce legislation to better protect American consumers from irresponsible companies who knowingly allow defective vehicles or vehicle parts to remain on the market. 
   Our bill, the ``Defective Product Penalty Act,'' would significantly increase the responsibility of companies to test products for defects, to recall those products when necessary, and to report to authorities when defects are found. 
   Recent news stories about Firestone tires have grabbed the headlines, but this bill really addresses some long-standing and serious deficiencies within our current laws. The Firestone case has highlighted the need for these overdue proposals, and it is our hope that this legislation receives swift and serious consideration. The time has come to close some loopholes and impose some real responsibility on company executives who ignore public safety. 
   Let me describe specifically what this bill does: 
   First, this legislation will increase civil penalties for failure to recall a defective vehicle or part or withholding information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Current penalties are $1,000 per violation with a maximum penalty in these cases of $925,000. The Defective Product Penalty Act would increase the penalty to $10,000 per violation, and would eliminate the maximum penalty altogether. A penalty of $925,000 for a multi-billion dollar, multinational business is not even enough to cause the company to think twice about releasing or recalling a defective vehicle. We need to give the NHTSA some real teeth. 
   Second, this legislation will establish criminal penalties for knowingly distributing a defective vehicle or part, or for failing to recall or tell authorities about a defective product, if that defect results in death or injuries. If death results, the legislation calls for a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. If serious injury results, the legislation calls for penalties of up to 5 years. 
   Third, this legislation would extend the statute of limitations for NHTSA to mandate recalls, from 8 to 10 
   years for vehicles, and from 3 to 5 years for tires. 
   Fourth, the bill would require companies to actually test vehicle products before self-certifying that the product is in compliance with NHTSA standards. 
   Next, the legislation clarifies federal law to make it clear that in cases involving vehicle products sold in the U.S., a company must send the NHTSA copies of all notices sent to dealers and owners, even if the notices are sent only to owners and dealers in foreign countries. 
   Finally, this legislation includes provisions from Senator KOHL's ``Sunshine in Litigation Act'' (S. 957), to: 
   Prohibit federal courts from issuing protective orders that prohibit individuals from disclosing potential defects or dangers to regulatory agencies; and 
   Prohibit federal courts from enforcing secrecy agreements without first balancing the need for privacy against the public's need to know about potential health and safety hazards. In other words, no longer can a company put other consumers at risk by forcing a plaintiff to keep quiet about a potential threat to public safety. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will send a clear signal to irresponsible companies and individuals who intentionally put the public at risk from defective products--you will now be held responsible for your actions. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Thompson amendment, and then I hope I can make a few comments on what I believe to be one of the most important pieces of legislation on which this Congress will be voting. Let me begin by saying this. If I believed this amendment would keep our country safe, I would vote for it. I do not believe that is the case. Rather, I believe the amendment is deeply flawed and it has major procedural and review problems. I want to point those out. 
   Let me say, first of all, to most of us, the draft of this amendment was available Monday night, a little more than a day ago. Yet it is a major, long-range piece of legislation that has major implications for national security, for peace, and stability in the Asia Pacific region. To pass it without careful analysis, without full hearings, and without careful judgment is something to which I am not willing to be a party. There have been no hearings on this or any draft of this legislation. The National Security Council and the State Department have not had the opportunity to provide a full analysis of this latest version of the amendment or assess its likely short- and long-term impact. 
   I am one of those who believes it would, in fact, doom giving China permanent normal trading status. I am simply not willing to do that. Most importantly, from what I have been able to perceive, I believe the legislation has serious flaws. 
   First, it focuses on three countries. It separates them from all the other countries. It applies a standard to them that exists for no one else. And I do not believe that is in the best interests of sound decisionmaking. 
   Second, the mandatory sanctions put in place by this amendment have hair triggers which are tripped by minimal evidence--indeed not necessarily even evidence. The raw intelligence data that provides the ``credible information'' trigger of this amendment requires followup, substantiation, and analysis before it is used to initiate action. It should be the starting point for processes that weigh options and consider appropriate action, not an end point that instantly triggers strong responses. 
   Let me give you one example: In 1993, the Yin He incident, where based on ``credible information'' the United States publicly accused China of shipping proscribed chemical precursors to Iran. The Chinese freighter in question was diverted and every single container searched, at great cost and inconvenience to all involved. There were no banned chemicals aboard. The Thompson amendment would have mandated sanctions. 
   Second, there is no way to target the sanctions which would be triggered by this amendment, and no effective Presidential waiver for national security interests. It is a blunt instrument more likely to hurt American interests than to change China's behavior. 
   Third, the amendment invites diplomatic and, yes, maybe even legal problems with other countries, including allies. The amendment as drafted could create a situation whereby sanctions would be placed on corporations of allied countries that are not acting illegally. 
   Fourth, especially chilling is the way in which the amendment's wording could, in effect, blacklist any company tagged as a proliferating agent under this amendment's low standard of proof. 
   These are just a few of the examples of some of the problems with this amendment. Several of my colleagues have discussed other shortcomings at greater length. 
   Automatic sanctions set off by low thresholds of evidence offer little to entice allies to join us in implementing an effective sanctions regime, but they most certainly will damage U.S.-China relations. They most certainly will weaken our ability to engage the Chinese in any kind of worthwhile dialog or influence them to change their behavior. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this amendment. 
   Let me, if I might, say a few things about the bilateral agreement that really is the issue before us today. I reviewed it carefully, and I believe that in this agreement China has made significant market-opening concessions to the United States across virtually every economic sector. 
   For example, on agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an average of 31 percent to 14 percent by January of 2004. Industrial tariffs will fall from an average of 24.6 percent in 1997 to 9.4 percent by 2005. 
   China agrees to open up distribution services, such as repair and maintenance, warehousing, trucking, and air courier services. 
   Import tariffs on autos, now ranging between 80 percent and 100 percent, are broken down to 25 percent by 2006 with tariff reductions accelerated. 
   China will participate in the Information Technology Agreement and will eliminate tariffs on products such as computers, semiconductors, and related products by 2005. 
   It will open its telecommunications sector, including access to China's growing Internet services, and expand investment and other activities for financial services firms. 
   The agreement also preserves safeguards against dumping and 
   other unfair trade practices. Specifically, the ``special safeguard rule''--to prevent import surges into the United States--will remain in force for 12 years, and the ``special anti-dumping methodology'' will remain in effect for 15 years. 
   No matter how you look at it, this benefits the United States. 
   I think many people have confused this PNTR vote with a vote to approve China joining the World Trade Organization. It needs to be understood that China will likely join the WTO within the next year regardless of our action. The issue will, in fact, be decided by the WTO's working group and a two-thirds vote of the WTO membership as a whole.  
   Under WTO rules, only the countries that have ``nondiscriminatory'' trade practices--that is PNTR--are entitled to receive the benefit of WTO agreements. Without granting China permanent normal trading status, the United States effectively cuts itself out of China's vast markets, while Britain, Japan, France, and all other WTO nations are allowed to trade with few barriers. 
   In my view, this has been an interesting exercise because it has been highly politicized. The bottom line is if we don't grant China PNTR based on the November bilateral agreement, an agreement in which the United States received many important trade concessions and gave up nothing, we effectively shoot ourselves in the foot. We take ourselves out of the agreement, China still goes into the WTO, and those other strategic trading blocks such as the European Union receive the benefits of the bilateral agreement. We do not. 
   I think it is much broader than this. But I think there is an ultimate issue at stake. That is this: The People's Republic of China is today undergoing its most significant period of economic and social activity since its founding 50 years ago. The pace is fast and the changes are large. 
   I am one who studies Chinese history. I have been watching China for over 30 years. I made my first trip in 1979. I try to visit China every year, if I can, and I have watched and I have seen. 
   In a relatively short time, China has become a key Pacific rim player, and a major world trader. It is a huge producer and consumer of goods and services--a magnet for investment and commerce. Because of its size and potential, the choices China makes over the next few years will greatly influence the future of peace and prosperity in Asia. 
   In a very real sense, the shaping of Asia's future begins with choices America will make in how to deal with China. 
   I come from a Pacific rim State; 60 percent of the people of the world live on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. The trade on that ocean long ago over took the trade on the Atlantic Ocean. It is, in fact, the ocean of the future. 
   We can try to engage China and integrate it into the global community. We can be a catalyst for positive change. Few objective observers would argue that despite the problems that still remain, there have not been significant benefits and advances in China that have come from two decades of interaction with the United States and the West. Or, we can deal antagonistically with China. We can lose our leverage in guiding China along positive paths of economic, political, and social development, and sacrifice business advantage to competitor nations while gaining nothing in return. 
   As I see it, for the foreseeable future America faces no greater challenge than the question of how to persuade China that it is in China's own national interests to move away from authoritarian government and toward a more open, a more pluralistic and freer society. How do we convince China to make the political, economic and social changes that will help China evolve the leadership that will make it guarantor of peace and stability in the Pacific rim, throughout Asia and the world? 
   I am convinced that Congress will debate few issues more important this year than the question of China's entry into the World Trade Organization and whether or not we will deal with the Chinese on the basis of a permanent normal trade relationship. 
   Trade means change in China. Economic engagement with the United States has been one of the prime motivating factors in China's decision to move toward a market economy and away from its self-isolation of decades. The past 20 years have brought massive social reform and economic advancement for China's people. I remember the first time I traveled to China in 1979. I saw a land of subdued people, grey Mao suits, few consumer goods, no conveniences, poor living conditions and little personal, economic or political freedom. The economy was all centrally controlled; little private property and private business existed. 
   Today, the goods, services, housing, and freedoms available to residents of Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are greatly improved. People have become interested in what happens outside of China. People will speak more freely. Living standards are higher. China is increasing turning to private ownership--as much as 50 percent of the economy is in private hands in boom areas like the Pearl River Delta in Southern China. 
   Large, inefficient state enterprises are closing or being converted to private ownership. Entrepreneurship is on the rise in the cities in much of the countryside. Cutting our bilateral economic ties will accomplish nothing except to turn back the clock in China to favor more government controls, seek to isolate this growing economy, and very likely strengthen repressive political interests linked to protectionism and economic nationalism within the PRC. 
   It is evident to me that flourishing business relationships have developed increased contacts, improved mutual understandings, and personal relationships between Americans and Chinese. 
   This, in turn, has fostered many positive changes, as different ways of thinking percolate through Chinese society at many levels. It is there; I have seen it. American firms have brought new management styles, innovative ideas, and new work styles to China. Through their presence in China's economy, Americans have spread their corporate philosophies, teaching Chinese entrepreneurs, managers, and workers about market economics, commitment to free flows of information, the rule of law--the most important thing--dedication to environmental responsibility, and worker rights and safety. 
   Yes, it is far from perfect. But are things changing? The answer by any objective criteria has to be yes. Are there flaws? Are there problems? Does China very often do stupid things? Yes: The crackdown on Falun Gong, in my view a stupid thing, an unnecessary thing, something that, once again, pushes it backwards rather than forwards. Its treatment of Tibet--has China done the wrong thing? Absolutely. For 10 years I have been saying that and will continue to say it. It makes no sense for a great nation to treat a major minority the way in which the Tibetan people are treated. I will say that over and over again. I will work to change it. And one day we will succeed and do that, too. But we cannot do it if we isolate China. We cannot do it if we play into the hands of the hardliners. We cannot do it if we create the kind of adversarial relationship that is determined to make China into the next Soviet Union. I believe that firmly, and 30 years of watching has confirmed it. 
   American firms exercise a very real influence over the changes occurring in Chinese society. That influence will not survive the elimination of PNTR. American businesses in China bring American values to China. But, they cannot bring them if their ability to operate is undercut. History clearly shows us a nation's respect for political pluralism, human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection grows alongside that nation's positive interaction with others and achieving a level of sustainable economic development and social well-being. 
   People who have a full stomach then begin to say: What is next? People who have an education then begin to question the leadership. That will happen in China just as it did in Taiwan, just as it did in South Korea. Not too long ago, both were governed by dictatorships. Given a chance, China can change as well. 
   If we are serious about building a peaceful, prosperous and stable Asia, if we are serious about being a force for good in the Pacific rim in the 21st century, if we are serious about working to bring about democratic reforms, human rights reforms, and labor reforms in China, we also must establish permanent normal trade relations with China. This is part of the equation for making China into a member of the WTO and the world community as a whole, and saying that China must, in return, play by the same rules all other members follow. It also exposes China to sanctions in the WTO should they not. As a WTO member, China commits to eliminate barriers to its markets; to accept WTO rulings concerning trade practices and procedures; and to abide by WTO decisions concerning trade disputes.  
   The November 15, 1999 U.S.-China WTO Agreement marked successful completion of 13 years of difficult U.S.-China negotiations. 
   I, for one, am convinced that normalizing our trade relationship with China is absolutely in our own best interest. 
   But it is absolutely in the best interests of seeing China becoming a pluralistic society, of developing the concern for human rights that we in the Western World hold so dear, of understanding the freedoms provided to us because of our due process of law, of understanding how important it is that a judiciary be independent from the politics of government, having a modern commercial code and a modern criminal code. None of these things China has today. 
   As has often been said, it has to be remembered that China, for 5,000 years, has been ruled by despotic emperors and for 50 years by revolutionary leaders who had no education. This is really, in over 5,000 years, the first time this largest nation on Earth has had an educated leadership who is now, today, striving to open the door to the Western World. 
   Remember the Boxer Rebellion? Remember what happened? Remember the humiliation, the isolation of China, and look what happened. We now have a chance in this legislation to take a different course. Most importantly--and this is what has amazed me so much about this debate--PNTR is nothing special. It simply means we will conduct our trade with China in the same manner and under the same rules that we conduct trade with almost every other nation in the world. In fact, there are only six countries with which we do not have normal trade relations--Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Serbia-Montenegro, and Vietnam. All of them are small nations. 
   In my view, the damage of denying China permanent normal trade relations would strike even deeper. Punitive U.S. economic policies aimed at unpalatable Chinese domestic practices will not only cut into American jobs, it will slice at China's newly emerging market-oriented entrepreneurial class, the driving force behind the very changes we seek to cultivate without eliminating the targeted abuses in Chinese society. What kind of sense does that make? 
   Responsible American voices in business, in education, in law, and in religion understand that attacking China through economic ties is counterproductive. It endangers the very social elements within China that are most compatible with ethical American norms. 
   Trade relations do not only benefit business. They are a key part of the foundation that supports the entire U.S.-China relationship. I believe that not only do we shoot ourselves in the foot by denying PNTR, we strike a blow against encouraging China to see that it is to its interest to make the necessary changes, to understand that it, too, by open doors, more ties across the Pacific, more pluralistic government, more freedoms for its people evolves as a stronger nation, not a weaker nation. That was the case with Taiwan. That has been the case with South Korea. I submit to you, Mr. President, it is the case of virtually every country that lives under dictatorship or absolute rule. 
   Pluralism results from an evolution and a growth in human standards, in economic standards, in interaction with the rest of the world. China will be no different if we enable it to open itself to the world. We should be prudent, we should be watchful, we should be strong, we should confront them where wrong--no question about that. I believe we have the adequate tools to do it. 
   I have seen sanctions placed since I have been in this body, and I do not believe the amendment before this body will encourage the kind of behavior that can enable China to eventually be a stable, sound partner anywhere in the Pacific or elsewhere. I feel very strongly about this. I thank the Chair for his forbearance. I yield the floor.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize the truly world-changing efforts of Roger Sant, a distinguished and successful businessman who, in his six years as Chairman of World Wildlife Fund, has brought profound changes to the way conservation is accomplished here in the United States and, indeed, around the world. 
   Having taught corporate finance at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business early in his career, Mr. Sant moved east to lead the Ford Administration's energy conservation efforts as head of the energy conservation program at the Federal Energy Administration. In 1981, he founded AES Corporation, a publicly held global power company characterized by its innovative approaches to energy production. Throughout his career, culminating in his chairmanship of WWF, Mr. Sant has been committed to conservation in all its aspects, inspired by the imperative of leaving a living planet to future generations. 
   As the involved and inspiring chairman of World Wildlife Fund, Mr. Sant has encouraged the organization to think big, working to achieve conservation results at a new ecoregional, landscape scale. He has applied his business acumen as well as a range of skills and approaches honed through his work in government, academia, and the nonprofit world to make a compelling case for conservation to decision makers around the world, from heads of state to government leaders in the United States. Encouraging partnerships, he has supported significant and innovative cooperative arrangements between conservation organizations, governments and private entrepreneurs, and among governments, all with the goal of advancing conservation priorities at a scale that can achieve lasting results. His personal support of conservation initiatives has made a world of difference. 
   As Roger Sant steps down on September 19 after six years as WWF Chairman, he continues his personal commitment to conserving the world's endangered species and spaces. Based on his track record, we all can give thanks for his substantial conservation achievements as well as for all we know he will achieve for conservation in the coming years.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I oppose all amendments offered to H.R. 4444, a bill to establish Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. 
   Much is at stake here; the effects of this vote may be felt for years to come. I am convinced that amendments at this stage create a procedural problem that could derail passage of this important bill. Adopting any amendments would mean sending this bill to conference, where it could become mired in wrangling over differences of language and content. It is clear to me that we do not have time remaining in this Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. We can allow nothing to interfere with what may be this Congress's most important decision concerning China. 
   I am convinced we must not let our focus be drawn away from the real point in question: pure and simple, this vote is about deciding whether or not the United States wishes to join with the world community in having normal trade relations with China, and whether we are prepared to conduct our dealings with China according to the terms and conditions established by that community under the World Trade Organization framework (WTO). 
   This vote is about protecting U.S. interests in an increasingly competitive global marketplace and about ensuring that American workers, managers, entrepreneurs, and investors do not miss out on the opportunities that are bound to grow as China brings itself further into the modern world. 
   I do not think we further U.S. interests by undermining this nation's ability to function effectively in the world's most important multinational trade organization, or by cutting Americans off from the full benefits of WTO membership. 
   This is what will happen if we pass a bill that does not conform to WTO requirements, or if we are forced to send the bill to conference, and fail to pass a bill, at all. I believe it is in America's best interests that this body pass a clean, focused bill establishing permanent normal trade relations with China that is the same as the House bill and does not need conferencing.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose amendment No. 4122, which calls for annual trade reviews with China, offered by the distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina on H.R. 4444, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. 
   This amendment, if passed as part of the China PNTR bill, would be tantamount to unilaterally establishing special conditions on China's membership in the WTO, a violation of World Trade Organization precepts the United States, as a member, commits to follow. 
   In such a case, China would be legitimately entitled to deny American workers, entrepreneurs, investors--in short, our Nation--the benefits of open access to China's markets and the privileges of important WTO-related agreements, such as the International Telecommunications Agreement, conferred by WTO membership. 
   I am also convinced that amendments at this stage create a procedural problem that could derail passage of this extremely important bill. Adopting any amendments at this stage would require sending this bill to conference. It is clear to me that we do not have the time remaining in this Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. I believe it is crucial that we let nothing interfere with what may be the most important decision concerning China for years to come.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON. 
   Essentially, this bill would--for 1 year only--suspend the certification process with respect to Mexico. 
   It is my hope that this one-year hiatus will be viewed as a sign of good faith between our nations, and that our two countries will dramatically increase the level of our cooperation in the coming year. The problem of drugs is as serious as any we face, and only with a true partnership with Mexico and other source countries can we hope to succeed in the battle against illegal narcotics. 
   Mr. President, let me be very clear--my support for this legislation this year should not be taken as a sign that I am any less concerned with the rampant corruption and increasingly serious problem of illegal narcotics flowing from Mexico into the United States. I sincerely hope that President-elect Fox and the government of Mexico will with innovation and commitment launch a new and effective war against the cartels that are currently of unparalleled strength and viciousness. 
   The Zedillo administration has made some progress in cooperating with the United States in this fight. 
   For instance, the Zedillo administration: 
   Allowed, for the first time, the extradition of two Mexican Nationals on  drug charges--although these were lower level participants in the drug trade. This is a beginning, but just that--there is still a long way to go. 
   Fired more than 1400 of 3500 federal police officers for corruption; and so far, more than 350 officers have been prosecuted. 
   Cooperated with the FBI late last year in an investigation on Mexican soil. 
   And greatly increased seizures of illegal narcotics. 
   On the other hand, not nearly enough has been done: 
   Mexico is still the conduit to as much as 70% of the cocaine consumed in the United States (much of it originating in Colombia); 
   Mexico supplies the majority of marijuana to the U.S., and, according to the United States Forest Service, Mexican cartels are now sending people across the border to grow marijuana in our national forests and on other federal lands; 
   Despite recent successes in disrupting methamphetamine production in Mexico, the meth cartels are now increasingly setting up meth labs in the United States; 
   To date, not one major drug kingpin of Mexican nationality has yet been extradited to this country, nor has a major kingpin even been arrested, with the exception of the Amezcua brothers, currently in jail, while the Mexican government decides whether to extradite. Until the cartel leaders are arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned, there can be no real improvement. 
   In the meantime, Mexican drug cartels are becoming ever more vicious. Tijuana, for instance recently saw its second police chief gunned down in less than 6 years, as dozens of judges, prosecutors and drug agents have been killed in Tijuana alone in recent years. 
   Last April, the bodies of two Mexican drug agents and a special prosecutor for the Mexican Attorney General's anti-narcotics unit were found in such a mangled state that identification--even by the spouse of one of the agents--was impossible. According to press accounts, one investigator who saw the photographs of the crime scene said ``They told me it was a body. I've never seen anything like that.'' 
   The Arellano Felix organization is responsible for many of these crimes. They hold such a strong grip over their community that former DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine recently said that ``in Tijuana and Baja, they have become more powerful than the instruments of government in Mexico.'' 
   The Arellano Felix cartel operates with an estimated one million dollars in bribe money every day. With that money they pay law enforcement to look the other way, prosecutors to leave them alone, judges to let them go free, and for information about their enemies. 
   This leads to the largest single threat in this war against drugs--the level of corruption within Mexican law enforcement and even extending into this country. Honest law enforcement officers cannot know who to trust. Anyone who gets too close to capturing cartel members is subject to exposure and assassination. And the cycle of corruption and failure continues. 
   The corruption is evident at all levels of Mexican law enforcement, and this is a problem that can only be solved through a concerted, comprehensive effort on the part of the Fox administration. 
   Until the history of corruption is reversed and the drug cartels are brought to justice, this nation will have no respite from the scourge of drugs flowing across our borders. 
   I cosponsor this legislation today as an experiment to see that, if by putting aside the contentiousness of a certification debate next March, there can be a new, more productive process. I will follow this closely. If reports do not reflect substantial, positive change, we will know clearly that decertification may be the only course. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I very much appreciate those comments. Last Friday night, I took a tumble down stone stairs and managed to have a compound fracture of my tibia and crack a couple of ribs, so I can't say I am none the worse for wear, but I thank the Senator very much for his warm words. I greatly appreciate it. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for some time in morning business for the purposes of introducing a bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator LUGAR in introducing the Unilateral Palestinian Statehood Disapproval Act. This is cosponsored by Senators MOYNIHAN, SPECTER, INHOFE, SANTORUM, GRAMS, COLLINS and MURKOWSKI. 
   We are now 7 days away from September 13. That is the day that the Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has set, in the past, as a day when he would declare, unilaterally, Palestinian statehood. He has recently said that he would reassess his intention to declare an independent Palestinian state unilaterally. I am hopeful that he will. But, nonetheless, I am concerned that neither he nor other senior Palestinian leaders have repudiated the idea of a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   As part of the 1993 Oslo accords, the Israelis and Palestinians committed to resolving all outstanding issues through negotiation. Chairman Arafat reiterated this position on July 25 of this year, at the conclusion of the last round of the Camp David negotiations when he and Prime Minister Barak issued a statement agreeing on the importance of ``avoiding unilaterally action that prejudiced the outcome of negotiations.'' Indeed, one of the keys to the success of the peace process thus far has been the commitment by each side to avoid any unilateral action that would undermine the search for a mutually satisfactory agreement. 
   A unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would violate the commitments of Oslo. A unilateral declaration of statehood would be a grave blow to the peace process, one from which that process might not be able to recover. 
   I believe very strongly, and my cosponsors do as well, that any Palestinian state should be the result of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, not the result of the unilateral action of either one side or the other. 
   It is my sincere hope that in the next few days, Mr. Arafat and others in the Palestinian leadership will step back from the September 13 deadline and recommit themselves to the Oslo process and negotiations with Israel. 
   This legislation is necessary, however, because should Mr. Arafat go forward with the unilateral declaration, the repercussions for the peace process and stability in the Middle East are, indeed, both serious and severe. The United States must make it clear that  we will not recognize or condone a unilateral declaration and that the United States will work to make sure the international community neither accepts nor supports a unilaterally declared Palestinian state. 
   The legislation we introduce today would do the following: 
   It would state that the United States should not recognize any unilaterally declared Palestinian state. 
   It would urge the President and the Secretary of State to use all diplomatic means to work with other countries to deny recognition to such a unilaterally declared state. 
   It would prohibit any direct U.S. assistance to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state, except for humanitarian assistance or cooperation on antiterrorism efforts. 
   It would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose membership in any international financial institution by a unilaterally declared Palestinian state and oppose any financial assistance from these institutions to such a state. 
   It would state the sense of the Congress that the President should downgrade the status of the Palestinian office in the United States to an information office. 
   It would also state the sense of the Congress that the President should oppose Palestinian membership in the United Nations or any other international organization, and that the United States should oppose economic or other assistance to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state, except for humanitarian or security assistance. 
   Finally, it would urge the President to expedite and upgrade the ongoing review of strategic relations between the United States and Israel. 
   We have included a Presidential national interest waiver authority so that if the President deems that even with a unilateral declaration that the peace process can move forward, the United States will have the flexibility to continue that process. 
   I realize that it is a little unusual to say, but it is my sincere hope that this legislation will never require action, let alone implementation. 
   I have been a long-time supporter of the peace process and for a peace agreement that provides security for Israel and leads to the consensual establishment of a Palestinian state that will be a peaceful neighbor of Israel. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked long and hard as an advocate for peace in the Middle East and as a supporter of the negotiations led by President Clinton, Secretaries Christopher and Albright, and conducted so ably by Dennis Ross. 
   Because of this support, it is my sincere hope that Mr. Arafat will not choose to heed those who have suggested that the Palestinian Authority should unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on September 13. If Mr. Arafat is willing to continue to work within the context of the peace process and stick to his 
   commitments at Oslo and Camp David not to take unilateral steps, then I believe the United States should continue our partnership with the Palestinian people in search for peace. Under such circumstances, there is no need for this legislation. 
   I was deeply disappointed that the last round of negotiations at Camp David did not succeed in reaching an agreement. Prime Minister Barak appeared to make every effort to reach out and extend the hand of peace and placed items on the table for negotiation that no Israeli Prime Minister was previously even willing to discuss with the Palestinian leadership. 
   Although there is still a long way to go, I believe that if both sides are sincere in their desire for peace, a negotiated settlement is still possible, and it is my hope that Israel and its Palestinian neighbors will once again find themselves at the negotiating table in the not too distant future. I understand that Mr. Arafat, Prime Minister Barak, and President Clinton will be meeting in New York this week, and I hope the talks can get back on track. But if the Palestinians should choose to endanger the peace process by a unilateral declaration of statehood on September 13, the United States must be clear what our policy should be. 
   The United States has a vital and an important role to play as an honest broker in the region and as a guarantor of the peace process and any peace that may result. It is precisely our role as an honest broker that compels me to offer this legislation. If the Palestinians take unilateral steps that undermine the peace process, the United States must make it clear that we will neither condone nor support such actions. 
   I urge my colleagues to join the Senator from Indiana and me in sending a clear and compelling message in support of the Middle East peace process. Unilateral actions are not acceptable to the United States, and should the Palestinian Authority choose to break with the peace process, the United States will act accordingly. 
   Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator SPECTER may well be coming to the floor to make some comments on this. If he does, I ask unanimous consent that his comments be reflected directly following mine and Senator LUGAR's.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to Senate consideration of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China based on the bilateral trade agreement negotiated between our two nations this past November. Much is at stake in this vote. 
   In the bilateral agreement signed this past November China made significant market-opening concessions to the United States across virtually every economic sector. For example: 
   On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an average of 31 percent to 14 percent by January 2004 and industrial tariffs on U.S. products will fall from an average of 24.6 percent in 1997 to an average of 9.4 percent by 2005. 
   China will open up distribution services, such as repair and maintenance, warehousing, trucking, and air courier services. 
   Import tariffs on autos, now averaging 80-100 percent, will be phased down to an average of 25 percent by 2006, with tariff reductions accelerated. 
   China will participate in the Information Technology Agreement and will eliminate tariffs on products such as computers, semiconductors, and related products by 2005. 
   China will open its telecommunications sector, including access to China's growing Internet services, and expand investment and other activities for financial services firms. 
   The agreement also preserves safeguards against dumping and other unfair trade practices. Specifically, the ``special safeguard rule'' (to prevent import surges into the U.S.) will remain in force for 12 years and the ``special anti-dumping methodology'' will remain in effect for 15 years. 
   America benefits by having China follow the rules and norms of the global marketplace. 
   By some estimates, China is already the world's seventh largest economy.  China's total worldwide trade grew from $21 billion in 1978 to over $324 billion in 1998. Trade makes up 33 percent of China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at roughly one trillion dollars in 1998. 
   China is already America's fourth largest trading partner. U.S.-China two-way trade, less than $1 billion in 1978, was roughly $85 billion in 1998. 
   I would also like to take a few minutes to discuss why China's accession to the WTO is so important to California. 
   California is the nation's number one exporting State, and well over one-fourth of California's trillion dollar economy now depends on international trade and investment. For California workers and companies, this means jobs and improved export opportunities across a broad range of manufacturing, agricultural, and service industries. 
   For California, the growth of trade relations with China over the past two decades has been dramatic. 
   In 1998, China and Hong Kong together were California's fourth largest export destination, with exports topping $6.1 billion. 
   In 1998, while California's total exports declined 4.17 percent, due to the Asian financial crisis, our exports to China (not including Hong Kong) increased 9.28 percent. 
   One third of the total U.S. exports to China come from California; all told over 100,000 California jobs have been generated thus far by trade with China. 
   California's top exports to China look a lot like a list of new and emerging technologies fueling California's current economic boom: Electronic and electrical equipment; industrial equipment and computers; transportation equipment; and instruments. 
   And China is also an important market for the traditional mainstays of the California economy: China and Hong Kong in 1998 received 4.9 percent of California's food exports and 6.4 percent of our crop exports. 
   No matter how you look at it, this benefits the United States. 
   Unfortunately, many people have confused this PNTR vote with a vote to approve China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). It needs to be understood, however, that China will likely join the WTO within the next year regardless. That issue will be decided by the WTO's working group and a two-thirds vote of the WTO membership as a whole. 
   Under WTO rules, only the countries that have ``non-discriminatory'' trade practices (PNTR) are entitled to receive the benefits of WTO agreements. Without granting China permanent normal trading status, the United States would be effectively shut out of China's vast markets, while Britain, Japan, France and all the other WTO-member nations would be allowed to trade with few barriers. 
   If we do not grant China PNTR based on the November bilateral agreement--an agreement in which the U.S. received many important trade concessions and gave up nothing--we effectively shoot ourselves in the foot. 
   Let us also be clear about the ultimate issue at stake here today: The People's Republic of China is today undergoing its most significant period of economic and social activity since its founding over 50 years ago. The pace is fast; the changes large. In a relatively short time, China has become a key Pacific Rim player and major world trader. It is now a huge producer and consumer of goods and services, and a magnet for investment and commerce. 
   Because of its size and potential, the choices China makes over the next few years will greatly influence the future of peace and prosperity in Asia. But, in a very real sense, the shaping of Asia's future also begins with choices America will make in deciding how to deal with China. 
   We can try to engage China and integrate it into the global community. We can be a catalyst for positive change, as our management styles, business techniques and the philosophies that underlie them take root in Chinese society. 
   We can work for change in China, as the benefits of trade and rising living standards bring about the goals we seek, or we can deal antagonistically with China and lose our leverage in guiding China along paths of positive economic and social development. And we can sacrifice business advantage to competitor nations. 
   History clearly shows us a nation's respect for political pluralism, human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection grows in direct proportion to that nation's positive interaction with others and as that nations achieves a level of sustainable economic development and social well-being. This was true in Taiwan; it was true in South Korea. Not too long ago, both were governed by dictatorships. Given a chance, it will also be true in China. 
   As I see it, America will face no challenge more important than this in the foreseeable future. I am convinced we will debate no issue more important than the question of China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and whether or not we will deal with the Chinese on the basis of a permanent normal trading relationship--PNTR--and I intend to speak to this issue at greater length when the Senate returns to work this September. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this cloture motion.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Health Benefits Integrity Act to make sure that most health care dollars that people and employers pay into a managed care health insurance plan get spent on health care and not on overhead. 
   Under my bill, managed care plans would be limited to spending 15 percent of their premium revenues on administration. This means that if they spend 15 percent on administration, they would spend 85 percent of premium revenues on health care benefits or services. 
   This bill was prompted by study by the Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported under a USA Today headline in February, ``Medicare HMOs Hit for Lavish Spending.'' The IG reviewed 232 managed care plans that contract with Medicare and found that in 1999 the average amount allocated for administration ranged from a high of 32 percent to a low of three percent. The IG recommended that the Department establish a ceiling on the amount of administrative expenditures of plans, noting that if a 15 percent ceiling had been placed in 1998, an additional $1 billion could have been passed on to Medicare beneficiaries in the form of additional benefits or reduce deductibles and copayments. 
   The report said, ``This review, similar OIG reviews, and other studies have shown that MCOs' [managed care organizations'] exorbitant administrative costs have been problematic and can be the source for abusive behavior.'' Here are some examples cited by the Inspector General on page 7 of the January 18 report: $249,283 for food, gifts and alcoholic beverages for meetings by one plan; $190,417 for a sales award meeting in Puerto Rico for one plan; $157,688 for a party by one plan; $25,057 for a luxury box at a sports arena by one plan; $106,490 for sporting events and/or theater tickets at four plans; $69,700 for holiday parties at three plans; and $37,303 for wine gift baskets, flowers, gifts and gift certificates at one plan. 
   It is no wonder that people today are angry at HMOs. When our hard-earned premium dollars are frittered away on purchases like these, we have to ask whether HMOs are really providing the best care possible. Furthermore, in the case of Medicare, we are also talking about wasted taxpayer dollars since Part B of Medicare is funded in part by the general treasury. One dollar wasted in Medicare is one dollar too much. Medicare needs all the funds it can muster to stay solvent and to be there for beneficiaries when they need it. 
   I feel strongly that if HMOs are to be credible, they must be more prudent in how they spend enrollees' dollars. Administrative expenses must be limited to reasonable expenses. 
   An October 1999 report by Interstudy found that for private HMO plans, administrative expenses range from 11 percent to 21 percent and that for-profit HMOs spend proportionately more on administrative cost than not-for-profit HMOs. This study found the lowest rate to be 3.6 percent and the highest 38 percent in California! In some states the maximums were even higher. 
   The shift from fee-for-service to managed care as a form of health insurance has been rapid in recent years. Nationally, 86 percent of people who have employment-based health insurance (81.3 million Americans) are in some form of managed care. Around 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care nationally (40 percent in California), a figure that doubled between 1994 and 1997. By 2010, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 31 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will be in managed care. Between 1987 and 1999, the number of health plans contracting with Medicare went from 161 to 299. As for Medicaid, in 1993, 4.8 million people (14 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries) were in managed care. Today, 16.6 million (54 percent) are in managed care. 
   In California, the State which pioneered managed care for the nation, an estimated 88 percent of the insured are in some form of managed care. Of the 3.7 million Californians who are in Medicare, 40 percent (1.4 million) are in  managed care, the highest rate in the U.S. As for Medicaid in California, 2.5 million people (50 percent) of beneficiaries are in managed care. And so managed care is growing and most people think it is here to stay. 
   I am pleased to say that in California we already have a regulation along the lines of the bill I am proposing. We have in place a regulatory limit of 15 percent on commercial HMO plans' administrative expenses. This was established in my State for commercial plans because of questionable expenses like those the HHS IG found in Medicare HMO plans and because prior to the regulation, some plans had administrative expense as high as 30 percent of premium revenues. 
   This bill would never begin to address all the problems patients experience with managed care in this country. That is why we also need a strong Patients Bill of Rights bill. I hope, however, this bill will discourage abuses like those the HHS Inspector General found and will help assure people that their health care dollars are spent on health care and are not wasted on outings, parties, and other activities totally unrelated to providing health care services. 
   I call on my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senators BYRD, BOXER and I are introducing legislation to allow States, at their option, to enroll parents in the State-Children's Health Insurance Program, known as S-CHIP. This bill could provide insurance to 2.7 million parents nationwide and 356,000 parents in California by using unspent allocations States will otherwise lose on September 30, 2000. Congress has appropriated a total of $12.9 billion for S-CHIP for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, or about $4.3 billion for each fiscal year. California received $854.6 million in 1998, $850.6 million in 1999, and $765.5 million in 2000. Right now California stands to lose $588 million just in fiscal year 1998 funds because California has faced many hurdles in enrolling children. That is in part why we are introducing this bill, to enhance enrollment of more children and to help states use available S-CHIP funds. 
   S-CHIP is a low-cost health insurance program for low-income children up to age 19 that Congress created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. After three years, S-CHIP covers approximately two million children across the country, out of the three to four million children estimated to be eligible. Congress created it as a way to provide affordable health insurance for uninsured children in families that cannot afford to buy private insurance. 
   States can choose from three options when designing their S-CHIP program: (1) expansion of their current Medicaid program; (2) creation of a separate State insurance program; or (3) a combination of both approaches. In California, S-CHIP, known as Health Families, is set up as a public-private program rather than a Medicaid expansion. Healthy Families allows California families to use federal and State S-CHIP funds to purchase private managed care insurance for their children. Under the federal law, States generally cover children in families with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty, although States can go higher if their Medicaid eligibility was higher than that when S-CHIP was enacted in 1997. In California, eligibility was raised to 250 percent in November 1999, increasing the number of eligible children by 129,000. 
   Basic benefits in the California S-CHIP program include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, and well-baby and well-child care, including immunizations. Additional services which States are encouraged to provide, and which California has elected to include, are prescription drugs and mental health, visions, hearing, dental, and preventive care services such as prenatal care and routine physical examinations. In California, enrollees pay a $5.00 co-payment per visit which generally applies to inpatient services, selected outpatient services, and various other health care services. 
   The United States faces a serious health care crisis that continues to grow as more and more people are becoming uninsured. Despite the robust health of the economy, the U.S. has seen an increase in the uninsured by nearly five million since 1994. Currently, 44 million people (or 18 percent) of the non-elderly population are uninsured. In California, 23.5 percent, or 7.3 million, are uninsured. One study cited in the May 2000 California Journal found that as many as 2,333 Californians lose health insurance every day. A May 29, 2000 San Jose Mercury article cited California's emergency room doctors who ``estimate that anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of their walk-in patients have no 
   health coverage.'' This a problem that needs to be addressed now. 
   The bill we are introducing would allow States to expand S-CHIP coverage to parents whose children are eligible for the program. In my State, that would be families up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. For the year 2000, the federal poverty level for a family of four is $17,050. In California, with the upper eligibility limit of 250 percent of poverty, families of four making up to $42,625 are eligible. This bill could reach approximately 2.7 million parents nationwide and more than 356,000 parents in California. The bill we are introducing retains the current funding formula, State allotments, benefits, eligibility rules, and cost-sharing requirements. 
   An S-CHIP expansion should be accomplished without substituting S-CHIP coverage for private insurance or other public health insurance that parents might already have. The current S-CHIP law requires that State plans include adequate provisions preventing substitution and my bill retains that. For example, many States require that an enrollee be uninsured before he or she is eligible for the program. 
   This bill is important for several reasons. Many State officials say that by covering parents of uninsured children we can actually cover more children. More than 75 percent of uninsured children live with parents who are uninsured. If an entire family is enrolled in a plan and seeing the same group of doctors--in other words, if the care is convenient for the whole family--all the members of the family are more likely to be insured and to stay healthy. This is a key reason for this legislation, bringing in more children by targeting the whole family. 
   Private health insurance in the commercial market can be very expensive. The average annual cost of family coverage in private health plans for 1999 was $5,742, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. California has some of the lowest-priced health insurance, yet the State ranks fifth in uninsured for 1998-1996. In California, high housing costs, high gas prices, expensive commutes, and a high cost-of-living make it difficult for many California families to buy health insurance. According to the California Institute, the median price of single family home rose 17 percent, to $231,710, from February 1999 to February 2000. The California Housing Affordability Index, which measures the percentage of Californians that are able to purchase mid-priced homes, declined 11 percent from 1999 to 2000. With prices like these, many families are unable to afford health insurance even though they work full-time. 
   Many low-income people work for employers who do not offer health insurance. In fact, forty percent of California small businesses (those employing between three and 50 employers) do not offer health insurance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in June. 
   We need to give hard-working, lower income American families affordable, comprehensive health insurance, and this bill does that. 
   The President has proposed to cover parents under the S-CHIP program. The California Medical Association and Alliance of Catholic Health Care support our bill. 
   Current law requires States to spend federal S-CHIP dollars within three years of the appropriation. Many States, including California, could lose millions of dollars of unspent federal  Fiscal Year 1998 funds on September 30, 2000. I am working to get an extension of that deadline. In the meantime, we could begin to cover parents while getting that extension and working to increase funds for the program. According to estimates from the Health Care Financing Administration, the following 39 States could lose the following amounts, totaling $1.9 billion. Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, and Texas stand to lose the most money. These eight States alone would lose $1.4 billion.

   Our bill would offer another option for States like mine to use these unspent funds. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting and passing this bill. By giving States the option to cover parents--whole families--we can reduce the number of uninsured with existing funds and encourage the enrollment of more children and we can help keep people healthy by better using this valuable, but currently under-utilized program.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to benefit 17 million citizens of Southern California and visitors from around the country and world through the development of the Western Center for Archaeology and Paleontology. At this center, visitors will be able to marvel at the archaeological and paleontological past of inland southern California. 
   This bill would help create an interpretive center and museum around Diamond Valley Lake to highlight the animals and habitat of the Ice Age up to the European settlement period. 
   I understand that the paleontological resources are world class and include hundreds of thousands of historic and pre-historic artifacts. These include a mastodon skeleton, a mammoth skeleton, a seven-foot long tusk, and bones from extinct species previously not believed to have lived in the area, including the giant long-horned bison and North American lion. 
   Additionally, visitors will enjoy unprecedented recreational opportunities through a system of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails wandering through the grasslands, chaparral, and oak groves that surround the reservoir. 
   The total cost of the project is $58 million. The State has agreed to commit one quarter of the tab, the Metropolitan Water District has agreed to contribute one-quarter, and other local governments will also contribute one-quarter. This bill would authorize the federal government's share of one-quarter or $14 million. 
   I urge the Senate to adopt this legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand that we are running out the clock on a motion to bring to the floor the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. So I think my comments are pertinent to that bill and to the situation in which we find ourselves. 
   Mr. President, about 14 months ago, those of us in this Chamber passed a juvenile justice bill. Prior to its passage, many of us on this side of the aisle came together to say if we want to really achieve some limited improvements in targeted gun measures, what should they be? We decided on a few, and the Republican side had a few. So some targeted measures were added to that bill. 
   One of them was that guns should not be sold without trigger locks. That was made from our side of the aisle. One from the Republican side of the aisle was that children should not be permitted to buy assault weapons--a no-brainer. That was accepted by this body. A third vote was to close the gun show loophole which enabled the two youngsters from Columbine, 16 years old, to go to a gun show and buy two assault weapons with no questions asked. The final one was one I offered on the floor, which was to plug a hole in the assault weapons legislation. 
   Under the assault weapons legislation, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, sell, or to transfer a large-capacity ammunition feeding device in this country. So, in other words, nobody can manufacture one domestically in this country now. The loophole is that they can come in, if manufactured in foreign countries, and be sold. So since the passage of the original assault weapons legislation, about 18 million large-capacity ammunition feeding devices have come into the country. But just in the last 14 months, since the passage of the juvenile justice bill, 6.3 million of these clips have come into this country, many of them 250 rounds, but most 30 rounds. 
   What is the use of these clips? You can't hunt with them. You can't carry a clip with more than 10 bullets in virtually any State if you are going to hunt. You don't use them for self-protection. The street price of them has dropped. You can buy them, no questions asked, over the Internet for $7, $8, $9. The only reason for them is to turn a weapon into a major killing machine. They are used by drive-by shooters, by the gangs, and by the grievance killer who has a grievance and wants to walk into his place of business and kill a large number of people. Well, this body passed that, and the other body actually passed it by unanimous consent. So those are measures that have held up a whole huge juvenile justice bill for that period of time. 
   So in 14 months, we have gone nowhere in achieving safety regulations, prudent targeted gun regulations to protect people. 
   A million women--now 240 new organizations--in the Million Mom March, went to the streets of their cities and to the Capitol on Mother's Day to say they wanted prudent gun regulations. But what has happened since then is we have actually back slipped. The backsliding is taking place right in this very bill which time is running on. 
   An amendment was put in the bill that says this:  
   None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to implement a preference for the acquisition of a firearm or ammunition based on whether the manufacturer or vendor of the firearm or ammunition is a party of an agreement with a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States regarding codes of conduct, operating practices, or product design specifically related to the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition under chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code.  
   This amendment is essentially meant to prohibit the U.S. Government from giving any preference to any responsible gun manufacturer. I believe this measure is simply the worst possible public policy. I would rather not have a Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that has this kind of disincentive to good conduct in a manufacturer of weapons in this country. 
   When this bill comes to the floor, the first amendment from our side will be the amendment to strip this verbiage from the bill. 
   I am pleased to say I am joined in cosponsoring this by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG. 
   First, it is important to point out that no such preferences have been given. The thrust of this provision is based on a hypothetical. But it is based to be a deterrent. It is based to send a message. The message is to every manufacturer of weapons that there can be no reward in government if you manufacture safe guns. If you put trigger locks, if you have good, safe marketing practices, if you manufacture guns and see they are sold and distributed in a way to keep them out of the hands of children, people who are mentally deficient, or criminals--that is the thrust of this amendment--to reduce the gun industry to its lowest possible common denominator all across the United States of America, that is the worst possible public policy. Members on both sides of this aisle should stand together and refute it. 
   At least one company, Smith & Wesson, has agreed to adopt certain reasonable, responsible marketing practices. While this agreement was made under the threat of litigation, it is important to note that no dealer has to comply, and no measures have been forced on Smith & Wesson. Smith & Wesson has decided to take a responsible path to produce responsible policy, and for that this body would slap them on the hand. 
   As a result of their effort, Smith & Wesson has allegedly been targeted by others in the gun industry that are unhappy with the agreement who say you can't march ahead of us; you can't do something right; we all want to be able to do something wrong. There has been talk of boycotts and anticompetitive behavior. In fact, I recently joined a number of my colleagues in writing to the Federal Trade Commission, asking them to look into these allegations. 
   Given the determination of the National Rifle Association and its allies  to stop any and all reasonable control of the flow of guns to criminals and children, I believe it would be dreadful to prevent the administration from encouraging agreements such as this one. 
   Let me be clear. No one is saying that law enforcement should buy inferior weapons simply because the manufacturer has agreed to act responsibly. The fact is, Smith & Wesson produces very good weapons. I have certainly never been one to argue that we should leave law enforcement without adequate weaponry. But where technology and safety of guns are similar, it makes eminent sense to give preference to the manufacturer that has agreed to certain commonsense standards. 
   I wish to take a few moments and go over a few of the details in the Smith & Wesson settlement document. This is what it looks like. 
   First, under the agreement, all handguns and pistols will be shipped from Smith & Wesson with child-safety devices. 
   Again, the juvenile justice bill would have made this provision unnecessary. But, again, that bill has gone nowhere. 
   What would that do? 
   In Memphis, TN, not too long ago, a 5-year-old took a weapon off of his grandfather's dresser. It was loaded. He took it to kindergarten to kill the kindergarten teacher because that youngster had been given a ``time out'' the day before. The gun was discovered because a bullet dropped out of his backpack--a 5-year-old child toting in his backpack a loaded pistol with no safety lock to kill the teacher because he had been given a ``time out'' the day before. With the safety lock, the gun would have been inoperable to that child. 
   Another child in Michigan, a 6-year-old, has an argument with a child, brings a gun to school, and actually kills another 6-year-old. 
   These may not be everyday events. But they would be prevented from happening if guns were made with smart technology and, prior to that, with safety locks. 
   Also in the agreement, every handgun would be designed with a second hidden serial number. Why that? Because it prevents criminals from easily eradicating a serial number to impede tracing. How can we not support that? 
   New Smith & Wesson models will be no longer able to accept any large-capacity magazine. What is important about that? That immediately limits the kill power of that weapon. The weapon can still be used for defense. But the drums of 250 or 75 rounds with clips of 30 rounds, which are there for one reason--to kill large numbers of people--would not be accepted into that gun. 
   Within 2 years, every Smith & Wesson model would have a built-in, on-board locking system by which the firearm could only be operated with the key, or combination, or other mechanism unique to that gun. 
   Two percent of Smith & Wesson's firearms revenue would be devoted to developing smart gun technology for all future gun models. What a good thing to have happen. 
   Next, within a year of the agreement, each firearm would be designed so it could not be readily operated by a child under the age of six. This might include increasing the trigger-pull resistance, designing the gun so a small hand could not operate it, or perhaps requiring a sequence of actions to fire the gun that could not be easily accomplished by a 5-year-old. Who believes the Federal Government should not encourage manufacturers to make weapons so five- and six-year-olds cannot fire them? 
   The agreement includes safety in manufacturing tests, such as minimum barrel length and firing tests to ensure that misfires, explosions, and cracks such as those found in Saturday night specials do not occur. A drop test is also included. 
   I remember very well a major robbery in San Francisco where a police officer with a semiautomatic handgun went into the robbery, pulled out his weapon, and the clip dropped out. He was shot and killed. And I remember another incident where the gun was dropped and fired accidentally. 
   Another provision: each pistol would have a clearly visible chamber load indicator, so that the user can see whether there is a round in the chamber. 
   No new pistol design would be able to accept large-capacity ammunition clips. 
   The packaging of new guns will include a safety warning regarding the list of unsafe storage and use. What a good thing, a gun manufacturer that will put a warning with the gun that says to the prospective gun owner: Understand this is a lethal weapon. Here is how to keep it safely. Put it in a cabinet which is secure and locked. Keep the ammunition separate from the gun. 
   And we are going to prevent anyone who provides this from gaining any kind of preference? We give preference with merit pay. There are all kinds of preferences in Federal law. Yet we are to deny this to anybody who does the right thing and manufactures safe guns, smart guns, better guns. 
   Under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms would comply with a series of commonsense measures. Let me state what they are. Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms first agrees not to sell at any gun show unless all the sellers in the gun show provide background checks. What a responsible thing to do. Again, this provision would be unnecessary if Congress had simply passed the juvenile justice bill and sent it to the President for his signature because all sellers at all gun shows would already be performing background checks. That bill is stalled in conference, and this provision of the agreement is a small step in the right direction. 
   Again, under the agreement, any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must carry insurance against liability for damage to property or injury to persons resulting in firearm sales. The same thing would apply if you had a swimming pool. You would have some liability insurance if a neighbor fell into the pool and drowned. This isn't asking too much. 
   Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must maintain an up-to-date and accurate set of records and must keep track of all inventory at all times. 
   Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson firearms must agree to keep all firearms within the dealership safe from loss or theft, including locking display cases and keeping guns safely locked during off hours. 
   Ammunition must be stored separate from firearms. 
   Any dealer wishing to sell Smith & Wesson must stop selling large-capacity ammunition feeding devices and assault weapons. 
   This gun company has set itself in the vanguard of reform in the gun industry, and the Treasury-Postal bill coming before the Senate penalizes them for doing so. What kind of public policy is that? It simply says we are going to try, by law, to lower safety, regulation, careful record keeping, and all the things that are positive to the lowest possible denominator. We are not going to commend anybody who does the right thing. We are going to see they are not given preference. We are going to provide a disincentive to gun companies that want to do the right thing. 
   More than any other piece of legislation I have seen, this shows the disingenuousness of those who say they are for some targeted gun regulations. This speaks to what this is all about, that there should remain one, and one industry only, without regulation, without any kinds of standards, and that is 
   the gun industry. 
   I think there is no better time to join this debate than in the upcoming Treasury-Postal bill. The amendment to strip this language from Treasury-Postal will be the first item of business of this side. 
   Mr. President, I will make this agreement available to anyone from either side of this aisle who wants to inspect it. 
   Mr. President, Senator KENNEDY is a cosponsor of the amendment. I thank him, as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators HOLLINGS, INOUYE, and I are introducing a bill to create a demonstration grant program to help school districts create master teacher positions. 
   Our bill authorizes $50 million for a five-year demonstration program under which the Secretary of Education would award competitive grants to school districts to create master teacher positions. Federal funds would be equally matched by states and local governments so that $100 million total would be available. Under the bill, 5,000 master teacher positions could be created, or 100 per State, if each master teacher were paid $20,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary. 
   As defined in this amendment, a master teacher is one who is credentialed; has a least five years of teaching experience; is judged to be an excellent teacher by administrators and teachers who are knowledgeable about the individual's performance; and is currently teaching; and enters into a contract and agrees to serve at least five more years. 
   The master teacher would help other teachers to improve instruction, strengthen other teachers' skills, mentor lesser experienced teachers, develop curriculum, and provide other professional development. 
   The intent of this bill is for districts to pay each master teacher up to $20,000 on top of his or her regular salary. Nationally, the average teacher salary is $40,582. In California, it is $44,585. Elementary school principals receive $64,653 on average nationally and $72,385 in California. The thrust of the master teacher concept in this bill is to pay teachers a salary closer to that of an administrator to keep good teachers in teaching. 
   The bill requires State and/or local districts to match federal funds dollar for dollar. It requires the U.S. Department of Education to give priority to school districts with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students and to ensure that grants are awarded to a wide range of districts in terms of the size and location of the school district, the ethnic and economic composition of students, and the experience of the districts' teachers. 
   There are several reasons we need this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in May I stood on this floor and castigated the pharmaceutical industry for going behind the scenes and killing an amendment that Senator FEINGOLD and I had introduced, and which was part of the African trade bill. They killed this amendment in conference. 
   This amendment essentially would have allowed countries in the midst of a national HIV/AIDS emergency to use the cheapest possible drugs to fight that national health emergency by allowing the country to distribute the drugs through ``parallel importing'' and ``compulsory licensing.'' 
   Fortunately, the President put forward an Executive order to carry out the intent of our amendment. 
   Since that time, some substantial things have happened. 
   Because I was so critical of the industry I feel it is only fitting that I always come to the floor and acknowledge those that have responded to the crisis. 
   When Senator FEINGOLD and I began this fight last fall, 6 months after the World Health Organization declared HIV/AIDS the most deadly infectious disease in the world, very few people were aware at the time of the scope of the devastation as a result of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Today, things have changed. Virtually not a day goes by without the media running a story about the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. I will not recapitulate today all of the horrifying numbers behind this AIDS crisis. It suffices to say that more than 22 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, including over 30 percent of the adult population in many of the countries in the region. AIDS kills more than 2 million people a year in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   The media, the public, and governments from around the world are now increasingly aware of the catastrophe that is unfolding on this continent. Of course, the pharmaceutical community is also aware. 
   Today, I will discuss some of the positive steps the pharmaceutical industry is now taking to address this issue. I am very pleased and very grateful to see that the industry now recognizes its moral obligation and appears to be stepping up to the plate and taking the initiative to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa and other flashpoints throughout the developing world. 
   On July 7, Boehringer Ingelheim announced that Nevirapine will be offered free of charge for a period of 5 years for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in developing countries. They actually said that any country that asks for the drug will obtain it for free. That is a huge step forward. Reducing mother-to-child transmission can literally save millions of lives and reduce the rate of increase of HIV/AIDS in the developing world. In South Africa alone, according to a study published in the Lancet on June 17, as many as 110,000 cases of HIV in infants could be prevented over the next 5 years if all pregnant women in South Africa take a short course of antiretroviral medication such as Nevirapine during labor. 
   Today, I believe there are literally millions of orphans in Africa, orphans whose mothers, fathers, and families have died of AIDS, orphans who are living without food, without water. It is a devastating situation. The initiative by Boehringer Ingelheim is part of the collaborative effort between the United Nations, the World Bank, and five pharmaceutical companies. I salute them today. Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo-Wellcome, Merck, and Hoffman-La Roche are now trying, together, to expand access to HIV/AIDS treatment in the developing world. They deserve to be saluted by this body. 
   If efforts by the international community to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the developing world are to be successful, they must be part of a coordinated effort, and that effort has to include education, prevention, and adequate health care infrastructure. They must also include access to affordable medication. This is where participation by the pharmaceutical industry is so essential. 
   I am pleased to see that at long last pharmaceutical companies have recognized they have a profound social responsibility and moral obligation to meet the HIV/AIDS crisis, and that the lifesaving drugs they can provide are essential. We all know that AIDS drugs are extraordinarily costly. Therefore, access to low cost or generic drugs becomes critical. 
   It is important, however, to sound a note of caution and place the initiatives of these pharmaceutical companies in perspective. According to Doctors' Without Borders, for example, past experience with the proposed Pfizer fluconazole donation shows that these programs sometimes come with conditions for national health ministries that make them unsustainable over the long term. Many of these conditions are worthy. For example, it is worthy that the 
   drug companies actually try to prevent the distribution of these drugs on the black market, and I understand the requirement that these drugs only be dispensed by a physician.  If a country doesn't have an adequate physician corps, it makes the dispensation of these drugs extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. 
   Because of these experiences, I believe it is critical that the United Nations and the national governments concerned work with the pharmaceutical companies to make sure that any future efforts, including Boehringer Ingelheim's offer on Nevirapine, do not include hidden conditions which may serve to undermine these important initiatives. 
   Nevirapine, given in tablet form, as I understand it, does not have a lot of side effects and can be given in a way that encourages pregnant women throughout the continent to use it, and thereby in 90 percent of the cases prevent the transmission of the HIV virus to the unborn child. 
   In addition, I believe alongside initiatives by the pharmaceutical industry, access to low cost and/or generic drugs embodied in the President's May 11 Executive Order is still very important. The few developing countries that have significant access to medicines for people with HIV/AIDS gained access by aggressively pursuing generic strategies. In Brazil, 80,000 people have been treated with generic drugs that have brought the cost of triple drug therapy down to approximately $1,000 a year. While in Uganda, where the Government was working with brand name drugs through a U.N. AIDS initiative, fewer than 1,000 people have been treated, due to cost constraints. 
   Bringing the HIV/AIDS pandemic under control in sub-Saharan Africa and preventing HIV/AIDS from becoming a pandemic in other regions of the developing world is one of the great moral tests of our time. If governments, nonprofits, and the pharmaceutical industry work together, I believe we can control what will otherwise be the greatest preventable humanitarian catastrophe in history. 
   Government and nonprofits are now beginning to take this crisis seriously. So are the pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. The offer by Boehringer Ingelheim to provide free Nevirapine to developing countries for 5 years to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and the creation of a coalition of five major manufacturers of HIV/AIDS drugs to work with the United Nations to deliver drugs to victims of this crisis, are major steps in the effort to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
   I just want to say I am very grateful. I believe this Senate should also salute this action. I would like to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to follow the example these five companies are setting. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the RECORD letters from two young children in support of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. These children, Brendon Fisher, age 6 and a half, and Paige Fisher, age 8 and a half, are the nephew and niece of Betsy Mullen, Chairperson of the Women's Information Network--Against Breast Cancer. These letters eloquently state why it is so important to continue this program. 
   The letters follow.  
   July 16, 2000. 
   Dear Congress, I think it's very important to keep the stamp because if we don't every girl is going to worry about it or maybe get breast cancer. But if we keep it we will get money to cure to stop it. My Aunt Betsey risked her life on it and I'm proud of her. If you think about it no one likes it because you can die from it. I think, and a lot of other people agree with me, that it would be best to keep the stamp and then things will go perfect. Hope my letter makes a difference because not just me is counting on this. 
   By Paige Fisher, 8 1/2 years old. 
   Dear Congress, girls and boys can get breast cancer and I don't want girls and boys and the president and his wife, cat and dog to get sick. Keep the stamp going. 
   From Brendon Fisher.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Today I want to express my support for the NEA which plays an important role in preserving our culture and is funded in this bill. 
   The bill before us provides $105 million for the NEA, an increase of $7.3 million over FY 2000. This is of vital importance to the survival of the arts in both California and in the United States. National interest in the arts continues to increase. The number of artists in America has more than doubled since 1970. Today, the arts industry supports nearly 1.3 million jobs nationally; 391,200 indirectly, and 908,800 directly. 
   Despite this growth, the United States still spends nearly 50 times less on the arts than in any other countries: While the U.S. spends $6.00 per person on the arts, the United Kingdom spends $26.00; France spends $57.00; Finland spends up to $91.00. 
   In 1999, NEA funded projects in every county in the state of California, awarding 210 grants totaling $5.6 million. To date, in FY 2000, the NEA has provided 225 grants in California, totaling $7.3 million. 
   Here are three examples of how the National Endowment for the Arts helps preserve our national cultural heritage. 
   This year, the NEA awarded a grant to the City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture to support the Living Traditions Initiative. Living Traditions teaches a wide array of skills in music, dance, language arts, history, folklore, crafts and visual arts though classes, publications, recordings and the broadcast media. 
   In 1999, the NEA funded a collaborative project of the Brooklyn, New York, Historical Society to increase public access to visual materials documenting Prospect Park, the location of the 1776 Battle of Long Island, the first major conflict between the Continental and British Armies in North America, following the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The project will increase a historic image database, produce a guide for the database and make it Internet accessible. 
   In 1999, the NEA funded Documentary Arts, Inc. of Dallas, Texas, to support a series of films that explore the complexity of American life through the spoken word and community-based sounds of folk artists across the country. 
   Preserving national and community culture is one way to encourage patriotism and a sense of community that can help combat the apathy that keeps people from actively involving themselves in the daily life of their community. 
   The NEA can be a force to engage the imagination. The NEA funds arts education for children, such as these: 
   The Magic Theater in San Francisco, promotes the Young California Writers Project, an educational program designed to support young playwrights. 
   Class Act is a music education program in Orange County, California, elementary and middle schools supported by NEA. 
   Stagebridge in Oakland, California, provides a literacy program for both children and adults. 
   The National Book Foundation does literary outreach to link leading authors with underserved communities throughout the country. For example, American Voices brings established writers to American Indian reservations nationwide and conducts a summer writing camp for inner-city teens and adults. 
   The MoveSpeakSpin program in Santa Cruz, California uses dance education activities as a tool in teaching curriculum subjects in math and science, subjects which often are difficult for children to learn. 
   Given the demands on our school budgets in California, many school districts in California were forced to cut funding for music and art programs from their schools' curriculums. NEA funding in the schools helps assure that our children will still have access to arts education. 
   Additionally, students who participate in the arts do notably better on standardized testing. Research from the 1995-1997 College Entrance Examination Board shows that students who studied the arts scored an average of 83 points higher than non-art students on the SAT. 
   Arts can also provide a constructive outlet for young people. A three-year research study of YouthARTS, funded by the NEA and the U.S. Department of Justice in 1999, demonstrated that arts programs help decrease youth delinquency. Several NEA-funded projects have demonstrated this:  
   NEA awarded a grant to the Richmond Art Center in California to support expansion of the ``Art Reach'' program for at-risk youths in West Contra Costa County. 
   Creative Links: Positive Alternatives for Youth funds residency projects across the nation in which young people work with artists after school and during the summer. Programs are supported through arts organizations, community centers, low-income housing projects, tribal communities and juvenile facilities. 
   By encouraging at-risk teens to express themselves through art instead of 
   antisocial behavior, the NEA can help deter delinquency. 
   For much of American history, art has been considered to be a ``luxury'' of the elite. Through traveling programs and other outreach programs, the NEA has made art accessible for Americans in all corners of the nation and to all economic strata. Here are some examples in California: 
   The Rural Journeys Project, run partially by Independent Eye, Ltd. in Sebastopol provides residencies that offer performances from the repertoire and workshops to rural communities nationally. 
   A grant to the Humboldt Arts Council in Humboldt supports a consortium of multi disciplinary arts workshops and activities to rural, low-income populations.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his clarification. The point he makes is essential to me. If I had not had the understanding with regard to the carryover basis that he has just indicated, I would not have supported the amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am as upset by the gasoline price spikes as anyone else. I believe they are still very high in California, though prices have come down in my State from the highs they reached in March. 
   Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose this amendment despite understanding the sentiment behind it. The problem with the amendment is that there is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal gasoline tax will be passed on to consumers. 
   At least that's what the chief executive officers of the three major California refiners told me. Collectively, they produce 70 percent of California's gasoline. Earlier in the year, I called them. None could guarantee that a decrease in the gasoline tax would cause the same drop at the pump. They cited the fundamental problem with supply, and also pointed out that they have no control over other entities in the supply chain. 
   Price is a function of supply and demand, not taxes and right now, world oil markets are extremely tight, so prices are high. The way to relieve the pressure on the market is to boost supply and reduce demand. 
   With regard to supply, 14 nations sell oil to the U.S. under a cartel known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. Like any monopoly, OPEC controls the price of oil by limiting supply. Decreased production in non-OPEC countries like Venezuela, Mexico, and Norway has also contributed to the squeeze. 
   Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law, there are only a few things the U.S. can do to encourage the cartel to increase supply. The preferred alternative is diplomacy. 
   It takes several weeks for production increases to be felt at the pump in lower prices, and California has unique problems affecting its supply. No other State requires the kind of reformulated gasoline that California does. So the gasoline has to be refined in California, and California refiners have had problems--including two fires--operating their plants at full capacity. They are at full capacity now. 
   As I said a moment ago, this amendment does not solve the problem of high gasoline prices. Under California law, if the federal gasoline tax drops by 9 cents per gallon or more, then the State tax automatically rises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to protect the Highway Trust Fund. I have spoken with members of the California Legislature about this. They do not seem inclined to change the law. 
   What are our options? 
   The fact is, we have limited control over supply. Too much of the world's oil is produced elsewhere. The one thing we can control is demand. 
   The best way to reduce demand is to require that sports utility vehicles, SUVs, and light duty trucks get the same fuel efficiency that passenger vehicles do. If SUVs and light duty trucks had the same fuel efficiency standards as passenger cars, the U.S. would use one million fewer barrels of oil each day. 
   This is roughly equal to the U.S. shortfall before OPEC increased production. 
   The Department of Transportation is responsible for setting fuel efficiency requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, program. About two-thirds of all petroleum used goes to transportation, so boosting fuel efficiency is an important way to wean ourselves off OPEC oil and reduce the price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider, too, the significant environmental and health benefits of higher fuel efficiency. 
   But CAFE standards have not increased since the mid-1980s. And the situation is made worse by a loophole in the CAFE regulations. SUVs and light duty trucks--which are as much passenger vehicles as station wagons and sedans--are only required to average 20.7 miles per gallon per fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles. 
   Since half of all new vehicles sold in this country are fuel-thirsty SUVs and light duty trucks, this stranglehold on energy efficiency has produced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards! 
   According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day because of CAFE standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I said a moment ago, and save another million barrels each day. 
   Overall, SUV and light duty truck owners spend an extra $25 billion a year at the pump because of the ``SUV loophole.'' Making SUVs and light duty trucks get better gas mileage would save their owners some $640 at the pump each year when the price of gasoline averages $2 per gallon. 
   The bottom line is that eliminating some or all of the federal gasoline tax will not lower prices at the pump. The best way to do that is to reduce our demand. The best way to reduce demand is to increase the gas mileage requirements for SUVs and light duty trucks.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the repeal of the estate tax. 
   I support the repeal of the estate tax because, on a very basic and fundamental level, I believe that the estate tax is unfair. 
   In some respects, for example, the estate tax amounts to double taxation, taxing, at times at a confiscatory rate in excess of 50 percent, assets which were already taxed when the income was earned. Regardless of how much or how little, if you have earned money, and paid taxes on it, you ought to be able to pass it on to your children without it being taxed yet again. 
   I also believe that it is critical to our continued economic growth and prosperity that small business owners and family farmers be given every incentive to work and grow their business, and to be able to pass those businesses on to their children to run and grow. 
   If a family works for years to establish and grow a business, an heir should not find that they are forced to sell the business simply to pay taxes on it, or that they must assume a crushing debt burden--which may well make the continued survival of the business untenable--simply to pay the taxes. 
   That is not fair, not right, and not what the American dream is all about. 
   In addition, because of soaring real estate prices, the estate tax is unfair to many middle class residents of my state who never thought, planned, or expected to find themselves subject to the estate tax. And the simple fact of the matter is that they should not be subject to the estate tax. 
   As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, in recent years housing prices in California have gone through the roof. Modest two and three bedroom houses in many parts of California now sell for close to three-quarters of a million dollars. 
   These are not mansions, but simple and straightforward middle class houses--two or three bedrooms, perhaps a small back yard--in modest neighborhoods.  
   But because of the soaring value of their homes, many middle class families with modest incomes now find that they would be faced with having to pay estate taxes simply because of the value of their family home. 
   With few other assets other than their primary residences, a parent who wanted to pass on the family home to his or her children would find that their children would be forced to sell the family house simply to pay the estate taxes on the house itself. 
   That is not fair and that is not right. 
   Mr. President, I can think of few things that this Congress can do in addressing tax reform this year that are more important than repealing the estate tax. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of estate tax repeal.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. I think this amendment is both needed and timely. It would provide emergency funding to address what has become a very dangerous fuel buildup on millions of acres of national forests. 
   In April of this year, the General Accounting Office released a report entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire Adapted Ecosystems, a Cohesive Strategy.'' The underpinning of this report is this comment:  
   The most expensive and serious problem relating to the health of national forests in the interior west is the over-accumulation of vegetation.  
   The report goes on to say that throughout much of the interior west, dense vegetation and dead material is continuing to accumulate. Each year in the absence of treatment, more forests become high risk, choked with dense accumulations of small trees and dead wood. These accumulations of fuel and more damaging fires are more dangerous and more costly to control, especially during drought years. 
   As the GAO report points out, many experts attach a sense of urgency to the management of these ecosystems. Because of the high proportion of the total area classified as high risk--in this report it is what is called class 3--combined with the fact that without treatment more vegetation will grow into these high-risk conditions, it is apparent that time is running out for a strategy to successfully avert high cost/high loss consequences. 
   That is the backdrop for this amendment. The amendment would provide emergency funding to move ahead on this program. Because dead and dying and small-diameter trees and thick underbrush have accumulated in our national forests, the possibility of serious and highly destructive forest fires have dramatically increased. Without any action on our part, it is going to continue to increase in the future. 
   Senator DOMENICI, several of our colleagues, and I share the belief that we have a true emergency on our hands. The Forest Service has identified 24 million acres of land in the continental United States as being at the absolute highest level of catastrophic fire risk. Almost fully one-third of this--7.8 million acres--lies in California. That is more than any other State. 
   Last year in my State--and we counted it forest fire by forest fire--over 700,000 acres of forest burned down. Several people lost their lives and dozens of structures were burned. Seventy-thousand of these acres were prime California spotted owl habitat in the Lassen and Plumas Forests. 
   Last year, $365 million was spent nationally by the Federal Government putting out fires and rehabilitating the land. Of this, $144 million, or approximately one-half of the U.S. total, was spent in one State; that is, California. I think the money would be much better spent preventing fire rather than cleaning up after that fire. 
   The entire Sierra Nevada mountain range national forests continue to be classified as the highest fire risk. This includes the newly designated Sequoia Monument, over 361,000 acres. It includes the Plumas and Lassen Forests in and around Quincy, where forest fires in the past have destroyed homes and businesses and spotted owl habitat. It includes areas such as the Lake Tahoe Basin, where one-third of the forests are either dead or dying. And the probability of major fire conflagration remains and grows each year. Such a fire would permanently destroy the water quality of the lake. 
   Through the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. population was predominantly spread out and agrarian. Forest fires burned naturally at fairly predictable intervals, and they burned hot enough to restrict encroaching vegetation and prevent fuel from loading up on the ground but not hot enough to kill old growths. Forests in the United States survived in this fashion for literally thousands of years. 
   By the middle of the 20th century, however, an increasing population began to occupy new urban wild land zones on what had once been forests. Suddenly, forest fires had to be put out or suppressed in order to protect the surrounding communities. It seemed intuitive to simply continue fighting fires as they arose and leave the forests untouched. So nothing was done to groom the forests, to remove dead and dying trees, to reduce undergrowth, to prevent subsequent conflagrations. 
   What is called ``fuel load'' has grown to astronomic proportions in many of our national forests. Dead and dying trees, which were no longer consumed by fire, lingered while brush began to build up at ground level. Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by natural fire, began to crowd out some of the older growth trees. Forests became crowded and severely fire prone. 
   Anyone who wants to look at that should get a copy of this report. On page 23 of the report it points out how our forests have changed in species composition and forest structure. The first picture taken is the forest in 1909. We see old growth trees; we see them spaced; we see very little vegetation on the ground. That is because there had been these hot, fierce fires in the past. 
   Next is a 1948 photo of that same part of the forest. We see changes. We see changes in the species composition, the structure, as fire had been excluded for many years. 
   In a picture in 1990, the area is totally dense and we cannot see through it. At that time--and most of our forests are like this now--we had an overabundance of vegetation. This stresses the site and predisposes the area to infestation from pests, disease outbreaks, and, of course, catastrophic fire. 
   That is where we are today. 
   It is evident to me that the Forest Service's decade-old policy of fire suppression has failed. It is time to look anew at how we can better manage our forests. 
   In California, for example, fire-intolerant Douglas and white fir have grown underneath old growth ponderosa pine. What 
   is the result? The newer firs, which are not resistant to fire, create potential fuel ladders that permit a fire to reach the top, or what is called the crown, of old growths for the first time. Old growth pine which previously was impervious to fire, since rarely did a fire ever reach all the way up to its crown--with this new fuel ladder, fire threats to old growth pine have become very real. 
   Drought periods have further stressed the forests, predisposing them to infestations of pests, disease, and of course severe wildfire. The bark beetle has gone through the Tahoe forests like a forest fire. One can see miles of forests standing dead after an infestation. The dead trees remain, year after year after year. 
   California forests provide homes for dozens of endangered and threatened species, including the marbled murrelet and the spotted owl. It is an understatement to say that today the risk of fire is the most serious threat to these species. I really believe that to be true. It may be the most immediate short-term environmental threat our western forests face. That is why this amendment and this funding is so important. It is imperative that the Forest Service use all available tools to clean up the forests and reduce fire risks. 
   The one-size-fits-all approach of the Forest Service, I believe, must be changed. Each forest is different. Topography is different, geography is different, climate is different, soils are different, vegetation is different, the kind and type of trees are different, in different places throughout the United States. What is proper stewardship for a California forest may not be proper stewardship in Pennsylvania or Alaska or Montana. We have to look at the area and look at the fire risk differently. A flexibility of management must be employed to fix the problem. Dead and dying trees should be removed. Overgrowth should be thinned. Mechanical treatment and controlled burns must each be used separately and carefully in conjunction with each other. If we don't do this, incidents of serious fire will only continue to increase. 
   As I said, it is only a matter of time before a cataclysmic fire strikes Lake Tahoe, with potential loss of life, habitat, and property. Already, run-off and problems associated with erosion have  threatened Lake Tahoe's world-renowned crystal blue waters. The last time I was there, scientists told me that if we don't reverse the trend of eutrophication of the water, which removes its clear crystal blue look, in 10 years it will be too late and we might as well not bother. A serious fire could make this happen even sooner. 
   This amendment helps provide funding to remove dead and dying trees from Lake Tahoe National Forest where almost one-third of that forest today is dead or dying. 
   Last year, Senators REID, BOXER, BRYAN, and Congressman Doolittle, Congressman Gibbons, and I introduced the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act to authorize the necessary funding to deal with this problem. It is very timely that this bill will be marked up by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Thursday and has already been marked up at the subcommittee level in the House. 
   The Domenici-Feinstein amendment could be used in that forest. It could almost be used in the Quincy area. In 1998, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Quincy Library Group Project. 
   This legislation authorized a 5-year demonstration project based on the forest management plan assembled by the Quincy Library Group, a coalition of local environmentalists, public officials, timber industry representatives, and just plain concerned citizens who came together in the Quincy Library so they could not yell at each other, to resolve longstanding conflicts over timber management of national forests in the area. 
   The project, which is only a pilot, is to see if there is not a better way to manage our forests by combining strategic fuel breaks with selected mechanical thinning and controlled burn. I have had some disagreements with the Forest Service in the past over Quincy, but I believe the project is back on track and I am determined to see, if I can, that funding is appropriated to complete the project to the letter of the law. 
   I want to quickly speak about one other thing. One of the possibly most cataclysmic fires could occur in the newly designated Sequoia National Monument. This is about 366,000 acres. Once the monument was declared, two timber mills closed down. I have been working with the community in that area to be able to put forward a removal of hazardous fuels. These trees are the largest trees in the world. Around these large trees have built up this dense underbrush, this fuel load that I have spoken about. If this is not removed, this underbrush creates the kind of fuel ladder that can effectively destroy the Sequoias. 
   The State of California additionally has prepared an adaptive management plan and had been working in the Sequoia area. What they showed was, as you clear certain limited areas around the giant Sequoias, that the giant Sequoias actually grew bigger and grew fatter and were much healthier for it. It is my hope that over the next few years we can reduce the fuel loading on 24 million acres that the Forest Service has identified as being at this level 3. Level 3 is the most significant fire threat. Then focus on the other 18 million acres at jeopardy. 
   Let me just recount. One-third of all of the national forests at catastrophic fire level in the United States are in the State of California. It is the entire Sierra Nevada range, it is the Sequoia, it is part of the Plumas and Lassen National Forests, and of course the Tahoe National Forest. There is, indeed, a lot to be done if we are not only to protect our endangered species but also protect the property and the people who live in these areas as well. 
   I think Senator DOMENICI's legislation is timely. It is well thought out. I think making this an emergency and moving in the class 3 areas and being able to remove this underbrush is a major step forward in prudent forestry management all throughout the West. 
   I thank the Senator. It was a delight to work with him. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation designed to eliminate injuries and deaths that result from crib accidents. 
   While there are strict guidelines on the manufacture and sale of new cribs, there are still 25 to 30 million unsafe cribs sold throughout the U.S. in ``secondary markets,'' such as thrift stores and resale furniture stores. These cribs should be taken off the market, and either made safe, or destroyed. 
   There are a number of reasons why unsafe cribs should be taken off the market: 
   Each year, at least 45 children die from injuries sustained in cribs. That is almost one child a week. 
   The number of deaths from crib incidents exceeds deaths from all other nursery products combined. 
   Over 9,000 children are hospitalized each year as a result of injuries sustained in cribs. 
   To illustrate the need for this legislation, I want to share with you the story of Danny Lineweaver. 
   At the age of 23 months, Danny was injured during an attempt to climb out of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the cornerpost of his crib and hanged himself. 
   Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, Danny lived in a semi-comatose state for nine years and died in 1993. This injury and subsequent death could have been prevented. 
   Since Danny's accident, we have passed laws mandating safety standards for the manufacture of new cribs. But this is not enough. 
   There are nearly four million infants born in this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. As many as half of all infants are placed in secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs--cribs that are sold in thrift stores or resale furniture stores. These cribs may be unsafe, and may in fact threaten the life of the infants placed in them. 
   This legislation requires thrift stores and retail furniture stores to remove decorative knobs on the cornerposts of cribs before selling those cribs. 
   Additionally, the bill prohibits hotels and motels from providing unsafe cribs to guests, or risk being fined up to $1,000. 
   The Infant Crib Safety Act makes the sale of used, unsafe cribs illegal. I hope my colleagues will join me in putting a stop to preventable injuries and deaths resulting from unsafe cribs.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Rebecca Ryan, who recently retired after more than twenty years of teaching in the South San Francisco Unified School District. Ms. Ryan is a shining example of what a dedicated teacher can do. 
   Becky Ryan began her teaching career in 1972 in the South San Francisco Unified School District. After 28 years, she is ending a career that has been filled with many accomplishments. 
   With over twenty years of experience teaching English as a Second Language Classes, Becky recognized that many immigrant parents, because of their inability to speak English, were reluctant to become involved in their children's education. This lack of parental involvement was detrimental to the children, and led her to found the Spruce Literacy Project at Spruce Elementary School in South San Francisco. This unique program teaches immigrant parents, mostly mothers, how to read, write, and speak English. With a better understanding of the English language, parents are able to more fully participate not only in their children's education, but also in their local communities. 
   The profound effect the Spruce Literacy Project has had was most evident last year, when the mothers she taught banded together to oppose funding cuts to the program. Becky has been praised for her can do spirit and her encouragement of students. 
   She has truly made a lasting impact on her students. She has spent her career helping to open doors to those who would have otherwise found them closed. A good teacher affects many lives, and the greatest compliment I can give to Rebecca Ryan is that she helped so many students become productive and successful citizens. 
   Mr. President, I ask that an article from the Friday, June 9 edition of the San Mateo County Times on Ms. Ryan's retirement be reprinted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD following my statement.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today to designate the Santa Rosa/San Jacinto mountain range in southern California as a National Monument. This bill was introduced by Congresswoman MARY BONO earlier in the year. An almost identical version of this bill was passed out of the House Resources Committee earlier in the week. 
   The Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains contain nationally significant biological, cultural, recreational, geological, educational, and scientific values. This includes magnificent vistas, unique wildlife and mountains which rise from the desert floor to an elevation of almost eleven thousand feet. These mountains provide a picturesque backdrop for Coachella Valley communities and support a wide array of recreational opportunities. 
   The bill designates this environmentally sensitive area as a monument and instructs the Department of Interior and the Forest Service to craft a management plan. The bill protects the rights of individual land owners, Native American tribes, and all lands outside the monument boundary. It protects the environment and preserves property rights. The bill has bipartisan support and supported by most of the local community. 
   This bill is quite timely. Three hundred and fifty-five thousand acres of the Sequoia National Forest were designated a national monument by President Clinton on April 15. Over the sixty-day period preceding the designation, many members of the affected community expressed significant opposition to the monument designation. I came to believe that when possible, Congress is in the best position to decide monument and other land use designations and can best ensure that stakeholders affected by such a designation have ample opportunity to provide input, influence the process and understand the designation. 
   I believe this bill is the proper way to protect this majestic national resource.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming. This amendment would prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from issuing ergonomic standards to protect workers from back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and other work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) 
   MSDs caused by ergonomic hazards are the most widespread safety and health problem in the workplace today. Every year 1.8 million workers suffer as a result of work-related MSDs bone or muscle disorders and one-third of those workers lose work time as result of these disorders. 
   These injuries are a burden on workers, and they are a burden on the economy. These injuries result in $20 billion per year in workers' compensation claims. OSHAs proposed ergonomic regulations would cut in half the cost of workers' compensation claims. 
   Ergonomic programs have slashed costs for businesses throughout California. 
   In 1997, Sun Microsystems average MSD disability claim dropped to $3,500, from $55,000, in 1993. 
   The Vale Health Care Center, in San Pablo, California, reduced the number of back injuries from ten per year to one per year. 
   The Fresno Bee, three years after establishing an ergonomics program, reduced workers' compensation costs by over 95 percent, and associated lost workdays and surgeries were eliminated. 
   Xandex, in Pentaluma, California; Silicon Graphics, in Mountain View, California; Rohm and Haas, in Hayward, Califoria; Blue Cross of California; Varin Associates, a California electronics manufacturing business, the city of San Jose, Pacific Bell, FMC Defense Systems Corporation, AT&T Global Information Systems, in San Diego, and Intel, in Santa Clara, California, have all implemented successful ergonomics programs. 
   Ergonomic standards have been studied ad nauseam. 
   There are more than 2,000 published studies on MSDs, and the scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ergonomics programs can and do reduce MSDs. 
   In 1991, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole believed there was sufficient scientific evidence that ergonomic injuries were a major problem in the workplace, and she committed the Labor Department to address the issue. 
   In 1991, Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin committed the Department of Labor to develop and issue a standard using normal rule-making procedures. 
   In 1998, at the request of the Representatives Livingston and BONILLA, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) received a $490,000 grant to conduct a literature review of MSDs. Later in 1998, NAS released its findings. It concluded that ``research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rates of musculoskeletal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' In other words, workplace ergonomic factors cause MSDs, but specific interventions can reduce the number of cases. 
   Congress then appropriated another $890,000 for another NAS literature review on workplace-related MSDs. This study will be completed early next year. 
   If the results are the same as the previous study, and I assume they will be, we should not prevent the Department of Labor from issuing ergonomic standards. 
   Ergonomic programs have proven to be effective in reducing motion injuries and other MSDs, and suggest that OSHA must be permitted to go forward with sensible regulations to ensure a safe workplace.  
   The problem is real, but it is a problem we can fix, and we can save businesses billions of dollars in workers' compensation claims by doing so. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to help improve workplace safety by joining me in opposing this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the bill the Senate is considering today addresses some of the nation's most pressing problems and is very important to my state, the largest state in the nation, with a population of 34 million people. 
   California's schools face huge challenges--low test scores, crowded classrooms, teacher shortages, booming enrollments, decrepit buildings. 
   California has 5.8 million students, more students than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the US. 
   California has 40 percent of the nation's immigrants; we have 50 languages in some schools. 
   Many of California's students have low test scores and are taught by uncredentialed teachers. 
   At the college level, the University of California has the most diverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 percent of all student financial aid funding that UC students received. Our colleges and universities are facing ``Tidal Wave II,'' the demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will inundate California's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 because the number of high school graduates will jump by 30 percent. 
   Our needs are huge. 
   I am pleased that the bill before us increases education by $4.6 billion over last year. The federal share of elementary-secondary education funding has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in 1999. 
   Devoting more resources to education is critical in my state. On May 17, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit against the California Department of Education charging that many of our students do not have the bare essentials for getting an education, basics like textbooks, school supplies, libraries, computers, and credentialed teachers. In some classes, there are not enough seats or desks, the air conditioning and heating systems are broken and the roofs leak. I do not know what the outcome of this suit will be, but it is certainly a sad commentary on the state of our schools. 
   Clearly, we need to do more and this bill makes a start. 
   The bill increases the Title I program, the program for disadvantaged students, by $278 million. I am grateful that the committee included two of my requests relating to what is called the ``hold harmless'' provision. 
   In 1994, Congress put in the law a requirement that the Department of Education annually update the number of poor children so that the allocation of funds would truly reflect the most recent count of poor children. This is a very important provision to growing states like mine. However, despite my opposition, the hold harmless provision has been included in the last three annual appropriations bills and this bill today, effectively overriding the census update requirement and locking in historic funding amounts for states despite the change in the number of poor children. 
   Secretary Riley said--I whole-heartedly agree--that ``a basic principle in targeting should be to drive funds to where the poor children are, not to where they were a decade ago.'' Because of the hold harmless, my state has lost over $120 million since 1998 and I am disappointed that my efforts to totally eliminate it were not successful. Nevertheless, I appreciate the inclusion of two provisions:

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment sponsored by Senator CHAFEE from Rhode Island. This amendment expresses the sense that the United States should support bilateral and multilateral debt relief for the world's poorest countries with unsustainable debts, and provide the funding for bilateral and multilateral debt relief the Clinton administration has requested. 
   Last year, United States and other industrialized countries agreed to provide $27 billion in debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries that adopt sound economic policies and use the savings for health, education, and poverty reduction efforts, and the Clinton administration pledged to pay four percent of the total. The $435 million the administration requested for Fiscal Year 2001 is a down-payment on our $920 million pledge. 
   The countries that will benefit are classified by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), which means they have unsustainable debts and are extremely poor. 
   In these countries: 
   One in ten children dies before his or her first birthday; 
   One in three children is malnourished; 
   More than half of all citizens live on less than $1 per day; and 
   HIV infection rates are as high as 20 percent. 
   More than two out of three of these countries spend more on debt service than health care. 
   Every dollar in debt payments these countries make to the United States and other creditors is one fewer dollar to spend on education, health care, and other basic needs. 
   Many of these countries, including Zambia, Uganda, Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique, and Tanzania, to name but a few, are in the midst of a HIV/AIDS pandemic. Every dollar in debt payments these countries make is one fewer dollar to spend on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs. 
   This debt relief proposal will not solve every problem in these countries, but it will help. Bolivia, our democratic ally, began receiving debt relief in 1997. In 1999, Bolivia saved $77 million in debt service as a result of debt relief provided by multilateral institutions. Most of the savings went to increased spending on health care and education. 
   Uganda has also received multilateral debt relief. Uganda saved $45 million in debt service payments in 1999, and it increased spending on poverty reduction programs, primary education, and primary health care by $55 million. Since 1997, the primary school enrollment rate has increased by 50 percent. 
   Uganda is not the only country in desperate need of debt relief in Africa. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund list 33 countries in Africa as HIPCs, meaning they are extremely poor and have unsustainable debts. 
   As Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University, wrote in The Washington Post, on May 23, 2000, in regard to malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis,  
   Debt cancellation for Africa has come down to a matter of life and death. African leaders know very well that for their own countries to muster the internal resources to fight these dread diseases, they will have to be permitted by the creditor nations to shift the funds now spent on debt servicing into public health.  
   We must provide debt relief to accountable governments, not to dictatorial regimes that waste funds on the military and violate human rights. 
   This amendment urges the Senate to fund multilateral debt relief efforts carried out by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for countries that use the funds transparently, allow participation by civil society, do not grossly violate human rights, and do not spend excessively on the military. 
   Debt relief will allow Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, which use up to 60 percent of their budgets for debt service on loans made by the United States and other industrialized countries to dictators during the Cold War, to use these precious resources to meet basic needs. 
   The debt burden condemns these countries to poverty. Relieving the burden from these debts will give these countries a chance to develop. Relieving debts that can never be repaid is the humane thing to do. 
   The Clinton administration has requested $435 million for this initiative to help the world's poorest people. The United States has committed to this multinational debt relief plan, and we should live up to our commitment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support funding for debt relief for the world's poorest people. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the long-in-coming supplemental appropriations request for Colombia included as part of this Foreign Operations bill. I believe that there are few requests more important to the security and well-being of this nation in the coming years than this one. 
   I believe that it is critical that we move quickly to pass the Foreign Operations bill and this emergency supplemental request for Colombia. 
   Some have argued that the Colombia proposal is simply too expensive. But I believe that this proposal represents the proper balance regarding what should--in fact must--be one of this nation's highest priorities: to stop the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States. 
   As we debate this proposal today, Colombia faces an unprecedented crisis. 
   Almost 40 percent of the country--an area itself the size of the entire nation of Switzerland--is under the control of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, FARC. The FARC is an alliance of some 20,000 drug traffickers and terrorists who threaten the stability not only of Colombia, but of the entire Andean region. And, as we all know, there are right-wing paramilitary groups in Colombia who also have ties to the drug trade. 
   Over 80 percent of the world's supply of cocaine is grown, produced or transported through Colombia, and large swaths of Colombia, now lawless or under FARC or paramilitary control, have become prime coca and opium producing zones. 
   These FARC rebels earn as much as two or even three million dollars per day from drug cultivators and traffickers who rely on their protection or--perhaps even more likely--who fear their retribution. 
   The FARC is currently holding hostage as many as 1,500 to 2,500 people, including at least 250 military prisoners and 250 police officers. 
   And, as the ability of the government of Colombia to govern large areas of their own country continues to disintegrate, the FARC narco-terrorists and paramilitaries continue to expand their base of operations and attack surrounding areas. 
   All this, and Colombia is facing its worst economic recession in more than 70 years: Real GDP fell by over 3 percent last year. Clearly, something needs to be done. And clearly, Colombia will need help. 
   The situation in Colombia is not simply a problem in a far away land. The events taking place in Colombia have direct and severe repercussions for the United States and the rest of the world. 
   Colombia is the source country for 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States each year, and up to 70 percent of the heroin.  
   And the situation is getting worse, not better. Coca cultivation in Colombia has doubled in the past decade alone, and shows no sign of slowing. 
   In addition to undermining the democratic institutions in Colombia, the violence that has become endemic has forced over 500,000 people to flee Colombia; 65,000 have sought refuge in the United States. 
   According to the administration, illegal drugs account for over 50,000 deaths each year in the United States, and cost over $100 billion a year in health care costs, accidents, and lost productivity. So the problem of narcotics production in Colombia is not just a problem in Colombia: To the flow of drugs from Colombia has very real, and very damaging effects, on our country. 
   Earlier this year, I joined many of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee as we met with Colombia's President, Andres Pastrana. President Pastrana outlined a clear and comprehensive plan to address the drug trade, and to start solving the deeper problems within his country. 
   It is an ambitious plan, but one which I believe can be implemented, and can promote the peace process, strengthen democracy, and help revive Colombia's economy. 
   The Plan Colombia encompasses far more than the request we have before us. A combination of internal and external sources will be providing Colombia with most of the $7.5 billion over three years that President Pastrana has deemed necessary. 
   The United States need provide but a piece of the overall plan. Working with President Pastrana, President Clinton has asked Congress to fund $1.6 billion of that total. The two-year package will assist Colombia in combating the drug trade; help the country promote peace and prosperity; and deepen its democracy. This is a large package, but it is in our interest to provide it. 
   Without a major new effort, supported by the United States, the Colombian military and police simply lack the resources and ability to defeat the FARC and narco-trafficking forces. 
   Plan Colombia is focused on efforts to boost Colombia's interdiction and eradication capabilities, particularly in the south, including: 
   Funds for special counter-narcotics battalions to push into coca-growing regions of Southern Colombia; 
   Funds to purchase helicopters, desperately needed to provide the Colombian National Police access to the remote and undeveloped regions of the country where the narco-traffickers thrive; 
   Funds to upgrade Colombia's interdiction capabilities, with aircraft and airfield upgrades, radar, and improved intelligence gathering; 
   Funds for equipment to be used in increased eradication efforts; 
   Funds to provide economic alternatives to coca growers; and, 
   Funds for new programs to promote human rights, help the judicial system and to crack down on money laundering. 
   As many of my colleague are aware, there is some concern about the human rights questions raised by this assistance package. This supplemental request, after all, provides military assistance to an army and a police force which, in the past, has had a less than Steller record on human rights issues. 
   But it is my belief that the Leahy amendment, augmented by specific language that has been added to this legislation in committee, goes a long way towards meeting these concerns. 
   To begin with, any U.S. assistance to Colombian military and police forces will be provided in strict accordance with section 563 of the FY2000 Foreign Operations Act--the Leahy amendment. 
   In addition, this legislation contains new and specific provisions intended to guarantee the protection of human rights. Colombian military officers accused of human rights violations are to be tried in a civilian court, for example, not in the military courts which have, in the past, been far too lenient in how they treat these cases. There are also requirements that any Colombian military units trained by the United States as part of this antinarcotics effort be screened for human rights abuses. 
   In addition, the committee has also included language at my request relating to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the regions which, I believe, has greatly contributed to the culture of violence and lawlessness in Colombia. 
   I believe that any effective strategy to stabilize the region and reduce the influence of the criminals, drug traffickers, narco-terrorists, and paramilitaries must include the implementation of stringent controls on existing stockpiles and the destruction of surplus and seized stocks of small arms and light weapons. 
   The small arms and light weapons language calls for the creation of a serial number registry by the Department of State and by Colombia to track all small arms and light weapons provided to Colombia under this supplemental request, as well as the creation of a small arms and light weapons destruction initiative for the region. If any of the small arms and light weapons the United States supplies to Colombia as part of this assistance package are used in violation of human rights, this registry will allow us to track, to the unit, who was using these weapons and bring the responsible party to justice. 
   On the question of human rights then, I believe that although we must remain watchful, the package crafted by the Appropriations Committee does a good job in meeting the concerns that have been raised. 
   Let me take a minute here, however, to express my concern about one specific part of the committee recommendations that I hope is addressed in conference: The lack of Blackhawk helicopters. 
   The President asked for $388 million to fund 30 additional Blackhawk helicopters. 
   These helicopters fly faster, farther, higher and hold more people than the Huey II helicopters provided for by the committee. 
   In fact, I believe that the Blackhawk is critical to the terrain and mission in Colombia for several reasons: 
   The Blackhawk can carry three times as many men as the Huey II; at high altitudes the advantage of the Blackhawk is even more pronounced; and the Blackhawk's maximum speed is 50 percent faster than the Huey II. 
   I believe that the drug war is a serious one, and that we should be devoting the best possible resources to this ongoing struggle. 
   I am not a helicopter expert, but the experts in the administration and elsewhere are telling us that the Blackhawk is the right equipment for the job. I do not think we should be second-guessing that decision with so much at stake. 
   Let me also talk for a moment today about one other aspect of this assistance package for Colombia that has come under some discussions: The issue of demand reduction versus supply reduction. 
   Let me say that I strongly believe that even as we provide the resources necessary to implement Plan Colombia that we must also attack the demand side of the drug problem in this country with a multi-pronged, concerted effort. 
   I support funding for domestic prevention and demand reduction programs, and I believe we must continue to provide domestic law enforcement with the tools they need to combat the drug trade within our borders. 
   But much of the demand-side, domestic effort can be accomplished by state and local governments. 
   What state and local governments cannot do is to keep drugs from entering this country in the first place. That task can only be accomplished by the federal government, which has control over our borders and over foreign policy. 
   In fact, of the $18 billion in the Federal Government's counterdrug funding, 32 percent goes to domestic demand reduction, 49 percent to domestic law enforcement; 10 percent to interdiction along our borders; and only 3.2 percent to international counterdrug efforts. 
   Less than 4 percent for the one area that is clearly and unambiguously the one area in this fight that is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. 
   Even with passage of this package of assistance to Colombia this figure will still be well under 10 percent. 
   So I say to my colleagues who believe more effort needs to be directed to domestic programs to address demand that they are right. More effort in this  area is needed. Our states should do more. Our cities should do more. But clearly more effort supporting our friends and allies in international efforts to curtail production, refinement, and transportation are needed too. And that is the one area where only the Federal government can act. 
   Only with assistance from the United States will the Government of Colombia be able to eradicate and intercept the tons of illegal narcotics that leave that country each year bound for our shores. 
   The ongoing narco-crisis in Colombia and the overall crisis of drugs in America represent an important threat to our nation's security and stability. The war against drugs is real, and should be treated with the same seriousness of purpose and resources as any other war. 
   The funding provided for the Colombia supplemental request in the Foreign Operations bill, although expensive, is clearly within our national interest. We face a crisis in this nation, and that crisis demands action. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Colombia package in the Foreign Operations bill, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the FY 2001 Department of Defense authorization bill, I want to add my support for the amendment offered by Senators MURRAY and SNOWE to repeal the provision of current law that prohibits the use of DOD facilities for abortion services. This prohibition is particularly harsh for women who serve their country overseas. 
   Current law has two bans: (1) a ban on the use of any DOD funds to perform abortions, except if the life of the mother is endangered; and (2) a ban on using DOD facilities to perform an abortion except if the life of the mother were endangered or in the case of rape or incest. The Murray-Snowe amendment would repeal the second ban, on using a DOD facility to perform an abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered or in the case of rape or incest. 
   This amendment does not force DOD to pay for abortions. It simply repeals the current ban on using DOD medical facilities. This ban works a particular hardship on military women stationed overseas because if they cannot use DOD facilities, they are forced to find private facilities, which may be unfamiliar, substandard, or far away. 
   I support this amendment for several reasons. 
   First, under several Supreme Court decisions, a woman clearly has a right to choose. A woman does not give up that right because she serves in the U.S. military or is married to someone serving in the military. Barring the use of U.S. military facilities creates a particular difficult barrier to exercising that constitutionally protected right when serving in another country. 
   Second, this prohibition in current law can endanger a woman's health, if she has to travel a long distance or wait to find an appropriate facility or physician. Women may not have ready access to private facilities in other countries. A woman stationed in that country or the wife of a service member might need to fly to the U.S. or to another country--at her own expense--to obtain an abortion because some countries have very restrictive laws on abortion. Most service members cannot 
   easily bear the expense of jetting off across the globe for medical treatment. 
   If women do not have access to military facilities or to private facilities in the country where they are stationed, they could endanger their own health because of delay and the time it takes to get to a facility in another country or by being forced to get treatment by someone other than a licensed physician. 
   We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion is illegal, some women--especially desperate young women--resort to unsafe and life-threatening methods. If it were your wife, or your daughter, would you want her in the hands of an untrained, unknown person on the back streets of Seoul, South Korea? Or would you prefer that she be treated by a trained physician in a U.S. military facility? Under the current prohibition, women could put themselves at great risk by the hurdles required, by the possibility of using an untrained, unlicensed person and sometimes by a lack of knowledge of the seriousness of their condition. 
   People who serve our country agree to put their lives at risk to defend their country. They do not agree to put their health at risk with unknown medical facilities that may not meet U.S. standards. With this ban, we are asking these women to risk their lives doublefold. 
   Current law does not force any military physician to perform an abortion against his or her will. All branches have a ``conscience clause'' that permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the procedure. What we are talking about today is providing equal access to U.S. military medical facilities, wherever they are located, for a legal procedure paid for with one's own money. 
   The Department of Defense supports this amendment. A May 7 letter from Dr. Sue Bailey, the Assistant Secretary of Defense says the following:  
   The Department believes it is unfair for female service members, particularly those members assigned to overseas locations, to be denied their Constitutional right to the full range of reproductive health care, to include abortions. The availability of quality reproductive health care ought to be available to all female members of the military.  
   Abortion is legal for American women. To deny American military women access to medical treatment they can trust is wrong. I urge my colleagues to vote the Murray-Snowe amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to say I believe the time has come to adopt the Kennedy legislation. In effect, the study has been done. We know that since the early 1990s, there have been 60,000 hate crimes in this country. We know that young men such as Matthew Shepard, just because they are gay, can be beaten until they are killed. We know that a U.S. postal worker can be shot and killed simply because he happens to be a Filipino American. We see people targeted for specific crimes. 
   I authored the original hate crimes legislation in 1993. It had two loopholes: It excluded sex and sexual orientation. This legislation corrects it, and it only applies in pursuance of a Federal right. This legislation extends that. I urge its adoption. I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, no one should be victimized because of his or her skin color, national origin, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   In furtherance of this belief, I sponsored in 1993 the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act, which required the U.S. Sentencing Commission to provide sentencing enhancements of no less than three offense levels for crimes determined beyond a reasonable doubt to be hate crimes. The Act increased the penalties for hate crimes directed at individuals not only because of their perceived race, color, religion, and national origin, but also on account of their gender, disability or sexual orientation. 
   Today, I am proud to be the cosponsor of the Kennedy hate crimes amendment, which would build on this effort by expanding the Justice Department's authority to prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on the victim's race, color, religion or national origin. 
   This important amendment would also allow the Federal government to provide assistance in state investigations of crimes against another based on the victim's gender, disability, or sexual orientation. 
   Sadly, hate crimes occur more often than we might think. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, there have been nearly 60,000 hate crime incidents reported since 1991. In 1998 alone, the last year for which we have statistics, nearly 8,000 hate crime incidents were reported in the United States. That is almost one such crime per hour. 
   In the same year, more than 2,100 Californians fell victim to a hate crime. That's a shocking number when one considers the motivation behind a hate crime. These are truly among the ugliest of crimes, in which the perpetrator thinks the victim is less of a human being because of his or her gender, skin color, religion, sexual orientation or disability. 
   Even more disturbing is that nearly two-thirds of these crimes are committed by our nation's youth and young adults. The need to send a strong message of mutual tolerance and respect to our youngsters has become all too clear in recent years. 
   One of the most high profile hate crime cases in California involved two young Northern California men, Benjamin Matthew Williams, age 31, and his younger brother James Tyler Williams, age 29. The two brothers became poster boys for our Nation's summer of hate last year. Both men were charged with the double slaying of a prominent gay couple who lived about 180 miles north of Sacramento. 
   The men are also prime suspects in the wave of arson that hit three Sacramento-area synagogues two weeks before the killings, causing more than $1 million in damage. When investigators searched the Williams brothers' home, they found a treasure trove of white-supremacist, anti-gay, anti-Semitic literature. They also found a ``hit list'' of 32 prominent Jewish and civic leaders in the Sacramento area, apparently compiled after the synagogue fires. 
   Hate crimes not only affect the victim who is targeted, but also shakes the foundation of an entire community that identifies with the victim. I grow increasingly concerned when I hear reports about the proliferation of hate in our nation, because California, the state I represent, has one of the most diverse communities in the world. 
   Our state has greatly benefitted from the contributions of persons from countries as nearby as Mexico and El Salvador, and as far away as India and Ethiopia. It is only through our willingness to live among each other and to respect our individual differences and gifts, that we can continue to build from the strength of our diversity. 
   That is why Senator KENNEDY's amendment is so important. Not only would it broaden the protection offered by Federal law to people not covered by hate crime legislation, but it will provide vital Federal assistance and training grants to states investigating these crimes. 
   Specifically, this legislation would compensate for two limitations in the current law: First, even in the most blatant cases of racial, ethnic, or religious violence, no Federal jurisdiction exists unless the victim was targeted while exercising one of a limited number of federally protected activities. Second, current law provides no coverage for violent hate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
   Unfortunately, there are those who would stop short of supporting this legislation because it extends protections to those targeted on account of their sexual orientation. This is especially disturbing given the fact that crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked third in reported hate crimes in 1998, registering 1,260 or 15.6 percent of all reported incidents. Even in light of the growing number and severity of these horrific events, Congress has not seen fit to enact important Federal hate crime measures to ensure that justice is served. 
   I wonder, how many cases go unsolved because of the Federal government's inability to participate in the investigation and prosecution of a hate crime? 
   How many people have chosen not to report a serious hate crime out of fear of retribution because there is no state or federal protection? 
   How many more people, and families, and communities, need to be victimized by these most horrendous acts before our colleagues realize that now is time to act? 
   Since those who commit hate crimes seek out a category of people, rather than a particular individual, anyone of us at anytime can become a victim of a hate crime. I believe the Kennedy hate crimes amendment would send the right message: that those who commit violent acts because the victim is of a certain gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, or disability will be prosecuted because everyone--I repeat--everyone has a right to be free from violence and fear when they are going to school, work, travel, or doing something as simple as going to a movie. 
   While I rise in strong support for the Kennedy amendment, I must also express my opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Utah, Mr. HATCH. While well-intentioned, the Hatch amendment would not extend protection to people targeted because of their sexual orientation, gender or disability in states that have not enacted hate crime laws or have limited their laws to crimes motivated by race, national origin or religion. 
   Moreover, the Hatch amendment would permit the Federal government to address hate crimes only in those very limited circumstances in which the offender crosses a state line to commit an act of hate violence. This amendment would, therefore, fail to address the majority of cases we confront today in which a hate crime results in death or serious bodily harm. 
   As elected leaders, it is incumbent upon us to set an example--not just by expressing outrage about these crimes--but by strengthening legislation and bolstering the ability of law enforcement--whether state or Federal--to combat hate crimes. 
   How many more people will become victims of hate before we act? I believe the time has come to affirm our support for the diversity that makes our nation so great. The time has come to enact a sensible hate crime measure to address this problem of violent bigotry and hate. The time has come to enact the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from California, Senator BARBARA BOXER, in commending and congratulating the Los Angeles Lakers for their outstanding season which was culminated last night in winning the 2000 National Basketball Association Championship. 
   Without a doubt, the Los Angeles Lakers are one of the finest franchises in the history of professional sports. In defeating a gritty and hard-nosed Indiana Pacers team last night, the Lakers captured their twelfth NBA Championship in the true spirit of their ``Showtime'' years. 
   The Los Angeles Lakers are a true sporting dynasty. They are the second winningest team in NBA history. Their record of 67-15, the best regular season record in the NBA's Eastern and Western Conference. 
   Led by coach Phil Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant the Lakers are a formidable opponent. Shaquille O'Neal was named league Most Valuable Player, led the league in scoring and field goal percentage, won the IBM Award for greatest overall contribution to a team, and became just the sixth player in the game's history to be a unanimous selection to the All-NBA First team. 
   Shaquille O'Neal also was named Most Valuable Player of the 2000 All Star game scoring 22 points and collecting 9 rebounds. And he also dominated the 2000 playoffs scoring 38 points per game in the NBA Finals on his way to winning the Most Valuable Player award. 
   Another top player was the 21-year-old phenom, Kobe Bryant, who overcame injuries to average more than 22 points a game in the regular season and be named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. Kobe Bryant's eight point performance in the overtime of game 4 led the Lakers to one of the most dramatic wins in playoff history. 
   Coach Phil Jackson, winner of seven NBA Championship rings and a playoff winning percentage of .718, has proven to be one of the most innovative and adaptable coaches in the NBA. 
   And when you add to this terrific trio and strong supporting cast--including Glenn Rice, A.C. Green, Ron Harper, Robert 
   Horry, Rick Fox, Derrick Fisher, Brian Shaw, Devean George, Tyronn Lue, John Celestand, Travis Knight, and John Salley--the recipe for a championship was written. 
   I also congratulate team owner Dr. Jerry Buss, General Manager Jerry West and all the others who worked so hard to return the championship magic to the City of Angels. But most of all, I would like to congratulate the myriad of Lakers fans who have pulled for this team through it all. 
   The 1999-2000 Los Angeles Lakers will go down in history with those legendary teams of the past. And we can add the names of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryan to the tapestry of Laker greats: George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the incomparable Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson. 
   These Lakers demonstrated immeasurable determination, heart, stamina, and an amazing comeback ability in their drive for the championship. They have made the City of Los Angeles and the State of California proud. 
   The Los Angeles Lakers have started the 21st century meeting the high standards they established in the 20th century. In the years ahead, I have no doubt that this team will add numerous championship banners to the rafters of the Staples Center. 
   Senator BOXER and I thought it would be fitting of offer this resolution today.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to join the Senator from Washington in this debate. I have just listened to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I must say I profoundly differ with them. But let's for a moment say the Senator is correct. Then what is the fear of doing a study to take a look at the safety implications of SUVs and light trucks in single and multicar accidents? If the other side is so sure they are correct, they have nothing to worry about from a study being done. So why the gag order that prevents the Government from looking at this? 
   I submit to you, Mr. President, in direct debate with the Senator, that as fuel economy standards have gone up, fatality rates per million miles traveled have actually decreased. That decrease is rather large. I wish I had a big chart, but you can kind of see it here. These are the fuel economy on-road miles per gallon going up, and here are the fatality rates to the year 2000 actually going down. 
   Second, Ford Motor Company, by 2003, will have on the market a hybrid SUV which will get 40 miles per gallon. And Ford says that its 2003 version of its Escape sports utility vehicle will get twice that of other small SUVs, four times that of big ones. This comes from technology, from a hybrid powerplant, a small gasoline engine coupled to an electric motor. This SUV will get 40 miles to the gallon. Let me read a statement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Board:  
   Collisions between cars and light trucks account for more than one half of all fatalities in crashes between light duty vehicles. More than 60 percent of all fatalities in light vehicle side impacts occur when the striking vehicle is a light truck. SUVs are nearly three times as likely to kill drivers of other vehicles during collisions than are cars.  
   According to a study by the National Crash Analysis Center, an organization funded by both the Government and the auto industry:  
   Occupants of a SUV are just as likely as occupants of a car to die, once the vehicle is involved in an accident.  
   The explanation, of course, is that SUVs have high rollover rates; 62 percent of SUV deaths are in rollover accidents, but only 22 percent of car deaths are in rollover accidents. So you cannot say that the SUV/light truck is a safe vehicle, even as a heavier vehicle. The statistics do not support it. 
   Let me also say that Ford Motor Company itself, which depends on SUVs for much of its profit, has acknowledged that they cause serious safety and environmental problems. Let me quote from the New York Times:  
   In its first corporate citizenship report issued at the company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution, and endangered other motorists. The auto maker said that it would keep building them because they provide needed profit, but would seek technological solutions to the problems and look for alternatives to big vehicles.  
   So here is a major American manufacturer admitting that SUVs are not safer. 
   Let me finally, on this point, quote a GAO report:  
   The unprecedented increase in the proportion of light cars on the road that occurred between 1976 and 1978, and 1986 and 1988, did not have the dire consequences for safety that would be expected if fatality rates were simply a function of car weight. Not only did the total fatality rate decrease, but the fatality rate for small cars, those at the greatest risk, if it is assumed that heavier cars  are inherently safer than lighter cars, also declined sharply.  
   So why be afraid of the study? If those who say safety is a problem are so sure, let's take a good look at it. Let's have unbiased sources take a look at it. 
   The reason I feel so strongly is because I do believe that global warming is a real and vital phenomenon; that it is taking place all across the land, and that the largest single thing we can do to reduce global warming is to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. 
   By putting the same fuel efficiency standards on SUVs and light trucks as are on sedans, we essentially remove 240 million tons of carbon dioxide each year from the atmosphere. 
   This year's House Transportation appropriations bill once again contains the provision which prevents this issue from even being considered. This is the seventh consecutive year this gag order has appeared. Why are they so afraid of a study? 
   If you add to what the Senator from Washington said--and I think he is absolutely correct--that we are witnessing a new phenomenon this year in increasing gasoline prices which have exacerbated our Nation's dependence on OPEC and foreign oil, this policy does not make sense from another viewpoint. It costs the consumer more. Frankly, I am surprised there is this resistance. Since last year's debate, gasoline prices reached $2 per gallon in many parts of my State, and they are approaching $2.50 through much of the Midwest. This should harden our resolve to take a look at the situation. 
   Today, the United States, with only 4 percent of the world's population, consumes 25 percent of the world's energy. Our CO2 emissions from vehicles alone exceed the total CO2 emissions of carbon dioxide from all but three other countries in the world today. 
   My State of California is the third largest consumer of gasoline in the world, behind only the United States and Japan and ahead of virtually every other country. So California has a huge stake in this. We use more gasoline than China, Germany, and Russia. The situation is made worse by this loophole. SUVs and light trucks, which are as much passenger vehicles as station wagons and sedans, are only required today to have 20.7 miles per gallon per fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles. 
   I am an SUV owner. I own three Jeeps. I love my Jeeps, but I do not see why they should not be just as fuel efficient as the sedan we also drive. At today's prices, light truck and SUV owners are spending an additional $25 billion a year at the pump because of this loophole. If SUVs simply achieve the same fuel economy standards as automobiles, consumers would save hundreds of dollars a year and thousands of dollars over the life of a vehicle. 
   As this chart shows, the typical SUV burns about 861 gallons of fuel each year. The average gasoline price, if it is at $1.50 cents a gallon, costs consumers $1,290 a year. At $2, the cost increases to more than $1,700. 
   If we simply close this SUV loophole and require these vehicles to meet the same standards as automobiles, SUVs would burn 213 fewer gallons of gasoline a year. That is a savings of 1 million barrels of oil a year, and it is a savings of 240 million tons of carbon dioxide going into the air. It is also a savings for the consumer of $318 each year. At $2, the savings is $420 a year. The real clincher is the pollution argument, and that is, the savings of 240 million tons of CO2 from going into the air and creating a greenhouse effect that warms the Earth. 
   We also know that raising CAFE standards is the quickest and most single effective step we can take in this direction. I happen to believe global warming is real. I took a day and went to the Scripts Institute of Oceanography in San Diego and had a briefing. What I heard there doubly convinced me it is a real phenomenon. 
   The weather is getting hotter, and the ten hottest years on 
   record have all occurred since 1986; 1980 to 1999 was the hottest 20-year period ever recorded, and 1998 was the hottest year in recorded history. Yesterday the temperature in San Francisco, a usually very cold city, was 104 degrees. 
   The Earth's average temperature has risen 1.3 degrees in the last 100 years, and computer models predict an increase of 2 to 6 degrees over the next century. Because of our temperate climate, the increase in the United States will be on the high end of that figure; meaning we will gain about 6 degrees in temperature over the next century. 
   What does that mean? That means warmer weather in my State will make water even more scarce. It means it will destroy certain agricultural crops. It means it will lead to more frequent and intense Sierra forest fires and serious flooding at certain times of the year. 
   In normal winters, our water gets stored in snowpacks until the spring when it is needed for drinking and farming, but warmer winters would cause significant amounts of winter precipitation to change from snow to rain, becoming runoff or, worse, floods into low-lying flood-prone areas, such as Sacramento. Drought conditions will worsen in the southern and central valley parts of my State, destroying water-dependent crops, such as rice, cotton, and alfalfa. 
   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sea levels could rise 2 feet over the next century, further flooding low-lying areas, and greatly increasing the penetration of salt water into the California delta, the source of drinking water for 22 million people. 
   That is why I am concerned. It is a legitimate reason to be concerned and it is doubly legitimate if you know something that is doable and can be done with no adverse impact, is, in fact, being done by some manufacturers and foreign manufacturers, and this Congress will not even take a look at what effect it would have on pollution, what effect it would have on safety. It is an ostrich syndrome par excellence. 
   Mr. President, 117 million Americans live in areas where smog makes the air unsafe to breathe. Asthma of children is on the uptake, and roughly half of this air pollution is caused by cars and trucks. 
   If we increase fuel efficiency, we consume less gasoline. This decreases smog and air pollutants. Given all these facts, I cannot figure out why anyone would not want to at least study whether CAFE standards should be updated. For 7 years there has been a gag order: Do not even take a look; both sides are certain. Senators GORTON, BRYAN, and myself on one side; Senators ABRAHAM, LEVIN, and ASHCROFT on another. Let's settle it. Let's take a look. Let's have an independent study. Let's see who is right. It does not bother me to do that. I do not understand why it bothers anyone else. 
   Half of all new vehicles sold in this country are SUVs and light duty trucks, and this is what makes this so compelling. This becomes then a stranglehold on energy efficiency, and it has produced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards because of it. We are polluting the air more because of it. We are contributing to global warming more because of it. 
   The United States saves 3 million barrels of oil each day because of the current fuel efficiency standards. Closing the SUV loophole adds 1 million additional barrels. That is a total savings of 4 million barrels of oil each day. 
   Last year, opponents of our amendment argued that boosting CAFE standards would lead to increased traffic fatalities, layoffs, and higher sticker prices. If our opponents again are so sure of their arguments, what is the harm of allowing the Department of Transportation to study the costs and benefits of higher CAFE standards? 
   Last year, I listened to some of my colleagues cite their concerns again about traffic safety. Based on what we heard today, I believe it is naive to think that bigger cars are simply safer. 
   I was going to buy a bigger car not too long ago. I watched the crash tests. I saw this expensive, heavy sedan crumple up like an accordion. I decided not to buy it; it was not safer. 
   The New York Times recently reported on tests conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to demonstrate the propensity of SUVs to roll over. Here is a particularly poignant quote from the article:  
   Because it is taller, heavier and more rigid than a car, an SUV or pickup is more than twice as likely to kill the driver of the other vehicle in a collision. Yet partly because these so-called light trucks roll over so often, their occupants have roughly the same chance of dying in a crash.   
   So not only is an SUV driver more apt to kill someone else, but that same driver is not any safer. I think this should be disturbing to anyone who gets into any moving vehicle. 
   With regard to job losses in the domestic auto industry, opponents of our amendment fail to offer any empirical evidence. A recent study by the nonpartisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy concludes that the consumer savings at the pump would actually translate to a net increase of 244,000 jobs nationwide, with 47,000 of these new jobs occurring in the auto industry. Let me repeat: The projections are, it will not mean a loss of jobs; it will mean a gain of jobs. And that gain of jobs has translated into a net increase of 244,000 jobs nationwide and 47,000 in the auto industry. 
   I remember when automakers told us they could not make cars safer; they could not meet the original CAFE standards; they could not add seatbelts or catalytic converters; But they did. They said regulations and mandates would drive them out of business, but they did not. 
   These same arguments have been recycled for decades. 
   In 1974, a representative for Ford Motor Company testified in front of Congress that the implementation of CAFE standards would lead to a fleet of nothing but sub-Pinto-sized automobiles. Of course, that did not happen. Our Nation's fleet of vehicles are as diverse as ever and probably more diverse. The largest sedans and station wagons today get far better fuel economy than the 1974 Pinto. It is really a tribute both to the industry and to that industry's ingenuity. It is also a tribute to the CAFE or fuel efficiency program. 
   One of the reasons that, for a while, the American automobile manufacturers lost their cutting edge in the 1970s was their reluctance to do the research and development necessary to build innovative new vehicles. But I am very proud to say that today's car companies are far more efficient and 
   innovative and have the technology to increase the fuel economy of light duty trucks and SUVs to much higher levels than achieved by today's automobiles. 
   I am disappointed that the automotive companies continue lobbying for this gag order. To me, it is like pushing things back into the 1970s, where the Japanese made all the advances, and the American industry refused to change its models, to move with the times, to put in the research and development that is necessary to build a better automobile. I thought those days were behind us. 
   What do we have to lose by allowing the Department of Transportation to simply do their job and determine whether it makes sense to increase CAFE standards? 
   Let me just touch on a couple of the safety fallacies. 
   Again, in fact, vehicle fatality rates have been cut in half since CAFE standards were introduced. I pointed that out in the beginning. Only by stretches of fallacious logic do opponents contrive higher death rates to the CAFE standards. 
   Let me give you some of these fallacies: 
   First, the CAFE standards imply smaller vehicles. 
   The answer: Higher CAFE is achieved by technology improvement, not by downsizing. 
   Secondly, that lighter vehicles imply higher fatalities. 
   The answer: Crashworthiness is determined not by size or weight but by design. Today's compacts are safer than large cars of 20 years ago. 
   And finally, unbalanced risk assessment. 
   The answer: Studies based on harm to small-car occupants neglect the risks that larger vehicles impose or inflict on others. 
   So I am hopeful that because of the increase in fuel prices, because of the added cost to the consumer by the gag order, by the fact that every consumer, if this were to come to pass, would save $318, with an average cost of $1.50, and $504 with a higher cost a year, we can clearly make a showing that a study is necessary at this time. 
   I thank the Chair and also the Senator from Washington. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona to require the disclosure of donors to tax-exempt groups who engage in political activities. These groups use an obscure provision of the Tax Code--section 527--to shield the identity of contributors and use the funds to make anonymous attacks on candidates for public office. 
   Section 527 organizations represent the latest attempt to bypass campaign finance laws and pour undisclosed money in the electoral process. There is no official public information about the number of such groups, who their officers are, where the money is coming from, and how it is being spent. 
   Section 527 of the Tax Code was enacted to provide candidates, political parties, and PAC's with special tax treatment. These groups are required to register with the Federal Election Commission and disclose contribution and expenditure information. 
   In recent years, however, the IRS has ruled that organizations which intend to influence the outcome of an election but do not expressly advocate the election of a candidate qualify as a political organization but are not required to file with the FEC. These groups can raise and spend as much money as they want to influence an election, but the public has no information on who or what they are. 
   This is precisely the sort of activity that makes the political process appear corrupt and undemocratic. The American public is becoming increasingly disenchanted and uninterested in electoral process because they feel their voices are being drowned out by soft money donations to political parties. 
   In the case of soft money, however, at least the amount of the contribution and the name of the group or person who is making the donation must be registered with the Federal Election Commission. These groups spend unlimited amounts of money and none of it has to be disclosed. This insidious hijacking of the campaign finance system must be corrected. 
   It is a simple fact that the American public believes that large contributions are made to influence decisions being made in Washington. They are becomingly increasingly cynical of the process and fewer and fewer people are participating in elections. 
   In 1996, voter turnout was 48.8 percent--the lowest level since 1924. Turnout for the 1998 mid-term election was 36 percent--the lowest for a nonpresidential election in 56 years. Congress has a responsibility to take steps to reverse this trend. 
   The first step should be to require the disclosure of contributors to tax-exempt organizations. The Senate must act to close this loophole and we must do it now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. President, the significance of this debate, in my view, is this: The Norwood-Dingell bill--the Daschle amendment here--is a good bill. It would provide coverage for 161 million Americans, as opposed to the 48 million Americans covered by the Republican Senate bill. The beauty of what is happening here today is that if the Senate were to enact this bill, to pass this bill, we would have health care reform in the United States. The bill would go directly to the President, it would be signed, and the job would be done. 
   Instead, the concern of many of us is that this is simply not going to happen. And we have a chance to make it happen today. I contend that no one should go out there and say they are for health care reform and not vote for a bill that has the opportunity to become a reality. That bill is the House-passed Norwood-Dingell bill, and we have that chance today. 
   After the consideration of the bill on the floor last year, I went to California. California has the largest penetration of managed care in the Nation. I called together the CEOs of the big managed care companies and the California Medical Association. We proposed four things to them--four very simple things. One of them was the definition of ``medical necessity.'' 
   The Senator from Tennessee just said: It is important to get the HMOs out of the business of practicing medicine. That is what I tried to do in the debate on the floor when the Senate bill was up--to change the medical necessity provisions to make sure doctors decide what is medically necessary, not insurance companies. 
   So I thought I would go to them and ask them to voluntarily make changes in how medical necessity is determined, in medically necessary drugs and in two other areas. There was a lot of discussion and several meetings. The bottom line is that they are unwilling to change. The bottom line is that they did not come forward with a plan. 
   The bottom line is I believe we are going to be in this situation where Americans are dissatisfied with the level of managed care provided to them by their plans until we pass a basic law. 
   What law could be more basic essentially than Norwood-Dingell? Let's look at what it does. 
   It assures nearby emergency room treatment for emergencies. That is common sense. 
   It provides access to specialists for patients needing specialty care. 
   In my view, that is a no-brainer. If you need it, you should get it. 
   It provides access to drugs not on the plan's formulary, if medically necessary. 
   It provides the ability to stay with your physician at least 90 days or until treatment is complete if a doctor terminates his/her contract with your plan and you require specialized care. 
   It provides coverage of the routine costs of clinical trials. 
   It provides access to a clear internal and external review process for denial of benefits. 
   It holds plans accountable in the event of death or injury. 
   A key issue in this debate and reflected in several parts of the Daschle amendment is who decides: Is it the doctor in consultation with the patient or is it an HMO bureaucrat, a green eyeshade? Under this amendment it is the medical expert who knows the patient and who decides, not the plan. This means that doctors decide which drug works best; doctors decide which treatment is appropriate; doctors decide when specialty care is needed; doctors decide how long someone will stay in the hospital. 
   For example, this amendment requires health plans that have formularies to cover drugs that are not on a plan's formulary, if the doctor believes the non-formulary drugs are medically necessary. It also requires plans to refer patients with a serious or complex illness to a specialist for care. If a patient's condition requires the use of a specialist that is not available through the health plan, this amendment requires that plans cover services, at no additional cost, through a non-participating specialist. Both provisions are essential for persons living with a life-threatening or chronic illness. 
   Restoring medical decision-making to those trained to make medical decisions is at the heart of this debate. Doctor after doctor in my state talks about how their decisions are challenged, countermanded, second-guessed, and undermined by HMOs, to the point that they can hardly practice medicine. 
   Another important provision says that patients can continue treatment with their doctors for at least 90 days if plans have terminated their contract. A plan must continue to cover treatment for pregnancy, life-threatening, degenerative or disabling diseases and diseases that require special medical care over a prolonged period of time with the terminated provider. 
   The amendment also requires plans to cover the routine costs of clinical trials, costs like blood work, physician charges and hospital fees. Clinical trials are research studies of new strategies for prevention, detection and treatment of diseases for which patients volunteer. These trials often involve analyzing new treatments, like promising new drugs, for diseases such as cancer. This provision is needed because a major deterrent to participation in trials is that insurers refuse to cover the day-to-day costs. For example, in the case of cancer, only 3-4 percent of adult cancer patients (40,000 people out of 1.2 million diagnosed) are enrolled in cancer trials. 
   Another provision of the amendment would allow patients to go to the closest emergency room during a medical emergency without having to get a  health plan's permission first. Emergency room staff could stabilize, screen and evaluate 
   patients without fear that plans will refuse to pay the costs. 
   According to the University of California, Los Angeles, Health Insurance Policy Program: ``Californians are confused about where they should turn for help in resolving their problems and most are not satisfied with the resolution of their problems. There is a need for a clear grievance procedure and independent review of health plan decisions to try to prevent adverse health outcomes to the extent possible.'' 
   The Daschle amendment requires plans to have both an internal and external review for benefit denials. The review must be conducted and completed by a medical professional within 14 days or 72 hours in the case of an emergency. For external reviews, the reviewer must have medial expertise and a determination must be made within 21 days after receiving the request for a review. In the case of an emergency, that decision must be made within 72 hours. 
   Senator DASCHLE's amendment would also allow patients to sue health insurance plans in state courts for denials or delays in coverage if the internal and external review process has been exhausted first, unless injury or death has occurred before the completion of the process. Plans complying with an external review decision would not be subject to punitive damages. Additionally, employers who were not involved in a claim decision would be exempt from such legal action. This provision helps patients keep their health plan accountable for the decisions made about their health. 
   Another key issue before us is who is covered. Under this bill, all 161 million insured Americans would be protected. This is a vast improvement over the Senate bill which only covers 48 million Americans. How can we say one group deserves protections and another does not? 
   The words of this Californian provide an accurate and poignant summary of the problem. Kit Costello, president of the California Nurses Association, said:  
   Most Americans see a confusing, expensive, unreliable and often impersonal assembly of medical professionals and institutions. If they see any system at all, it is one devoted to maximizing profits by blocking access, reducing quality and limiting spending ..... all at the expense of the patient........Who's in charge of my care? The average American believes that health insurance companies have too much influence and exert too much control over their own personal care--more than their doctor, hospital, the government or they themselves, sometimes more than all of them combined.  
   Mr. President, people should not have to fight for their health care. They pay for it out of their monthly paycheck. It should be there for them when they need it. 
   Last fall, after the Senate completed consideration of the HMO bill, I convened a group of HMO officials and health care providers in an effort to address some of the complaints we were hearing from patients and doctors in California. They met several times early this year. 
   I asked them to try to reach agreement on at least four issues. 
   One, medical necessity: Include clear language in contracts between plans and providers on medical necessity. I suggested the language like that that I proposed in the Senate which defined ``medically necessary or appropriate'' as ``a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' 
   Two, payment of claims: Because at the time, 50 percent of physicians and 75 percent of California medical groups were reporting serious delays in payments by plans, I asked them to agree on a system for promptly notifying doctors when patients' leave plans and an assurance of prompt payment of claims. 
   Three, low premium rates: According to a 1999 Price Waterhouse Study, California has one of the lowest average per member premium rates per month in the country ($120 monthly) in the commercial managed care marketplace. Of this, doctors receive around $35 for actual patient care. Payments in California are 40% less than those in the rest of the country. Over 75% of medical groups are in serious financial trouble in my state. 
   I suggested that they develop payment rates to providers that are sufficient to cover the benefits provided in an enrollee's contract, rates that thus are actuarially sound. 
   Four, formularies: Finally, physicians were telling me that it is difficult to find out which drugs are and are not on plans' formularies and that it was difficult to get exceptions from formularies for patients when drugs not on the formulary were medically necessary and more effective than those on the formulary. 
   I had hoped they could work out better methods for letting doctors know which drugs are on the plans' formularies and to agree on a uniform method for allowing exceptions to formularies when nonformulary drugs are medically necessary. 
   There were several meetings in January and February. It is now June. Even though there were several constructive discussions, little resolution was reached. 
   And so, without voluntary action by the industry, legislation is all the more necessary. 
   I hope the Senate passes this amendment today and sends it to the President for signature.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join the administration and, particularly the Vice President, in introducing the Social Security Number Protection Act of 2000. 
   This legislation is designed to curb the unregulated sale and purchase of Social Security numbers, which have contributed significantly to a growing range of illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking and other violent crimes. 
   Mr. President, in 1997, I introduced S. 600, the Personal Privacy Information Act, with Senator GRASSLEY after watching in dismay as one of my staff downloaded my own Social Security number off of the Internet in less than three minutes. 
   Nothing much has changed. For a mere $45, one can go online and purchase a person's Social Security number from a whole host of web businesses--no questions asked. 
   Why is it so important to stop the commercial sale of individuals' personal Social Security numbers? Once a criminal has a potential victim's Social Security number, that person becomes extremely vulnerable to having his or her whereabouts tracked and his or her identity stolen. 
   The Social Security number is the Nation's de facto national identifier. It is a key to one's public identity. The Federal Government uses it as a taxpayer identification number, the Medicare number, and as a soldier's serial number. States use the Social Security number as the identification number on drivers' licenses, fishing licenses, and other official records. Banks use it to establish personal identification for credit. The number is requested by telephone companies, gas companies, and even by brokerages when consumers set-up personal accounts. 
   Thus, a criminal who purchases a Social Security number is well on his way to fraudulently obtaining numerous services in the name of an unsuspecting American. 
   Partly due to this unrestricted traffic in Social Security numbers, our country is facing an explosion in identity theft crimes. The Social Security Administration recently reported that it had received more than 30,000 complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers, last year, most of which had to do with identity theft. This is an increase of 350% from 1997, when there were 7,868 complaints. In total, Treasury Department officials estimate that identity theft causes between $2 and $3 billion in losses each year--just from credit cards. 
   According to a recent survey of identity theft victims published jointly by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and CALPIRG, the average identity theft victim has fraudulent charges of $18,000 made in his name. Typically, an identity theft victim spends approximately 175 hours of personal time over a two-year period to clean-up his credit record. 
   Sometimes, this unrestricted sale of personal information can have tragic results. Amy Boyer, a twenty-year old dental assistant in New Hampshire, was killed last year by a stalker who bought her Social Security number off an Internet web site for $45. Armed with this critical information, he tracked her down to her work address. 
   Here are some other examples of Social Security number misuse. Kim Brady, a constituent from Castro Valley, California, wrote to me that an identity thief obtained a credit card in her name on the Internet. The application ``was approved in 10 seconds even though the application only had [her] name, Social Security number, and birth date correct.'' When Ms. Bradbury contacted credit card companies and asked how a credit card was issued in her name despite false information on the application, the companies said they only look to ``see that the name and the Social Security number match.'' 
   Another California constituent, Michelle Brown of Hermosa 
   Beach, informed me that a criminal used her Social Security number to fraudulently assume her identity. The perpetrator rang up a total of $50,000 in charges including a $32,000 truck and $5,000 worth of liposuction. In addition, the perpetrator used Michelle's identity to establish wireless and residential telephone service, utilities service, and to obtain a year-long residential lease. 
   Michelle notes that she has spent hundreds of hours trying to restore her good name and has endured ``weeks of sleepless nights, suffering from nearly no appetite, and nerve-shattering moments of my life spinning out of control.'' 
   In another case, a retired air force officer was falsely billed for $113,000 on 33 different credit accounts after identity  thieves stole his Social Security number. He and his wife have dealt with over a dozen third party collection agencies. They are also being sued by a furniture store in Texas and have had five automobiles purchased in their name. 
   I am pleased to work with the Administration on this bill because no one should seek to profit from the sale of Social Security numbers in circumstances that create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or financial harm to the person to whom these numbers are assigned. 
   What would this bill do? The Social Security Number Protection Act would impose criminal and civil penalties for the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers. Specifically, it would direct the Federal Trade Commission to issue regulations prohibiting this sale. 
   The legislation would direct the FTC to permit exceptions to this ban in a very narrow range of circumstances, including where an individual has consented to the sale, for law enforcement or national security reasons, in emergency situations to protect an individual's health and safety, for research or public health purposes, and where the use of the Social Security number is for a lawful purpose and is unlikely to result in serious bodily, emotional, or financial harm of a Social Security number holder. 
   Mr. President, I think this is a very important step forward. The bill is carefully drawn. It simply prevents the sale of Social Security numbers for profit, which can result in enormous wrongdoing to the individual Social Security number holder. 
   I yield the floor. 
   By Mr. L. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. LAUTENBERG, Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, and Mr. BAUCUS):

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Kerrey motion to strike the Section 1017 of the Defense Authorization Act regarding U.S. strategic nuclear force levels. 
   I do not believe that the restrictions that this bill contains, which prevents the Department of Defense from reducing U.S. strategic nuclear delivery vehicles--warheads--below START I levels until START II enters into force, is necessary or, given the current international security environment, needed. 
   Striking this provision does not mandate any cuts in U.S. nuclear forces: It merely makes it possible, now that the Russian Duma has ratified the START II treaty, for the U.S. to make further cuts below START I levels. 
   In fact, I believe that it is important that the President, the Joint Chiefs, and the Secretary of Defense have the flexibility to determine the appropriate force level and alert status for U.S. nuclear forces based on military and security need. 
   In fact, the original reason for including this provision in the Defense Authorization bill in 1998 was not based on military or security need per se, but rather to encourage the Russian Duma to ratify START II. Well, now they have, and the U.S. should be prepared to reduce our nuclear forces below START I levels, consistent with our national security needs, if and when Russia moves to reduce its forces below START I levels in a verifiable manner. That is what the Kerrey Amendment will allow. 
   Before I conclude, I would also like to take a few minutes today to speak to some of the larger issues raised by this debate. 
   We no longer live in the world of the superpower nuclear arms race of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or 1980s. 
   During the Cold War the threat of nuclear war was omnipotent, and the size and configuration of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was very much a function of the Cold War international security environment and the needs of nuclear deterrence with the Soviet Union. 
   But the Soviet Union is gone. The Berlin Wall came down over ten years ago. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are now members of NATO. The world in the year 2000 is not the same as the world of twenty, thirty, or forty years ago. And I believe that our nuclear weapons policy should reflect these new realities. 
   We live in a transformative moment for international politics: The security structures and imperatives that guided our thinking during the Cold War have either melted away or are malleable to change. Both AL GORE and George W. Bush recognize that. Why should the U.S. Senate remain captive to the thinking of the Cold War, or to the nuclear weapons counting arithmetic of the Cold War? 
   The world has changed, yet as Dr. Bruce Blair, President of the Center for Defense Information, has pointed out, the Single Integrated Operating Plan (SIOP) which guides our nuclear weapons targeting, has been growing steadily since 1993, and grew over 20 percent in the last five years alone. It includes over 500 weapons aimed at Russian factories in a country whose economy is all but defunct and which produced almost no armaments last year, and over  500 Russian conventional military targets for an army of a country that can not even successfully invade itself. 
   Something is amiss. Clearly we need to retain a force capable of robust deterrence. But we can not allow ourselves to pursue an outdated policy that dictates an arsenal far larger than new, current-day reality suggests we need or is advisable. 
   I strongly believe that deterrence can remain robust with a smaller nuclear arsenal. Analysis by Dr. Blair and others suggests that with a force of 10 Tridents, each with 24 missiles, 300 Minuteman III land-based missiles, 20 B-2 bombers and 50 B-52 bombers we can assure the destruction of between 250 and 1,000 targets worldwide in retaliation for any strike against the United States. If this sort of retaliatory capacity does not deter any adversary, than it is hard to imagine what would. 
   I also believe that it is critical, as we move into this new world, for the United States to review our own nuclear alert status and those of other nuclear capable-states. Right now the U.S. maintains 2,300 warheads on launch-ready alert: 98 percent of the Minuteman III and Peacekeeper land-based force on 2-minute launch readiness and 4 Trident submarines, two in each ocean, on 15 minute launch readiness. The Russians, likewise, maintain their forces on hair-trigger alert. Keeping these forces on hair-trigger alert is a potential accident waiting to happen, with devastating consequences if it does. 
   In January 1995 a commercial space-launch off the coast of Norway in the middle of the night was almost misinterpreted by Russia as a U.S. Trident missile launch, despite the fact that we had pre-notified them about the launch. As I understand it, Russia prepared for a nuclear retaliatory strike. It was only at the last minute that the Russians realized that this was a commercial launch headed for space, not a nuclear weapon headed for Moscow and stood-down their forces. 
   These risks--these needless risks which do nothing to add to our security but, just the opposite, make the world a less safe, stable, and secure place--need to be addressed. 
   And they need to be addressed in a way that will allow us to embrace the challenge of the new century, not be held captive to the grim math of the old. As Governor Bush pointed out on May 23, ``These unneeded weapons are relics of dead conflicts and they do nothing to make us more secure.'' 
   Mr. President, I think that it is important to point out that the Kerrey Amendment does not mandate that we cut U.S. nuclear force levels. It merely gives the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chief the flexibility to determine whether, if and how lowering U.S. force levels below the START I limits would be a net-plus for U.S. national security and, if it is, to do it. 
   As Senator KERREY has argued, by mandating force levels higher than are needed or desired for national security needs, we actually run the risk of undermining our security interests. If we force the Russians to maintain at hair-trigger status more nuclear weapons than they can safely control we run the risk of an accidental or unauthorized launch. If we maintain our own nuclear arsenal at high levels when it is unnecessary to do so, we encourage rouge nations to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs. 
   A decade after the end of the Cold War, and on the cusp of the twenty-first century, I believe that it is critical that the United States Senate show a willingness to engage in the serious business of forging a new strategic vision. We must do so with no preconditions or preconceived notions about how many, or how few, nuclear weapons are necessary. If an objective review of our national security needs dictate that we should maintain an arsenal at START I levels, then I will be second to none in this body in insisting that our arsenal remain at that size. But if, as Governor Bush has suggested, deeper cuts are advisable, then I do not believe that artificial barriers to achieving this goal should be put in place by this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Kerrey Amendment and strike Section 1017 of this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate reauthorized a very important piece of legislation: the Ryan White CARE Act. I want to thank Senators KENNEDY and JEFFORDS for their work and commitment to reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   The CARE Act provides access to health care for tens of thousands of low-income people living with HIV and AIDS. This vital Act is set to expire on September 30, 2000. We must move quickly to ensure that it is reauthorized. Without the CARE Act, access to important health-related services could be jeopardized for hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS. 
   Since 1990, the CARE Act has helped establish a comprehensive, community-based continuum of care for uninsured and under-insured people living with HIV and AIDS, including access to primary medical care, pharmaceuticals, and support services. The CARE Act provides services to people who would not otherwise have access to care. 
   The CARE Act is particularly important to communities of color. The HIV epidemic is devastating communities of color. Currently, AIDS is the leading cause of death among African American men and the second leading cause of death among African American women between the ages of 25 and 44. Comparably, AIDS is the fifth leading cause of death among all Americans in this age group. A disproportionate number of African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos are also living with AIDS. Whereas African Americans represent only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they represent 36 percent of reported AIDS cases. Likewise, Latinos represent 9 percent of the population but 17 percent all of AIDS cases. 
   The Ryan White CARE Act is important to thousands of Californians. Two of California's largest cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, are among the top four metropolitan cites with the highest number of AIDS cases in the United States. California has the second highest number of AIDS cases, with over 40,000 Californians currently living with AIDS. Through the CARE Act, Los Angeles has provided services to over 43,160 clients since 1996. San Francisco has provided services to 47,440 since 1996. These numbers alone demonstrate the significant impact the CARE Act has had on California. 
   A majority of newly diagnosed AIDS cases in California are among people of color. Through 1998, over half of all AIDS cases are reported among racial and ethnic minorities in California. In Los Angeles, and Oakland that number rises to over 60 percent, according to the Ryan White CARE Act state profiles. 
   Los Angeles County and San Francisco County were among the first sixteen eligible metropolitan areas to receive Title I emergency Ryan White CARE Act funds in 1991. California has been significantly impacted by the HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and has greatly benefitted from the Ryan White CARE Act since 1990. 
   The CARE Act has been very successful in the past decade. Over the last several years, the CARE Act has:  
   Helped to reduce AIDS mortality by 70 percent. Due to combination anti-retroviral therapies being made more widely available through the CARE Act, the AIDS death rate in 1997 was the lowest in nearly a decade. 
   Helped to reduce mother-to-child transmission by 75 percent. 
   Helped to reduce the number and length of expensive hospitalizations by 30 percent. It has also helped decrease the use of medical speciality care. 
   Helped 97,000 individuals access drugs through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program in 1997. 
   Helped 315,234 people receive HIV testing and counseling services in 1997. 
   Helped 66,000 people access dental care in 1998. 
   Promoted health and well-being which has enabled many people living with HIV to return to work and remain healthy, and actively participate in society.  
   The CARE Act is more important now than ever. HIV/AIDS remains a health emergency in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 40,000 new cases are reported annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control, between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are currently infected with HIV while the number of AIDS cases has nearly doubled over the past five years. According to Dr. Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, the worse is yet to come in the 21st century. The state of the epidemic points to the need for an increase, rather than a decrease, in health care and drug treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS. Communities of color and women will continue to be the most heavily impacted in the 21st century. 
   We have made many advances in testing, treatment, and research since the early days of the disease and the beginnings of the Ryan White CARE Act. Drugs now exist that can prolong and improve the quality of life. These drugs are not a cure, but they enable  many people to lead a more ``normal'' life. Our job is not done, however, until we have made certain that all people have access to these life-prolonging medications. 
   The work we were able to accomplish in San Francisco for people living with HIV/AIDS is one of my proudest achievements as Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco. In 1981, when there were only 76 diagnosed cases, we provided $180,000 for prevention and social services for people living with HIV/AIDS. These were some of the first public funds allocated for AIDS in the United States. In 1987, during my last full year as mayor, 20,000 AIDS deaths were reported in San Francisco and we increased funding to $20 million. There was no federal Ryan White program then; I struggled to find this money in the city budget. Fortunately, for cities and States across the country, we now have the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   I pledge to do all I can to eliminate AIDS. As I have said time and time again: I was there in the beginning and I plan to be there in the end. In the meantime, we must make certain that the uninsured and under-insured have access to life-prolonging HIV treatments. The Ryan White CARE Act has proven to be an essential and effective Federal program for the uninsured and under-insured. We must ensure the continuation of the Ryan White CARE Act.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today which will provide for the transfer of the Sugar Pine Dam and Reservoir Project in the Central Valley Project to the Forest Hills Public Utility District. I continue to support the transfer of the Bureau of Reclamation projects to the local water districts which operate and benefit from them. 
   This bill is important in one other way. The language in this bill will correct the financial inequity that affects CVP beneficiaries. Some of the costs of constructing Bureau of Reclamation projects have been allocated to other CVP contractors even though the projects have never been operationally integrated into the CVP. Thus, Irrigation and Municipal and Industrial (M&I) contractors such as Contra Costa Water District, East Bay MUD, Santa Clara Valley Water District, Sacramento MUD, City of Fresno and a number of others have incurred substantial costs without ever receiving any benefit. 
   This bill has the bipartisan support of Congressman GEORGE MILLER and JOHN DOOLITTLE in the House. And I can think of no opposition to assisting Forest Hills Public Utility District and other M&I contractors with this legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to, from the Democratic side, more or less conclude the debate on the legislative branch appropriations bill. 
   We believe it is a good bill. We are very supportive--both Senator BENNETT and I--of Senator MIKULSKI's amendment. I am delighted she offered it. 
   The men and women of the Capitol Police perform a vitally important job. Unfortunately, sometimes we hardly notice them. This is an opportunity to give them notice, respect, commendation, and say we are proud of you. 
   The legislative branch appropriations bill restores the damaging cuts contained in the House bill and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring security in the Capitol and of the Capitol Police. 
   I reiterate what a delight it has been to work with our chairman, Senator BENNETT. My tenure as ranking member on this subcommittee has been marked by a sense of comity and equity which has really made this work a great pleasure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as an original co-sponsor of Senator MOYNIHAN's resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of the free and fair elections in Burma which were overturned by a military junta, I rise today to mark that event and to discuss the repressive conditions that have dominated the lives of the Burmese people for the past 37 years and that continue to define the terms of their existence to this very day. 
   For the past 12 years, a brutal authoritarian regime has denied the Burmese people the most basic human freedoms, including the rights of free speech, press, assembly, and the right to determine their own political destiny through free and competitive elections. 
   In 1988, the government led by General Ne Win--who overthrew the popularly elected government of Burma in 1962--brutally suppressed popular pro-democracy demonstrations. In September of that same year, the Government, in a futile public relations gambit to deflect international censure, reorganized itself into a junta of senior military officers and renamed itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). 
   The SLORC seemed to bow to international opinion in 1990, when it permitted a relatively free election for a national parliament, announcing before the election that it would peacefully transfer power to the elected assembly. 
   Burmese voters overwhelmingly supported anti-government parties, one of which, the National League for Democracy (NLD)--the party of Aung-San Suu-Kyi--won more than 60 percent of the popular vote and 80 percent of the parliamentary seats. 
   SLORC's public promises were a fiction. The military junta nullified the results of the elections and thwarted efforts by NLD representatives and others elected in 1990 to convene the rightfully elected parliament. 
   Instead, SLORC convened a government-controlled body, the National Convention, with the goal of approving a constitution to ensure that the armed forces would have a dominant role in the nation's future political structure. The NLD has declined to participate in the National Convention since 1995, perceiving it to be nothing more than a tool of the ruling military elite. 
   SLORC reorganized itself again in 1997, changing its name to the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). But an oppressive regime by any other name remains an oppressive regime. Burma continues to be ruled by a non-elected military clique, this time headed by General Than Shwe. And, even though Ne Win ostensibly relinquished power after the 1988 pro-democracy demonstrations, in reality, he continues to wield informal, if declining, influence. 
   To this day, Burma continues to be ruled by fiat, denied both a valid constitution and a legislature representing the people. 
   To solidify its hold on power and suppress Burma's widespread grassroots democracy movement, the military junta--whether it be named SLORC or the SPDC--has engaged in a campaign of systematic human rights abuses throughout the 1990s. It has been aided in this effort by the armed forces--whose ranks have swelled from 175,000 to 400,000 soldiers--and the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI), a military and security apparatus that pervades almost every aspect of a Burmese citizen's life. 
   For many in Burma, the prospect for life has become nasty, brutish, and short. Citizens continue to live a tenuous life, subject at any time and without appeal to the arbitrary and too often brutal dictates of a military regime. There continue to be numerous credible reports, particularly in areas populated mostly by ethnic minority, of extrajudicial killings and rape. Disappearances happen with sickening regularity. Security forces torture, beat, and otherwise abuse detainees. Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and detention for holding dissenting political views remains a fact of life. Since 1962, thousands of people have been arrested, detained, and imprisoned for political reasons, or they have ``disappeared''. Reportedly, more than 1,300 political prisoners languished in Burmese prisons at the end of 1998. 
   The Burmese judiciary is an SPDC tool. Security forces still systematically monitor citizens' movements and communications, search homes without warrants, relocate persons forcibly without just compensation or due process, use excessive force, and violate international humanitarian law in internal conflicts against ethnic insurgencies. 
   The SPDC severely restricts freedom of speech and of the press, and restricts academic freedom: since 1996, government fear of political dissent has meant the closing of most Burmese institutions of higher learning. And even verbal criticism of the government is an offense carrying a 20-year sentence.  
   And while the SPDC claims it recognizes the NLD as a legal entity, it refuses to recognize the legal political status of key NLD party leaders, particularly General-Secretary and 1991 Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her two co-chairs. The SPDC constrains their activities severely through security measures and threats. 
   The SPDC restricts freedom of religion. It exercises institutionalized control over Buddhist clergy and promotes discrimination against non-Buddhist religions. It forbids the existence of domestic human rights organizations and remains hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. Violence and societal discrimination against women remain problems, as does severe child neglect, the forced labor of children, and lack of funding and facilities for education. 
   In sum, as the latest biannual State Department report on:  
   Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Towards Burma notes, over the last six months the SPDC has made no progress toward greater democratization, nor has it made any progress toward fundamental improvement in the quality of life of the people of Burma. The regime continues to repress the National League for Democracy ..... and attack its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in the state-controlled press.  
   Burma's political repressiveness is matched only by its poverty. Burma's population is thought to be about 48 million--we can only rely on estimates because government restrictions make accurate counts impossible. The average per capita income was estimated to be about $300 in 1998, about $800 if considered on the basis of purchasing power parity. 
   Things do not have to be this way. Burma has rich agricultural, fishing, and timber resources. It has abundant mineral resources--gas, oil, and gemstones. The world's finest jade comes from Burma. But the economic deck is stacked against Burma. 
   Three decades of military rule and economic mismanagement have created widespread waste, loss, and suffering. Economic policy is suddenly reversed for political reasons. Development is killed by overt and covert state involvement in economic activity, state monopolization of leading exports, a bloated bureaucracy, arbitrary and opaque governance, institutionalized corruption, and poor human and physical infrastructure. Smuggling is rampant; the destruction of the environment goes on unabated. Decades of disproportionately large military budgets have meant scant spending on social development and economic infrastructure. 
   There is no price stability. The Burmese currency, the Kyat, is worthless. There is a telling anecdote about this: one year, Burma asked the U.K., then its primary foreign aid donor, to give it paper so that it could print more Kyat because the Kyat was so devalued that Burma could not afford to buy the paper needed to print it. Imagine, the paper was worth more as paper than as money. I don't know if the story is true or not. The point is that in Burma's case, it easily could have been. In 1998-1999, the official exchange rate was 6 Kyat to one dollar; the black market rate was 341 Kyat to the dollar. This says it all. 
   I could go on and on. But I don't need to. We all know that Burma's economy is a basket case. We all know that, for the Burmese people, mere existence, not life, is the norm. We all know that Burma cannot expect to begin the road to recovery, prosperity, and long term economic stability as long as the basic human rights and political will of the Burmese people are denied. 
   The questions before us now are: what tools do we have for stopping this government's inhumanity toward its own citizens and for giving hope to the Burmese people? Are the tools we are now using the correct ones? 
   The debate over unilateral sanctions represents a fundamental question in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy: Are U.S. interests advanced best by deepening relations or diminishing relations with a country that is not acting as we would like? 
   I do not endorse sanctions as a panacea. Each case must be considered on its own merits. 
   In Burma, I believe the United States government had a responsibility to respond to a situation in which the democratically-elected leaders had been summarily thrown out of office, assaulted, and imprisoned by renegade militarists. 
   Consequently, in 1996, then-Senator Cohen and I coauthored the current sanctions legislation on Burma. The Cohen-Feinstein amendment required the President to ban new investment by U.S. firms in Burma if he determined that the Government of Burma has physically harmed, rearrested for political acts, or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale repression or violence against the Democratic opposition. 
   Shortly after Congress passed the Cohen-Feinstein Amendment, President Clinton implemented sanctions against Burma. 
   Unfortunately, since Cohen-Feinstein went into effect on October 1, 1996 there appears to be little improvement in human rights conditions in Burma: The SPDC continues to implement its repressive policies. 
   Nevertheless, until the SPDC shows a willingness to make progress towards democracy and improved human rights, the Cohen-Feinstein sanctions must remain in place. 
   The sanctions make us a leader on Burma and in forging a common international position. I believe, for example, that the European Union would have a much softer line on Burma if not for U.S. policy. The EU has no economic sanctions in place, but has taken some other measures, such as a visa ban for members of the SPDC government and support of the U.S. in introducing the annual United Nations Human Rights Committee resolution on Burma. The United States must continue trying to develop a multilateral approach, particularly with the ASEAN nations, to bring additional pressure to bear on the SLORC. 
   There is some indication that the sanctions are causing some hardships for the SPDC. For example, last year the SPDC let the International Committee of the Red Cross back into Burma under conditions the ICRC found acceptable, including access to prisons and prisoners. Although there was no clear link to the impact of sanctions in getting the ICRC back in, some analysts contend that the SPDC is heeding international pressure. This may indicate that the SPDC could be willing to make some positive changes, even though it is still an open question if they will change the ``core behavior'' that triggered the sanctions to begin with. 
   The bottom line is that the current sanctions should not be lifted without some major concession by the SPDC. To lift any sanctions without a concession would send the wrong signal and give the SPDC the message that they could continue to stifle democracy. 
   We should make it clear that the United States stands on the side of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Burma. We should make it clear that the United States stands on the side of Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League of Democracy and that we support their efforts to return Burma and its government to the people. 
   I am pleased to co-sponsor Senator MOYNIHAN's resolution which commemorates the 10th anniversary of the free and fair elections in Burma, and calls on the SPDC to: guarantee basic freedoms to the people of Burma; accept political dialogue with the National League for Democracy; comply with UN human rights agreements; and reaffirms U.S. sanctions as appropriate to secure the restoration of democracy. 
   I look forward to the day when the United States has cause to lift the Cohen-Feinstein sanctions and welcome Burma into the community of free nations. In the interim, I urge my colleagues to support the Moynihan resolution.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 2603, the legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   This is my second year as ranking member of the legislative branch subcommittee. I have been very proud to serve alongside our dedicated and distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator BENNETT. Senator BENNETT is  always very open and very willing to discuss the various issues that arise in relation to this bill. He has been very accommodating to my concerns as well as those of other Senators. I think he has displayed great knowledge of the various Departments and Agencies that fall under the legislative branch. 
   It has been a real pleasure working with him. 
   Thanks to the allocation to our Legislative Branch Subcommittee by the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Senator STEVENS, and the ranking member, Senator BYRD, this appropriation is $145 million in budget authority greater than the House subcommittee's allocation, so the bill before us now restores the House cuts of 2,112 employees, including 438 Capitol Police officers. 
   Although we were not able to fully fund every agency's request, I believe the committee has distributed the scarce resources as fairly as possible, and we were able to make modest increases in most agency accounts above last year's level. 
   Overall spending is increased by 3.7 percent over last year's bill. In particular, I note that during markup of this year's bill, Chairman BENNETT agreed to include committee report language recommended by Senator MIKULSKI, having to do with the need for better employee relations in the office of the Architect of the Capitol. Senator MIKULSKI came to the subcommittee hearing and questioned the Architect of the Capitol directly concerning these matters. As a result of her efforts, the committee report language directs the Architect of the Capitol to establish a position of employee advocate, in an effort to improve morale and employee relations in the office of the Architect. 
   In his remarks, Chairman BENNETT has outlined for the Senate the various components of the bill, so I do not want to repeat that summary. I do, however, wish to point out to the Senate that for the Capitol Police, the subcommittee in that regard has included an appropriation of $109.6 million for fiscal year 2001. This is an increase of $22.8 million, or 26 percent over last year's enacted level of $86.8 million. This will fund 100 to 115 new Capitol Police officers. 
   The funding level, we believe, will enable the Capitol Police to implement the department's plan for posting two police officers at all key and critical entries and exits throughout the Capitol complex. 
   I take this opportunity to thank all Capitol Police officers for their really outstanding service to the Members, to this Capitol, and to the tens of thousands of visitors to the Capitol each year. They do a great job. 
   I know Senator MIKULSKI will be presenting a sense-of-the-Senate commendation to the Capitol Police, with which I strongly agree. I think it is important, because of what happened last year, to be able to really tell them how much we do appreciate their efforts. This can be a very thankless job, particularly when there are tens of thousands of visitors milling through the Capitol each and every week. So I think we both agree that they do a truly fine job and are, indeed, to be commended. 
   I also thank Chairman BENNETT for agreeing to include language in the committee report about which he spoke, which I requested, relating to the proposed merger of the police forces at the Government Printing Office and the Library of Congress with the Capitol Police Force. This study will enable a careful feasibility analysis to be carried out and completed prior to any consolidation. The GAO report, I believe, can be done by July 1, giving the conference the opportunity to review its findings at that time. I understand Chairman BENNETT's intentions in this area. He believes the proposed merger will result in greater efficiencies for the overall legislative branch police force. I believe it can be carried out in a way, as he just stated, that can maintain the upward mobility and career path for officers. 
   I share that hope, and I believe that prior to proceeding with such a merger, Congress should first have these views of the GAO to ensure that no unforeseen problems exist in relation to such a consolidation or merger. Chairman BENNETT has agreed to that study, and the committee report ensures that the study will be completed by July 1. 
   In closing, I express appreciation and recognition to the very capable staff who assisted Chairman BENNETT and myself with the legislative branch bill: Christine Ciccone, Chip Yost, Jim English, Edie Stanley, and Chris Kierig. 
   This is a very good bill. I urge my colleagues to give favorable consideration to its passage in the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Levin amendment to the military construction appropriations bill, which strikes the provisions of the Byrd-Warner amendment on Kosovo which was attached to the bill in committee. 
   Unfortunately, for an issue of such importance, this amendment came up very quickly in committee without, I think, due consideration and study. 
   Since the committee markup last week I have had a chance to further consider and study this issue and I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue, at length, with senior members of the Administration, with Secretary Cohen, with Jack Lew, Director of the OMB, and with General Wesley Clark, the former supreme NATO commander. As a result of these discussions, I have some serious concerns about the potential impact of the Byrd-Warner amendment 
   During the committee markup, proponents of this amendment asserted that the certifications called for by the amendment could be made ``tomorrow'' without delay. According to Mr. Lew, however, the certifications can not be met by July 15 of this year. The reason why these certifications can not be made, he has stated, is not because our European allies are not making efforts to meet their commitments--they are and in many cases they have--but for technical reasons. 
   So we could very well find ourselves in a position whereby we have accomplished the policy goals of the Byrd-Warner amendment but, because technical reasons prevent Presidential certifications, we are forced to withdraw U.S. forces from Kosovo. 
   Both Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER have given assurances that these shortcomings will be fixed in conference. I very much appreciate these assurances. But I have reason to believe that it is not a simple fix, but that a number of issues needs to be addressed, and this may well prove difficult to accomplish. 
   In addition, as General Clark has made clear, by setting in motion an automatic mechanism for complete withdrawal by 2001 that will telegraph our troop deployments and our policy, and which ties the hand of the next President, the Byrd-Warner amendment has an impact far beyond that originally anticipated in that it complicates and makes more difficult the U.S. role in Kosovo. I cannot ignore the conviction of General Clark that passage of this amendment would run the risk of destroying the NATO mission in Kosovo. 
   As General Clark stated in his May 11 letter to Senator LEVIN, ``This action will also undermine specific plans and commitments made within the Alliance. At the time that U.S. military and diplomatic personnel are pressing other nations to fulfill and expand their commitment of forces, capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally mandated pullout would undercut their leadership and parallel diplomatic efforts.'' 
   Or, as Secretary Cohen said in a discussion I had with him just a short time ago, ``if the Senate passes this, it will weaken the allies' resolve rather than strengthen it.'' 
   As General Clark concludes in his May 11 letter, ``A U.S. withdrawal could give Mr. Milosevic the victory he could not achieve on the battlefield.'' 
   Because of these concerns, I find that I must vote in favor of the Levin motion to strike the Byrd amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation that, if enacted, will enable the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to cut through and eventually eliminate the unacceptably long backlogs in its processing of applications for naturalization, adjustment of status, and other immigration benefits. 
   I am pleased that Senators ABRAHAM, JEFFORDS, DEWINE, LEAHY, REID, MOYNIHAN, MIKULSKI, GRAHAM, and DURBIN have joined me as original cosponsors of this important bill. 
   All of us have heard the horror stories of the long delays in processing naturalization and immigration applications. What was once a 6-month process has now become a 3- to 4-year ordeal. 
   The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000,'' which I am introducing today, would provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with the direction and resources it needs to reduce the current immigration backlogs and hold it accountable to get the job done. 
   It is unacceptable that millions of people who have followed our nation's laws, made outstanding contributions to our nation, and paid the requisite fees have had to wait months--and in too many cases, years--to obtain the immigration services they need. The enormous delays in processing have had a negative impact on the reunification of spouses and minor children, and on businesses seeking to employ essential workers to help keep them globally competitive. 
   The fact is, there are many victims of an agency that is in dire need of a change in the way it does business. Today, it has become all too clear that the INS needs to re-engineer its adjudication process, which will require both additional resources and strong congressional direction and oversight. 
   The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act'' would enable millions of law-abiding residents, immigrants, and businesses, who have played by the rules and paid fees to the INS, to have their applications processed in a timely manner. 
   This bill evolved from discussions with immigration advocates, the business community, State and local leaders, and the Administration. Specifically, this legislation would do three things. 
   First, it would create a separate ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Account'' (``Account'') and authorize such sums as may be necessary to fund it. 
   This account would permit the INS to fund across several fiscal years infrastructure improvements, including additional staff, computer records management, fingerprinting, and nationwide computer integration. Moreover, it would pay for these infrastructure improvements through direct appropriations rather than through increased application fees. 
   Second, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000'' would require the INS to put together a plan on how it will eliminate existing backlogs and report on this plan before it could access any of the funds. 
   In its report, the INS would be required to describe its current processing capabilities and detail its plans to eliminate existing backlogs in immigration benefit applications and petitions. 
   And third, it would require the Department of Justice to submit an annual, detailed report to Congress, including data on the number of naturalization applications and immigration petitions processed and adjudicated in each of the fiscal years following enactment of the act. 
   The act would also require the INS to report on the number of cases still pending in the naturalization, immigrant and nonimmigrant visa categories. In some cases this would involve a state-by-state or regional analysis of INS's progress in processing applications in a timely fashion. 
   In the past 7 years, 6.4 million people applied for U.S. citizenship--more than the previous 37 years combined. Today, INS faces a backlog of 1.3 million naturalization applications. Although the INS has put more resources into processing naturalization applications, this has come at the expense of processing other immigration-related applications, such as those for lawful permanent residence. At the beginning of this year, the INS had a pending caseload of 951,350 adjustment of status applications--an eightfold increase since 1994. 
   As a result, major cities continue to face tremendous delays in the processing of INS naturalization and immigrant applications. Five cities--Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Miami, and Chicago--handle 65 percent of the nation's naturalization workload. 
   By now, most of us are familiar with the numbers. Indeed, it would be easy for one to look at and decry the statistics reflecting the enormous number of backlogged applications. Instead, I come to floor of the Senate today to talk about the human cost of these backlogs and what I intend to do through legislation to help the INS put itself on its proper course. 
   As one who represents California, a State that is number one among immigrant-receiving States, I have seen firsthand how families and businesses can be disproportionately affected by the smallest fluctuations in INS resources and services. 
   One out of every four Californians--about 8.5 million people--is foreign born. The average number of new immigrants to the State is more than 300,000 annually. Population growth of this magnitude is like adding a city the size of Anaheim, California each year. 
   The constant processing delays at the INS have had a tremendous impact on the ability of immigrants to naturalize, and seek services related to their application for green cards, work authorization, and family reunification. 
   On almost a daily basis, my office fields calls from people who have been waiting three or four years to naturalize or to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident. And this is after having paid a fee of $225 per naturalization application, and $220 for an adjustment of status application--per person. Imagine how much of an investment a family makes in order to play by the rules. 
   Applicants for these services are never really sure if their application is still in the process or lost, especially when the expected time for a fingerprint or interview notice comes and goes. 
   I have received numerous letters from constituents that vividly portray the human toil these backlogs have taken. 
   For example, one person wrote that he and his family have been in the country legally for more than 10 years. They filed their request for permanent residency at the right time. Their file, however, has moved so slowly within the INS that one of their sons is now about to ``age out'' of qualifying for permanent residence because he will turn 21 soon. 
   Just recently, I received a letter from a young student at Berkeley who filed a citizenship application in October 1996. She is still waiting to receive word from the INS on the correct status of her file. 
   She was told by the INS in January this year that it had closed her case in June 1999 without her knowledge or ability to address any concerns they might have had with her case. In fact, she was never told there were problems with her case. 
   Up until January, she had been told by the INS that she would be receiving her interview notice within six weeks. Unfortunately, six weeks became three years. Now, almost four years later, she has come to my office for assistance, wondering what she might have done to create this situation. 
   The fact is, like millions of others throughout the country, she is a victim of an agency that is in dire need of a change in the way it does business.  
   Millions of people are being prevented from participating in American civic life because of the inability of INS to process their naturalization applications in a timely fashion (e.g., they cannot vote, run for public office, assume certain government positions). U.S. citizens are unable to be reunited with their spouses and minor children because of the delays in INS processing. 
   And thousands of American businesses, such as high tech companies like Sun Microsystems and others, have been prevented from getting qualified workers because of the INS's inability to provide access to a critical portion of their workforce. Lengthy delays and inconsistencies in INS processing have taken a toll on company projects, planning and goals. 
   How does this legislation help Congress hold the INS accountable for the prompt delivery of services? If INS does not met the goals of set out in this legislation, it 
   would have to explain to Congress why the backlogs persist and what the agency is doing to fix them. This legislation would also require the INS to describe the additional mechanisms and resources needed to meet Congress's mandate that backlogs be eliminated and that the processing of applications take place in an acceptable time frame. 
   While funds devoted to enforcing our immigration laws have rightfully been increased in recent years, until very recently, Congress had not provided increases in funding to the INS specifically to deal with the increased missions that Congress has imposed on it. Nor has Congress provided adequate funding to deal with the increased number of naturalization and other immigration benefits applications that have been submitted in recent years and continue to be submitted. 
   The business community, immigration community, and the Administration have indicated their support for mechanisms such as those included in my legislation. I wish to thank the following organizations whose valuable input and ideas helped shaped this important legislation: 
   American Business for Legal Immigration; American Council on International Personnel; American Immigration Lawyers Association; Hebrew Immigration Aid Society; Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund; National Association of Latino Elected Officials; National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium; National Council of La Raza; United Jewish Communities; and United States Catholic Conference. 
   Mr. President, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2000'' would provide direction and accountability on how the INS uses appropriated funds. Passage of this legislation would send a strong congressional directive to the INS that timely and efficient service is not merely goal, but a mandate. 
   I urge the Senate to act swiftly and pass this urgently needed legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to use my 15 minutes to do three things. The first two are to debunk certain myths that the National Rifle Association has developed. The first is the myth they have developed with respect to the second amendment to the Constitution. Second is the myth that the gun laws are not being enforced. The third item I would like to discuss is the juvenile justice bill that has been awaiting conference now for about a year. 
   Let me begin by talking about the NRA claim that the second amendment to the Constitution gives every individual the right to own any kind of weapon, no matter how powerful or deadly: 
   From the Derringer to a Bazooka. From the .22 to .50 caliber weapon. From a revolver that holds 5 bullets to weapons of war with drums of 250 rounds. From the copper jacketed bullets to the black talon that rips apart organs as it passes through a body. 
   The fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court has never struck down a single gun control law on second amendment grounds. Let me just quickly read to you the second amendment. It says:  
   A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  
   Contrary to the constant claims of the NRA, the meaning of the second amendment has been well-settled for more than 60 years --ever since the 1939 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Miller. In that case, the defendant was charged with transporting an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines. 
   In rejecting a motion to dismiss the case on second amendment grounds, the Court held that the ``obvious purpose'' of the second amendment was ``to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness'' of the State militia. Because a sawed-off shotgun was not a weapon that would be used by a state militia--like the National Guard--the second amendment was in no way applicable to that case, said the Court. 
   More than 40 years after the 1939 Miller case, in the 1980 case of Lewis v. United States, the Supreme Court again held that ``the Second Amendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not have `some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' '' Again, the Court pointed to the militia as the key to the right to keep and bear arms. 
   Since Miller, the Supreme Court has addressed the second amendment twice more, upholding New Jersey's strict gun control law in 1969 and upholding the Federal law banning felons from possessing guns in 1980. 
   Furthermore, twice--in 1965 and 1990--the Supreme Court has held that the term ``well-regulated militia'' refers to the National Guard. 
   And in the early 1980s, the Supreme Court even refused to take up a Second Amendment challenge, leaving established precedent in place. After the town of Morton Grove, Illinois, passed an ordinance banning handguns--making certain reasonable exceptions for law enforcement, the military, and collectors--the town was sued on second amendment grounds. 
   The Illinois Supreme Court and the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that not only was the ordinance valid, but went further to say--explicitly--that there was no individual right to keep and bear arms under the second amendment. In October 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of this ruling, allowing the lower court rulings to stand. 
   I was mayor of San Francisco when this took place, and I put forward legislation in the early 1980s to ban possession of handguns in San Francisco since at that time the homicide rate was soaring. The legislation passed. It was subsequently preempted by State law in a case brought and carried up to the State supreme court on the basis that the State of California had preempted the areas of licensing, of registration, and of possession, but it was not struck down on second amendment rights grounds. 
   Perhaps this history is what led former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger in 1991 to refer to the second amendment as ``the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word `fraud,' on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.....[the NRA] ha(s) misled the American people and they, I regret to say, they have had far too much influence on the Congress of the United States than as a citizen I would like to see--and I am a gun man.'' This was Warren Burger--a Nixon appointee to the Court. 
   Burger also wrote,  
   The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon.....[S]urely the Second Amendment does not remotely guarantee every person the constitutional right to have a `Saturday Night Special' or a machine gun without any regulation whatever. There is no support in the Constitution for the argument that federal and state governments are powerless to regulate the purchase of such firearms......  
   Erwin Griswold, former dean of Harvard Law School and Solicitor General in the Nixon Administration said in 1990 that ``It is time for the NRA and its followers in Congress to stop trying to twist the Second Amendment from a reasoned (if antiquated) empowerment for a militia into a bulletproof personal right for anyone to wield deadly weaponry beyond legislative control.'' 
   All told, since the Miller decision, lower Federal and State courts have addressed the meaning of the second amendment in more than thirty cases. In every case, up until March of 1999, the courts decided that the second amendment refers to the right to keep and bear arms only in connection with a State militia--in other words, the National Guard, not an individual. 
   And the NRA is clearly aware of this history. Despite all of the NRA's rhetoric and posturing on this issue, they  know that the second amendment does nothing whatsoever to limit reasonable gun control measures. In fact, in its legal challenges to federal firearms laws like the Brady law and my assault weapons ban, the National Rifle Association has made no mention of the second amendment. 
   When the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected a second amendment challenge to California's 1989 assault weapons ban, the NRA elected to not even appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, because they knew they would lose. 
   In fact, even when part of the Brady law was struck down as unconstitutional, that decision was not based on the second amendment, but on a narrow States' rights issue. 
   Another suit against the 1994 assault weapons ban was based on a ``bill of attainder'' argument, that Congress illegally targeted gun manufacturers--again, the suit is not based on the second amendment. 
   Elsewhere around the country, the NRA has argued that various gun control laws violate the first amendment, or the privacy rights of gun owners, or even the equal protection clause because NRA members are treated differently than others. The second amendment is never even brought up. 
   Nonetheless, many on the other side of the aisle may point to the one, single, lone exception to the long history of second amendment jurisprudence. 
   On March 30, 1999, a United States District Judge in Texas struck down a federal law making it a felony to possess a firearm while under a domestic restraining order. 
   In the Texas case, a man in the midst of a divorce proceeding was accused of threatening to kill his wife's lover. Although put under a restraining order and therefore barred from possessing a firearm under federal law, the man was subsequently caught with a gun and indicted for violating the ban. U.S. District Court Judge Sam Cummings dismissed the indictment, in part because the federal law, he said, had the effect of ``criminalizing'' a ``law-abiding citizen's Second Amendment rights.'' 
   This was the first time such a decision was made by a federal judge, but it is important to note that this decision has been appealed. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the Supreme Court, if it ever got to that level, would uphold this decision. 
   The Texas decision clearly flies in the face of 60 years of second amendment precedent and, as Handgun Control has said, ``can only be viewed as a renegade decision.'' 
   In fact, in his opinion, Judge Cummings was unable to follow usual judicial practice and cite legal precedent supporting his decision, because no such precedent exists. 
   This ruling is, as I have said, being appealed and since that decision, two federal courts, including a higher circuit court, have ruled that the second amendment does not guarantee an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
   That is the first myth. 
   Now let me talk about the second myth being perpetrated by the National Rifle Association. That is that our current gun laws are not being enforced. Members have heard over and over again: We have the gun laws; now go out and enforce them. 
   Of course we should be enforcing our gun laws. And of course we are. And the evidence clearly shows that gun prosecutions are up. In fact, since the passage of the Brady Bill just seven years ago, more than 500,000 felons, fugitives, mentally ill individuals, and stalkers have walked into a gun dealer and walked right back out again without a gun because of a background check. 
   The NRA argues that prosecutions are down, but they fail to correctly interpret the statistics to recognize that state and federal cooperation have actually led to an increase in combined prosecutions during the Clinton administration. 
   In fact, since 1992 the total number of federal and state prosecutions combined has increased sharply, and about 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for state and federal weapons offenses than in 1992--from 20,300 prosecutions to 25,100. 
   Federal numbers may be down, but there is a reason for it. The federal government is now focusing its prosecutions on higher level offenders, and turning the lower level offenders over to the states for prosecution. In fact, the number of prosecutions of higher level offenders--those sentenced to 5 or more years in jail--has gone up nearly 41 percent in 7 years. And the number of inmates in federal prison on firearm or arson charges have increased 51 percent from 1993 to 1998. 
   Just last month, Senator KOHL of Wisconsin and I introduced an amendment which would expand Project Exile to 50 cities and provide law enforcement with ballistics technology that will make it far easier to identify and punish the perpetrators of gun violence. And I also support the President's request to fund at least 500 additional ATF agents and 1000 new prosecutors to focus on guns. 
   But here's the rub, and here's the contradiction of the National Rifle Association. On the one hand, they say enforce the law, and then they go out and they oppose any effort to strengthen those laws. The NRA fought the Brady Bill for 10 years. The NRA defeated all attempts to allow the consumer product safety commission to regulate the safety of firearms. The NRA in 1986 got legislation passed which restricts Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from inspections of gun dealers to once a year. Even dealers who are the source of hundreds of gun crimes cannot routinely be inspected more than once a year without a special court warrant. 
   For years, the NRA has even blocked the ATF computerization of gun sale records from gun dealers that have gone out of business. As a result, when a gun is traced as part of a criminal investigation, the files have to be retrieved manually from warehouses where old records are kept. This can add days or even weeks to an investigation. By the time the records are found, the trail may already be cold. 
   And most importantly, the National Rifle Association fights against funding law enforcement agencies at levels adequate to enforce our current laws. 
   As former New York City police commissioner William Bratten has said, ``The National Rifle Association has strenuously opposed increased financing for ATF and has successfully lobbied against giving it the authority to investigate the origin of gun sales.'' 
   The result: ATF has been left underfunded, understaffed and unable to adequately enforce all the laws on the books. 
   And the simple fact is that even if enforced, the current laws aren't enough. There so riddled with NRA induced loopholes, that they are easy to get around. And that's why you see children killing children today. Guns left loaded without safety locks, with no responsibility in the law, civil or otherwise, for parents to keep those guns and weapons in safe storage. 
   Let me speak as a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
   Mr. President, this body passed a comprehensive bill to address the problem of juvenile crime almost exactly one year ago. The House followed suit a month later. Both bills passed by wide margins, and this Nation was given hope that some solutions to the problems of gun violence and juvenile crime were close at hand. 
   Yet simple fact is, the conference committee has met only once--in early August of last year. No real issues have been discussed. No progress has been made. The bills sit in legislative purgatory, apparently never to see the light of day again. 
   Democrats in both Houses have been ready and willing to debate these issues in conference for months now. But time continues to tick by. It now seems clear that these bills will die a quiet death at the end of this session because the NRA opposes certain targeted gun laws passed by this body to keep the guns out of the hands of children, out of the hands of juveniles, and out of the hands of criminals. 
   There is no one I have ever spoken to who believes a gun should not be sold without a trigger lock. There is no one I have ever spoken to who believes an assault weapon should be purchased by a juvenile. There is no one I have ever spoken to who believes we should not plug the loophole in my assault weapons legislation which permits the importation of clips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets--even the NRA agrees to that. And there is no one I know, outside of the National Rifle Association, who believes that two teenagers from Columbine should be able to go to a gun show and buy two assault  weapons with no questions asked. That is what this is all about. 
   As a result, all of the important issues we debated will go un-addressed: Gang violence, juvenile detention, firearm regulation reform, and a host of other problems will go unsolved. 
   Mr. President, this demonstrates just how deeply these bodies are dominated by this one special interest group--these people who fervently resist any regulations on weapons, no matter how mild, no matter how targeted, and no matter how much the American people want it. 
   The Columbine incident shocked this nation to its core and this Congress to action. But since we passed that bill one year ago, we have continued to see tragedy after tragedy, all because we live in a nation awash with guns, and we won't stand up to the NRA. 
   In Atlanta, we saw a distressed day trader gun down his family and colleagues. In California, a hateful bigot killed a postal worker and then wounded five others at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills. The pictures of those young children being led away from the scene of the tragedy were not only heart-wrenching, but also clearly depicted the trickle-down of gun crimes in this country. Now the victims are young children. 
   We even saw one six year old child bringing a handgun to school, apparently in retaliation for a slight the day before, and use that gun to kill another 6 year old. 
   And every day since Columbine, another 12 children have died from gunshot wounds, in incidents of gun violence that go relatively unreported, and with outcomes not so public. 
   These incidents will never stop until we do something to stop them. The death rate will never be diminished unless we stand up and take action. 
   The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill is not an over-reaching statement with regards to gun control. Rather, the provisions in the juvenile justice bill are small, reasonable measures to make a difference in the lives of our children. None of those provisions should be controversial. Let me describe just a few of these provisions. 
   This bill includes four common sense provisions to address gun violence: 
   A ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines; 
   Closing the gun show loophole; 
   Requiring safety locks with every handgun sold in America; 
   And my provision to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines. 
   Let me talk just a bit about this last amendment--my amendment to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. 
   The ``Large Capacity Ammunition Magazine Import Ban Act of 1999'' passed the Senate as an amendment to S. 254 by voice vote, after a motion to table failed 59-39. The same amendment, offered by Judiciary Chairman HENRY HYDE on the House floor, passed by unanimous consent in the House. 
   This amendment would stop further importation of large-capacity ammunition clips by eliminating the grandfather clause--as to these imported clips--that was included in the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. Large-capacity ammunition clips are ammunition feeding devices, such as clips, magazines, drums and belts, which hold more than ten rounds of ammunition. 
   This legislation would not ban the sale or possession of clips already in circulation. And the domestic manufacture of these clips is already illegal for most purposes. Under current law, U.S. manufacturers are already prohibited from manufacturing large capacity clips for sale to the general public, but foreign companies continue to do so. 
   As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was not our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high capacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the importation of clips already on their way to this country. Instead, BATF has allowed millions of foreign clips into this country, with no true method of determining date of manufacture. 
   In fact, from July, 1996 to March, 1998, BATF approved over 2.5 million large-capacity clips for importation into the country. And recently, that number has sky-rocketed even further. Between March of 1998 and March of last year, BATF approved more than 11.4 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. Since that time, there have been millions more as well. 
   The clips come from at least 20 different countries, from Austria to Zimbabwe. 
   These clips come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, 90, or even 250 rounds per clip. 
   At least 40,000 clips of 250-rounds came from England; 
   Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy; 
   10,000 clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic; 
   156,000 30-round clips came from Bulgaria; 
   And the list goes on, and on. 
   Mr. President, 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing of other men, women and children. 
   It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often used for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling. 
   Yet this amendment, along with the rest of the juvenile justice bill, remains stalled in conference. 
   And the juvenile justice bill being held hostage by the NRA is not just a gun bill. That legislation also contains countless provisions to stem the tide of youth violence in general: 
   A comprehensive package of measures I authored with Senator HATCH to fight criminal gangs; and 
   The James Guelff Body Armor Act, which contains reforms to take body armor out of the hands of criminals and put it into the hands of police; 
   And the Senate bill also provides for: 
   A new $700 million juvenile justice block grant program for states and localities, representing a significant increase in federal aid to the states for juvenile crime control programs, including: 
   Additional law enforcement and juvenile court personnel; 
   Juvenile detention facilities; and 
   Prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble before they turn to crime. 
   The bill contains provisions regarding the nature and amount of contact allowed between juvenile offenders and adult prisoners. These are important provisions relating to the safety of youth offenders that have been worked out through extensive negotiations for months, yet they, too, remain in limbo. 
   The bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, through the implementation of graduated sanctions to ensure that subsequent offenses are treated with increasing severity 
   The bill reforms juvenile record systems, through improved record keeping and increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and schools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in California can know if he has committed violent offenses in Arizona; and 
   And the bill extends federal sentences for juveniles who commit serious violent felonies. 
   There are some key issues that still need to be resolved, including the issue of who gets to decide whether a young offender is tried as a juvenile or an adult. It is my hope that the conference committee will give judges greater discretion in this area. But if the conference committee never meets, this issue--like so many others--can never be resolved. 
   Mr. President, all of the common-sense provisions in this bill are now at risk of disappearing without a trace, and I urge the majority to proceed with the conference and come to a compromise. 
   Let me now turn to more recent events. 
   Mr. President, this past weekend, we saw a formidable gathering of people united in a common cause--750,000 at the National Mall and tens of thousands in other cities throughout America--marching in support of common-sense gun laws. 
   These mothers, fathers, sons and daughters gathered together for one purpose--to tell this Congress that enough is enough. These moms and others were saying that we can, should and shall put an end to the violence that is taking 80 lives a day--12 of them children--in our nation. We must pass sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.  
   There are those who will try to dismiss the Million Mom March as a one-shot affair, a day in the sun on the Mall, but I say such cynics do not know the power of a woman whose child is in jeopardy. Such cynics do not know the power of a million women united on behalf of the safety of their families. 
   There are those, such as the National Rifle Association, who have even sought to deride the Million Mom March, as ``a political agenda masquerading as motherhood'' in full-page newspaper ads. 
   While at the same time bragging about working out of the White House after November, the NRA said it was ``shameful to seize a cherished holiday for political advantage.'' 
   But women throughout America have a message for the NRA--your time is up. It's a message so well articulated in a Tapestry on the Million Mom March web site. On this Tapestry, thousands of women have had their say about the senseless violence taking more than 30,000 lives a year. 
   I'll pick out just a couple of these messages to share with you today. Here's Kerry Foley, Chevy Chase, Maryland: ``I am the mother of three and I am an emergency medicine doctor. I have seen the carnage of gun violence first hand--a high school student shot dead while mowing the lawns by a mentally ill person. A man who shot his brother to death in an argument over the TV remote. We are not safe. Our kids are not safe. I'll be at the march to add my voice to all of yours.'' 
   And Karen Farmer, from Littleton, Colorado, ``The right for my child to live, far outweighs anyone's `right' to own anything.'' 
   Mr. President, I ask approval to submit this Tapesty as part of the RECORD. It demonstrates the spirit, determination and commitment of women throughout America, the one force that I believe can finally break the gridlock that is keeping even the most common-sense gun laws from passage. 
   This march was the culmination of a lot of pent up grief and frustration at the inability of Congress to act. 
   On August 10, 1999, a hate-filled madman opened fire at a Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, California, wounding five people, three of them children. 
   This was but the latest mass shooting across our great country. Who can forget the horrors of Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Littleton, Colorado to name just a few. But on that day last August, the dream of the Million Mom March was born. 
   Mothers from New Jersey to California shared that dream and joined together this past Sunday, urging Congress to pass the four common-sense gun measures held in Conference Committee as part of the Juvenile Justice Bill since last June. And urging this Congress to approve new legislation for firearm licensing and registration. 
   Mr. President I have been working on this issue for months, with community groups dedicated to preventing gun violence, with law enforcement officials, other Senate offices and even individuals involved in the Million Mom March. 
   As Donna Dees-Thomases, organizer of the March, said ``licensing and registration is the foundation of sane gun laws. Without these basic measures, even current gun laws cannot be adequately enforced.'' 
   The product of our work is the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2000,'' a bill I introduced last week with the support of my colleagues, Senators LAUTENBERG, BOXER and SCHUMER. 
   I began working on this legislation after the shooting at the Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, when I became determined to find a better way to ensure that only responsible citizens have access to firearms. 
   I believe that this legislation will begin to address three key problems facing our nation. 
   First, too many criminals are finding it easy to obtain firearms. Our system of background checks has been a success--the Brady Law has stopped more than 500,000 felons, fugitives, stalkers and mentally ill applicants from obtaining firearms. 
   However, under the Brady Law a background check is required only when a gun is purchased through a licensed dealer. Gun shows and private sales have long provided a safe haven for those persons who are not legally entitled to buy a gun. 
   Only with a comprehensive system of licensing and records of sale can we hope to limit these illegal sales. By requiring that gun owners be licensed, that every transfer be processed through a licensed gun dealer, and that gun dealers record the transfer of guns, we will begin to limit the number of gun sales that fall between the cracks. 
   Second is the problem of gun tracing. Gun tracing is the process through which law enforcement can take a gun found at the scene of a crime and, as the name suggests, trace it back to its owner. In this way, many crimes have been solved and many dangerous perpetrators caught. 
   But without a national system of licensing and sale records, and without universal background checks, law enforcement often finds it impossible to track down the perpetrators of these crimes. Guns left behind, even those with serial numbers, turn out to be no more than dead ends for criminal investigators, because they may have been sold many times--even legally--with no background checks, no records kept, and no accountability. 
   If we begin to record the transfers of these guns, we make it easier for law enforcement to trace a crime gun to the perpetrator of the crime. 
   For this same reason, Senator KOHL and I recently introduced legislation to further the efforts of law enforcement to establish so-called ``gun fingerprints''--ballistics information that will allow law enforcement to trace those who use guns in crime even when the firearm itself is not found at the crime scene. 
   Third, and what I believe is the primary benefit of this legislation, we place a greater burden of responsibility on those persons who own dangerous firearms. 
   As Mike Hennessy, the Sheriff of San Francisco, recently pointed out in a letter to me, ``Most importantly,'' this legislation ``places responsibility for the tragic consequences of children having access to firearms squarely where it belongs, on the adult owner.'' 
   This legislation provides criminal penalties for those adults who knowingly or recklessly allow a child access to a firearm, if the child then uses the firearm to seriously injure or kill another person. 
   Mr. President, the problem of firearm injury goes beyond just criminal violence. Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not know how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. 
   In fact, according to a study released early last year, in 1996 alone there were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than 18,000 firearm suicides--many of which could have been prevented if the person intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by somebody else. 
   And think of this--if a man goes into a barber shop to have his hair cut, the barber is licensed. When we women go to a beauty shop to have our hair done, the cosmetologist is licensed. If we want to fish, we get a license. If we want to hunt, we must get a license. If you're a pest control eradicator, you must have a license. If you want to drive a car--not a lethal weapon in itself--but certainly a lethal weapon if irresponsible people are driving it, you get a license. And as a matter of fact, you register the automobile. 
   When a 16-year-old boy wants to drive a car, we make him prove that he knows the rules of the road, and that he can operate a car safely and responsibly. But if that 16-year-old uses his hard-won new license to drive to a gun dealer, he faces no written safety test, and no demonstration of proficiency whatsoever. It is time to recognize that a firearm is at least as dangerous as an automobile. 
   These are the issues--keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, tracking down criminals once they have used a gun in the commission of a crime, and making sure that gun owners know how to safely use and store their weapons. 
   I know that no single piece of legislation can solve the problems of gun violence in America. But in order to begin addressing these issues, I have introduced a bill that will require that all future transfers of handguns or semi-automatic guns that 
   can take detachable magazines be recorded, and their owners be licensed. 
   Now let me first discuss why the bill covers the guns that it does.  
   The bill covers handguns because statistically, these guns are used in more crime than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all firearm homicides involve a handgun. 
   And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can accept detachable magazines, because these are the assault weapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives in the shortest period of time. A gun that can take a detachable magazine generally also take a large capacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and you have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent years. 
   Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent the greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children in this nation. Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept detachable magazines will remain exempt. 
   Now as to those firearms that will be covered by the bill, there are two requirements placed on prospective gun owners. 
   Regarding the licensing requirement first, this legislation requires that every person wishing to own a firearm covered by this bill must obtain a license--either from the federal government or from a state program that has been certified by the federal government. 
   In order to obtain a license, a person will have to provide proof of identity, and be legally entitled under federal law to own a gun. This will entail providing several things to federal or local law enforcement: 
   Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and address; 
   Submit a thumb print; 
   Submit a current photograph; 
   Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information is true and that the applicant is qualified under federal law to possess a firearm; 
   Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring knowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal responsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined by the state or federal authority; 
   Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands of juveniles--this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties for anyone failing to do so; 
   And undergo state and federal background checks. 
   Once an individual has received the license from the Treasury Department, that single license entitles the licensee to own or purchase any firearm covered by this bill. Only one license is required, no matter how many firearms are purchased. 
   Licenses will cost $25 maximum and be renewable every five years. They can be revoked anytime if the licensee becomes disqualified from owning a gun under federal law. 
   Right now, the United States is one of only two countries--along with the Czech Republic--that does not have a firearm licensing system. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why children under 15 in this country are 12 times more likely to die from gunfire than the children of 25 other industrialized nations combined. 
   Only America, so advanced in other ways, remains so backward in how we regulate guns and gun owners. I believe that it is time to listen to the American people, and to enact common sense, reasonable legislation to ensure that all gun owners become responsible gun owners, and that guns themselves can be used more effectively to track down perpetrators of gun violence. 
   The second requirement of this legislation is that all future transfers of firearms covered by this bill be recorded by a licensed gun dealer. 
   This record of sale provision means that guns that are transferred in the future will, effectively, be registered. Registration is not a complicated issue, and it is one that every American will understand. We register many things in this country that are far less dangerous than firearms. 
   We register cars and license drivers; 
   We license barbers and cosmetologists: 
   We register pesticides; 
   We register animal carriers and researchers; 
   We register gambling devices; and 
   We register a whole host of other goods and activities--even ``international expositions,'' believe it or not, must be registered with the Bureau of International Expositions! 
   The American people already support national gun registration overwhelmingly, despite a concerted campaign by some to change their minds. 
   By requiring that firearm sales and transfers be recorded, we will establish some accountability for the use and care of those guns. Law enforcement will be able to track crime guns back to their legal owners, so owners will therefore need to be more careful about storing their guns so they are not stolen and also in reporting gun sales--nobody wants to be responsible for a crime committed by someone else. 
   As San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessy wrote to me, ``By requiring every transfer of handguns and semi-automatic firearms to be made through a licensed dealer, a chain of ownership can be established that can assist law enforcement in identifying firearms used in the commission of crimes.'' This record requirement is not so we can target law abiding citizens, but rather so that law enforcement can quickly apprehend criminals who use guns in crime. 
   Firearms dealers already keep careful track of gun sales, and submit serial numbers to the ATF for later use in gun tracing. The new record of sale requirement will essentially mean that this same process will be expanded to all covered firearms. 
   Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation: 
   Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 and $5,000. 
   Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will also result in penalties between $500 and $5,000; 
   Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years in prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law enforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the straw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy access to a continuing flow of guns; 
   And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a firearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to kill or seriously injure another person. 
   Mr. President, the Million Mom March was just the beginning of a powerful movement for sensible gun laws. Like the women activists before them, mothers and others who led the fight to abolish child labor, to establish juvenile courts, to improve child care and broaden health coverage, the participants in this March are now united behind a cause that we cannot afford to ignore: Sane, common-sense gun laws; child-safety locks on handguns; a ban on minors buying assault weapons; closing the gun-show loophole that allows buyers to get around background checks; prohibiting the import of high-capacity ammunition magazines; and finally licensing gun owners and registering firearms. After all, we ask people to get licenses to drive a car and we register automobiles; why not gun-owners and firearms? 
   I urge the Senate to pass the juvenile justice bill, and to continue the fight against gun violence demanded by those million people this past weekend.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, earlier today, Senator CRAIG spoke on the floor about licensing and registration. I just wanted to correct one statement he made. 
   Senator CRAIG said that ``The reality of licensing gun owners and registering firearms is something that almost all Americans have viewed as an anathema for a long while. Why? Because they really do believe that a gun once acquired is private property and it is no business of the government that they should know about it.'' 
   Of course guns are private property, but the facts do not support the contention that the American people view licensing and registration as an ``anathema.'' 
   According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last year, 90 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans support mandatory registration of any type of gun or firearm.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to grant United States citizenship to Vijai Rajan. Ms. Rajan is a twenty-four year old permanent resident from India whose naturalization application was denied because of physical disabilities that make it impossible for her to take the oath of allegiance. 
   Ms. Rajan has lived in the United States since she was four months old. Her sister, Inbhu, was born in Cincinnati and is an American citizen by right of her birth in the United States. Her father Sunder Rajan became a naturalized citizen in 1980. But Ms. Rajan's mother Shakunthala, was not naturalized until 1994, just after Vijai's 18th birthday. If both parents had become citizens before Rajan turned 18, she would have automatically qualified for citizenship. 
   Unfortunately, due to this peculiar circumstance, the law now requires that Ms. Rajan undergo the rigors of the regular naturalization process, including taking the oath of allegiance, before she can become a United States citizen. 
   An anomaly in the law has resulted in Ms. Rajan being left out of her family's American dream, for no other reason than because her physical disabilities prevent her from taking the oath of allegiance. Ms. Rajan suffers from cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, seizures, and Crohn's disease. 
   American citizenship is the most visible sign of one's attachment to the United States. The naturalization process, including the oath of allegiance, should be credible, and it must be accorded the formality and ceremony appropriate to its importance. I would not support any steps that would detract from the meaningfulness, solemnity, and dignity of this time-honored tradition. 
   In 1952, when Congress codified the requirements for becoming an American citizen, it required that the oath contain five elements: (1) support for the Constitution; (2) renunciation of prior allegiance; (3) defense of the Constitution against all enemies; (4) true faith and allegiance; and (5) a commitment to bear arms or perform noncombatant service when required. 
   I believe these principles should remain intact. But I also believe that we should carry out these ideals with compassion and sufficient flexibility that persons who are so severely disabled, like Ms. Rajan, are not automatically disqualified from becoming U.S. citizens. 
   I believe the case of Vijai Rajan is compelling and warrants Congress' immediate consideration. Moreover, I am aware that there are other cases in which a physical disability has prevented an otherwise qualified person from becoming an American citizen. I intend to work to enact legislation that will give the Attorney General the discretion to act on such compelling cases without having to resort to a private act of Congress. 
   In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of Vijai Rajan.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on May 21, students and former students, their parents, teachers and administrators of Los Altos High School, will come together in Southern California to show their appreciation, and express their thanks and best wishes to Don Gunderson, who is retiring this year after 41 years as a music educator. 
   Don Gunderson began his teaching career at the halfway point of President Dwight Eisenhower's second term, working with his mentor in Washington state, teaching instrumental music in the junior high, as well as music to elementary schoolers. Three years later, in 1961, Mr. Gunderson came to Anaheim, California to be the band, orchestra and choir director at Crescent Junior High School, which was still in construction when he was hired. Five years later, he began a very distinguished eleven-year career as the band and orchestra director at Savannah High School in Anaheim. In 1978, Mr. Gunderson rose to the college ranks, serving as head of the jazz and student teacher programs at California State University at Fullerton. 
   Three years later, in 1981, Don Gunderson decided to return to high school instruction at Los Altos High School, in Hacienda Heights. At that time, Los Altos was one of the largest musical programs in Southern California, with a strong reputation in marching band competitions. For the next nineteen years, Los Altos High School would become more than just the home of one of Southern California's largest marching bands--it would be the site of one of our nation's internationally recognized music education programs. The Los Altos Entertainment Unit has performed at the Fiesta Bowl pageant twice and marched in the Tournament of Roses Parade four times. They've been here in Washington, where they performed at the White House, and traveled for performances in Florida and the Bahamas. 
   Don Gunderson began building the music program's international credentials in 1982, when he led the Los Altos Entertainment Unit on a two week tour of England and Scotland. Knowing that very few, if any Americans, knew of Hacienda Heights, Mr. Gunderson was prepared when inquiring Brits asked where in the world is Hacienda Heights: ``We're not far from Disneyland'' was his reply. It's safe to say that after that 1982 trip, along with a return visit ten years later as guests of the British Military as part of the prestigious Royal Tournament, the people of Britain know how to find Hacienda Heights on a map. The same can be said for music-lovers that had the good fortune to see and hear Los Altos perform in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. The Los Altos Entertainment Unit has been the recipient of countless awards and achievements. Los Altos was designated the Official Youth Band of the 1984 Summer Olympics, and was crowned three times as marching band champions at the Southern California Tournament of Champions. And that's just the marching band, color guard and dance team. Don Gunderson brought to Los Altos a commitment to a total music program, and strived to establish the same standard of excellence to the orchestral and jazz programs.  
   Perhaps just as significant are the signs of recognition and respect given to this program in ways other than award ceremonies. Go to a Friday night football game at Los Altos and you're sure to find a few young people from other high schools in Southern California in the stands not to see the football team, but to watch and hear the Entertainment Unit. Those same football games certainly sparked the imaginations of young elementary and junior high school students, who would come home interested in learning music and being a part of the Entertainment Unit. Come to the football field on a night when the Entertainment Unit is rehearsing and you're sure to find parents, students, teachers, former students, and even students from other high schools in the stands. Trace the career paths of those who learned from Don Gunderson and yes, you'll find those who have gone on to rewarding careers in music and music education. However, there are many more alumni of the Los Altos Entertainment Unit that pursued other careers, but they carry with them lessons learned from Don Gunderson on football fields, concert halls, or the band room that go beyond musical notes on a page--lessons in teamwork, preparation, determination, and excellence. 
   Mr. President, those who have learned and applied these and countless other lessons from Don Gunderson will have an opportunity to say thanks in a few short weeks. Let me join them in expressing my admiration to a man who has brought the joy of music to thousands of students and parents, and to countless more around the world who have heard the stirring opening fanfare, ``Conquistadores.'' Perhaps more important, let me express my own thanks to Don Gunderson for the honor and inspiration he has brought to the teaching profession for more than forty years. To borrow from the Los Altos motto, Don Gunderson has engaged and conquered. 
   I wish Don Gunderson, his wife Judy and his family, all the very best.

I want him to know, as the ranking member on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I am fully supportive of that request. I believe the chairman, Senator BENNETT, is as well.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the conference report on the African Growth and Opportunity Act and to express my deep disappointment that the conference decided to strip out of the report the amendment which has been spoken about on this floor which addresses HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. This is an amendment I offered with the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD. 
   This amendment was accepted by the Senate, and it was intended to provide African countries experiencing an HIV/AIDS crisis with the ability to institute measures consistent with the World Trade Organization intellectual property rules that are designed to ensure the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical technology to afflicted populations. 
   We offered this amendment because we believed the act inadvertently threatened to undermine the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa. Our amendment was a simple, commonsense approach consistent with international law to fix this oversight. I believe the action of the conference in stripping this amendment was unconscionable. I found it especially disappointing because my office and staff had been working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. ROTH, to develop compromise language that met our concerns and would be acceptable to the conference. 
   Chairman ROTH negotiated in good faith, and he and the other Senate conferees--Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. BIDEN, and Mr. BAUCUS--wanted to do the right thing. Unfortunately, as I understand it, because of the way in which the House and Senate Republican leadership dealt with this conference, the majority leader and the Speaker, as I have been told, decided my amendment was to be eliminated and presented a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the conferees. The conference was never really even given a chance to address this issue. 
   Perhaps they did not understand the full impact of what is happening in Africa, and in these remarks I hope to make both the extent and the nature of the AIDS crisis better known. I say this as someone who supports the legislation. I voted in favor of it. I believe the underlying principles of this legislation--opening up new possibilities for economic engagement and trade between the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa--are good ones. I know the countries of this region want to receive the benefits of the bill which will assist their economic development and promote democracy in the region. 
   I said in earlier remarks the problem is that the way things are going, there will not be an Africa left for this bill to help. I think people underestimate the impact of that statement. What I hope to do in these remarks is talk about the scope of the problem, give specific country reports, talk about the economic, social, and political impact of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, the need for affordable access to pharmaceuticals, what compulsory licensing and parallel importing is, and why the Feinstein-Feingold amendment is necessary. 
   I want to talk about drug companies' revenues from these drugs and what else is to be done. 
   But before I do so, I acknowledge the fact that this morning the White House has signed an Executive order to carry out the provisions of the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. 
   At this point, I will read into the RECORD the following letter, dated May 10:  
   I am pleased to inform you that today I will sign an Executive Order that is intended to help make HIV/AIDS-related drugs and medical technologies more accessible and affordable in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. The Executive Order, which is based in large part on your work in connection with the proposed Trade and Development Act of 2000, formalizes U.S. government policy in this area. It also directs other steps to be taken to address the spread of HIV and AIDS in Africa, one of the worse health crises the world faces. 
   As you know, the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken a terrible toll in terms of human suffering. Nowhere has the suffering been as great as in Africa, where over 5,500  people per day are dying from AIDS. Approximately 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected, and, of those infected, approximately 11.5 million have died. These deaths represent more than 80 percent of the total HIV/AIDS-related deaths worldwide. 
   To help those countries most affected by HIV/AIDS fight this terrible disease, the Executive Order directs the U.S. Government to refrain from seeking, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revision of any law or policy imposed by a beneficiary sub-Saharan government that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. This order will give sub-Saharan governments the flexibility to bring life saving drugs and medical technologies to affected populations. At the same time, the order ensures that fundamental intellectual property rights of U.S. businesses and inventors are protected by requiring sub-Saharan governments to provide adequate and effective intellectual property protection consistent with World Trade Organization rules. In this way, the order strikes a proper balance between the need to enable sub-Saharan governments to increase access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies and the need to ensure that intellectual property is protected. 
   I know that you preferred that this policy be included in the Conference Report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000, as did I. However, through this Executive Order, the policy this Administration has pursued with your support will be implemented by the U.S. Government. The Executive Order will encourage beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to build a better infrastructure to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS as they build better lives for their people. At the same time, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 will strengthen African economies, enhance African democracy, and expand U.S.-African trade. Together, these steps will enable the United States to forge closer ties with our African allies, broaden export opportunities for our workers and businesses, and promote our values around the world. 
   Thank you for your leadership on this critically important issue. 
   Sincerely, BILL CLINTON.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the President for this Executive order. It is the right thing to do and it is a major help. I very much hope that the African countries will make use of this Executive order and acquire the necessary pharmaceuticals that we here in this country know can extend the lives and well-being of people. 
   Almost 1 year ago, on May 11, the World Health Organization declared that HIV/AIDS is now the world's most deadly infectious disease. As of December of last year, the AIDS Epidemic Update, published by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, U.N. AIDS, and the World Health Organization, notes the following:  
   As the 20th century draws to a close, some 33.6 million men and women worldwide face a future dominated by a fatal disease, unknown just a few decades ago. According to new estimates from the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, 32.4 million adults and 1.2 million children will be living with HIV by the end of 1999. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of the HIV/AIDS with close to 70 percent of the global total of HIV positive people. Most will die in the next 10 years, joining the 13.7 million Africans who have already died, and leaving behind shattered families and crippled prospects for development.  
   Indeed, the hardest hit African companies face infection rates in excess of 22 percent--that is 22 million people--an overall rate of infection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa eight times the rate of infection worldwide. In some countries of southern Africa, 20 to 30 percent of the population of the country itself are infected. 
   You can see from this chart the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. You see the major countries affected that I 
   am speaking about--Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia--leading with 16 to 32 percent of adults infected with HIV. The next tranche of 8 percent to 16 percent is in the orange and it drops down from there. In South Africa, you have almost 13 percent of the population infected; that is, 2.8 million people. In Zimbabwe, it is 25.8 percent; that is, 1.4 million people. In Uganda, it is 9.5 percent; that is, 870,000. In the Central African Republic, it is almost 11 percent; that is 170,000. In Zambia, it is 19 percent; that is 730,000. In Kenya, it is 11.6 percent or 1.6 million people. 
   The destruction caused by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, by far, surpasses the devastation caused by famine, war, and even genocide in Rwanda. According to the United Nations, over 10 times as many people were killed by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa last year as by war. This chart shows the estimated adult and child deaths from HIV/AIDS during 1998--2 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, out of a global total of 2.5 million. You see why this is pandemic today, actually exceeding the bubonic plague in Europe centuries ago. 
   The devastation caused by AIDS has dramatically reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from the highs witnessed in the early to mideighties, before the devastating effect of AIDS began to be felt. This chart shows that in Botswana, which is this line, life expectancy has fallen from the age of 61 to age 50. In Zimbabwe, it fell from 59 to 47. In Zambia, it fell from age 50 to 38 years. In Malawi, it fell from age 45 to 40 years. In Uganda, it fell from 48 to 38 years. 
   If the present trends continue, life expectancy--already shortened by a decade or more in many sub-Saharan African countries--is projected to fall more dramatically still. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy is expected to decline by 26 years by 2010, from the age of 59 to the age of 33. That is more than half the life expectancy in little more than two decades. I never thought I would ever see that kind of devastation in one country. 
   AIDS is also affecting infant and child mortality rates, reversing the declines that have been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s. According to the U.N., AIDS, by 2010, the child mortality rates of children under 5 will increase by 200 percent in Botswana, by 100 percent in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, and Zambia by 100 percent, 
   and by 300 percent in Zimbabwe. 
   This becomes critical, if you understand that four pills can prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS from a mother to a child--four pills. 
   Look at these expected child mortality rates. 
   Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa will themselves be HIV infected. More than 500,000--half a million--babies were infected this past year by their mothers, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   As these statistics in the U.N. AIDS Report that I cited attest, sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. 
   Mr. President, it is not just adults who are being killed by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Out of 510,000 children killed by AIDS throughout the entire world, 470,000 were African children. That is 92 percent of the world's total. 
   What does that say for the future? Almost a half million children are killed in one continent alone. For anyone who has ever been a mother or a father, a grandmother or a grandfather, this number is mind numbing. 
   Beyond the carnage of the deaths, this disease has the potential to destabilize already fragile political and economic systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   The United Nations reports that 23.3 million adults and children are infected with the virus, up from 22 million a couple of years ago. Africa has only 10 percent of the world's population, but it has 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people. 
   That is what this chart shows. And it is shocking. 
   Worldwide, there were 5.6 million new AIDS infections in 1999--3.8 million of them in Africa. That is two-thirds of the new infections of AIDS taking place in Africa. Every day, 11,000 more people are infected with HIV--1 in every 8 seconds--and 10,000 of the 11,000 new HIV infections that take place around the world occur in this area. 
   Teachers, doctors, and nurses are today dying faster than they can be replaced. What does that say about the human development and the economic upward mobility of that country if the teachers, the doctors, and the nurses die faster than they can be replaced? In addition to the death toll striking down adults and children alike, as the ``Report on the Presidential Mission on 
   Children Orphaned by AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa'' notes:  
   Tragically, the worst is yet to come. During the next decade more than 40 million children will be orphaned by AIDS--40 million children orphaned by AIDS, and this  ``slow-burn disaster'' is not expected to peak until 2030. According to UNICEF, the HIV-AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa is having and will continue to have more impact on child survival and maternal mortality than all other emergencies combined. Without a doubt, AIDS has placed an entire generation of Africa's children in jeopardy.  
   Of the 13 million children orphaned by AIDS so far, 10 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   In Zimbabwe, there are currently 600,000 AIDS orphans, and the projection is that there will be more than 1 million by 2005. That is a 40-percent increase in orphans in one country alone in the next 5 years. Think about it for a minute. It is staggering. 
   There are rumors that some of the leaders of these countries don't want to deal with the drugs that can prevent passage from the mother to the child because they don't want to deal with the number of orphans that are going to be present in that country. I find this also shocking. You have more than 1 million orphans in 5 years growing up in poverty, without parents and with little or no social structure. 
   What does this say about the success of an African Trade Act, if you think about it? No teachers, no doctors, no nurses, and millions of orphans without parents, what does that say about economic and human development of a country? 
   In South Africa, there are already close to 250,000 AIDS orphans. The number is expected to skyrocket to 2 1/2 million by 2010. This is South Africa. This is from 1990 to 2010. Here we are at 2000, and this is what is anticipated to be the number of orphans by 2010. The number is 2.5 million in one country alone. How can this bill provide them with the resources to lead better lives in the future? What good will this bill do if this happens? 
   All told, over 34 million people in Africa have been infected by HIV since the pandemic began. That is the population of the State of California. And an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS--more than the entire population of Los Angeles and New York City combined. By 2005, if policies do not change, the daily death toll will reach 13,000--double what it is today--with nearly 4 million AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone. 
   A recent CNN Interactive story, ``AIDS in Africa: Dying by the Numbers,'' put the extent of the crisis in this way:  
   ..... The bubonic plague is reckoned to have killed about 30 million people in medieval Europe. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that AIDS deaths and the loss of future populations from the deaths of women of child-bearing age means that by 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it would otherwise.  
   In all of these countries in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be 71 million fewer people because of AIDS in the next 10 years. Just think about that for a minute. 
   I would also like to spend some time addressing the situation in several different countries in the region--some hard hit, some less so--so that my colleagues have a better sense of the chaos and disruption this disease is causing in individual countries and society. 
   The statistics that I cite below are drawn from UNA's World Health Organization epidemiological fact sheets on AIDS and includes data up to 1997. By all accounts, in almost every country in the region, the situation has grown much worse in the past 3 years. There could be little doubt about the pandemic. 
   Let's begin with Botswana. In Botswana, over 25 percent of the population between 15 and 49 is infected with HIV. That is 25 percent of the population. In Botswana's major urban areas, 40 percent of pregnant women are infected with HIV. From 1994 to 1997, the rate at which children have been orphaned in Botswana quadrupled. Almost 50 percent of Botswana's children under 15 are AIDS orphans. AIDS is responsible for over half of the deaths of all children under the age of five. 
   Let's look at Ethiopia. Ethiopia has a relatively low infection rate for sub-Saharan Africa, just 9.3 percent, with 5.6 million out of a population of 60 million infected. Over 35 percent of women in Ethiopia age 20 to 24 have HIV. That is a rate 3 times higher than men. In 1985, less than 1 percent of prostitutes in Addis Ababa were HIV positive. By 1990, that proportion had reached 54 percent. This is the point of spreading of the disease. Very little is being done about it. 
   Kenya currently has a relatively low rate of HIV infection. It is 11 percent. HIV prevalence is much higher in the major urban areas and is over 25 percent in Nairobi, where almost 90 percent of prostitutes are HIV positive. This is the wonderful city of Nairobi, where 90 percent of the prostitutes are spreading this disease heterosexually through the countryside. There are currently at least 350,000 AIDS orphans in Kenya, with the number expected to reach 1 million by 2005. By 2005, Kenya will have one million orphans, thanks to AIDS. That is a 200 percent increase. The cumulative number of deaths due to AIDS has risen from 16,000 in 1989 to 200,000 in 1995 and is expected to pass the one million mark this year. One million dead and one million orphans. 
   Kenya is a beautiful country. It is shocking what is happening. I hope some of the pharmaceutical companies that lobbied against this amendment are listening. Mr. President, 75 percent of AIDS cases in Kenya occur among adults age 20 to 45, the economically most productive time of the population. The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women in urban areas has risen from 2 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 1997. 
   Let's go to Malawi. It is estimated around 1 in 7 of the population, age 15 to 49, is HIV positive. That is 15 percent of the population, or 670,000 people. More than 80,000 people died of AIDS in 1 year alone, 1997, and Malawi has an accumulative death toll of over 450,000 people. I hope the pharmaceutical companies are listening. 
   Over 25 percent of women attending prenatal clinics in the urban centers test positive for HIV. Girls 15 to 24 years in age are six times more likely to be positive than boys the same age. Other infectious diseases are also on the upswing. Tuberculosis has tripled since the late 1980s, largely due to AIDS. By the end of 1997, over 6 percent of Malawi's children under 15 were orphans. 
   Let's look at Nigeria, Africa's most populace country, with 118 million people. More than 2.2 million people, around 5 percent, are HIV positive. Although Nigeria appears to have a relatively low incidence at present, trend lines are not comforting. The prevalence in pregnant women in urban areas 
   went from below 1 percent in 1991 to almost 7 percent in 1994. Likewise, the prevalence of HIV in prostitutes has more than doubled during this same period in urban areas, and increases from 3.9 percent to 23 percent in rural areas. Nearly 50 percent of the prostitutes in Lagos, the largest city, are HIV positive, spreading the disease. There were 350,000 AIDS orphans in Nigeria as of 1997. 
   Let's look at South Africa. About 3 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, 13 percent of a population of 43 million. Estimates are by 2010, 25 percent of South Africa's population will be HIV positive. By 1997, 180,000 children were orphaned. That figure will skyrocket to 2 million by 2010. There will be two million orphans in South Africa because of AIDS by 2010. Mr. President, 20 percent of pregnant women are infected. There are close to 400,000 deaths due to AIDS in South Africa since the beginning of the epidemic. 
   Let's go to Zambia, with an infection rate close to 20 percent. It is one of the hardest hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 1997, over 770,000 adults and children in Zambia were AIDS affected. There are more than 630,000 estimated AIDS cases. There have been 600,000 cumulative deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. After Uganda, Zambia has the highest proportion of children orphaned by AIDS in the world. By the end of 1997, 360,000 children, almost 10 percent of the children under 15, were orphaned because of AIDS. Four simple pills could prevent the transmission of AIDS from a pregnant woman to a child. Mr. President, 28 percent of adults in the urban area and 15 percent in rural areas are infected with HIV. 
   To give a sense of how the crisis is eroding social stability in Zambia, last year alone, 1,300 teachers in Zambia died from AIDS. Only 700 new teachers were available to take their place. How do you teach children to be able to get a job in the new marketplace that this bill hopes to bring about if the teachers  are dying of AIDS, if the children are orphaned? Zimbabwe has one of the worst AIDS epidemics in the world. Currently, 26 percent of all adults age 15 to 49 are infected with HIV, more than 1.5 million out of a total population of 5.5 million. 
   The United Nations Population Division has projected that over the next five years half of all child deaths in the country will be due to AIDS. 
   As in Zambia, by the end of 1997 there were over 360,000 AIDS orphans in Zimbabwe and, as I mentioned earlier, projections are for Zimbabwe to be faced with over 1 million AIDS orphans in the next five years. 
   The HIV/AIDS crisis is driving families in sub-Saharan Africa worn-down by widespread poverty to the brink of disaster, and eroding the ability of the regions governments to provide services while at the same time increasing the demand for them. This is especially true in health care, where AIDS-related illnesses sometimes account for almost half the hospital beds and in-patient days. 
   The transition to democracy in the region may also be imperiled, and economic growth may grind to a halt as a result of the AIDS crisis destabilizing social structures. 
   These numbers, and the impact this disease is having on individual counties in sub-Saharan Africa, is staggering, but it is difficult to capture the depth of the devastation and suffering in the region with statistics and charts. To try to give a better sense of the impact of HIV/AIDS, let me read the first few paragraphs from a story published in the Village Voice last year, part of a Pulitzer Prize winning series of articles by journalist Mark Schoofs. 
   Let me warn you: the following is not for the faint of heart or faint of stomach.  
   They didn't call Arthur Chinaka out of the classroom. The principal and Arthur's uncle Simon waited until the day's exams were done before breaking the news: Arthur's father, his body wracked with pneumonia, had finally died of AIDS. They were worried that Arthur would panic, but at 17 years old, he didn't. He still had two days of tests, so while his father lay in the morgue, Arthur finished his exams. That happened in 1990. Then in 1992, Arthur's uncle Edward died of AIDS. In 1994, his uncle Richard died of AIDS. In 1996, his uncle Alex died of AIDS. All of them are buried on the homestead where they grew up and where their parents and Arthur still live, a collection of thatch-roofed huts in the mountains near Mutare, by Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique. But HIV hasn't finished with this family. In April, a fourth uncle lay coughing in his hut, and the virus had blinded Arthur's aunt Eunice, leaving her so thin and weak she couldn't walk without help. By September both were dead. 
   The most horrifying part of this story is that it is not unique. In Uganda, a business executive named Tonny, who asked that his last name not be used, lost two brothers and a sister to AIDS, while his wife lost her brother to the virus. In the rural hills of South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province, Bonisile Ngema lost her son and daughter-in-law, so she tries to support her granddaughter and her own aged mother by selling potatoes. Her dead son was the breadwinner for the whole extended family, and now she feels like an orphan. 
   In the morgue of Zimbabwe's Parirenyatwa Hospital, head mortician Paul Tabvemhiri opens the door to the large cold room that holds cadavers. But it's impossible to walk in because so many bodies lie on the floor, wrapped in blankets from their deathbeds or dressed in the clothes they died in. Along the walls, corpses are packed two to a shelf. In a second cold-storage area, the shelves are narrower, so Tabvemhiri faces a grisly choice: He can stack the bodies on top of one another, which squishes the face and makes it hard for relatives to identify the body, or he can leave the cadavers out in the hall, unrefrigerated. He refuses to deform bodies, and so a pair of corpses lie outside on gurneys behind a curtain. The odor of decomposition is faint but clear. 
   Have they always had to leave bodies in the hall? ``No, no, no,'' says Tabvemhiri, who has worked in the morgue since 1976. ``Only in the last five or six years,'' which is when AIDS deaths here took off. Morgue records show that the number of cadavers has almost tripled since the start of Zimbabwe's epidemic, and there's been a change in who is dying: ``The young ones,'' says Tabvemhiri, ``are coming in bulk.'' 
   The wide crescent of East and Southern Africa that sweeps down from Mount Kenya and around the Cape of Good Hope is the hardest-hit AIDS region in the world. Here, the virus is cutting down more and more of Africa's most energetic and productive people, adults aged 15 to 49. The slave trade also targeted people in their prime, killing or sending into bondage perhaps 25 million people. But that happened over four centuries. Only 17 years have passed since AIDS was first found in Africa, on the shores of Lake Victoria, yet according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the virus has already killed more than 11 million sub-Saharan Africans. More than 22 million others are infected [and nobody cares]. 
   Only 10 percent of the world's population lives south of the Sahara, but the region is home to two-thirds of the world's HIV-positive people, and it has suffered more than 80 percent of all AIDS deaths. 
   Last year, the combined wars in Africa killed 200,000 people. AIDS killed 10 times that number. Indeed, more people succumbed to HIV last year than to any other cause of death on this continent, including malaria. And the carnage has only begun.  
   In addition to the devastating health impact, HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa is also threatening to undermine economic, social, and political stability in the region--the very issues which the African Growth and Opportunity Act is intended to address. 
   In Zimbabwe and Botswana, for example, where roughly one of every four people have AIDS, the disease has cut sharply into population growth with profound consequences. According to Karen Stanecki, chief of health studies for the U.S. Census Bureau:  
   The zero growth is coming because people are dying in their young adult years, not after leading full lives and then dying.  
   People are dying in the years when they're supposed to be most productive. 
   As World Bank President James Wolfensohn said at the United Nations this past January:  
   Many of us used to think of AIDS as a health issue. We were wrong. AIDS can no longer be confined to the health or social sector portfolios. AIDS is turning back the clock on development.  
   As the HIV epidemic deepens in Africa, it is leaving an economically devastated continent in its wake. 
   At the most simple level, already impoverished families that must care for a member who is ill with HIV/AIDS find that what little they had to pay for a child's education or invest for the future is now gone. 
   The United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS found that urban families in the Cote d'Ivoire, known as the Ivory Coast in this country, with a member sick from AIDS cut spending on their children's education in half and reduced food consumption by about 40 percent as they struggled to cover health care costs. 
   Moreover, as the epidemic has worsened, so have estimates of its effect on African economies, even without taking into account broader human welfare issues. 
   Indeed, because of the impact of HIV/AIDS, David Bloom, a professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health, warns that ``The whole economy [in Africa] could unravel.'' 
   In ``Confronting AIDS,'' the World Bank factored in labor supply issues and the amount to which health care would be financed out of savings to come up with a ``rough estimate'' of a 0.5 percent annual reduction in per capita GDP growth. I believe this estimate to be on the low side. 
   One-half of 1 percent may not seem like much. Indeed, for countries with relatively high growth rates such as Uganda, that kind of reduction will not seem to be immediately crippling, but a lower growth rate has a cumulative effect. 
   A country whose growth rate is 2 percent a year will increase its GNP per capita by 81 percent in one generation, or about 30 years. Each generation will live much better than the last. 
   However, if AIDS reduces growth to just 1.5 percent per year, the same country will increase its GNP per capita by only about 50 percent in the same period. 
   This chart shows the change in per capita GDP caused by AIDS in Kenya. The yellow is a no AIDS scenario, and one can see the enormous rise in GDP. The red is the AIDS scenario, even with the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and one can see how it is consequentially lower. 
   Thus, in Kenya, for example, UNAIDS estimates that while per capita GDP was estimated to increase from 5,600 Kenyan shillings in 1990 to over 6,000 Kenyan shillings by 2005 without AIDS, with the impact of AIDS per capita GDP will remain stagnant over the same period of time. 
   Likewise, in South Africa UNAIDS estimates that because of the impact of HIV/AIDS the Human Development  Index--which measures the level of human development through a formula based on life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, school enrollment, and real per capita GDP has dropped by over 15 percent from 1995 to the present. That is a 15-percent drop due to AIDS in 5 years. Without HIV/AIDS South Africa's HDI was projected to remain more or less the same. 
   Finally, the combined effects of HIV/AIDS on health, economic life, the social fabric, and political institutions, has created a genuine threat to future stability and security in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   That is why, at the initiative of Ambassador Holbrooke and Vice President GORE, the 15-member United Nations Security Council decided to address AIDS earlier this year. 
   As Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council:  
   In already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters is a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn, provides fertile ground for further infections.  
   And, as Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, said:  
   Visibly, the epidemic is eroding the social fabric of many communities. In its demographic, social and economic impact, the epidemic has become more devastating than war, in a continent where war and conflict appear to be endemic.  
   As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke said, if we do not work with Africa now to address the problems associated with the HIV/AIDS crisis, ``we will have to deal with them later when they will get more dangerous and more expensive.'' 
   It is in recognition of the destabilizing effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa that the Clinton-Gore administration has taken the step of designating AIDS a threat to U.S. national security interests, as reported the other week in the Washington Post. I believe the administration is to be congratulated for its recognition of the profound effects that this disease is having, and for this effort. 
   There are many explanations for why this pandemic is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa: Certainly the region's poverty, which has deprived Africans of access to health information, health education, and health care. Conflict, which has led to increases in refugee flows, and increases in prostitution have also played a role. Cultural and behavior patterns, which has led to sub-Saharan Africa being the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men, may also play a role. 
   Clearly, in addressing the challenges presented by this disease there needs to be considerable emphasis addressing the health care infrastructure of sub-Saharan Africa and on additional resources for education. I intend to address both these points later. 
   I also believe that if the international community is to be successful in meeting this challenge, we must make every effort to get appropriate medicine into the hands of those in need. 
   In the United States and much of the industrialized world, even as sub-Saharan Africa has been ravaged by the impact of HIV/AIDS, we have succeeded, in large part, in turning HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease; not curing it--that must still remain a top priority--but managing it. We have done so, in large parts, by developing effective pharmaceuticals and getting them to those in need. 
   Indeed, for too many years there were no effective drugs. 
   I remember, as Mayor of San Francisco, I was the first mayor to implement a program to deal with AIDS in the United States, and remember trying to manage this disease in its early days, when cause, let alone treatment, was unclear; when drugs were simply not available; when HIV/AIDS was devastating our community, and many, many promising young people--many of them my friends--were struck down in the prime of their lives; and when we simply did not know how big the crisis would get, or if our health care system could handle it. 
   So in some small way, I think I understand what policymakers in many sub-Saharan African countries are now going through. 
   Now, thanks to recent medical research, we do have effective medicine. For example, some recent pilot projects have had success in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering the anti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapine, NVP, during birth and early childhood. 
   In fact, new studies indicate NVP can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by as much as 80 percent. Just think of the statistics on orphans and HIV-infected children that could be stopped with four of these pills. NVP is given just once to the mother during labor and once to the child within three days of birth. 
   Three or four pills can mean that a child is prevented from being born with AIDS. 
   For just $4 a tablet--a little more than the cost of a large latte at Starbuck's, not a lot here but a great deal in Africa--this inexpensive drug regime has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against AIDS. Currently, however, less than 1 percent of HIV infected pregnant women have access to interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission. 
   In addition to such drugs as NVP, drug ``cocktails" administered in a treatment regimen known as HAART--highly active antiretroviral therapy--antiretroviral drugs can allow people living with AIDS to lead a normal life. And use of the drugs can lead to long-term survival rather than early death. Such treatment has proven highly effective in developed countries, including our own. 
   Although some pharmaceutical companies may try to tell you otherwise, most antiretrovirals drugs are relatively inexpensive to produce. AIDS Treatment News recently reported that:  
   AZT in bulk can be purchased for 42 cents for 300 mg from the worldwide suppliers; this price reflects profits not only to the manufacturer but also to the middleman bulk buyer. The same drug retails at my local pharmacy for $5.82 per pill. This ridiculous price bears no real relation to the cost of production.  
   Unfortunately--and inexplicably in my view--access for Africans to AIDS medications or ``antiretrovirals'' is perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the African epidemic. 
   According to an article, ``Poor Nations Ravaged by AIDS Need the Right Resources'' that appeared in the December 1, 1999 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association:  
   For as many years as antiretroviral therapies have been available, AIDS activists have accused pharmaceutical companies of price gouging and challenged them to reduce prices and cut their profit margins on drugs for people with HIV infection and AIDS. In a pilot drug access initiative launched in 1997 in Uganda, Co 3te d'Ivoire, Chile, and Vietnam, UNAIDS succeeded in negotiating discounts on drugs manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Merck & Co Inc, and Roche Laboratories. 
   In Uganda, the cost of dual antiretroviral drug therapy has been cut from $600 to $250 per month; triple combination therapy that used to cost $1000 per month is now between $500 and $600 (J Int Assoc Physicians AIDS Care. 1999;5:48-60). Dorothy Ochola, MD, coordinator of the drug access initiative in Uganda, said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has offered free laboratory monitoring of patients for 2 years. 
   While the program has helped hundreds of HIV-infected people in Uganda gain access to therapy, it is far from a cure-all. Along with government subsidies for drugs, the initiative offers less expensive drugs for palliative care and opportunistic infections, but patients must pay out of pocket for antiretroviral drugs. With a population of 21 million and the number of HIV-positive persons estimated at 930,000, Uganda's approximately 825 patients receiving antiretroviral drugs through the program are a drop in the bucket.  
   Unfortunately, it is true that even at reduced rates in all too many cases the cost of combination therapy is beyond the means of most people living with AIDS and governments in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Combination therapy in South Africa was estimated at $334 per month or $4,000 per year, and UNAIDS reports that Brazil treated 75,000 people with antiretrovirals in 1999 at a cost of $300 million--or, again, $4,000 per person. 
   I strongly believe that we have a strong moral obligation to try to save lives when the medications for doing so exist, and it is critical that the United States play a leadership role in the international community to increase access to life-saving drugs. 
   For example, the United States should not oppose African governments and donor agencies from achieving reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals  through negotiated agreements with drug manufacturers. 
   The British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of antiretrovirals, has already stated that it is committed to ``differential pricing,'' which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in Africa. And I say, hooray; one company. These efforts are to be commended, and it is my sincere hope that companies willing to adopt ``differential pricing'' will help African countries get the drugs they need at prices they can afford. 
   Now I will speak about compulsory licensing and parallel importing for a moment. 
   This is the issue raised by my amendment and now the President's Executive order. The United States must not oppose ``parallel importing'' and ``compulsory licensing'' by African governments to lower the price of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable, and more people in Africa will have access to them. 
   Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals can be purchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. Under compulsory licensing an African government could order a local firm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent holder. 
   Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under the World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health emergencies--and there can be little doubt that Africa is facing a health emergency of monumental proportions. 
   My amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Wisconsin, would have simply codified current administration policy--as the administration has now opted to do itself via Executive order--which states that the U.S. Government will not oppose efforts by governments of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to supply HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens through compulsory licensing or parallel importing. 
   This amendment did not create new policy or a new approach on intellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, know as TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or weakened. 
   There are few in this body as committed to the notion of strict protection of U.S. intellectual property rights as I am. 
   Just a few years ago, for example, when the United States and China were involved in a dispute over IPR protection for movies, music, and computer software, I worked with the administration to convince China that it was important to respect the rights of the patent holder and live up to its commitments to respect intellectual property rights. And, I am pleased to note, China's record since that time on IP issues has improved. 
   The compulsory licensing process under my amendment was fully consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection of intellectual property with a moral obligation to meet public health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. 
   According to an opinion I solicited from the Congressional Research Service on this question, the amendment I offered:  
   ..... would appear to be consistent with the TRIPS agreement since on its face it only prohibits U.S. government authorities, such as the U.S. Trade Representative (U.S.T.R.) From seeking a revocation of law or policy which offers adequate intellectual property rights protection consistent with the TRIPS agreement. ..... The TRIPS agreement permits compulsory licensing under certain conditions. .....  
   In other words, despite what some pharmaceutical companies have been saying behind closed doors about this amendment over the past few weeks, this amendment did not weaken intellectual property rights protection one iota. It left the bar exactly where it is right now. 
   Let me be clear about this: My amendment--and now the President's Executive Order--does not create new policy or a new approach on IP rights under TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or weakened. All it asked is that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. policy on ``compulsory licensing'' and ``parallel importing'' remain consistent with what is accepted under international trade law. 
   By doing so, this approach will allow the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs. 
   It was, or so I thought, a simple, common-sense approach to dealing with one facet of one of the most pressing and important national security and international health issues that we face in the coming decades: The HIV/AIDS pandemic currently sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Let me provide one example of why the approach adopted by my amendment, and now the President's Executive Order, is necessary. 
   On March 14 of this year, Doctor's Without Borders--the medical relief group that won the Nobel Prize last year--sent a letter to Pfizer calling on Pfizer to lower the price of fluconazole, a drug needed to treat cryptococcal meningitus, the most common systemic fungal infection in HIV-positive people, in developing countries. 
   As the Doctors Without Borders letter notes, in Thailand fluconazole is available for just $1.20 for a daily dose. Yet in Kenya and South Africa, the daily dose costs $17.84, almost 15 times higher. That is unconscionable and is greed in the ultimate. 
   What accounts for the difference in price? 
   In Thailand a generic version is available. In Kenya and South Africa the only supplier is Pfizer. 
   As Bernard Pecoul, director of the Doctors Without Borders Access to Essential Medicines Campaign has noted, ``People are dying because the price of the drug that can save them is too high.'' 
   As the March 14 Doctors Without Borders letter notes, ``While we appreciate that patents can be an important motor of research and development funding, there must be a balance to ensure that people in developing countries have access to life-saving medicines.'' I could not agree more. 
   Under pressure from Doctors Without Borders, Pfizer has since agreed to provide free fluconazole to South Africa. This situation never should have existed to begin with. 
   Without ``compulsory licencing'' and ``parallel importing,'' which would allow access to cheaper generic drugs, more people in sub-Saharan Africa will suffer and die. 
   So why, given that it represented a common sense approach to a devastating problem fully consistent with international trade law did my amendment meet such stiff opposition in conference? 
   After long and hard consideration, I have concluded that there can be only one possible answer to that question: Profits and corporate greed. 
   Simply put, the pharmaceutical companies which manufacture HIV/AIDS drugs would prefer to be able to sell drugs for $18 a dose rather than $1 per dose, with the additional $17 going straight to fattening the bottom line. 
   If there was a legitimate policy debate to be had, why did the opponents of including this provision in the bill not wage their fight out in the open? 
   The answer is because they had no arguments which would stand up to the light of day--so they restricted their activities to attacking this amendment behind closed doors, out of the public view. And they succeeded, in conference, with literally no one in the room except for a few members, in getting this amendment killed. 
   The pharmaceutical companies who were opposed to this amendment--opposed because they want to squeeze every last drop of profit from the suffering of the millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Saharan Africa--were successful, behind closed doors, in killing my amendment. 
   The revenue created from the sale of HIV/AIDS-related drugs is staggering. 
   Crixivan, used to treat HIV infections, produced $675 million in revenue for Merck, in 1998; Zithromax, used to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex in people with advanced HIV infections, produced over $1.04 billion in revenue for Pfizer, in 1998; Fluconazole, used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, produced $916 million in revenue for Pfizer, in 1998; Epivir, used in combination with AZT as a treatment option for HIV infection in adults and pediatric patients that are at least three months old, produced $595 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; Combivir, used as a treatment option for HIV infection in adults and adolescent patients that are at least twelve  years old, produced $442 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; AZT, used for the treatment of adults with AIDS, produced $248 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; Taxol, used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, produced over $1.2 billion in revenue for Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Zerit, used for the treatment of adults with advanced HIV infections, produced $551 million in revenue for Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Videx, used for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with advanced HIV that are intolerant to or deteriorating on AZT, produced $162 million in revenue for Bristol-Meyers 
   Squibb, in 1998; Invirase, used for advanced HIV infections, produced $397 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Hivid, used in combination with AZT for patients with advanced HIV, produced $65 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Famvir, used for the treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in HIV-infected patients, produced $172 million in revenue for SmithKline Beecham, in 1998; Gamimune N, used to prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected pediatric patients, produced $235 million for Bayer, in 1998; Biaxin, used to treat disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC), produced $1.25 billion in revenue for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; Novir, used in combination with nucleoside analogues for the treatment of HIV-infections, produced $250 million for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; Epogen, used to treat anemia related to AZT therapy, produced $1.38 billion in revenue for Amgen, in 1998; Sustiva, used to treat HIV-1 infections in combination with other antiretrovirals, produced $75 million in revenue for DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 1998. 
   Viramune, used to treat HIV-infected adults experiencing clinical or immunologic deterioration, produced $154 million in revenue for Boehringer Ingelheim, in 1998; Serostim, used for the treatment of AIDS-wasting and cachexia, produced $88 million in revenue for the Ares-Serono Group in 1998; Viracept, used to treat HIV infection when antiretroviral therapy is needed in adults and pediatric patients that are at least two years old, produced $530 million for Agouron Pharmaceuticals, in 1998; and Abelcet, used to treat aspergillosis, a fungal infection, produced $73 million for The Liposome Company, in 1998. 
   All of the above-mentioned drugs were among the 500 best selling drugs in the world, in 1998. 
   Driven in no small part by the profits on HIV/AIDS drugs, the pharmaceutical sector has proven to be one of the most profitable corporate sectors in the world. In 1999 pharmaceutical companies had a 18.6 percent return on revenues, which is 17 percent higher than the number two sector on the list, and a 16.5 percent return on assets, which is 7 percent higher than the number two sector on the list. 
   For shame, for opposing this amendment. 
   Merck, the producer of Crixivan, had an 18 percent return on revenues and a 17 percent return on assets. 
   Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the producer of Taxol, Zerit, and Videx, had a 21 percent return on revenues and a 24 percent return on assets. 
   Pfizer, the producer of Zithromax and Fluconazole, had a 20 percent return on revenues and a 15 percent return on assets. 
   Abbott Laboratories, the producer of Biaxin and Norvir, had a 19 percent return on revenues and a 17 percent return on assets. 
   Amgen, the producer of Epogen, had a 33 percent return on revenues and a 27 percent return on assets. 
   Ironically, the pharmaceutical companies would profit more from the approach embodied in my amendment than they do right now. Presently, most sub-Saharan African countries are not buying these drugs since they can not afford the price tag, so the pharmaceutical companies are not earning any money at all on these HIV/AIDS drugs in these countries. But if sub-Saharan African countries produced HIV/AIDS drugs through ``compulsory licensing,'' or purchased them by ``parallel importing,'' the pharmaceutical companies holding the patents on these drugs would receive royalties. 
   I have a very hard time understanding how lobbyists behind closed doors prevail on this body, in the middle of a world health crisis, to prevent the use of cheaper drugs when the figures I have documented are decimating these countries in a major public health emergency. I don't know how they sleep at night. I really do not. I don't know how they can look at a country with 1 million or 2 million AIDS-produced orphans and sleep at night. I really do not understand it. 
   Let me touch for a moment on what else is to be done. 
   By itself, the approach of the Feinstein-Feingold Amendment, and the President's Executive order, will not solve the problem of HIV/AIDS in Africa. It only addresses one area--an important area, but only one--of a large and complex problem. 
   As Dr. David Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States, wrote in ``The Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic'' in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, in April 1998:  
   More than a decade of experience has taught us how to control HIV/AIDS--we know what works. Many developed countries have successfully checked the spread of the epidemic. While development of therapy and a vaccine continue, prevention must be emphasized. The basic elements of prevention include education, behavior change, voluntary testing and counseling prevention of perinatal transmission, and political commitment. Each country must find the mix of methods appropriate to its particular conditions. 
   Education about HIV/AIDS is necessary but alone does not change the behavior of populations. Promotion of voluntary testing and counseling must complement education. Testing and counseling break the deadly silence around HIV/AIDS and empower individuals to make informed decisions and change behaviors. Breaking the silence also will begin to diffuse the stigma surrounding the disease. We have seen success with behavioral change in Uganda and Thailand, the only two less-developed countries with extensive capacity for voluntary testing and counseling. 
   It is known that perinatal transmission of HIV can be reduced by more than 50% by using antiretroviral therapy; however problems with access to these drugs limit their use in some countries. Transmission of HIV through breast-feeding and poor survival of orphans make the avoidance of disease via treatment for perinatal transmission more complex. We continue to work with international organizations, other governments, and pharmaceutical companies to lower costs and expand access to antiretroviral drugs. Current treatment for perinatal transmission, as well as use of antiretrovirals in general, in less-developed countries is also limited by the fact that very few people have been tested for HIV infection. 
   Treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is important to control the spread of HIV. One of the reasons HIV has spread so rapidly in Africa is that so many STDs go untreated. Untreated STDs break down natural barriers that prevent transmission. Access to even basic treatment for STDs remains a problem for many less-developed countries. 
   Perhaps most important in the global battle against HIV/AIDS is political commitment. Leaders at the national, provincial, and local levels of government must speak out about HIV/AIDS and encourage businesses and nongovernmental organizations to commit to work against the disease. I was encouraged by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, who put the HIV/AIDS threat at the top of the international agenda at the recent meeting of the United States-South Africa Joint Commission. They set an important example for leaders in developed and less-developed countries. 
   American medicine and public health have an important role to play in the global battle against HIV/AIDS by supporting international organizations such as the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank. 
   HIV/AIDS can be likened to the plague that decimated the population of Europe in the 14th century. While the modern epidemic affects people of all age groups, those of working age are at highest risk, posing potentially dire economic, social, and political consequences for the global community. Unfortunately, the world continues to devote greater attention and resources to traditional national security issues such as wars, postponing notice of an epidemic that, if left to spread unchecked, will kill more people than any of the terrible conflagrations that have so marked this century.  
   Because of the complexity of dealing with this issue, the Clinton-Gore Administration has asked Congress to commit $150 million toward vaccine research and AIDS treatment and prevention programs in Africa. 
   The Administration's initiative dedicates $100 million for the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS in Africa, Asia and other regions, doubling current U.S. funding of AIDS prevention efforts. An additional $50 million will go to the Vaccine Fund of the  Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations for research, and the purchase and distribution of vaccines for other infectious diseases in developing nations. 
   The Administration's initiative, announced by the Vice President this past January, also includes plans for a public-private partnership with U.S. business leaders active in Africa, with a goal of developing workplace education programs designed to end the stigma and ``break down the barriers against discussing AIDS.'' 
   The Vice President has also proposed specific funding for the U.S. military to work with armed forces in Africa to combat AIDS, an especially important initiative given the high rates of infection among soldiers. 
   I believe that it is crucial that we provide support for these efforts at least at the level the Administration has called for. 
   In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by my colleague from California, Senator BOXER, which calls for USAID to make HIV/AIDS a priority in foreign assistance funding and authorizes $2 billion over five years, with at least 50 percent targeted at sub-Saharan Africa, for a comprehensive coordinated effort to combat HIV/AIDS, including testing, education, treatment, and the provision of medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmissions. 
   I should note here that I was also disappointed that the Conference choose not to include an Administration initiative to provide a tax credit for the President's Millennium Vaccine Initiative tax credit proposal. This proposal would create a tax credit to encourage the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide. 
   Such a tax credit would encourage the development of a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. As Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative has put it: ``We need new prevention technologies, and the most critical one is a vaccine. ..... Ultimately, only a vaccine can stop the epidemic.'' 
   These actions and policies must be part of a larger development effort if we are to help these sub-Saharan African countries control the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
   Debt relief must also be part of a this larger development effort. It is unconscionable that many of these countries are spending more than a quarter of their precious export earnings on debt service payments to bilateral and multilateral creditors. The World Bank is correct when it declares that debt burdens at these levels are unsustainable. 
   The citizens of most of these countries are extremely poor, and they are burdened with unsustainable debts built up during the Cold War. These debts were accrued during the 1970s and 1980s by unaccountable governments. 
   Debt service diverts scarce resources away from spending on health care, health education, and poverty reduction initiatives in these countries. Debt servicing absorbs up to 40 percent of national revenue among a majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   We must lead the international community in efforts to write-off unsustainable debts so these countries can spend more money health education, infrastructure and services, as well as other development needs. 
   Let me conclude and thank the Senate for its forbearance. I am sorry for my display of emotion. I have watched people die of AIDS. I know what it is like. I can't imagine what it must be like in Africa where citizens maybe don't have a home, where they have an enormous cultural taboo attached to it, where there is no food, there is no medicine, and to know that a few pills can prevent the transmission of AIDS to a child for a nominal sum of money, and to know, literally, that in the coming years this could save 5 to 10 million people. 
   Just to think of what went on behind closed doors by lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies is unconscionable. The TRIPS agreement, the World Trade Organization, at a time of national health emergency, permits compulsory licensing and parallel importing. For these pharmaceutical companies that have made the kind of money they have made--and I know they will say they spent millions and millions on research and development; I have a member of my family who was director of research for one of the companies that worked on an antiretroviral--the bottom line is every one of these annual reports shows a substantial increase in profit. 
   Yet in little-known countries in sub-Saharan Africa, people are literally dying by the millions. Today we are considering a trade initiative bill which aims at giving them a better way of life. What is the better way of life if you can't live? What is the better way of life if you are dying of AIDS? What is a better way of life if you were 1 of 5 million orphans born in sub-Saharan Africa? What is a better life if you were born one of these HIV-infected orphans? 
   I find the act of pharmaceutical companies in opposing this amendment unconscionable. 
   I thank the Chair for its forbearance, and I thank the Senate. I also thank the administration for doing a major act of conscience in the production of an Executive order which will allow the purchase of these drugs at the lowest possible rates.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate's consideration of elementary and secondary education policy offers us an opportunity to begin to institute some fundamental reforms of American public education. 
   I fervently hope that the Senate does just that. I hope we will send to the President promptly a bill that brings about real change. 
   In the past week, we have debated several approaches and today we will debate another. 
   First, let me say that federal education funding is only 6 percent of total spending for elementary and secondary education. So in terms of dollars, the federal role is small. Public education spending and policy are largely set by local and state governments and that is the way it should be. 
   Nevertheless, federal dollars can and should leverage other dollars and in writing legislation to revamp federal education policy, we have the opportunity to stimulate some real reforms. 
   Why do we need reform? The numbers tell us a sad story. 
   American students lag behind their international counterparts in many ways. American twelfth grade math students are outperformed by students from 21 other countries, scoring higher than students from only two countries, Cyprus and South Africa. 
   Three-quarters of our school children cannot compose a well-organized, coherent essay. 
   U.S. eighth graders score below the international average of 41 other countries in math. U.S. twelfth graders score among the lowest of 21 countries in both math and science general knowledge. 
   Three-quarters of employers say that recent high school graduates do not have the skills they need to succeed on the job. Forty-six percent of college professors say entering students do not have the skills to succeed in college, according to a February Public Agenda poll. 
   These statistics speak for themselves. Our schools are failing many of our youngsters. It is not the students' fault. It is our fault. 
   We need major change. 
   Our changing economy, particularly in my state, poses huge challenges for public education. Our young people must be able to compete not just nationally, but in the world because the economy today is a global economy. 
   Here are a few examples: 
   Our state's economy has moved away from manufacturing toward more higher-skilled, service and technology jobs. Since 1980, employment has increased in California by nearly 28 percent, but growth in the traditional fields, such as manufacturing, has been only six percent. Jobs in the ``new economy,'' fields such as services and trade, have jumped nearly 60 percent. 
   California employers say job applicants lack basic skills. High tech CEOs come to Washington and ask us to increase visas so they can bring in skilled employees from overseas because they cannot find qualified employees in our state. 
   Nationally, over the next 10 years, computer systems analyst jobs will grow by 94 percent; computer support specialists, by 102 percent; computer engineers, 108 percent. Jobs for the non-college educated are stagnating. 
   Our economic strength is in large part dependent on how well we prepare our youngsters. And today, sadly, we are not preparing them very well by most measures. 
   California's public schools have gone from being among the best to some of the worst. California has 5.8 million students, more students in public school than 36 states have in total population! California has 30 percent of the nation's school-age immigrant children. We have 41 percent (1.4 million) of the nation's students with limited English proficiency. 
   We've gone from near the top rank in per pupil spending (we were 5th in the nation in 1965) to near the bottom. California ranks 46th today. In the 1960s California invested 20 percent above the national average per student in K-12 education. Today, California averages 20 percent below the national average. 
   We have low test scores, crowded classrooms, uncredentialed teachers, teacher shortages, growing enrollments, decrepit buildings. 
   Let's look at how California's students perform academically: 
   In fourth grade math, 11 percent of students score at or above proficiency levels--11 percent In fourth grade reading, 20 percent. 
   California ranks 32nd out of 36 states in the percent of eighth graders scoring at or above ``proficient'' on reading. For fourth grade readers, we rank 36 out of 39 states in reading. 
   California ranks 34th out of 40 states in the percent of eighth graders scoring at or above ``proficient'' on science. 
   California ranks 37th among the states in the high school graduation rate. 
   Forty-eight percent of freshman students enrolling in the California's State University system need remedial math and English. 
   California's students lag behind students from other states. Only about 40 to 45 percent of the state's students score at or above the national median, on the Stanford 9 reading and math tests. 
   These are dismal, disappointing and disturbing statistics. 
   What does this mean for California's future, when our high school graduates cannot read, write, multiply, divide or add, find China on a map, fill out an employment application or read a bus schedule? These are not abstract facts. These are real examples of the weaknesses in our education system. 
   The Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy--a highly respected think tank--put it quite bluntly: ``Ranking in the bottom 20 percent of all states is simply not compatible with meeting the requirements of industries which will lead California in a world economy.'' 
   In addition to low academic performance, we have a virtual litany of other problems: 
   California has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the nation, even though we are reducing class sizes in the early grades. 
   We will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Currently, 11 percent or 30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials. 
   We're 50th in computers per child and 43rd in schools with Internet access. 
   We need to add about 327 new schools over the next 3 years just to keep pace with projected growth. We need $22 billion to build and repair schools and $10 billion to install instructional technology, according to the National Education Association report that just came out on May 3. Two million California children go to school today in 86,000 portable classrooms. 
   Our Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible children.  
   We have 40 percent of the nation's immigrants. We have 41 percent of the nation's limited English proficient students. Some of our schools have 50 languages spoken. 
   These challenges will be exacerbated multi-fold. California has nearly 34 million people today, with schools, and roads, and other infrastructure that were built when the population was 16 million. And our population is projected to increase to almost 50 million over the next 25 years. California's school enrollment rate between now and 2007 will be triple the national rate. 
   But California's education system cannot be fixed with just bricks, mortar and electrical wiring. The problems are much, much deeper than that. The bottom line is this: tinkering around the edges of a failing system is not meaningful change. Nothing short of a major restructuring will turn around our schools. 
   The condition of public education in California troubles me greatly because this is an area of human endeavor that is critical to the future of our state. California's public school system can be turned around. It will be painful. It will not be easy. But it can be done. And we have to start. 
   So the question is, what should we do. In my view, we should base our efforts on two key principles: performance and accountability. 
   The success of our schools must be measured, not by what we put into our classrooms, but what comes out. 
   There several core elements of education reform: 
   That basic achievement levels be set for students for every grade in all core subjects. These standards should be phased in over a period of years, and measured at key levels, such as 4th, 6th, and 10th grades. 
   That social promotion of students be ended. Promotion from one grade level to the next should be based on measured levels of achievement--period. Intensive intervention programs must be provided for those who fall short and who need extra help. Extra, intervention or remedial programs must accompany the end of social promotion because clearly, retention should not replace the ending of social promotion. 
   That standards be set to measure a school's achievement. 
   That class size be reduced and phased in over 10 years. 
   That school size be reduced. Educators tell us that elementary schools should be limited to 450 students. 
   That the length of both the school day and the school year be increased, thereby increasing both instructional time for students as well as instructional development time for teachers. 
   In most states, the school year is 180 days. In other industrialized nations, students spend more time in the classroom, and teachers have more time for instructional development each year. For example, in Korea the school year is 220 days. In Japan it is 220. In Israel it is 216, and in Great Britain, 190. 
   That public school choice be increased. 
   And that teacher training and pay be improved, to elevate teaching to a respected and competitive position. I have proposed, for example, master teachers who mentor and coach other teachers, especially those in their first year in the classroom and who get salaries commensurate with that role. 
   Today, I intend to vote for Senator LIEBERMAN's reform proposal because I believe it takes a fresh approach to federal education policy and will bring us ``more bang'' for our education bucks by linking real reforms to federal dollars. 
   Here is what the Lieberman amendment does. It does three things. 
   First, it takes almost 50 current, disparate federal education programs and consolidates them into five performance-based grants: 
   educating disadvantaged children; 
   improving teacher quality; 
   teaching English to non-English-speaking children; 
   expanding pubic school choice; and 
   supporting high performance initiatives. 
   Second, the amendment increases authorized funding levels: 
   educating disadvantaged children (Title I), a 50 percent increase, from $7.9 billion to $12 billion; 
   teacher training, a 100 percent increase from $620 million to $1.6 billion; 
   teaching English to non-English-speaking children, a 250 percent increase, from $380 million to $1 billion; 
   public school choice, from $145 million to $300 million; 
   high performance initiatives, a new infusion of $2.7 billion. 
   Third, instead of the funds just going out the door without ever knowing any results, the Lieberman amendment requires for each of the five areas, that states demonstrate improvement. How does it do that? Accountability. The amendment has several important elements. 
   It requires states to have content and performance standards in at least English language arts, math and science. It requires states to define ``adequate yearly progress'' (AYP) and requires 90 percent of school districts to meet AYP, and within school districts, 90 percent of schools to meet AYP. 
   It requires school districts to identify failing schools and after two years and requires those schools to develop an improvement plan. Every school district must have a system of corrective action for failing schools. 
   The amendment gives states three years to implement their own accountability systems; requires states to sanction districts that do not meet their annual performance targets; cuts administrative funds if states do not meet objectives; authorizes funds to correct low-performing schools. 
   For Title I, each state must develop plans to ensure that all children are proficient in math and reading within 10 years. Each states must set performance goals for increasing overall academic achievement and for closing the gap between high- and low-income students, minority and non-minority students, limited English proficient children and non-LEP students. 
   On teachers, it requires that states have all teachers fully qualified by 2005. It preserves the class size reduction program. 
   For non- or limited English-speaking children, it requires states to develop standards for measuring English proficiency, to set performance goals and to require school districts to make adequate yearly progress in core academic subjects. 
   On public school choice, it requires states to hold charter and non-traditional schools accountable to the same content and performance standards as any other public school. It allows students in failing schools to transfer to another public school. 
   It requires states to have annual performance goals and a plan for holding local districts accountable. It rewards districts that meet or exceed their performance goals. 
   If states do not show improvement in three years, they lose administrative funding. States must also hold school districts accountable and have sanctions for low performance. 
   I believe that this amendment represents a comprehensive, constructive approach to real school reform. 
   In addition, the amendment increases authorized funding for elementary and secondary education by $35 billion. But it doesn't just add money, it better targets funds to those truly educationally disadvantaged children, such as poor students and limited English proficient students. According to tables prepared by the Congressional Research Service, California would see increases in Title I, in teacher training, in programs for limited English proficient children and innovative high performance grants. 
   Some may see it as tough. Some may see it as a too different. But we have gotten to the point where we need to look at different ways. As doctors say about an antibiotic, it must be (1) targeted; (2) of sufficient duration and (3) of sufficient dose. That is what this amendment is. 
   By clearly linking federal dollars to results, we can begin to put in place some real steps toward improving student achievement and making public education produce real results. 
   My goal is not to be harsh, to ``dish out'' requirements, sanctions and penalties. Our schools are overwhelmed. Our teachers are overwhelmed. They are often asked to do the impossible. 
   But our few federal dollars--6 percent of total education spending--can and should be used to produce results. 
   That is what this amendment does and that is why I support it. 
   I want to thank Senator LIEBERMAN for including in his amendment two of my initiatives: one is on master teachers and the other is on use of Title I funds.  
   In Title II of the bill, the title providing funds to strengthen teacher training, Senator LIEBERMAN has added a master teacher section so that school districts can use these funds to establish master teacher programs. Under the language, a master teacher would be an experienced teacher, one who has been teaching at least five years, and who assists other (particularly new) teachers in improving their skills. 
   I have proposed creating master teacher programs because I believe these ``senior teachers'' could enhance the profession of teaching and encourage people to stay in the classroom, as well as help the newer teachers ``learn the ropes.'' School districts could use these funds to, for example, increase teachers' salaries and that too could keep them in the classroom instead of moving to an administrative job or to private industry. 
   In California, teachers' salaries average $44,585 which is $4,000 higher than the U.S. average. But the schools cannot compete with private industry without some help. I believe starting master teachers should earn at least $65,000 a year so that we can begin to reward excellence and dedication and keep our teachers in the classroom. These programs have proven to work in Rochester and Cincinnati and I believe other areas should be given the resources to try them too. 
   I am also grateful that Senator LIEBERMAN has included language I suggested to clarify and refine how Title I funds can be used. The goal of this amendment is to better focus Title I on improving students' academic achievement. Under current law, there is little direction and no restrictions on how Title I funds can be used. Under this amendment, Title I funds would have to be used for services directly related to instruction, including extending instruction beyond the normal school day and year; purchasing books and other materials; and instructional interventions to improve student achievement. Funds could not be used, for example, for paying utility bills, janitorial services, constructing facilities, and buying food and refreshments. 
   This amendment is needed because when my staff checked with a number of California schools, we learned that Title I funds have been used for virtually everything, from clerical assistants to payroll administration, from college counseling to coaching, from school yard duty personnel to school psychologists. Alan Bersin, Superintendent of the San Diego Public Schools, found that Title I funds have been used to pay for everything from playground supervisors and field trips to nurses and counselors. 
   Many of these are no doubt worthy expenditures. But we have to realize that Title I cannot do everything. With limited federal dollars, I believe we 
   should focus those dollars on what counts--helping students learn and helping teachers teach. Activities unrelated to instruction will have to be funded from other sources. 
   This debate is about the future of our nation. We must ask some fundamental questions about our schools. 
   Seventeen years ago, the nation's attention was jolted by a report titled A Nation at Risk. In April 1983, the Reagan Administration's Education Secretary, Terrell Bell, told the nation that we faced a fundamental crisis in the quality of American elementary and secondary education. The report said:  
   Our nation is at risk. If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.  
   The report cited declines in student achievement and called for strengthening graduation requirements, teacher preparation and establishing standards and accountability. 
   Today, we still face mediocrity in our schools. While there are always exceptions and clearly there are many excellent teachers and many outstanding schools, we can do better. To those who say we cannot afford to spend more on education, I say we cannot afford to fail our children. Our children do not choose to be illiterate or uneducated. It is our responsibility and we must face up to it. 
   If we have failed, it is because as a society we have become complacent and have had low expectations. So we do whatever it takes, no matter how painful, to fix a system that is not only failing our children, but hurting our children. 
   If we are not willing to make the commitment to provide our children a first-class education, we are failing as a society. What can be more important that giving our children a strong start, a knowledge base and a set of skills that make them happy, productive and fulfilled citizens? 
   I truly believe, if we expect our children to achieve, we must make it clear that we expect and support achievement in every way. That is why I support this amendment.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on any given day in the United States 80 people are killed by gun violence, 12 of them children. Seeking to bring an end to this senseless violence, supporters of sensible gun laws are coming together this Mothers' Day from all over the country to participate in the Million Mom March and say to Congress: ``Enough is Enough.'' 
   We share a common purpose: The passage of sensible gun laws that will hopefully help save lives. 
   This common goal includes moving forward with the four, common-sense gun measures passed by this body almost a full year ago--trigger locks, closing the gun show loophole, banning the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines, and banning juvenile possession of assault weapons. 
   And beyond those four common sense measures, the mothers flooding into Washington are calling for legislation to license gun owners and keep track of guns. 
   Earlier today, I stood with some of those moms, with Donna Dees-Thomases, the head of the Million Mom March, with Chief Ramsey of the District of Columbia Police Department, with representatives of Handgun Control and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and with several of my colleagues to announce the introduction of a bill to take the next step in the fight to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and juveniles. 
   And so I now rise to introduce the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2000,'' which I believe represents a common-sense approach to guns and gun violence in America. 
   I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators FRANK LAUTENBERG, BARBARA BOXER and CHARLES SCHUMER. And I am pleased that Representative MARTY MEEHAN from Massachusetts will soon be introducing this legislation in the House. I know that this will be an uphill battle, and I don't expect this bill to pass overnight. But it is my  hope that in the coming months, more of our colleagues in both Houses will join us and help us to move this bill forward until we succeed. 
   Mr. President, in this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But when you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary. That makes no sense. 
   We register cars and license drivers. We register pesticides and license exterminators. We register animal carriers and researchers, we register gambling devices. And we register a whole host of other goods and activities--even ``international expositions,'' believe it or not, must be registered with the Bureau of International Expositions! 
   But when it comes to guns and gun owners--no license and no registration, despite the loss of more than 32,000 lives a year from gun violence. 
   To this end, I have worked with law enforcement officials and other experts in drafting the bill we are introducing today. 
   Upon enactment of this legislation, anyone purchasing a handgun or semi-automatic weapon that takes detachable ammunition magazines will be required to have a license. Shotguns and a large number of common hunting guns are not covered by the requirements of this bill. 
   Current owners of these weapons will have up to 10 years to obtain a license. 
   The bill sets up a federal system, but allows states to opt out if they adopt a system at least as effective as the federal program. 
   Under this bill, anyone wishing to obtain a firearm license will need to go to a federally licensed firearms dealer. There are currently more than 100,000 such dealers across the country--to put that in some perspective, there are four times more gun dealers in America than there are McDonald's restaurants in the entire world. Operating the federal licensing system through these licensed dealers will minimize the burden on those wishing to obtain a license. 
   If a state opts-out of the federal program, an individual will go to a State-designated entity, like a local sheriff, local police department, or even Department of Motor Vehicles. It will all depend on where the state feels is best. 
   Either way, the purchaser will then need to: 
   Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and address; 
   Submit a thumb print; 
   Submit a current photograph; 
   Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information is true and that the applicant is qualified under federal law to possess a firearm; Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring knowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal responsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined by the state or federal authority; 
   Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands of juveniles (this pledge will be 
   backed up by criminal penalties of up to three years in jail for anyone failing to do so); 
   Undergo state and federal background checks. 
   Licenses will be renewable every five years, and can be revoked at any time if the licensee becomes disqualified under federal law from owning or possessing a gun. 
   And the fee for a license cannot exceed $25. 
   Once the bill takes effect, all future sales and transfers of firearms falling within the scope of the bill will have to be recorded through a federally licensed firearms dealer, with an accompanying NICS background check. That way, law enforcement agencies will have easier access to information leading to the arrest of persons who use guns in crime. 
   The bill covers both handguns and other guns that are semi-automatic and can accept detachable magazines. 
   The legislation covers handguns because statistically, these guns are used in more crimes than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all firearm homicides involve a handgun. 
   And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can accept detachable magazines, because these are the kind of assault weapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives in the shortest period of time. 
   A gun that can take a detachable magazine can also take a large capacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and you have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent years. 
   Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent the greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children in this nation. 
   Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept detachable magazines will remain exempt. 
   This represents a compromise between those who would rather not have this bill at all, and those of us who believe that universal coverage of all firearms would be appropriate. 
   Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation. But in no case will gun owners face jail time simply because they forgot to get a license: 
   Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 (for a first offense) and $5,000 for subsequent offenses. 
   Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will also result in penalties between $500 and $5,000, because this system works best for law enforcement when the perpetrators of gun crime can be quickly traced and arrested; 
   Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years in prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law enforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the straw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy access to a continuing flow of guns; 
   And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a firearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to kill or seriously injure another person. In this way, the bill truly puts a new sense of responsibility onto gun owners in America. 
   Mr. President, law enforcement in California tells me that a licensing and record of sale system like the one I am introducing today will help law enforcement, upon recovery of a firearm used in crime, to track the gun down to the person who sold it, and then to the person who bought it.  
   And this legislation also sets in place a method through which we can better attempt to ensure that gun owners are responsible and trained in the use and care of their dangerous possessions. 
   We have tried to minimize the burden of this bill at every turn:  
   The licensing process will take place through federally licensed firearms dealers--as I mentioned earlier, there are currently more than 100,000 in this country; 
   The fee for a license will be only $25; 
   Current gun owners will have ten years to get a license, and guns now in homes will not have to be registered. 
   Future gun transfers will simply be recorded by licensed dealers--as they are now--and a system will be put in place to allow the quick tracing of guns used in crime. Gun owners themselves will not have to register their old guns or send any paperwork to the government. 
   Mr. President, this nation is awash in guns--there are more than 200 million of them in the United States. The problem of gun violence is not going away, and accidental deaths from firearms rob us of countless innocents each year. 
   Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not know how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. In fact, according to a study released early last year, in 1996 alone there were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than 18,000 firearm suicides--many of which might have been prevented if the person intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by somebody else. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill, particularly with regard to child access prevention, will begin the process of making it harder for children and others to gain easy access to firearms. 
   I know that this bill will not pass overnight. We have a long process of education ahead of us. But the American people are with us. The facts are with us. And common sense is with us. 
   I thank the Senate for its consideration of this measure, and I look forward to working with each of my colleagues to move this bill forward in the coming months.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. Richard B. Harvey, Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science on the occasion of his retirement from Whittier College. Over the span of four decades, Dr. Harvey has also served as Assistant Dean, Dean of Academic Affairs and Chair of the Political Science Department of Whittier College. 
   In addition to his academic pursuits, Dr. Harvey is the accomplished author of The Dynamics of California Government and Politics, a well known textbook in its sixth edition, Earl Warren, Governor of California, and a number of articles and book reviews. He is also a radio commentator, delivering political analysis of election results. 
   His educational leadership has inspired countless young students to pursue civic opportunities. Dr. Harvey's Politics Outside the Classroom course exposed students various powerhouses in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. Students met and discussed California politics with some of the state's most influential political officials, learning more about the practical world of politics than a textbook or lecture can offer. 
   Dr. Harvey's dedication to educating students and his belief in the significance of the political process are worthy of recognition. He earned a B.A. degree from Occidental College, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Dr. Richard Harvey best wishes on his retirement and in all of his future endeavors. His dedication and commitment to teaching California politics for over forty years has set an example that will be emulated for years to come.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last week, during the debate on a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims, Senator LEAHY made several lengthy statements challenging some of the facts set forth by supporters of the amendment, including myself. We responded to many of those arguments at the time--and, I believe, refuted them. I do want not burden the record now by repeating all our contentions or making new ones. 
   However, there is one argument that the Senator from Vermont made during the waning hours of debate on the amendment that I find particularly troubling. It involves the role of victims in criminal proceedings at the time our Constitution was written. Because I believe the Senator's comments contradict the clear weight of American history, I feel compelled to respond. 
   Here is the argument Senator LEAHY disputes: At the time the Constitution was written, the bulk of prosecutions were by private individuals. Typically, a crime was committed and then the victim initiated and then pursued that criminal case. Because victims were parties to most criminal cases, they enjoyed the basic rights to notice, to be present, and to be heard under regular court rules. Given the fact that victims already had basic rights in criminal proceedings, it is perhaps understandable that the Framers of our Constitution did not think to provide victims with protection in our national charter. 
   The Senator from Vermont tried to rebut this argument. Citing an encyclopedia article and a couple of law review articles, he claimed that, by the time of the Constitutional Convention, public prosecution was ``standard'' and private prosecution had largely disappeared. 
   Because Senator LEAHY's comments suggest that some confusion about this issue lingers among my colleagues, I would now like to provide some additional evidence demonstrating that private prosecutions had not only not largely disappeared in the late 18th century but in fact were the norm. 
   First, it is important to concede one point: some public prosecutors did exist at the time of the framing of the Constitution. Certainly, by then, the office of public prosecutor had been established in some of the colonies--such as Connecticut, Vermont, and Virginia. But just because some public prosecutors existed in the late 18th century does not mean that they played a major role or that public prosecution had supplanted private prosecution. In fact, criminal prosecution in 18th century English and colonial courts consisted primarily of private suits by victims. Such prosecutions continued in many States throughout much of the 19th century. 
   Thus, contrary to Senator LEAHY's suggestion that a ``system of public prosecutions'' was ``standard'' at the time of the framing of the Constitution, the evidence is clear that private individuals--victims--initiated and pursued the bulk of prosecutions before, during, and for some time after the Constitution Convention. 
   Let's look, for example, at the research of one scholar, Professor Allen Steinberg, who spent a decade sifting through 
   dusty criminal court records in Philadelphia and wrote a book about his findings. Based on a detailed review of court docket books and other evidence, Professor Steinberg determined that private prosecutions continued in that city through most of the 19th century. 
   In Professor Steinberg's words, by the mid-19th Century, ``private prosecution had become central to the city's system of criminal law enforcement, so entrenched that it would prove difficult to dislodge. .....'' 
   Of course, Philadelphia was the city where the Constitution was debated, drafted, and adopted. And for decades it was our new nation's most populous city--and its cultural and legal capital as well. 
   It is difficult to reconcile the assertion that a ``system of public prosecutions'' was ``standard'' at the time of the Constitution Convention with historical research showing that, in the same city where the Convention was held, private prosecutions--inherited from English common law--continued to be ``standard'' through the mid-19th century. 
   It is not surprising that the Senator from Vermont would conclude that public prosecution had replaced private prosecution by the late 18th century. A cursory exam of historical documents might lead to such a conclusion, for the simple reason that documents regarding public prosecutors and public prosecutions (what few there were) are easier to find than documents regarding private prosecutions. As Stephanie Dangel has explained in the Yale Law Journal:  
   [e]arly studies concentrating on legislation naturally over-emphasized the importance of the public prosecutor, since a private prosecution system inherited from the common law would not appear in legislation. Examinations of prosecutorial practice were cursory and thus skewed. The most readily accessible information relating to criminal prosecutions predictably concerned the exceptional, well publicized cases involving public prosecutors, not the vast majority of mundane cases, involving scant paperwork and handled through the simple procedures of private prosecution .....

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I also thank the Senator from New York, and I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to proceed. 
   I begin by thanking the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, I say to JON KYL, working with him on this amendment has truly been one of the highlights of my 7 years in the Senate. He has worked with credibility and with integrity. He has been fulsome in his sharing of detail. We have gone shoulder to shoulder through virtually every rung of this, through 4 years of discussions, of conferences, of hearings, of 800 pages of testimony, some 35 witnesses.  I agree with everything he said about the inclusive nature of the process. 
   I must tell Senator KYL how much I admire him. We worked together on the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I saw it there. I have never seen it with another Senator as pronounced as it was in these past 4 years in the work on this issue. I believe a friendship has developed in the process, one which means a great deal to me. His leadership has been superb, and there is certainly nothing either one of us has done for the misunderstanding out there still about what we are trying to do and the importance of it. We will come back another day; there is no question in my mind about that. I cannot thank him enough. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Senator KYL for his credibility, his intelligence, his integrity. He did his party proud. I am very happy to be a colleague of his and a friend as well. 
   Before I get into my remarks, I also echo the thanks Senator KYL provided to a whole host of victims, literally tens of thousands of them, to 37 State attorneys general, to many Governors, to all those across both party lines who support this and understand it. I particularly thank three legal scholars who were with us every step of the way. 
   I thank Larry Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, for his testimony, for the phone calls, for the advice he has provided and for the statements he has made. 
   I also thank one of the primary legal scholars in this country who has been a victims' rights representative, legal counsel--just a wonderful human being I have also gotten to know--and that is Professor Paul Cassell, professor of law at the University of Utah. 
   I would be remiss if I did not thank Steve Twist on behalf of both Senator KYL and myself. There are few people who have been as ardent in the cause as Steve Twist has been, with his knowledge, with his expertise, with his representation of victims throughout this entire process. 
   I know that none of the three above-mentioned individuals is going to go away. We have them as part of this enormous victims coalition. We will come back, and we will fight again another day. 
   But today, Mr. President, I rise with a sad heart because we must postpone our battle for a crime victims' rights constitutional amendment. 
   This is a fight that actually began 18 years ago when the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime recommended an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which would address victims' rights. This isn't a new idea. It has been around. There is a track record to show why it is necessary. 
   As I said, Senator KYL and I introduced that amendment 4 years ago. We have worked long and hard. I think enough has been said about that. 
   What is unbelievable to me is that we have also been criticized for the hard work we have put into this amendment over the past 4 years. 
   Senators have come to the floor and told us that the fact that we put our amendment through so many drafts and consulted so many interested parties shows that our amendment does not deserve to be in the Constitution of the United States. Yet, in fact, drafting an amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires an uncanny kind of precision. Because this isn't 1791 when the Bill of Rights was written, or 1789 when the Constitution was adopted, there has been a whole panoply of case law and interpretations that have come throughout the ages that makes the drafting of a constitutional amendment such as this one very difficult. However, I believe we have developed a document that will, in fact, stand the test of time. 
   What we have tried to do, in essence, is very simple. I would like to show a chart, once again. We have tried to take the Constitution, which provides 15 specific rights to the accused, and no rights to victims of violent crimes--with a scale of justice which we believe is weighted in a certain way to exempt victims from the administration of criminal justice--and give victims some status and standing in the administration of criminal justice, so that the scale of justice would not be so badly tilted but would look something like this other chart where the accused would have certain basic rights, and victims would have certain basic, although limited, rights: The right to notice when a trial takes place; the right not to be excluded from a public proceeding; the right to be heard at that proceeding, if present; the right to submit a statement in writing; the right to notice of the release or the escape of an attacker; the right to consideration for the assurance of a 
   speedy trial; the right to an order of restitution; and the right to consideration of their safety in determining any conditional release of an attacker--simple, basic rights of status and standing. 
   We have heard much about the fact that this should not be in the Constitution. There has been much talk on the floor about James Madison and other framers. Senators have suggested that our forefathers would not support the amendment. 
   I tried to point out why our forefathers did not have reason to consider the amendment because when both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written, victims had a role in the process. Up until 1850, victims had a role in the process. But it was with the development of the public prosecutors, when victims were no longer in the courtroom, that they became summarily excluded from the process. 
   I point out that if we look back in history, I find my views very commensurate with those of Thomas Jefferson. He was not among those who wrote the Constitution, but he thought deeply about the Constitution and how and when we should amend it. He was also the inspiration for our Bill of Rights, a document actually drafted by James Madison. 
   In 1816, 25 years after the Bill of Rights became the law of the land, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Samuel Kercheval, stating his views on amending the Constitution. I think it is important that the RECORD reflect these views. He said:  
   I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace with the times.  
   Similarly, 13 years earlier, he said in a letter to Wilson Nicholas:  
   Let us go on perfecting the Constitution by adding by way of amendment, those forms which time and trial show are still wanting.  
   I believe very deeply that time and trial show that our amendment is still wanting and should be adopted.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of the unfortunate aspects of the debate in these hallowed Halls is the fact that many have chosen to ignore the fact that this amendment would actually help poor minority communities beset by crime. It would give victims in these communities rights our criminal justice system often deny them through bureaucratic neglect and casual racism. 
   Among the many supporters of the amendment, for example, is a group called Racial Minorities for Victim Justice. This group includes Norm Early, the former district attorney of Denver, CO, and the founding president of the National Black Prosecutors' Association. It includes Joseph Myers, executive director of the National Indian Justice Center; David Osborne, an Asian American who is assistant secretary of the State in California; Azim Khamisa; Christine Lopez; Steven Njemanze. The group includes minority victims such as Teresa Baker, whose rights were denied after her son was coldbloodedly murdered in Maryland; Clementine Garfield, whose two teenage sons were shot in Detroit; Sarah Fletcher, whose husband Reginald, son Ricky, daughter Crystal, and unborn granddaughter were all murdered. They wrote me an eight-page letter laying out their thoughts about the amendment. I will read some of that letter.  
   The undersigned are founding members of Racial Minorities for Victim Justice which strongly support Senate Joint Resolution 3, the Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment. We are aware that some groups that seek conscientiously to speak for the interests of racial minorities have expressed opposition to your proposed amendment. We claim some understanding of the fundamental concerns that guide their position--concerns we share--but we also believe that they have reached the wrong conclusion on this issue. 
   To put it in the simplest terms, no one in our society stands to benefit more from the adoption of the Victims' Rights Amendment than people of color--for it is our people that suffer the highest rates of victimization in the Nation. 
   Let us start with some common ground on which the great majority of racial minorities stand in this country. Historically, we have had deep suspicions of the agencies of criminal justice. Speaking specifically of the African American experience, it was the agents of criminal justice who were the enforcers of the Fugitive Slave Act and all the Jim Crow laws--often with lawless brutality. 
   While we are proud of recent progress to end this pattern of bigotry in the administration of justice--proud because African Americans and other minorities have led the way in reforming these practices--we are not so naive as to believe that our criminal justice system has grown altogether color-blind. 
   More than most Americans, we believe criminal justice has become too fearful of people of color, too punitive toward minority offenders, with too few opportunities for their treatment and rehabilitation. 
   This is where we share common ground with most members of the minority communities in America. What we cannot understand, however, is why some in those communities have concluded that one way to bring justice agencies into harmony with our higher ideals is to deny the victims of crime any effective and enforceable rights. To us, that makes no sense. We do nothing to improve the fair treatment of minority defendants by impeding the fair treatment of minority victims.  
   I couldn't agree with that more. They go on to say:  
   Leaders of America's criminal defense bar have testified frequently and heatedly against passage of the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment, citing amorphous dangers to defendants' rights and liberties. And how many cases did they cite where their millions of clients had run afoul of some overzealous, unfair and harmful interpretation of a crime victim's rights already provided in State Constitutions? Two hundred? Twenty? Two? Not even one! 
   It is important to understand that victims' rights statutes echoing those in the proposed Amendment are to be found on the books of every state--buttressed by constitutional amendments in 32 of them. While compliance with those laws is woefully spotty (more on that below) it is fair to estimate that in hundreds of thousands of cases, the victims rights were fully implemented, giving rise to not one single appeal as to the fairness of the application of those laws. 
   In our opinion, people of color should be especially outraged at these disproportionate deprivations of our legal and human rights, for it is our minority communities who disproportionately suffer the pain of criminal victimization.  
   I agree with that very much. There is perhaps none but, at most, very few minority victims of violent crime who can afford the counsel to process their rights under State constitutions, under State laws, or under the patchwork of laws to protect victims across this Nation at this time. Every time, if they do, they will eventually lose because the rights of the defendants or the accused are deeply embedded in the heart of this great Constitution. They will find that, in effect, as they press a case in court, they have no standing under the Constitution of the United States. That is what this is all about, to give victims standing in the Constitution of the United States. No case demonstrated that more clearly than the Oklahoma City bombing case. 
   As we sum up, I will quickly refresh why that is the case. We had passed two statutes--one in 1990--which allowed victims to watch the trial and testify at sentencing. The Victims of Crime Bill of Rights, a 1990 law, passed by the House, passed by the Senate, and signed by the President, references the right to be present at all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard 
   other testimony at the trial. In spite of that statute, the court denied the prosecutors' request. The victims made a similar request, and the court denied that request, holding that victims lacked standing to raise their rights under that statute. 
   The prosecutors and the victims were not satisfied. They both had good attorneys, Washington attorneys, Paul Cassell, distinguished attorneys. They appealed that to the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit. As Professor Cassell, one of the lawyers put it:  
   Three months later, a panel of the Tenth Circuit rejected--without oral argument--both the victims' and the United States' claims on jurisdictional grounds. With respect to the victims' challenges, the court concluded that the victims lacked ``standing'' under Article III of the Constitution because they had no ``legally protected interest'' to be present at the trial and consequently had suffered no ``injury in fact'' from their exclusion. The Tenth Circuit also found that victims had no right to attend  the trial under any First Amendment right of access. Finally, the Tenth Circuit rejected, on jurisdictional grounds, the appeal and mandamus petition filed by the United States. Efforts by both the victims and the Department to obtain a rehearing were unsuccessful, even with the support of separate briefs urging rehearing from 49 members of Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit, and some of the leading victims groups in the nation.  
   We heard about that. We responded with alacrity. The House passed the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. That statute said, notwithstanding any statute, any rule or other provision of law, a U.S. district court shall not order any victim of an offense excluded from the trial of a defendant accused of that offense because such victim may, during the sentencing hearing, testify as the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family or as to any other factor for which notice is required. 
   That is clear. We cleared it up. We gave them standing by law, passed by the House, passed by the Senate, signed by the President of the United States. But the district court then said that this statute might be unconstitutional and postponed a decision until after the trial. So the judge paid no attention to the House of Representatives, the Senate of the United States, or to the signature of the President of the United States. 
   This is why we press this cause today. This is why we do not believe that a statute will ever be adequate to give victims basic rights. Push sort of comes to shove. There is an old expression called ``carrying water on both shoulders.'' It is sometimes a way that people feel, in our business--that they can appease a group by saying, oh, something else will do. This case, to me, is irrevocable evidence that the challenge of making a statute work is extraordinarily difficult to give any minority or impoverished victim any meaningful right in real life. So we intend to continue to press this case. 
   I want to ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona now that he has heard the outline of what happened--some people have criticized me, I think, because I have used this case over and over again, but it is the only clearly definable case we have following the passage of two laws passed by our bodies to make a judgment--and, true, we are making that judgment just on the Tenth Circuit Court--nonetheless, does the Senator not believe it is an applicable judgment to add to this to confirm the fact that a statute probably won't work in this situation?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for that comment. I would like to follow up with something. My staff has handed me a letter from Professor Tribe dated today. It is on this point. I think it adds some additional very distinguished credibility to what the Senator is saying. It says:  
   I am writing to address one consideration in particular that is highlighted by the proposed Crime Victims Assistance Act, S. 934, whose sponsors--many of whom are my good friends--evidently hope that by this Federal statute they obviate the need for the proposed constitutional amendment. I favor S. 934's enactment, at least in principle. I assume that closer study of the detailed provision than I have been able to undertake would disclose ways in which it might be improved. But minor technical flaws, or even design defects in the contemplated statute would be beside the point and are not my focus. After all, detailed problems with the statute's terms could be cured by redrafting and would not in themselves explain why only an amendment to the Constitution could meet the need for fuller national protection of victims' rights.  
   Then he goes on to say this--and I am skipping some:  
   The mere brandishment of the banners of defendants' rights or of prosecutorial needs too often suffices to push the needs and interests of victims--to be notified, to observe, to be heard, to have their views considered, to achieve closure, and to be compensated if possible--into the background. Rather than creatively and determinedly seeking ways to protect victims' rights in ways that manage fully to respect the genuine rights, privileges, and needs both of the accuser and the accused, state and local officials are understandably but unfortunately tempted to relegate victims and their rights to second-class status or to shelf them altogether, as merely hortatory and aspirational provisions of law enacted with something much stronger and more operational in mind.  
   He essentially goes on to say again why a statute won't work. He says:  
   The argument is flawed first, because it fails entirely to come to terms with the basic reasons, set forth above, that merely statutory measures would be unable to combat the deeply rooted attitudinal problems confronting victims and their claims of right; and second, because insofar as it assumes broad congressional power to act under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is simply ignorant of the series of decisions in the 1990s and reaching into 2000, beginning with the invalidation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and continuing with the invalidation of provisions of the Patent Reform Act and the Age Discrimination Employment Act, in which the modern Supreme Court has dramatically curtailed the legislative authority of Congress to use its Section 5 power to protect interests that Congress, but not yet the Court, is prepared to recognize as constitutional rights, or even to protect Court-recognized constitutional rights in circumstances, or by means, not shown in the legislative record to be ``necessary.''  
   What Professor Tribe at this stage is adding to this is that any statute passed by us does not take into consideration the courts striking down of the Religion Freedom Restoration Act, the Patent Reform Act, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act. He is saying that the authority of Congress is now more limited to use its section 5 power to protect interests that we think are valid. 
   The striking down of these bills, in effect, makes the constitutionality of anything that we might pass by way of a Federal statute extraordinarily vulnerable. I think this is new information which we have not had a chance to analyze and consider which may enable us to come back and fight another day.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me briefly summarize. I sincerely believe that the only way to afford victims of violent crime standing under the Constitution to be able to assert a right that is provided is by amendment to the Constitution. I don't use my judgment. This is the judgment of the most distinguished legal scholars. 
   I know there are strong forces at work in this in front of the scenes and behind the scenes. I know there are some people who believe what we are trying to do is weaken defendants' rights. That is simply not correct. Defendants' rights, as I see them, are basically rights that do not come into collision with the rights we would afford the victims. They are totally different rights. If there is a collision, our view is that the judge then provides the balancing mechanism. This gives the victim a standing in law to assert the right that, in a sense, can't be trusted. 
   This issue goes down--let me be very candid--on one phrase. That one phrase is the addition of language that would say nothing in this Constitution would abridge the right of a defendant as provided by this Constitution. 
   That is a paraphrase of what it is. 
   The Department of Justice insists on that language. We will not get administration support, I believe, without that language. The victims movement believes they would not have sufficient standing in these rights to really assert them in a meaningful way unless they were able to be balanced against the rights of the defendant. 
   The question I wanted to ask my friend and colleague, Senator KYL, is I think our challenge in proceeding may be how we could reconcile this with the very real concern of victims that they once and for all--albeit for a limited right but nonetheless real rights--have standing for those rights in a court of law.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I think the analogy is actually a very good one. I know defendants' rights are extraordinarily privileged, and well they should be. Senator KYL and I have discussed this. We believe that our amendment does not collide, and we understand how victims feel. 
   I think one of the points is that throughout all of this we have communicated with victims groups. We have been their advocates. We have tried to march to the sound of their drum. 
   The tragedy for me, today, is that we are so close that, if we could bridge that one gap, getting the support of the Justice Department, the President's support, the Vice President's support, perhaps we might, on our side, pick up some votes. That one inability to reach this kind of consensus within the timeframe we have, in view of the feelings of our colleagues, is really the necessity of what we are doing here this afternoon. But I think at this stage there is an impasse. Does my colleague agree?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also am buoyed by the prospects. As we go through this more and more, I understand more and more what is happening behind the scenes. I do want to enter into the record this latest letter from Professor Larry Tribe. Senator KYL will be interested in one quote. He says deep into his letter:  
   I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of ostensibly ``liberal'' lawyers and scholars who do not look askance when they learn of my support for this amendment. Friends who otherwise respect me and admire my work have a difficult time, it seems, assimilating the notion that a liberal champion of defendants' rights--something I think I have been all my life--should take seriously the idea that the victims of violent crime actually have ``rights'' that the Constitution should compel government to take seriously and to treat with respect, rather than merely being the unfortunate--well, victims--of criminal predations that the state is charged with combating, in a system where the only ``rights'' worth naming and treating as such of course belong to those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the wrong end of the machinery of criminal justice. With all respect, I do not share that perspective. Rather, I regard its deeply ingrained nature as the principal argument for the conclusion that statutory measures will never fully suffice.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Professor Tribe's letter in the RECORD.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I extend my deepest thanks to Professor Tribe for his letter and for his support. We will certainly be consulting both he and Professor Cassell again and come back to fight again another day. 
   I want to say something to the victims who have been so heartrending in this process. Those of us who are political come to grips with the sophisticated lobbying around this place. One of the things I have seen in the people whom we represent is they are real people. They have been maimed, they have been harmed, they have been hurt, and with this--I have seen this in the past when I was active in the criminal justice system--victims almost become catatonic. They almost become unable to go out and do the lobbying that is necessary to move something such as this. 
   I want them to know how much we identify with their cause, how much we intend to continue to pursue this cause. It is a just cause. It is a cause that deserves remedy and recognition in the Constitution of the United States. It is a cause where, once victims have these rights, they lost them. 
   This Congress--the other body and our body--should provide these rights again. I am hopeful that in the coming years, we will be able to continue our work on this. Perhaps we will be able to solve this one dilemma of the balancing. It is interesting; anytime one reads a statement by the President or by the Attorney General, it mentions the balancing of these rights. Yet when we write something in the Constitution which, in effect, would provide for this, it brings out the criminal defense bar; it brings out the liberal scholars; it brings out people who say: You can't do this. You can't give victims these rights. 
   The cause is just that they have these rights. A statute, we believe, will be unable to provide them, but as to their standing in the Constitution, there is a time and there is a place, I predict, when that standing will happen and take place.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, for those words. I want him to know, I want the Senate to know, and I want the House to know how important this amendment is. It is so important that both of us are willing to filibuster a conference report. I think it is only fair to send that signal loudly and clearly. 
   The reason I do so is because I was the mayor of the first city with AIDS. I spent 9 years as mayor understanding what AIDS can do and how it can spread and understanding the importance not only of prevention of AIDS, which is all important, but also of being able to treat an AIDS-infected population adequately. 
   Let me say something about the AIDS pandemic now sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely effected by AIDS than any other part of the world. The bottom line of all of this is, there will not be an Africa left for an African trade initiative unless this amendment is part of that initiative. 
   The United Nations reports that 23.3 million--not thousand, million--adults and children are infected with the HIV virus in Africa. Africa has about 10 percent of the world's population, but it has 70 percent of the total number of infected people in the world. 
   Worldwide, about 5.6 million new infections will occur this year, with an estimated 3.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Every single day, 11,000 people are infected in sub-Saharan Africa. That is 1 every 8 seconds. 
   All told, over 34 million people in Africa--the population of California--have been infected with HIV since the pandemic began. An estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998. It is enormous, and it is hidden because of the cultural taboos that surround it. 
   Each day, AIDS buries 5,500 men, women, and children. By 2005, if policies do not change, the daily death toll will reach 13,000--double what it is now--with nearly 5 million AIDS deaths in 2005 alone, in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   The overall rate of infection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa is 8 percent, compared with a 1.1-percent infection rate worldwide. In some countries of southern Africa, 20 percent to 30 percent of the entire adult population is infected. AIDS has cut life expectancy by 4 years in Nigeria, 18 years in Kenya, and 26 years in Zimbabwe. 
   Imagine, AIDS cutting life expectancy by 26 years. That is the case in Zimbabwe today. 
   AIDS is devastating Africa. It is affecting infant and child mortality rates, reversing the declines that have been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa will themselves become HIV infected. 
   There are many explanations why this pandemic is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. Certainly, the region's poverty, which has deprived Africans of access to health information, health education, and health care. Cultural and behavioral patterns have led to sub-Saharan Africa being the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men. Clearly, there needs to be considerable emphasis addressing the health care infrastructure of Africa. There must also be additional resources for education. 
   If the international community is to be successful, we must also make every effort to get appropriate medicine into the hands of those in need. For too many years, there were no effective drugs that could be used to combat HIV/AIDS. Now, thanks to recent medical research, we do have effective medicine. For example, some recent pilot projects have had success in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering the anti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapne, NVP, during birth and early childhood. As a matter of fact, four pills can prevent, in many cases, the transmission of HIV from a mother to an unborn child. 
   Unfortunately, and inexplicably in my view, access for poor Africans to costly combinations of AIDS medications, including antiretrovirals, is perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the African pandemic. I happen to believe we have a very strong moral obligation to try to save lives when the medications for doing so actually exist. There are several things the United States could do to increase access to life-saving drugs. 
   First, we can work with others in the international community to provide support to make these drugs affordable and to strengthen African health care systems so that drug therapies can be administered. 
   Second, we should not prevent African Governments and donor agencies from achieving reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals through negotiated agreements with drug manufacturers. The British pharmaceutical firm, Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of antiretrovirals, has already stated it is committed to differential pricing which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in Africa.  
   Third, I strongly believe the United States must not oppose parallel importing and compulsory licensing by African Governments, to lower the price of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable and more people in Africa will have access to them. That is what the amendment that Senator FEINGOLD and I offered would do. 
   Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals could be purchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. Under compulsory licensing, an African Government could order a local firm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent holder. Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under the World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health emergencies. This is a health emergency. Without compulsory licensing and parallel importing, which would allow access to cheaper generic drugs, more people in sub-Saharan Africa will suffer and die needlessly. 
   For my colleagues who may be concerned that this amendment may undermine wider intellectual property rights, an accusation that those opposed to this amendment--and let me be frank, the pharmaceutical industry--is making, they are incorrect. This amendment reaffirms the World Trade Organization's TRIPS agreements which is the legal standard for intellectual property rights. 
   TRIPS does not prohibit parallel importing and compulsory licensing during health emergencies. That is fully consistent with current U.S. policy on intellectual property rights. In other words, despite what some pharmaceutical companies have been saying behind closed doors about this amendment, the amendment does not weaken intellectual property rights protection one iota. It keeps the bar exactly where it is now. 
   The World Trade Organization and U.S. commitments on intellectual property protection allows countries flexibility in addressing public health concerns. The compulsory licensing process under this amendment is fully consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection of intellectual property, with a moral obligation to meet public health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa. In other words, this amendment is consistent with international trade law. 
   The amendment does not create new policy or a new approach on intellectual property rights under TRIPS, nor does it require intellectual property rights to be rolled back or weakened. All it asks is that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. policy on compulsory licensing and parallel importing remain consistent with what is accepted under international trade law. By doing so, the amendment will allow countries of sub-Saharan Africa to continue to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries and provide their people with affordable HIV drugs. 
   By itself, the amendment is not going to solve the problems of AIDS in Africa. Opponents of the amendment suggest that because it doesn't address the entire HIV/AIDS problem, it should be removed from the bill. They argue that because the health care infrastructure is weak, allowing parallel importing and compulsory licensing will not get the drugs to the people who need them. 
   That misses the point. Although it is true we need to strengthen infrastructure, and my amendment contains language urging additional efforts in this area, that was never the purpose or intent of the amendment. Its purpose and intent was to address this one specific issue, this one small piece of the puzzle, and in so doing, provide some measure of relief to the millions and millions of people now suffering from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Let me provide one example of why the approach adopted by this amendment, admittedly one small part of a larger effort, is necessary. On March 14 of this year, Doctors Without Borders, the medical relief group that won the Nobel Prize last year, sent a letter to Pfizer calling on Pfizer to lower the price of fluconazole, a drug needed to treat cryptococcal meningitis, the most common systematic functional infection in HIV-positive people in developing countries. As the Doctors Without Borders letter notes, in Thailand, fluconazole is available for just $1.20 for a daily dose. Yet in Kenya and South Africa, the daily dose costs $17.84. It is 15 times higher in Africa than in Thailand. 
   That is unconscionable. So, what accounts for the difference? In Thailand, a generic version is available. In Kenya and South Africa, the only supplier is Pfizer. 
   As Bernard Pecoul, director of Doctors Without Borders Access to Essential Medicines Campaigns, has noted:  
   People are dying because the price of the drug that can save them is too high.  
   As the March 14 Doctors Without Borders letter notes:  
   While we appreciate that patents can be an important motor of research and development funding, there must be a balance to ensure that people in developing countries have access to lifesaving medicines.  
   That is the purpose of my amendment, and I am deadly serious about it. 
   I am pleased to note that, under pressure from Doctors Without Borders, Pfizer has now agreed to lower the prices of fluconazole. This situation never should have existed to begin with. Ironically, the pharmaceutical companies would profit more from this amendment than they do right now. Presently, most sub-Saharan African countries are not buying these drugs because they can't afford the price tag. So the pharmaceutical companies are not earning any money at all on these drugs. But if sub-Saharan African countries produced HIV/AIDS drugs through compulsory licensing or purchased them through parallel importing, the pharmaceutical companies holding the patents on these drugs would receive royalties. 
   I was very pleased to work with the managers of this bill, when the African Growth and Opportunity Act was on the floor of the Senate last November, to modify my amendments to meet some of their concerns and to have their support in seeing it included in the final Senate-passed version of this bill. 
   I have been happy to work with them. My staff has worked with their staff over the past several months to try to meet some additional concerns which have subsequently been voiced. But, frankly, my patience is wearing very thin. The pharmaceutical companies that are opposed to this amendment, opposed because they want to squeeze every last drop of profit from the suffering of the millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Sarahan Africa. They have shown no willingness to compromise, no willingness to enter into good-faith negotiations. 
   I am more than willing to see additional clarifying language added to this amendment in conference. I believe strongly that the core of the amendment must remain and that efforts to either remove this amendment or to gut it are both inexplicable and reprehensible, and I am determined not to let this happen. 
   It is clearly in the interests of the United States to prevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. I believe my amendment is a necessary part to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act if we are to continue to assist the countries of this region in halting the number of premature deaths from AIDS. 
   Antiretroviral drugs can work to improve the quality and length of life. The United States has the power to make these lifesaving drugs more affordable and more accessible to Africans. We should not turn our backs, and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry should not stop us. 
   I am absolutely determined that if a conference report comes to this floor without this amendment, Senator FEINGOLD and I, and I hope others, will join together and filibuster this report. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member and the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I am delighted the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is here. I will try to be as brief as I can. However, when I left the Democratic caucus at lunch yesterday, I felt, I might say, very lonely; that this, in a sense, was an insurmountable quest. As I went back to my office and as I considered what had been said in the caucus and what had been said on the floor of the Senate, I felt so strongly how worthwhile this fight is and how many people will be touched and protected if, one day, we do succeed. 
   Then I realized we were not alone. Later today, I will be submitting a raft of letters from a panoply of victims' rights organizations as well as law enforcement organizations that are in support of this measure. A few of them are up here on the board today: Mothers Against Drunk Driving, National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network, National Organization for Victims Assistance, Parents of Murdered Children; Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance; Stephanie Roper Foundation; Mothers Against Violence in America--and on and on and on. 
   Also, a group of 37 State attorneys general, the former U.S. Attorneys General, William Barr, Dick Thornburgh, Ed Meese; the Alabama Attorney General, and on and on and on; the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, the American Correctional Association, American Probation and Parole Association, Concerns of Police Survivors, the National Troopers' Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association, and on and on and on. Members can look at this. I will submit later individual letters. 
   However, I thought it might be useful to answer some of the questions that were asked on the floor yesterday. One of them was that we should not be doing this lightly; this is too precipitous; it comes too fast; Members have not had enough of an opportunity to study it. In fact, Senator KYL and I have been working on this for 4 years. We have had four hearings in the Judiciary Committee. We have heard from 34 witnesses. We have taken 802 pages of testimony. The House has had 32 witnesses and has 575 pages of testimony. So this is not a lonely quest in the sense that it has lasted for a short period of time, but it is a quest that will go on as well. 
   Yesterday, both in the Democratic caucus, as well as on the floor, one distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee, a Senator whom I greatly respect, made this statement. Hopefully he will be listening because I want to provide the answer. The statement is:  
   I have not received an answer, a good answer, from my colleague from Arizona and my colleague from California as to why not a statute. You can pass it more quickly and more easily. It fits the amendment. It fits what you are trying to do. No court, no Supreme Court, no final authority has thrown it out.  
   Let me take the biggest and broadest case and describe to my colleagues why a statute will not work. The reason I use this case is it is a case with which we are all familiar. It is a case in which this Senate has played a role twice in passing, in fact, two statutes. It is a case where the defendants had access to attorneys and could mount a legal challenge. It is the treatment of the Oklahoma City bombing victims. 
   I am going to read from a letter from a law professor who was one of the attorneys for the Oklahoma City bombing victims. His name is Paul Cassell. He is a professor of law at the University of Utah. He says:  
   This morning I had the opportunity to listen to the debate on the floor of the Senate concerning the Crime Victims Rights Amendment. During that debate, if I understood it correctly, the suggestion was made that federal statutes had ``worked'' to protect the rights of the Oklahoma City bombing victims. As the attorney who represented  a number of victims in that case, I am writing to express my strong view that this suggestion is simply not correct. To the contrary, the events of that case show that statutes failed. To be specific, the statutes failed to assure that all victims who wanted to were able to attend the trial of Timothy McVeigh. Indeed, the Department of Justice prosecutors handling the case advised a number of victims that they should not attend to avoid creating unresolved legal questions about their status in the case. A number of the victims reluctantly accepted that advice. In other words, they sat outside the courtroom despite the presence of two federal statutes specifically designed to make sure that they had an unequivocal right to attend. To add insult to injuries, the other attorneys and I who represented the individual victims were never able to speak a word in court on their behalves....... 
   Some might claim that this treatment of the Oklahoma City bombing victims should be written off as atypical. However, there is every reason to believe that the victims here were far more effective in attempting to vindicate their rights than victims in less notorious cases. The Oklahoma City bombing victims were mistreated while the media spotlight has been on when the nation was watching. The treatment of victims in forgotten courtrooms and trials is certainly no better, and in all likelihood much worse. Moreover, the Oklahoma City bombing victims had six lawyers working to press their claims in court, including a law professor familiar with victims rights, four lawyers at a prominent Washington, DC, law firm and a local counsel. In the normal case, it often will be impossible for victims to locate a lawyer willing to pursue complex and unsettled issues about their rights without compensation. One must remember that crime most often strikes the poor and others in a weak position to retain counsel. Finally, litigating claims concerning exclusion from the courtroom or other victims' rights promises to be quite difficult. For example, a victim may not learn that she will be excluded until the day the trial starts. Filing effective appellate actions in such circumstances promises to be practically impossible. It should, therefore, come as little surprise that the Oklahoma City litigation was the first in which victims sought federal appellate court review of their rights under the Victims Bill of Rights, even though that statute was passed in 1990.  
   What he is saying is that this was the first time victims under a statute passed 6 years earlier actually tried to use the court to enforce their rights. 
   He continues:  
   The Oklahoma City bombing victims would never have suffered these indignities if the Victims Rights Amendment had been the law of the land. It would have unequivocally protected their right to attend and their ``standing'' to assert claims on their behalf to protect that right. In short, the federal amendment would have worked to protect their rights.  
   Then he goes on to give a chronology, and I think this is very important because the issue is effectively standing and the fact that they have no standing in the Constitution to have these rights. I think it is important that I point out a chronology of exactly what happened. I want to take the time to do that:  
   During a pre-trial motion hearing in the Timothy McVeigh prosecution, the district attorney ..... issued a ruling precluding any victim who wished to provide victim impact testimony at sentencing from observing any proceeding in the case. The court based its ruling on Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence the so-called ``rule on witnesses.'' In the hour that the court then gave to victims to make this wrenching decision about testifying, some of the victims opted to watch the proceedings; others decided to leave Denver to remain eligible to provide impact testimony. 
   Thirty-five victims and survivors of the bombing then filed a motion asserting their own standing--  
   This is important--  
   then filed a motion asserting their own standing to raise their rights under federal law and, in the alternative, seeking leave to file a brief on the issue as amici curiae. The victims noted that the district court apparently had overlooked the Victims Bill of Rights, a federal statute guaranteeing victims the right (among others) ``to be present at all public court proceedings unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial.''  
   In other words, the court had flexibility to make that determination. 
   Continuing:  
   The District Court then held a hearing to reconsider the issue of excluding victim witnesses. The court first denied the victims' motion asserting standing to present their own claims, allowing them only the opportunity to file a brief as amici curiae. After argument by the Department of Justice and by the defendants, the court denied the motion for reconsideration. It concluded that victims present during the court proceedings would not be able to separate the ``experience of trial'' from ``the experience of loss from the conduct in question,'' and, thus, their testimony at a sentencing hearing would be inadmissible....... 
   The victims then filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking review of the district court's ruling. Because the procedures for victims appeals were unclear, the victims filed a separate set of documents appealing from the ruling. Similarly, the Department of Justice, uncertain of precisely how to proceed procedurally, filed both an appeal and a petition for a writ of mandamus. 
   Three months later, a panel of the Tenth Circuit rejected--without oral argument--both the victims' and the United States' claims on jurisdictional grounds. With respect to the victims' challenges, the court concluded that the victims lacked ``standing'' under Article III of the Constitution because they had no ``legally protected interest'' to be present at the trial and consequently had suffered no ``injury in fact'' from their exclusion. The Tenth Circuit also found the victims had no right to attend the trial under any First Amendment right of access. Finally, the Tenth Circuit rejected, on jurisdictional grounds, the appeal and mandamus petition filed by the United States. Efforts by both the victims and the Department to obtain a rehearing were unsuccessful, even with the support of separate briefs urging rehearing from 49 members of Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit, and some of the leading victims groups in the nation. 
   In the meantime--  
   And now it gets even more critical--  
   the victims, supported by the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, sought remedial legislation in Congress clearly stating that victims should not have to decide between testifying at sentencing and watching the trial. The Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 was introduced to provide that watching a trial does not constitute grounds for denying the chance to provide an impact statement. The 1997 measure passed the House by a vote of 414 to 13. The next day, the Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent. The following day, President Clinton signed the Act into law, explaining that ``when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.'' 
   The victims then promptly filed a motion with the district court asserting a right to attend under the new law. The victims explained that the new law invalidated the court's earlier sequestration order and sought a hearing on the issue. Rather than squarely uphold the new law, however, the district court entered a new order on victim-impact witness sequestration. The court concluded ``any motions raising constitutional questions about this legislation would be premature and would present issues that are not now ripe for decision.'' Moreover, the court held that it could address issues of possible prejudicial impact from attending the trial by conduct[ing] a voir dire of the witnesses after the trial. The district court also refused to grant the victims a hearing on the application of the new law, concluding that its ruling rendered their request ``moot.'' 
   After that ruling, the Oklahoma City victim impact witnesses--once again--had to make a painful decision about what to do. Some of the victim impact witnesses decided not to observe the trial because of ambiguities and uncertainties in the court's ruling, raising the possibility of exclusion of testimony from victims who attended the trial. The Department of Justice also met with many of the impact witnesses, advising them of these substantial uncertainties in the law, and noting that any observation of the trial would create the possibility of exclusion of impact testimony. To end this confusion, the victims filed a motion for clarification of the judge's order. The motion noted that ``[b]ecause of the uncertainty remaining under the Court's order, a number of the victims have been forced to give up their right to observe defendant McVeigh's trial. This chilling effect has thus rendered the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997.......for practical purposes a nullity.''  
   So the effort of this Congress to write one statute, and to clarify it with a second statute, was rendered a nullity.  
   Unfortunately, the effort to obtain clarification did not succeed, and McVeigh's trial proceeded without further guidance for the victims. 
   After McVeigh was convicted, the victims filed a motion to be heard on issues pertaining to the new law. Nonetheless, the court refused to allow the victims to be represented by counsel during argument on the law or during voir dire about the possible prejudicial impact of viewing the trial. The court, however, concluded (as the victims had suggested all along) that no victim was in fact prejudiced as a result of watching the trial. 
   This recounting of the details of the Oklahoma City bombing litigation leaves no doubt that statutory protection of victims rights did not ``work.'' To the contrary, for a number of the victims, the rights afforded in the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997 and the earlier Victims Bill of Rights were not protected. They did not observe the trial of defendant Timothy McVeigh because of lingering doubts about the constitutional status of these statutes. 
   The undeniable, and unfortunate, result of that litigation has been to establish--as the only reported federal appellate ruling [to date]--a precedent that will make effective  enforcement of the federal victims rights statutes quite difficult. It is now the law of the Tenth Circuit that victims lack ``standing'' to be heard on issues surrounding the Victims' Bill of Rights and, for good measure, that the Department of Justice may not take an appeal for the victims under either of those statutes. For all practical purposes, the treatment of crime victims' rights in federal court in Utah, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Wyoming has been remitted to the unreviewable discretion of individual federal district court judges. The fate of the Oklahoma City victims does not inspire confidence that all victims rights will be fully enforced in the future. Even in other circuits, the Tenth Circuit ruling, while not controlling, may be treated as having persuasive value. If so, the Victims Bill of Rights will effectively become a dead letter.  
   This is the reason we pursue our case with such ardor. We do not believe it is possible, under any statute drafted to cover victims of violent crimes, to provide them with certain basic rights because any Federal statute would only cover 1 to 2 percent of the victims of violent crimes in the United States; and, secondly, because the one noteworthy case, in the sense of public knowledge, in the sense of major representation of victims by attorneys of major quality, resulted in two laws, passed by this Senate and the other House, being rendered a nullity. 
   That is the reason we pursue our quest here today. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think Senator KYL has stated it very well. Not only do I find that to be a correct distinction--it is not only Senator KYL and I--it is legal scholars who we have worked with and trusted throughout this process. Let me quote the professor from Harvard with whom we worked, Larry Tribe.  
   These are the very kinds of rights with which our Constitution is typically and properly concerned, rights of individuals to participate in all those government processes that strongly affect their lives. Congress and the states have already provided a variety of measures to protect the rights of victims.  
   Senator KYL and I have heard that said on this floor and outside of this floor. That certainly is true. Yet, as Professor Tribe goes on, the reports from the field are that they have all too often been affected. Rules to assist victims frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or the mere mention of an accused's rights, even when those rights are not genuinely threatened. 
   I read the chronology of the Oklahoma City bombing case and the rights that those victims were afforded by two statutes, not one statute. We couldn't get it done right in 1990. We tried again 7 years later. Both of those were effectively declared a nullity by the Tenth Circuit because the victims had no standing under article III of the Constitution. So the question of standing and harm all enter into this. Everything I have been able to deduce is, the only way to provide standing to be a party at issue in the situation is through the Constitution of the United States. Would my colleague agree with that?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The point made by the Oklahoma City case is that these were not indigent victims. They had Washington counsel, distinguished counsel of very high quality. They tried to assert the rights under the statute, and the court essentially turned them down. This isn't what we think; this is what happens. I will quote a bit more from Professor Tribe on this very subject, until Senator BYRD, who is next, comes to the Chamber. 
   Larry Tribe makes this statement:  
   Beginning with the premise that the Constitution should not be amended lightly and should never be amended to achieve short-term partisan or purely policy objectives, I would argue that a constitutional amendment is appropriate only when the goal involves (1) a needed change in government structure, or (2) a needed recognition of a basic human right, where (a) the right is one that people widely agree deserves serious and permanent respect, (b) the right is one that is insufficiently protected under existing law, (c) the right is one that cannot be adequately protected through purely political action such as state or federal legislation and/or regulation, (d) the right is one whose inclusion in the United States Constitution would not distort or endanger basic principles of the separation of powers among the federal branches.......(e) the right would be judicially enforceable without creating open-ended or otherwise unacceptable funding obligations.  
   Professor Tribe goes on to say:  
   I believe that S.J. Res. 3 meets these criteria. The rights in question--rights of crime  victims not to be victimized yet again through the processes by which government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and/or release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably basic human rights against government, rights that any civilized system of justice would aspire to protect and strive never to violate.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Continuing the quote:  
   To protect these rights of victims does not entail constitutionalizing the rights of private citizens against other private citizens; for it is not the private citizen accused of crime by state or federal authorities who is the source of the violations that victims' rights advocates hope to address with a constitutional amendment in this area. Rather, it is the government authorities themselves, those who pursue (or release) the accused or convicted criminal with insufficient attention to the concerns of the victim, who are sometimes guilty of the kinds of violations that a properly drawn amendment would prohibit.  
   I think that well states what we are trying to do. 
   I am delighted to yield to Senator SCHUMER.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There is always room in the trench to change his mind, if the Senator cares to. I do appreciate his concern and his testimony does carry weight with me. As a matter of fact, it was Senator SCHUMER's comment in the RECORD that I referred to last night when I addressed and talked with the attorneys in Oklahoma City today who represented the victims--Professor Cassell was one of them--and got that chronology. 
   To me, the reason the statute won't work is because it hasn't worked. Both Houses of Congress, and even the redoubtable intelligence of the Senator in working on both the 1990 and the 1997 statute, rendered both a nullity by the 
   Tenth Circuit. Therefore, they were victims in that entire circuit and are effectively left without a remedy, and the belief is that it would be difficult in that circuit, based on the precedent that has been set, without providing standing for victims in the Constitution under article III, to have a successful statute. 
   Now, I don't believe many victims have the wherewithal to get a professor of law at a distinguished university and a Washington law firm. The people who are going to be the most impacted by this are poor, are minorities, where most of the crime victims, after all, really are in the Nation. So the ability for them to get redress under a statute, I think, is effectively quite limited. 
   Addressing the second part about the drafting of this article, we have been at this for 4 years. There are 800 pages of testimony, as I have mentioned. I ask Senator KYL, how many meetings does the Senator believe we have had with the Justice Department in the last 4 years over the wording in this? 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So we have had at least a dozen meetings with Justice. The concepts are the authors', and much of the writing is actually a product of those meetings with the Justice Department. In fairness, staff has changed over the years. We worked with one assistant U.S. Attorney General, and that person has changed, and so on and so forth. We have also worked with White House staff. The basics of the amendment that the Senator questions as being burdensome in verbiage is really very simple: to reasonable notice of, and not to be excluded from any public proceedings relating to the crime; to be heard, if present; to submit a statement at all such proceedings to determine a conditional release from custody and acceptance of a negotiated plea or sentence. 
   I might say that this was gone over with precision and detail with Justice as to whether a plea bargain would be effected; the foregoing rights in a parole proceeding that is not public to the extent these rights are afforded to the convicted offender; the reasonable notice of and an opportunity to submit a statement concerning any proposed pardon or commutation; reasonable notice of escape or release from custody. I will say the pardon has not been worked out with Justice, and there are some negotiations going on about that right now. But notice of release or escape; consideration for the interest of the victim; that any trial be free from unreasonable delay--there was considerable discussion through Senator KYL, ourselves, attorneys for the victims, victims' rights groups, as to not to create a problem there. And the words ``to consideration of the interest'' were added to avoid any problem. To order restitution, to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any conditional release from custody, and to notice of the rights: that is essentially the bulk of the basic rights. The rest sets up a vehicle. 
   Now, we have heard two Senators come to the floor and say: ``Who would define a victim?'' We have to write in this that the Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. So the Congress would enforce the article. And some of that language, by way of clarification, is added. 
   This is not 1791; it is the year 2000. Fortunately, since 1791, there is court precedent. There is now definition of  language in the law that has been predetermined, and it is much more complicated, I think, to write this kind of language than it was way back when.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is a very important question. 
   I am sure I cannot answer as adequately, but let me try. I think any statute lasts a ``New York minute.'' Let me state why. 
   I think there is bureaucratic inertia. At our caucus yesterday, to be very frank, I was amazed at Members' reactions. We are trying to give victims certain basic rights. I almost came out of the caucus feeling somewhat un-American because I am trying to do something that can stand the test of universal time to improve a very convoluted, difficult administration of justice process in this country, to ensure victims a certain participation in the process.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I grant that the 1997 clarification act, which, as I understand it, meant to say that a victim could both be present in court and make a statement, was simply not answered; it was ignored. 
   The 1990 victims' rights amendment was a more considered bill, developed over a period of time, and was the one with which the Tenth Circuit essentially said that victims lack standing under article III because they had no legally protected interest to be present at the trial and had suffered, therefore, no injury. 
   I don't know how one remedies by statute to withstand the test of time, the bureaucratic inertia, the equivocation that goes on. 
   From 1850, we have a century and a half in this country where victims have had no rights in the process. The process has locked itself. The Senator is right, some district attorneys don't want to be responsible to send a victim or say, Give me your address and phone number if you want to come to court; I will notify you. Then it is up to the victim to provide that and be there at the appropriate time. Many don't want to do that. 
   What makes me very suspect is, that reaction is disproportionate to what we are trying to achieve, which is basically status rights. It is not like the right to counsel, not like a right of a jury of your peers, it is not like protection against double jeopardy or unreasonable search and seizure. Those are very ``meaty'' rights that defendants have that should be provided, including the right to be present, the right to make a statement--pretty simplistic rights.

Maybe the third time will either be another strike or a home run. I don't know. But, nonetheless, no matter how the statute is crafted, it will affect just 1 to 2 percent of the victims of violent crime all across this great land. For me, that is a very great problem.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Then I think it is the wrong tool for what is a basic human right against government because it is government that refuses these people access. I think then you have to monitor government, and it would take a whole new bureaucracy to monitor government to see every notice was sent out and every change of address and that kind of thing. But I want to read a statement from someone who you do respect. I know you respect Professor Tribe. In addition, I know you respect the Attorney General of the United States. Just before you leave, I want to read a statement:  
   Unless the Constitution is amended to ensure basic rights to crime victims, we will never correct the existing imbalance in this country between defendants' irreducible constitutional rights and the current haphazard patchwork of victims' rights. While a person arrested or convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States knows he is guaranteed certain basic protection under our Nation's most fundamental law, the victim of that crime has no guarantee of rights beyond those that happen to be provided and enforced in the particular jurisdiction where the crime occurred.  
   This is similar to the discussion of how many angels dance on the head of a pin. I supported the first State constitutional amendment in 1982. It is now 18 years later. Even by constitutional amendments, what Senator KYL said about 60 percent and 40 percent of victims being responded to is really correct. We believe it is never going to be enforceable, it is never going to be carried out. The bureaucratic inertia is too great, the system is too ingrained, and the Constitution of the United States should not be so static and so immutable that people who have suffered violence do not have a right in a court of law. That is what we are about. Thank you.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank our ranking member for this opportunity. It gives an opportunity for the Senator from Arizona and me to explain the amendment. I very much appreciate that. 
   Providing constitutional rights for victims of violent crime has been at the top of my list of priorities as a Senator from California. I will take a few moments to explain why. 
   I thank our colleague, Senator KYL, for his leadership in bringing this issue to the forefront and working so closely with me in a bipartisan way over the past 4 years through two Congresses. I believe this is what voters sent us here to do, to work together, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, to find solutions to the problems ordinary Americans face every day. Indeed, ordinary Americans do find problems in the criminal justice system. 
   There were about 9 million victims of violent crimes in 1996, when we began this effort, and each of the 4 years since that time in the United States. Many of these victims were actually victimized a second time by the criminal justice system. They were kept in the dark about their case. They were excluded at the trial. They were unable to express their concerns for their safety when a decision was made to release their attacker. It is for these victims we are fighting for this amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   There are those who say the Constitution is a static document; it is a perfect document; it should not be changed. There are those who say it should not be changed easily. There are those who say it should not be changed without need. We are in the latter two. We believe we have a serious amendment, and we believe we can demonstrate the need for this change. 
   The amendment we propose today meets a situation, the situation that when the Constitution of the United States was written in 1789, there were but 4 million people in 13 colonies. Today we are over 250 million people, and victims of violent crimes alone amount to over 9 million a year. 
   When the Constitution was written, it was a different day. In 1791, the Bill of Rights was written. Between the text of the Constitution and the text of the Bill of Rights, a number of rights were provided to the accused, rights to protect them against an overeager, overzealous, and overambitious Government. We all know what they are: The right to counsel, to due process, to a speedy trial, against double jeopardy, against self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to have warrants issued upon probable cause, the right to a jury of peers, the right to be informed, and so on. 
   Victims were entirely left out, and when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written in 1789 and 1791, there were essentially no rights provided to victims in the United States. There was good reason for it. I want to say why that took place. 
   When the Constitution was written, in America in the late 18th century and well into the 19th century, public prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence criminal trials themselves by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant, initiating a private prosecution. The core rights of our amendment to notice, to attend, to be heard were inherently made available to a victim of a violent crime. As Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard journal of law and public policy, observed:  
   At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often hired a prosecutor.  
   Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private prosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in recent years, it became easier and easier for the victim to be left aside in the process. 
   As other scholars have noted:  
   With the establishment of the prosecutor the conditions for the general alienation of the victim from the legal process further increased.  
   Mr. President, this began to happen in the mid 19th century, around 1850, when the concept of the public prosecutor was developed in this country for the first time.  
   The victim is deprived of his [or her] ability to determine the course of a case and is deprived of the ability to gain restitution from the proceedings. Under such conditions, the incentives to report crime and to cooperate with the prosecution also diminished. As the importance of the prosecution increases, the role of victim is transformed [in our country] from principal actor to a resource that may [or may not] be used at the prosecutor's discretion.  
   Those aren't my words; those are words of Fredric Dubow and Theodore Becker in ``Criminal Justice and the Victim.'' 
   So we see why the Constitution must be amended to guarantee these rights. There was no need to guarantee them in 1789 and 1791, when the Bill of Rights was added. We see that the criminal justice system has changed with the  evolution of the concept of the public prosecutor, and we see that America has changed. The prevalence of crime has changed. The number of victims has changed. So creating the need and circumstance to respond to these developments and to restore balance in the criminal justice system by guaranteeing certain basic rights of violent crime victims in the United States is what we seek to do. 
   Those rights would be as follows: The right to notice of proceedings; the right not to be excluded from proceedings; the right to be heard at proceedings, if present; the right to submit a statement; the right to notice of release or escape of an attacker. For me, that is a central point and how I got involved in this movement. Also, there is the right to consideration in ensuring a speedy trial; the right to an order of restitution ordered by a judge; the right to consideration of safety in determining any conditional release. Those are basic, core rights that we would give to a victim of violent crime to 
   be balanced against the rights of the accused. 
   Senator KYL mentioned that among our supporters are Prof. Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School. Professor Tribe is a noted constitutional expert. Let me quote portions of his testimony from the House hearing on the amendment:  
   The rights in question--the rights of crime victims not to be victimized yet again through the processes by which government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably basic human rights against government, rights that any civilized system of justice would aspire to protect and strive never to violate. 
   Our Constitution's central concerns involve protecting the rights of individuals to participate in all those government processes that directly and immediately involve those individuals and affect their lives in some focused and particular way....... The parallel rights of victims to participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit text of the U.S. Constitution. 
   The fact that the States and Congress, within their respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative authority to enact rules protecting these rights is.....not a reason for opposing an amendment altogether....... The problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened.  
   Now, some people would say, ``Let's pass another Federal statute.'' To them, I say: Been there, done that. We did that twice--in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing--and the judge ignored the Federal statute both times. According to the FBI, 98.4 percent of violent crimes are prosecuted in State courts. So why a Federal statute won't work is that even the broadest Federal statute would affect only 1 percent of the victims of violent crimes in this Nation. And then that statute could, in effect, be trumped at any time by the constitutional amendment provided to the accused. 
   The attorneys general of 37 States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have all signed a letter with this statement:  
   We are convinced that statutory provisions are not enough. Only a Federal constitutional amendment will be sufficient to change the culture of our criminal justice system.  
   Let me tell you, very personally, why I believe this to be very necessary. Let me take you back to my life in San Francisco in the 1970s. In 1974, in my home city, a man by the name of Angelo Pavageau broke into the house of Frank and Annette Carlson in Portrero Hill. Mr. Pavageau tied Mr. Carlson to a chair, murdered him by beating him with a hammer, a chopping block, and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly raped Annette Carlson, who was 24 years old, breaking several of her bones. He slit her wrists and tried to strangle her with a telephone cord before setting their home on fire and leaving them to go up in flames. 
   But Mrs. Carlson survived the fire; she lived and she testified against her attacker. That testimony sent him to prison where he resides, I believe, to this day. But she has been forced to change her name. She lives anonymously and she continues to live in fear that one day her attacker may be released and come back after her. 
   When I was mayor of San Francisco, she called me several times to notify me that she had found out that he was up for parole, and she begged me to do what I could to see that she would know if he was released so she could protect herself. 
   Amazingly, it was up to her to find this information. The system did not provide it. 
   I believe no American citizen should have to live out of fear that their attacker will be released from jail or from prison without their notice. That is a basic right provided by this measure. 
   In 1979, a killing occurred which galvanized the victims' rights movement in California. A young woman named Catina Rosa Salerno was murdered on her first day of school at the University of the Pacific in Stockton. The killer was an 18-year-old, Steven Jones Burns, Catina's high school sweetheart and a trusted family friend. After shooting her, Burns went back to his dorm room to watch Monday night football. He could see her as she bled to death outside his window. 
   During the trial, the family was not allowed in the courtroom and had to sit outside waiting for news. The murder of Catina had a profound and lasting effect on the family. Her mother, Harriet, and her father, Michael, cofounded Crime Victims United, one of California's more outspoken groups for victims' rights, and the family has since that day worked tirelessly to educate the public about the rights of crime victims. 
   These cases helped California become the first State in the Nation to pass a crime victims' constitutional amendment, an amendment to the State Constitution of California, Proposition 8, in 1982. It gave victims the right to restitution, the right to testify at sentencing, probation, and parole hearings, established a right to safe and secure public school campuses, and made various changes in criminal law. It was a good start. 
   Since that time, a total of 32 States have passed constitutional amendments to provide victims of crime with certain basic rights. All of them have passed by substantial margins--Alabama, 80 percent; Connecticut, 78 percent; Idaho, 79 percent; Illinois, 77 percent; Indiana, 89 percent; Kansas, 84 percent. Some States passed them by constitutional convention: South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
   What is wrong with that? What is wrong is the paperwork quilt of different rights provided by different State Constitutions. The remaining States--18 of them--provide no basic rights for a victim of a violent crime. We provide a basic core of rights--of notice, of presence, to be heard, to be noticed of an attacker's release, to restitution if ordered by a judge--eight certain, basic, core rights that exist for every victim of a violent crime throughout the United States. For the first time in history, the Constitution would recognize a victim has core basic rights, that those rights are present in the Constitution, and that the victims are free to exercise those rights. 
   In summary, I know this amendment is controversial. I know there are those who will say these State amendments are enough. I want to give a few examples of why the State amendments are not enough. 
   Maryland has a State amendment. But when Cheryl Rae Enochs Resch was beaten to death with a ceramic beer mug by her husband, her mother was not notified of the killer's release 2 1/2 years into the 10-year sentence. The mother was not given the opportunity to be heard about this release--in violation of the Maryland constitutional amendment. 
   Arizona has a State constitutional amendment, but an 
   independent audit of victim-witness programs in four Arizona counties, including Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, found that victims were not consistently notified of hearings; they were not conferred with by prosecutors regarding plea bargains; they were not consistently provided with an opportunity to request postconviction notification. 
   Ohio has a State amendment. But when the murderer of Maxine Johnson's husband changed his plea, Maxine was not notified of the public hearing and was not given the opportunity to testify at his sentencing as provided in Ohio law.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to have an opportunity to ask the Senator from Arizona a couple of questions. I thought he pointed out very ably the problem of a statute filling the void, the first problem being that the rights of the accused will always trump the rights of the victim. He pointed out very well and very ably and very specifically the situation that took place with respect to Oklahoma City. 
   Then we turned to the FBI to try to get the amount of coverage that could be achieved in the statute for victims across this great land. We were told that really the best we could do would be to protect by statute the 1 to 2 percent of victims who were victimized by violent crimes. 
   I think it is important that we discuss a little bit more why the Constitution will always trump a State law. I ask the Senator to lay that out once again.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me stop the Senator on that point because I think he has very well expressed what we are trying to do. We have discussed this before. I think the whole body should hear this. We know that those who are accused have basic rights. We know that the prosecution usually wants to try to get the victim in the courtroom. The defense attorney wants to keep the victim out of the courtroom. Supposing a situation arises where you have an emboldened or abusive victim, or one who is overly emotional, under our amendment, how would this work? What rights would the judge have in this situation?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. The Senator and I worked extensively with both Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, and Paul Cassell, a 
   professor of law at the University of Utah College of Law. Both are very skilled and knowledgeable in this area. I happened to find an article that they wrote together in a newspaper. I thought it might be interesting to hear their view. I would like to read it to you and ask for your response:  
   We take it to be common ground that the Constitution should never be amended merely to achieve short-term, partisan, or purely policy objectives. Apart from a needed change in governmental structure, an amendment is appropriate only when the goal involves a basic human right that by consensus deserves permanent respect, is not and cannot adequately be protected through State or Federal legislation--  
   I think we have shown why that can't happen--  
   would not distort basic principles of the separation of powers among the Federal branches or the division of powers between the national and state governments or the balance of powers between government and private citizens with respect to their basic rights. 
   The proposed Victims Rights Amendment meets these demanding criteria. It would protect basic rights of crime victims, including their rights to be notified of and present at all proceedings in their case and to be heard at appropriate stages in the process. These are rights not to be victimized again through the process by which government officials prosecute, punish and release accused or convicted offenders.  
   Then it goes on to say:  
   These are the very kinds of rights with which our Constitution is typically and particularly concerned--rights of individuals to participate in all those government processes that strongly affect their lives. ``Participation in all forms of government is the essence of democracy,'' President Clinton concluded in endorsing the amendment.  
   Now, what we come down to, essentially, is how do you express these things in a way that gives victims these certain basic rights? I think we have tried to do that. We put it up on a schedule here of crime victims' rights. I wish to quickly go over this. The rights of the accused are on the left. The rights we would afford victims are on the right. In a sense, we achieve a kind of balance. Now, the question comes when and if these rights come into conflict. The fact is, I think we both believe it will be rare that these rights come into conflict. As was said, with an emotional victim, there is in the law already the opportunity for a judge to handle this situation. 
   I have had a very hard time, because the Senator and I have had a number of critics on this; we have had a number of newspapers that have editorialized and said that what we are trying is trivial, not important. But let me tell you something. If you are a rape victim and you have reason to believe that individual may come back after you, it is not unimportant that you have notice when that individual is released from prison or from jail. It is not unimportant at all. I indicated earlier a case of an individual who has had to change her name and live in fear and anonymity because of this. The Constitution should protect that victim, and that is what we try to do. So I have had a very hard time seeing instances where there is actual conflict. 
   My question of the Senator is, Can the Senator expand on this more and indicate where there is conflict? People have said, ``You diminish the rights of the accused.'' I don't see us diminishing the rights of the accused. Their rights are very 
   specific. We don't touch on these. There is the right to counsel, the right to due process, the right to a speedy trial. We want that, as well, because we know that the speed of the trial is an important deterrent to violence. We know that if a trial is not speedy, evidence grows cold, witnesses disappear. It is much more difficult to make a case if there is a long hiatus between arrest and trial. In fact, Federal law recognizes that by moving trials along in an expeditious way. 
   Double jeopardy. We certainly don't interfere with that. We certainly don't interfere with the prohibition against self-incrimination or against unreasonable search and seizure, probable cause, a jury of peers, the right to be informed, the right to confront witnesses, to subpoena witnesses, a prohibition against excessive bail, the right to a grand jury. There are a few other rights written into the Constitution. But our rights are so basic for a victim, such as the right to have notice when a trial takes place, the right to be present in the courtroom, the right to make a statement at an appropriate  place in the trial, the right to have notice if your assailant is released. These are certain basic, core rights that in no way, shape, or form, it seems to me, interfere with the constitutional rights granted to a defendant or to an accused to protect them from excessive government under the Constitution of the United States. 
   So I have been very perplexed as to why we see bubbling out there this argument that we are setting up some collision of rights. We are simply trying to provide a victim with certain basic rights that are spelled out and are specific. 
   Would the Senator care to elaborate on that?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. 
   If the Senator recalls, in our earlier discussions with the Justice Department, we were very concerned that the rights of the accused not be violated, not be diminished, and we quite consciously left out any specific remedy in this situation so that if someone doesn't exercise their right either to be present or to make a statement, in effect, they have no remedy, or after they make their statement, if the facts in the trial are such and the jury comes in with a decision, they have no right of a remedy. 
   So the basic core rights we provide are, in a sense, certain procedural rights that give them a place in the process. 
   Let me read what these two law professors have said on this point:  
   The framers of the Constitution undoubtedly assumed the rights of victims would receive decent protection, but experience has not vindicated this assumption. It is now necessary to add a corrective amendment. Doing so would neither extend the Constitution to an issue of mere policy, nor provide special benefits to a particular interest group, nor use the heavy artillery of constitutional amendment where a simpler solution is available, nor would it put the Constitution to a purely symbolic use or enlist it for some narrow partisan purpose. Rather, the proposed amendment would help bridge a distinct and significant gap in our legal system's existing arrangements for the protection of basic human rights against an important category of government abuse.  
   This, I think, goes right to the question of remedy. We don't provide for a remedy, we simply say you have these basic 
   rights to participate in this manner.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday, April 24, marked the 85th anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate this terrible crime and to help ensure that it will never be forgotten. 
   On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their property and land confiscated. 
   As Americans, we are blessed with freedom and security, but that blessing brings with it an important responsibility. We must never allow oppression and persecution to pass without condemnation. By commemorating the Armenian genocide, we renew our commitment always to fight for human dignity and freedom, and we send out a message that the world can never allow genocide to be perpetrated again. 
   Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. Out of the ashes of their history Armenians all across the world have clung to their identity and have prospered in new communities. My State of California is fortunate to be home to a community of Armenian-Americans a half a million strong. They are a strong and vibrant community whose members participate in every aspect of civic life, and California is richer for their presence. 
   Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian genocide; let their deaths not be in vain. We must remember their tragedy to ensure that such crimes can never be repeated. And as we remember Armenia's dark past, we can take some consolation in the knowledge that its future is bright with possibility.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I begin by thanking the Senator from Connecticut. I don't think there is anyone else in the Senate who has the kind of expertise about South America as has Senator DODD of Connecticut. He speaks the language. He has studied. He has traveled in the country widely. He has been to Colombia. 
   On how many occasions has the Senator been to Colombia?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think the Senator has stated the case about as well as it can be stated. I have never been to Colombia. I come at this a little differently, as one who has watched the development of major narcotics trafficking over a long period of time. My State is very much influenced and affected by this kind of narcotrafficking. 
   I have worked with Senator COVERDELL of Georgia in the certification of Mexico. I have watched the development of the big transportation cartels because Colombia is the source country of most of the cocaine. I have watched the big transportation cartels develop in Mexico. I have watched them interface with gangs in our country. I have watched California become the export State of gangs. The Crips and Bloods started in Los Angeles and are now in 118 American cities. I have watched the gang deaths in America over drugs. 
   It is a huge problem. I have watched the debate over supply versus demand. We spend dollars on demand. In fact, local jurisdictions are the ones that mount the demand programs, the prevention, the counseling, the drug abuse programs. The one area in which the Federal Government has total responsibility is interdiction at our borders; it is international narcotics, trafficking, and control. These big amount of drugs come from outside of the United States; therefore, what we do affects our role. 
   I did not know President Pastrana. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, on which I am fortunate to sit, had a meeting with him in the appropriations room during his last trip. I met this young President for the first time. Prior to that, I had been visited by the head of the military under the former government who pointed out with great alarm what he thought was happening and even said he didn't think Pastrana was being strong enough in the drug area. 
   The former head of the military pointed out to me that a third of the country at that time was under control of narcoterrorists. That is a country the size of Switzerland. That is how large the geographic area is. He pointed out that a million and a half citizens were refugees within their own country; 300,000 had fled. He believed that 60,000 had tried to come into this country illegally, people who were devastated by this, running in fear for their lives because of it. 
   We do have a role to play. He pointed out to me there were 3,000 citizens held hostage by narcoterrorists, 250 of them local police, 250 of them soldiers. Nobody knows what happens to these people. 
   I met President Pastrana. He was a very sincere leader, a leader who had been sobered by this, a leader determined to do something about it, a leader pleading for backup and help by the United States. 
   Is it in our national interests to help? I believe it is. All of these drugs come to our country, all of these cartels interface with American gangs, all of these cartels are brutal. They kill anyone who stands in their way--even a Catholic cardinal in Mexico. They kill newspaper heads who write against them. They kill anyone who stands up and says no. 
   The question that Tom Friedman mentioned so eloquently in his New York Times column--and I ask this of the Senator from Connecticut--if someone comes to you and says: here is half a million in an envelope, here is a picture of your wife and where she has her hair done, and a picture of your children and the schools they go to, which will you take? 
   I ask the Senator from Connecticut what kind of courage does it take to stand against that kind of entreaty?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have seen it impact our border areas in the United States. I go down to Otay Mesa where trucks are lined up by the thousands and you have Customs agents who maybe earn $45,000 or $50,000 a year--we know some trucks are loaded with tons of cocaine, with street values of millions of dollars--taking a bribe, maybe half a million dollars just to turn their head and let that truck go through. 
   This is where the corruption becomes so evil and where it is not just confined to jungle areas of Colombia or outposts in Mexico or anywhere else in the Andean region but comes right into the United States as well.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. I think the point is well taken. I, for one, was delighted--because I tend to read all of Tom Friedman's articles in the New York Times--he spent time in Colombia. I was so pleased that he saw what was the central point in all of this debate. I want to quote him. I know the Senator did earlier, and I hope this is not redundant. 
   He said there are two ways to look at Plan Colombia. One is to get wrapped up in the details--the helicopters, the training, why we might or might not like it. The other way, and he suggests the right way, is to step back and ask yourself: What kind of courage does it take? 
   That is what we are talking about here, what kind of courage it takes to stay in Colombia right now--to be a judge who puts drug lords in jail or be a politician such as the President of the country, or the Attorney General, or the generals of the army, or local public officials who fight for the rule of law, knowing that criminals have millions of dollars in drug money and would kill their kids in a second. That is not an esoteric concept. The numbers of children of families who have been killed in drug wars are legion. 
   These people do not care for anybody who stands in their way. The debilitating part about it is the ability to corrupt to get your way. How many people can actually stand up to that? We see over and over and over again where a respected public official, a police officer, a judge, a prosecutor gives in to this kind of tyranny. The Ariano Felix Cartel in Mexico is notorious for this. They will kill anybody standing in their way. Their cocaine comes right out of Colombia. There you have the narcoterrorists controlling a 
   third of their country and everybody and everything within that third. 
   So the real courage, as Mr. Friedman points out, is that the people who are trying to do the right thing deserve our support. This is our hemisphere; it is not another hemisphere. The results of drug trafficking, the results of narcoterrorism, only spread. They do not contain themselves; they spread. The spread is northerly into our country. 
   So I make this point again and again and again: This supplemental appropriation, an appropriation in our budget, is in our national interest. It is in the American national interest to stand tall against the cartels, to stand tall against this kind of terrorism, to support public officials who are willing to do the same thing. That support should be for the Attorney General of Mexico, the President of Mexico, the President of Colombia, the Attorney General of Colombia, the Judges of Colombia, the people who have been able to come back from M-11 and what was done in their country to try to institute a democracy. These are the people who recognize that, yes, there are problems but they are trying to make the changes. The people who plead to this country say: Help us. Don't do the whole thing; just do a part of it. Put your imprimatur of leadership on it so other nations will follow and so we will have the ability to control something which, if we do not, will spread through the whole Andean region and, I contend, to Mexico and to the United States as well. 
   I think you have, essentially, a major battle in this area of South America that will effectively determine the future of these countries--Colombia, the Andean region, Mexico--and to a degree our own country. 
   I very much hope people will reconsider and really look at how important it is to stop this trafficking. I remember the day--and it was in the 1980s--we in the cities of America never saw an arrest involving a ton of cocaine or a ton of any other substances, hundreds of pounds of drugs at one time. Now the arrests are being made, and they are finding 5 tons, 6 tons, 4 tons. 
   The business that is inherent in this, the corruption that comes with it, is so enormous it is beyond anything we can possibly conceive. The complicity by transportation companies is one of the reasons Senator COVERDELL and I worked together on this drug kingpin bill, to apply the RICO statutes to companies doing business with the cartels who simply turn their heads when there are 5 tons of cocaine on a train coming into this country or in a container as part of a fleet of trucks that come across the border every day. People have to open their eyes. They have to see what is happening. We have to begin to support the leaders who will stand tall. 
   I will be very candid with the Senator from Connecticut and our distinguished Presiding Officer from the great State of Maine. If somebody came to me with a picture of my daughter or my granddaughter, I don't know what I would do. I don't know. I believe I would tell them where to get off, but I don't really know. It is like the person who jumps in the river to save someone who is drowning. You don't really know until you are in that situation. 
   The fact is, thousands of people in Colombia are in that situation on a daily basis. What they are saying is: Help, United States. Use your leadership. Give us the resources because we need helicopters that can fly at a certain altitude 
   and have a certain range. The Huey cannot do it; it is the Black Hawk. We need a certain altitude for certain areas. The Huey can't do it; give us the Black Hawk. Help us with some of this other equipment we need and stand by us as we make the battle real.  
   If we are to put our money where our mouth is, it has to be to fight the major trafficker. It has to be to fight the narcoterrorist. It has to be to stand up for the political leaders who are willing to stand against them.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can I ask the Senator a question? I believe the Senator was in the Senate when President Bush gave the order to send American troops to Panama because so many heavy narcotics were coming through Panama, much of it under the control of one person, a general by the name of Manuel Noriega. They picked up this general and brought him back to the United States for trial. To this day, he is in Federal prison in the United States, and the problem has been remedied in Panama. This was the kind of direct recognition of a problem and a response that has solved the problem. Does the Senator agree?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will conclude with one additional comment. Colombia is the source country for 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this Nation. It is the source country of 70 percent of the heroin consumed in this Nation. It is a country under siege. It is a country where one-third of the geographic area is controlled by narcoterrorists, and it happens to have a government that is willing to stand up and say: We want to do something about it. United States, help us in a multilateral effort do something about it. 
   This Senate is saying it does not have time to consider the request. It is in our national interest to consider the request. It is in our national interest to have debate on the request. It is in our national interest to appropriate the dollars for this request. 
   I end by summarizing something Mr. Friedman said in the New York Times:  
   If we give the Colombian majority the aid it needs to fight the drug Mafia, there is a chance--and it's no sure thing --that it will  be able to forge a domestic peace. If we don't --and this is a sure thing--the problem will only get worse, it will spew instability across this region, and the only rain forest your kids will ever see is the Rainforest Cafe.  
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know there is a great deal of discussion going on about the marriage penalty tax. I wanted to stay out of the politics of it, if I could, and just speak about the merits of the proposals for a few moments. 
   Essentially, what we have are three proposals: the Finance Committee proposal of $248 billion, over 10 years; the Moynihan proposal, which is the Democratic proposal, of $150 billion over 10 years; and then I believe a proposal that is really worthy of very serious consideration by this body, and one which I would support, which is a proposal by Senator EVAN BAYH of Indiana for $90 billion over 10 years. 
   I believe this proposal is the most sensible and most fiscally responsible way to go about addressing the issue. More than 21 million couples suffer from the marriage tax penalty. In my State, there are close to 3 million of them. 
   I think providing marriage tax penalty relief is a measure of common sense and a measure of decency. The Tax Code not only can be used for revenue producing, but it is also used to encourage behavior that one believes one should encourage. Certainly getting married is a behavior that one wishes to encourage. 
   Who generally believes that the marriage tax penalty is unfair? They are young couples. They are getting married. Both of them work. They find out, for the first time, they actually pay more taxes if they get married than they do if they remain single. 
   These people are generally under the $100,000 earning limit. I have never heard anyone at the top brackets say they find the marriage tax penalty to be unfair. But I have heard considerable testimony from young couples getting married, young professionals: My goodness, we have to pay this penalty. Why is it? How is it fair? 
   Senator BAYH's proposal strikes right at that heart, and it does so in a way that you can say and I can say--every one of us in this body can say--we eliminate the marriage tax penalty for those earning under $120,000 all across this land within 4 years. I think it is simple. I think it is direct. It is cost effective. And it gets the job done. I think it makes a great deal of sense. 
   The targeted Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act provides significant relief by creating a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, calculated by the taxpayer, using a simple worksheet, which offsets and eliminates the marriage penalty for families making under $120,000. The credit is phased out at $140,000. 
   The bill would also broaden the availability of the earned-income tax credit for low-income working families. 
   Under this legislation, half of all taxpayers with marriage penalties will have their penalties eliminated the first year. By 2004, it completely eliminates the penalty on earned income for all couples making under $120,000. That is approximately 17.5 million couples. 
   If you look at the fact that the impact of the majority proposal by the Finance Committee eliminates most of the marriage tax penalty on 21.6 million couples who currently face penalties by year 10, and provides a bonus--this does not provide a bonus; the phaseout in that bill is over 10 years--the phase in the Bayh bill is over 4 years. In the Moynihan bill, 21.6 million couples who currently incur a marriage tax penalty would find relief by year 10. 
   The beauty of this bill is that all of the marriage tax penalty is eliminated for 17.5 million people by year 4. And less than 10 percent of all households earn more than $120,000 a year. So, effectively, it covers not only 17.5 million people, but it covers over 90 percent of the population who would be affected. It does it at a cost that is much lower than the other two bills--$90 billion. 
   What I like about it is it gives us the opportunity to actually see tax reduction happen, to actually say that within 4 years the marriage penalty tax is completely eliminated for working families earning under $120,000 a year. We do it for a modest amount of $90 billion over 10 years. 
   The other bills deal with all kinds of different so-called hidden penalties, but those are not the real things that I think impact the people's drive to eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   It is what happens when you get married. It is the increase in the tax when you get married. This is entirely eliminated within a 4-year period of time. I support Senator BAYH's proposal, and I will be pleased, when he offers it, to be a cosponsor of it. I hope it will have very serious debate and discussion before this body. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in all too many places and in all too many conflicts in recent years we have witnessed the use of rape and sexual torture as instruments of war. I am sad to say, some incidence of rape has always accompanied war and turmoil in human history, but the record of the past few years, with the use of organized, systematic campaigns of rape to terrorize civilian populations, suggests a new chapter in the barbarity of human history has been opened. 
   It was disturbing to learn there are serious and credible allegations that rebel forces used systematic rape as an instrument of terror in the eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone. 
   While statistics are not yet available, there is clear and credible evidence that thousands of girls and women, ranging from ages 5 to 75, were abducted during the civil war and gang raped. Many were used as sex slaves and forced labor. And it is possible many are still being held captive, subject to the depravations of their inhuman captors. 
   This horrific story was detailed in an article in yesterday's Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent to have the article, entitled ``A War Against Women'' from the April 11, 2000, Washington Post printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD following my remarks. 
   The civilized world must send a strong, unambiguous message that rape and sexual torture are not acceptable under any circumstances and will not be tolerated. The United States must be at the forefront of efforts to help the Government of Sierra Leone bring to justice those responsible for the systematic rape and sexual torture that took place during the civil war.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am as upset by the gasoline price spikes as anyone else. Price spikes have been worse in California than in any other State. Today, as I speak, though prices have recently started to come down a bit, they still average more than $2 per gallon in some parts of California. 
   Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose S. 2285, despite understanding the sentiment behind it. The problem with S. 2285 is that there is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal gasoline tax will be passed on to consumers. Why is this? Because price is a function of supply and demand, not taxes. And right now, world oil markets are extremely tight, so prices are high. 
   The way to relieve the pressure on the market is to boost supply and reduce demand. 
   With regard to supply, fourteen nations sell oil to the U.S. under a cartel known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. Like any monopoly, OPEC controls the price of oil by limiting supply. Decreased production in non-OPEC countries like Venezuela, Mexico, and Norway has also contributed to the squeeze. 
   Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law, there are only a few things the U.S. can do to encourage the cartel to increase supply. The preferred alternative is diplomacy. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has had some success on this front. OPEC ministers announced last month that the cartel would immediately increase supply by 1.7 million barrels a day. Mexico has also agreed to increase production by a small amount. 
   It takes several weeks for production increases to be felt at the pump, in lower prices. And California has unique problems affecting its supply. No other State requires the kind of reformulated gasoline that California does. So the gasoline has to be refined in California. And California refiners have had problems--including two fires--operating their plants at full capacity. They are at full capacity now. 
   Notwithstanding these problems, the announcement of OPEC production increases has driven spot gasoline prices down. They have dropped more than 40 cents, for instance, in the greater Los Angeles area. 
   The spot price is the price of gasoline on the open market without taxes and other markups figured in. Spot prices are usually good harbingers of the price movement we will eventually see at the pump about a month or two later. 
   But the increase in OPEC production is, at best, a short-term solution. By the middle of summer when demand for gasoline will peak, we may be back in the same predicament. 
   As I said a moment ago, S. 2285 doesn't solve the problem of high gasoline prices. Under California law, if the federal gasoline tax drops by 9 cents per gallon or more, then the State tax automatically rises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to protect the Highway Trust Fund. I have spoken with members of the California legislature about this. They do not seem inclined to change the law. 
   Even if the law were changed, the price still wouldn't drop. At least that's what the chief executive officers of the three major California refiners told me. Collectively, they produce 70 percent of California's gasoline. None could guarantee that prices would drop at the pump. They cited the fundamental problem with supply, and also pointed out that they have no control over other entities in the supply chain. 
   What are our options? 
   The fact is, we have limited control over supply. Too much of the world's oil is produced elsewhere. The one thing we can control is demand. 
   The best way to reduce demand is to require that sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and light duty trucks get the same fuel efficiency that passenger vehicles do. If SUVs and light duty trucks had the same fuel efficiency standards as passenger cars, the U.S. would use one million fewer barrels of oil each day. 
   This is roughly equal to the U.S. shortfall before OPEC increased production. 
   The Department of Transportation is responsible for setting fuel efficiency requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF&#201;) program. Abut two-thirds of all petroleum used goes to transportation, so boosting fuel efficiency is an important way to wean ourselves off OPEC oil and reduce the price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider, too, the significant environmental and health benefits of higher fuel efficiency. 
   But CAF&#201; standards have not increased since the mid- 1980s. And the situation is made worse by a loophole in the CAF&#201; regulations. SUVs and light duty trucks--which are as much passenger vehicles as station wagons and sedans--are only required to average 20.7 miles per gallon per fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles. 
   Since half of all new vehicles sold in this country are fuel-thirsty SUVs and light duty trucks, this stranglehold on energy efficiency has produced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards! 
   According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day because of CAF&#201; standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I said a moment ago, and save another million barrels each day. 
   Overall, SUV and light duty truck owners spend an extra $25 billion a year  at the pump because of the ``SUV loophole.'' Making SUVs and light duty trucks get better gas mileage would save their owners some $640 at the pump each year when the price of gasoline averages $2 per gallon. 
   The ``bottom line'' is that eliminating some or all of the federal gasoline tax won't lower prices at the pump. The best way to do that is to reduce our demand. The best way to reduce demand is to increase the gas mileage requirements for SUVs and light duty trucks.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bill entitled the Breast Cancer Research Stamps Reauthorization Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON has joined me as the lead cosponsor. 
   The Breast Cancer Research stamp is the first stamp in our nation's history  dedicated to raising funds for a special cause. Since the stamp's issuance in the summer of 1998, the U.S. Postal Service has sold 164 million Breast Cancer Research stamps--raising over $12 million for breast cancer research. In addition, the stamp has focused public awareness on the devastating disease and has stood out as a beacon of hope and strength around which breast-cancer survivors can rally. 
   Unfortunately, without congressional action, the Breast Cancer Research stamp will expire on July 28, 2000. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2000 would permit the sale of the Breast Cancer Research stamp for 2 additional years. The stamp would continue to cost 40 cents and sell as a first class stamp. The extra money collected will be directed to breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the Specter-Harkin amendment to increase funding for health research by $2.7 billion, an increase of 15 percent over last year. 
   For Fiscal Year 2001, the President is requesting a 5.6 percent increase. That is not enough. Congress has shown its commitment to our five-year goal of doubling NIH funding. In 1997, the Senate voted 98-0 to adopt the Mack-Feinstein amendment, which urged Congress to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health over 5 years. To stay on target, we must add 15 percent again this year, bringing NIH funding to $20.5 billion. That is what this amendment does. 
   This Fiscal Year, the National Institutes of Health is only funding an estimated 31 percent of grant applications. The National Institute on Aging is only funding 22 percent, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 25 percent. NIH officials believe that at least 35 percent of applicants are worthy of funding and others say 50 percent should be funded. Without a significant increase in funding, hundreds of important projects will go without funding. What is it we aren't learning? How many millions of people aren't treated, or cured? 
   Every day 1,500 people in the U.S. die of cancer, our nation's second leading cause of death. This year over half a million people will die of cancer, and 1.2 million will face a new cancer diagnosis. While the mortality rate has dropped for major cancers, including lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate, the mortality rate has risen for liver cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
   The National Cancer Institute has a number of promising areas of research, including: (1) better understanding the unique characteristics of cells and how they become cancerous; (2) molecule-directed prevention approaches, such as Herceptin for advanced breast cancer, Rituximab for non-Hodgin's lymphoma, and STI 571 for leukemia; and (3) early detection of cancer and cancer risk through genetic explanation for cancer risks, environmental influences, and responses to therapies. But we spend one-tenth of one cent of every federal dollar on cancer research. 
   There are still too many diseases for which we have no cure. AIDS has surpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults; it is now the leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44. Diabetes and asthma rates are rising. Forty-thousand infants die each year from devastating diseases. Seven to 10 percent of children are learning disabled. Birth defects affecting function occur in 7 percent of deliveries; that's 250,000 children. 
   Another compelling reason to double NIH funding is that the baby boom generation is getting older. Over the next 30 years, the number of Americans over age 65 will double. As our population ages, we are seeing an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases like arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. For example, the 4 million people with Alzheimer's Disease today will more than triple, to 14 million, by the middle of the next century--unless we find a way to prevent or cure it. Health care costs will grow exponentially and we see that in part reflected in our budget debates over Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. The total annual cost of Alzheimer's today is $100 billion. By finding new treatments through research, if we delay the onset of this disease by 5 years, we can save $50 billion annually. 
   This increase in funding for the NIH is important to California. California organizations receive 20 percent of all NIH grants, and the University of California is one of the top recipients of NIH funding. I am proud to say that California and the UC system contribute immeasurably to medical research supported by NIH grants. With support of NIH, many California researchers have helped find new cures and treatments. For example, Dr. Naomi Balaban at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the NIH, discovered a revolutionary way to fight staph infections without antibiotics by blocking the occurrences that make the bacteria harmful to humans. Then, she created a vaccine that successfully aided mice in resisting this infection. 
   We have made tremendous strides in medical research in the last decade. The Association of American Medical Colleges states, in a June 1999 paper on clinical research:  
   Perhaps the most profound challenge of this era is the sheer scope of scientific and technologic opportunity. The future of scientific advancement and its potential to transform medical practice and improve the health of the public have never been brighter. Astonishing advancements in the basic sciences have profoundly increased understanding of disease mechanisms and identified a plentitude of novel targets for therapeutic and preventive interventions.  
   Better treatments are available, and scientists are learning more and more about how to treat diseases. Patient access to cutting-edge treatments is critical to further research and improve the health of Americans. The NIH is beginning to expand clinical research and, with additional funds, more people can reap the benefits of clinical trials and more effective treatments can be found. 
   For example, the NIH is working on a vaccine for AIDS, better treatments for diabetes, and a better understanding of the entire human genome and its implications. Understanding a person's genetic make-up is helping researchers understand how genes affect a person's susceptibility to disease. This year's development of a new flu drug is a direct result of AIDS research, and a drug now used to treat hepatitis B was originally created to treat AIDS. Additionally, studies have produced better glucose-sensing devices that will greatly reduce the number of finger pricks that diabetics endure. 
   The United States is the world's leader in understanding disease, in developing sophisticated treatments for illnesses and diseases, in making important medical discoveries, and in improving human life expectancy. Yet, we are spending only three cents of every health care dollar on health research. NIH's budget is less than one percent of the federal budget. 
   Inconsistent funding for the NIH discourages the medical community from pursuing research. According to the National Academy of Sciences, we are not producing enough research scientists. That is, in part, due to the uncertainty in health research funding. 
   Simply put, we can do better. We must try to ensure that all promising areas of research are pursued. 
   The public is with us. Fifty-five percent of Californians said they would spend one dollar more in taxes per week for medical research, and 55 percent of Americans said that it is important for the U.S. to remain a world leader in medical research. Every day, I hear from Californians who want a cure for their children, a better treatment for a parent, and more knowledge to prevent disease in themselves. I believe the public wants us to fight a war on disease and that the public sees medical research as a top priority for the federal government. I urge passage of this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise in opposition to this Republican budget resolution. 
   It is with regret because I had sincerely hoped that this year, thanks to a booming economy and a federal budget surplus, Congress would be able to approach the budget resolution in a bipartisan and responsible manner, and do what is necessary to protect Social Security and Medicare, make sure we have adequate funds to meet important domestic priorities like education and the environment, and provide fair tax cuts for working Americans. 
   Indeed, thanks to unprecedented economic growth, the tough choices we made on the budget in 1993, and the discipline we have demonstrated since passing the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, this year we have an opportunity to structure a fiscally responsible budget that pays down the national debt and makes important investments in America's domestic priorities. 
   Unfortunately, this Republican budget resolution threatens to blow a hole in the budget by instituting irresponsibly large tax cuts. It does not provide sufficient funding for important domestic priorities and the long-term fiscal solvency of Social Security and Medicare. 
   When I first came to the Senate seven years ago, we faced $200 billion annual federal deficits as far as the eye could see. Thanks to fiscal discipline and the current economic boom we are running surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the non-Social Security budget surplus over the next ten years will be over $890 billion. 
   Thanks to the size of the surplus we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to pay down our national debt and meet the challenges of the future. 
   We have the opportunity to extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare so that these programs are available for the next several generations of recipients. 
   We have the opportunity to invest in education, the environment, and health care. To reduce class size and increase Title I funding. To clean up our environmental treasures, including Lake Tahoe. To provide health care for all children. 
   We have the opportunity to provide prescription drugs for seniors who currently have to make the choice between paying for food or prescription drugs. 
   And we have the opportunity to provide fiscally responsible and targeted tax cuts for working Americans. 
   Unfortunately, this budget resolution is not fiscally responsible, and it does not meet these needs. 
   The budget resolution calls for $150 to $200 billion in tax cuts over the next five years. Who knows how much these cuts will cost over the next ten years? Tax cuts that appear to be modest and reasonable at first will mushroom in years six to ten to something like $1 trillion. To hide this the Republicans on the Budget Committee did not even try to estimate the size of these tax cuts in the so-called ``out'' years. They did not even try because the reality is that these tax cuts will be greater than the non-Social Security budget surplus over 10 years, just as they are over 5 years. 
   This budget resolution uses the surplus for tax cuts, not debt reduction. The non-Social Security budget surplus is expected to be $171 billion over the next five years, but this budget resolution calls for $168 to $218 billion in tax cuts over the same period. Quite simply, this resolution does not protect Social Security surpluses. 
   The Republican budget calls for increases in spending on defense, education, veterans health care, and income support payments for farmers. I applaud these increases. We need a strong defense. To take care of veterans. To educate our children. To protect our farmers from income fluctuations that are the result of weather, disease and market conditions. 
   Unfortunately, to increase funding for these priorities while providing almost $1 trillion in tax breaks would result in a ten percent across-the-board cut in all other non-defense discretionary spending. 
   Let me tell you what this means for ordinary people. Over the next 5 years a 10 percent across-the-board budget cut would cut: 
   750,000 low-income women, infants and children from WIC; 1,100 FBI and 900 DEA agents; 316,000 Pell Grants for needy students; and 40,000 students from Head Start. 
   This budget resolution would leave the COPS program about 40,000 police officers short of the goal of 150,000. It would prevent us from providing urgent repairs for 5,000 schools. It could force us to abandon plans to put 100,000 new teachers in our classrooms and reduce class sizes. 
   The reality is that even though this budget is predicated on slashing these programs, and more, the Republican Congress has not been able to slash non-defense discretionary spending. Domestic spending grew in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. In fact, it grew by more than ten percent last year. 
   So what are our options? 
   This budget resolution forces us to decide between an across-the-board ten percent budget cut in domestic spending or dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund. This is not fiscal discipline. This is not fiscally responsible. 
   We must extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. This budget resolution opens the door to raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, thereby reducing the solvency of these entitlements. 
   We must take this once in a lifetime opportunity to provide prescription drugs for seniors that cannot afford them. This budget resolution will not do so. 
   We must take this opportunity to expand Title I, secure funding for 100,000 new teachers, modernize schools, and increase Head Start funding. To extend the 100,000 COPS program and protect our children from gun violence. To bolster the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ability to protect our borders. To protect the environment and expand mass transit in California and other states. 
   Let me be clear: In addition to spending on these important domestic priorities, I also believe that we have a responsibility to provide tax relief. 
   In fact, last year Senator GRASSLEY and I introduced the Tax Relief for Working Americans Act of 1999. This is legislation to provide tax relief for working families in a fiscally responsible manner--$271 billion over ten years--and in a budget framework which protects Social Security and Medicare. It includes provisions to eliminate the marriage penalty for 21 million working couples, provide for health insurance and child care, promote long-term care, create more affordable housing, make education more affordable, and keep our economy strong through incentives such as the research and development tax credit. 
   We must provide targeted tax relief; Eliminate the marriage penalty; Expand the earned income tax credit; Establish a long-term care tax credit; Establish educational savings accounts and Individual Development Accounts; Permanently expand the research and experimentation tax credit. 
   I believe that given the health of our economy and the Federal budget surplus we can provide the American people with real tax relief, responsible tax relief. But this Republican budget resolution does not do so. 
   The current economic boom has presented us with a unique opportunity--we can save Social Security and Medicare, invest in domestic priorities, provide for a strong national defense and give working Americans targeted tax relief. All while paying down the national debt. 
   Unfortunately, this budget resolution includes unrealistic tax cuts that risk upsetting the current economic climate. This resolution may set us down a path of fiscal irresponsibility that will endanger all of our gains of the past few years. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this budget resolution.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Amendment by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. In supporting this Amendment, however, I would like to make clear my views on the question of the repeal of the federal gas tax. 
   I do not think that, under present circumstances, repeal of the federal gas tax is necessary or warranted. Yes, gas prices have gone up precipitously over the past several months--to more than $2 a gallon in California--but there is some evidence that prices may now be easing. 
   More important, I have discussed this issue with the chief executive officers of several major U.S. oil companies, and none could promise that any of these savings would be passed on to consumers. Market forces--supply and demand--dictate how much, if any, of a fuel tax cut would be seen at the pump. 
   For California, repealing more than 9 cents of the federal gasoline tax merely triggers an automatic increase in the state gasoline tax. Under the California tax code, if the federal gas tax drops below 9 cents per gallon and if Federal Highway Trust Fund payments to California are reduced accordingly, the state tax goes up. 
   In other words, if all federal fuel taxes are eliminated and funding for the highway trust fund is therefore reduced, the overall tax will remain the same in California and Californians hurt by high gasoline prices will not benefit. 
   I am also concerned that repeal of the federal fuel tax may endanger the Highway Trust Fund and imperil important highway projects. The highway trust fund, which is funded by the federal fuel tax, provides about half a billion dollars a year for California, money which is used to seismically retrofit bridges to protect them against earthquakes; replace the I-80, which was destroyed by the 1992 earthquake; repair potholes; and otherwise maintain our roads and bridges. 
   The bottom line is that the current spike in gas prices is due to a supply squeeze: There is simply not enough oil in the market to meet demand. Although I was pleased that members of OPEC, as well as Norway, Mexico, and Venezuela, have agreed to increase production somewhat, it is still unclear if these production increases will be sufficient to meet demand over the next several months. 
   For that reason, I think it is important to underscore that just as I do not feel we should repeal the federal fuel tax now, I do not believe we should precipitously foreclose our options. 
   Alongside initiatives to increase fuel efficiency and develop alternate sources, suspension or repeal of a portion of the federal fuel tax in a way that benefits the consumer and does not harm highway spending may be necessary later if this crisis does not ease, and I intend to continue keeping a close eye on this issue.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last May, in the wake of the Columbine massacre, this Senate took action, passing a comprehensive juvenile justice bill that would begin the long process of addressing the problems that plague the youth in this country. 
   Parts of the bill addressed our crisis of violence. 
   These provisions included: A comprehensive package of measures I authored with Senator HATCH to fight criminal gangs; increased penalties for adults who recruit children into criminal activity or provide them with firearms; the James Guelff Body Armor Act, an amendment I authored, which contains reforms to take body armor out of the hands of criminals and put it into the hands of police; and other provisions related to juvenile confinement, juvenile record-keeping, and countless other important issues. 
   Parts of the bill addressed our crisis of guns: a ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines; a provision to close the gun show loophole; a requirement that safety locks be included with every handgun sold in America; and my provision to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines. 
   But the crisis in leadership remains. 
   Despite passage by both Houses of Congress almost one year ago, the conference committee on this bill has met only once--in early August of last year. No real issues have been discussed. No progress has been made. The bills sit in legislative purgatory, apparently never to see the light of day again. 
   It now seems clear that these bills will die a quiet death at the end of this short session. As a result, all of the important issues we debated will remain un-addressed. Gang violence, juvenile detention, firearm regulation reform, and a host of other problems will remain unsolved. 
   And nobody within the walls of this Chamber or elsewhere has any doubt why this stalemate persists. This bill would have passed months ago were it not for those four, simple, targeted gun measures buried within the text of the bill. 
   This, Mr. President, demonstrates just how deeply this Congress is dominated by just one special interest group--these people who fervently resist any regulations on firearms, no matter how mild, no matter how targeted, and no matter how much the American people want it. 
   Some argue that we don't need more gun control laws--enforcing our current laws would be enough. But those arguments miss the point entirely. 
   Of course we should be enforcing our current laws. And we are. The evidence clearly shows that gun prosecutions are up. In fact; since 1992, the total number of federal and state prosecutions has increased sharply--about 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for state and federal weapons offenses now than in 1992 (from 20,681 to 25,186). 
   The number of higher-level federal firearms offenders sent to prison (those sentenced to five or more years) has gone up more than 34 percent (from 1049 to 1406) in six years. 
   The number of inmates in federal prisons on firearm or arson charges (the two are counted together) increased 51 percent from 1993 to 1998, to 8,979. 
   And we are working to improve this situation. 
   Just last week, my colleague Senator KOHL and I introduced legislation that would expand Project Exile to 50 cities and provide law enforcement with ballistics technology that will make it far easier to identify and to punish the perpetrators of gun violence. 
   Early last year, I wrote the Secretary of the Treasury several times to demand greater attention to those who violate the Brady Law. I asked why so few violators had been prosecuted, and I was told that the resources just aren't there. 
   That is why I support the President's request to fund at least 500 additional ATF agents and 1,000 new prosecutors to focus on guns. 
   But enforcing our current laws has been made tougher by the concerted efforts of the NRA to disparage and to destroy the very people tasked with enforcing those laws. The NRA called AFT agents ``jack-booted thugs,'' in a letter that was completely contradictory to what they are saying they want now. 
   In fact, every time the opportunity arises to increase federal 
   law enforcement capabilities by increasing ATF investigatory ability, the NRA fights it tooth and nail: 
   The NRA fought the Brady bill for 10 years. 
   They successfully defeated all attempts to allow the Consumer Products Safety Commission to regulate the safety of firearms. 
   In 1986, the NRA got legislation passed which restricts ATF inspection of gun dealers to once per year. Even dealers who are the source for hundreds of crime guns cannot be routinely inspected more than once a year without a special court warrant. 
   For years, the NRA has successfully blocked ATF computerization of gun sale records from gun dealers that have gone out of business. As a result, when a gun is traced as part of a criminal investigation, the files must often be retrieved manually from warehouses where the old records are kept. This can add days or even weeks to the time it takes to start tracking down the perpetrators of gun violence. By the time the records are found, the trail may already be cold. 
   And most importantly, the NRA fights against funding our law enforcement agencies at levels adequate to enforce our current laws. As former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton has said, ``The NRA has strenuously opposed increased financing for the [ATF] and has successfully lobbied against giving it the authority to quickly investigate the origins of guns sales.'' 
   The ATF has been left underfunded, understaffed, and unable to adequately enforce our current gun laws. 
   And the simple fact is that our current laws--even if fully enforced--are just not enough. Those laws are riddled with NRA-induced loopholes. Guns are still too easy to get. And too many children die every day for us to ignore the problem. The Columbine incident shocked this nation and this Congress to its core--as did the school shootings in Jonesboro, Arkansas; West Paducah, Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi; Springfield, Oregon; and Edinboro, Pennsylvania. And in my own state of California, we saw a hateful bigot kill a  postal worker and then wound five others at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills. 
   Those incidents were tragic. But countless incidents go relatively unreported, but with equally tragic results. Every day in this country, another dozen children die of gunshot wounds. 
   A new study published in the April issue of the American Journal of Public Health found that over a third of American children live in a home where there is also a gun--in 43% of those homes, the firearm is stored unlocked. 
   Who knows how may lives could be saved if trigger locks were made available to gun owners? 
   The pictures of those young children in Granada Hills being led away from the scene of the tragedy were not only heart-wrenching but also clearly depicted the trickle-down of gun crimes in this country. The victims of gun violence get younger, and younger. 
   We must close the gun law loopholes for those children. 
   We must pass the juvenile justice bill so that we can at least begin the process of solving some of these problems. 
   We must pass this bill for the fifth grader from San Francisco who wrote me that ``One day I saw a neighbor of mine get shot on her way to the candy house. She got shot 4 times. She got shot 3 times in her side and once in her leg. Now she's paralyzed for life. That really hurt me and a lot of other people. She was only 12 years old and she was a nice little girl.'' 
   We should pass this bill for the other fifth grader who told me ``every year I hear at least 20 gunshots. I am scared at night because I think it's going to be a drive-by. I even sometimes can't go outside to recess because gunshots are heard.'' 
   We must pass this bill for the little girl who wrote me that ``I do not like to be locked in my room just because my mom feels I can't be safe in my own neighborhood and I think everybody deserves to live just like human beings.'' 
   We must pass this bill so that the next six year old child who decides to seek revenge on a classmate is not able to find a gun so easily. 
   And so that the next kindergartner who gets a timeout from the teacher and tries to bring his grandfather's gun to school the next day to get revenge is likewise left without a weapon. 
   I say, enough is enough. The least this Congress can do is turn to the juvenile justice bill and move forward with the Senate-passed gun provisions. These provisions are no-brainers. And there is no excuse for inaction. 
   Before I conclude, I want to talk briefly about the problem of gang violence in this country. This is a problem that I have taken seriously for many years--every since my days on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors and as Mayor for 9 years when I worked to create the city's first anti-gang task force after the infamous gang massacre at the Golden Dragon Restaurant in 1977. In those shooting, gang members killed five people, including two tourists, and injured 11 others. 
   For the last 4 years in the Senate, I have worked with Senator HATCH to craft national legislation giving law enforcement the tools they need to fight gang crime and gang violence. 
   Criminal youth gangs have become a national problem, extending their virulent reach and bringing with them murder, drive-by shootings, drug sales, intimidation, and destruction of theft of property. 
   Gangs plague more than 4,700 cities in all 50 states. 
   There are some 25,000 gangs with over 650,000 members, and the problem continues to spread. 
   In Los Angeles, for example, there are currently 408 gangs with more than 64,000 members. This is 15,000 more members than 10 years ago. 
   That means that there are currently more gang members in L.A. alone than there are people in most of America's cities and towns. For instance, the number of gang members in L.A. is almost double the population of the largest city in Vermont. 
   And these gang members do not stay in California. The state ``exports'' more gang members than any other state. 
   For instance, two of the largest gangs, the Bloods and Crips--with more than 60,000 members--are based in Southern California, but operate in more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest. In fact, one recent survey found gangs claiming affiliation with the Bloods and/or Crips in 180 cities in 42 states. (Department of Justice) 
   The mere existence of gangs is a terrible social problem. Gang members are far more likely to commit crimes than non-gang youths, even those who may have grown up under similar circumstances. 
   This is especially true for homicides; drive-by shootings; using, selling, and stealing drugs; auto theft; carrying concealed weapons in school; and intimidating or assaulting victims and witnesses. 
   In fact, the Los Angeles Police Department has told me that almost half of violent crime in the city is committed by gang members. 
   And the problem is just as acute in other cities, big and small. Just a few months ago in my home city of San Francisco, for example, an innocent bystander was caught in the crossfire between two warring gangs in the Mission District. He was shot through both legs and may be crippled for life. A brave witness assisted police in apprehending the perpetrators. But gang members later cornered the witness, held a automatic gun to his head and threatened to blow his head off if he continued to help the police. 
   Also, recently in San Francisco, gang members stuck an assault weapon in the face of a victim in an attempted robbery. When the victim resisted, he was shot 17 times. The victim survived but will never walk again. 
   Let me give some specifics about gang-sponsored violent crime. 
   Killings: Around the country, every year, gang members kill over 3,000 people. Last year in Los Angeles alone, there were 136 gang-related killings. 
   Drugs: A survey of law enforcement agencies suggests that about 75% of gang members are involved in illegal drug sales; that about one-third of gangs are organized specifically for the purpose of trafficking in drugs; and that gangs make over 30% of crack cocaine and marijuana sales. (Department of Justice) 
   Guns: Ninety percent of gang members report that their fellow gang members carry concealed weapons and 80% report that those members had taken guns to school. Worse, the study showed that gang members favor powerful, lethal weapons over smaller caliber handguns. (Ohio State University study). 
   The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill includes a number of key measures to address this complex problem. The bill: 
   Provides $100 million annually in federal aid for certain intense gang activity areas, so those communities can afford to create joint task forces with federal and local law enforcement and to support community gang prevention efforts; 
   Increases sentences for interstate drug gang activity; 
   Makes it a Federal offense to recruit youngsters into a gang; 
   Enables Federal law enforcement to prosecute gangs who cross state lines to commit gang crimes such as drive-by shootings; and 
   Increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors. 
   Since we passed the juvenile justice bill last May, an estimated 30,000 people have died from gunshot wounds, including 3,700 children. 
   If history is any judge, millions of large capacity ammunition feeding devices have been approved for import--in the year preceding the juvenile justice bill, more than 11 million of those clips were approved. 
   All of the commonsense gun, gang, and other provisions in the juvenile justice bill are now at risk of disappearing without a trace, and I urge the majority to proceed with the conference and come to a compromise. 
   The compromise should preserve intact the Senate-passed gun control legislation, which represents the bare minimum we should do this year to stem the gun violence that is increasingly common on our streets and in our schools. 
   I also urge this body to pass the President's gun enforcement initiative. That initiative, which will fund more than 500 new ATF agents and 1,000 new prosecutors, is vital to the enforcement of our current gun laws. 
   The crisis of leadership has come to a head. It is time for this Congress to take serious and bipartisan steps to stem the tide of youth and gun violence that continues to plague this nation.  
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as we debate the priorities for spending in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, I am pleased to have voted yesterday for the Bingaman education amendment. Unfortunately, the Senate tabled this amendment yesterday by a 54 to 46 vote. This amendment begins to address some of the critical needs of our schools. But more importantly, it says, ``We think education is important. We think education is a priority. We think education should be nourished, not starved.'' 
   This amendment adds important resources in several ways: 
   It supports the $4.5 billion or 12.6 percent increase for education that the President proposed for FY 2001 over the previous year. 
   It adds $1 billion for Title I, the program that helps school districts educate disadvantaged students. If Congress follows through with FY 2001 appropriations, this would bring total Title I funding next year to $9.9 billion, up from $8.5 billion in FY 2000. 
   It adds $2 billion to train new teachers and current teachers. 
   It provides $1.75 billion to continue to reduce class sizes in the early grades. 
   It increases funds for afterschool programs to give students extra help. 
   It provides $1.3 billion to repair schools in high-need areas. 
   It adds $1 billion for special education, programs to help disabled students. 
   It raises the maximum Pell Grant, aid for needy college students, from $3,500 to $3,700. 
   This amendment is timely because the federal share of elementary and secondary education has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in 1999-2000. Hopefully, this amendment will begin to reverse that decline. 
   The schools in my state face huge challenges--low test scores, crowded classrooms, teacher shortages, growing enrollments, decrepit buildings. In short, they are overwhelmed. 
   California has 5.8 million students, more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country. 
   California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Eleven percent or 30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials. 
   California has 40 percent of the nation's immigrants; we have 50 languages in some schools. Children from these families need special attention, not just in English language learning but in dealing with huge adjustments of learning to live in a new country. 
   California's students lag behind students from other states. Only about 40 to 45 percent of the state's students score at or above the national median, on the Stanford 9 reading and math tests. 
   For school construction, modernization and deferred maintenance, California needs $21 billion by 2003 or 7 new classrooms per day. Two million California children go to school today in 86,000 portable classrooms. 
   California's Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible children. 
   For higher education, the University of California has the most diverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 percent of all student financial aid funding that UC students received. Our colleges and universities are facing ``Tidal Wave II,'' the demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will inundate California's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 because the number of high school graduates will jump 30 percent. 
   California's schools are in crisis. The needs of my state are huge. 
   While these needs cry out for resources, the federal government is contributing only 6 percent of total education funding. Funds are so short in my state that California teachers are spending around $1,000 a year out of their own pockets to pay for books, magic markers, scissors and other school supplies, according to the San Diego Tribune, August 16, 1999. 
   Why should we be increasing funds for education? Let me answer that question by giving you an example of the state of our schools, as expressed by a young student. I would like to read a letter from Hannah Wair, a 14-year-old from Santa Rosa, California, who graphically describes her school:

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that yesterday the Senate unanimously passed a bill I introduced to name a United States Post Office after Joseph Santos Ileto. He was the U.S. Postal Service employee of Filipino descent who was brutally gunned down last August by the same man who opened fire on the North Valley Jewish Community Center. This bill designates the new post office located at 14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California as the ``Joseph Ileto Post Office.'' 
   Joseph Ileto's death on the job exemplifies the ultimate sacrifice of public service. He served our nation with honor and will be remembered by his family, friends, and community as a kind-hearted man who touched many lives. Despite the tragedy of his death, we can take comfort in knowing that Joseph's life will continue to touch others. 
   By passing this bill, Congress recognizes the urgent need to address and condemn hate crimes and racism. Dedication of the newly constructed post office in Joseph's hometown is the very least we can do to honor a man who gave his life to his country. The companion legislation, sponsored by Congressman GARY MILLER, has already passed. It is my hope that the bill will be signed into law expeditiously.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution. I tried to submit it during the first session of the 106th Congress, but due to a clerical error, it was never printed. This resolution commends and remembers events that transpired in Remy, France as its citizens honored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps pilot, Lieutenant Houston Braly. This inspiring story happened over fifty years ago, but its example of compassion and brotherhood remains in our hearts and minds. 
   On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. After three unsuccessful attacks at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion. 
   Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and nearly all  buildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its historic stained-glass windows were shattered. 
   It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly at only twenty-two years of age. 
   Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German authorities. 
   The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers continued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of punishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople. 
   Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, discovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization that would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a gesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds. 
   On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.'' 
   I know that my fellow Senators will want to join me in commending the people of Remy for their kindness and recognized the comrades of Lt. Braly for their goodwill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I draw the attention of the Senate to a timely Opinion-Editorial, written by former Ambassador Leonard Woodcock, that appeared in the March 9, 2000 Los Angeles Times. Long a champion of workers' welfare and workers' rights, Ambassador Woodcock was also the first United States Ambassador's to the People's Republic of China. 
   Ambassador Woodcock lays out, in a clear and well-reasoned manner, powerful arguments showing how the United States will benefit from establishing permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, and why it is in our interest to see China in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Equally important, the author forces those who profess a concern for Chinese workers' rights to take a realistic look at how our decision concerning China PNTR will help or harm workers in China. 
   I comment Ambassador Woodcock's thought-provoking commentary to all my colleagues in the Congress and, even more, to all persons interested in understanding the basics of the U.S.-China PNTR debate. I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Woodcock's Opinion-Editorial be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD following my remarks.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Stuart Prentiss Herman, a prominent California attorney who passed away recently, in Los Angeles, at the young age of 57 after battling cancer. 
   Mr. Herman lived his life fighting injustice and discrimination wherever he found it. He was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960's, and began his legal career in 1968 as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. 
   After his term as a federal attorney, Mr. Herman entered private practice. His legal work was devoted to labor and civil rights law, and he was highly respected throughout the country as a litigator, a mediator, and an arbitrator of complex and significant cases, particularly in the areas of racial discrimination and sexual harassment. In addition to his private practice, Mr. Herman was committed to providing legal services to the less privileged members of our society, and served on the Managing Committee of Bet Tzedek Legal Services, the Southern California Committee of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Board of Directors of the Western Law Center for Disability Rights. 
   He was also committed to preserving the quality of our legal system, having served on the California State Bar Complainants' Grievance Panel and the Los Angeles Police Commission's discipline panels, and our judiciary, having served on the Los Angeles County Bar Association's Judicial Evaluations Committee and on the U.S. Court of Appeals' Ninth Circuit Task Force on Judicial Reporting. 
   Stuart Prentiss Herman was an exemplary attorney, having truly dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice for all Americans. I rise today in recognition of all that he accomplished during his lifetime, and in sadness that he passed away at such an early age.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1,200 students from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People..... The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am very proud to announce that the class from Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton will represent the State of California. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals. Through their experience, they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The We the People..... The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The primary goal of the program is to promote civic competence and responsibility among our nation's elementary and secondary students. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People..... program has provided curricular material for more than 26 million students nationwide. 
   The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress. The students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing several regions of the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. Their testimony is followed by a period of questioning by a simulated Congressional committee. The judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   The class from Amador Valley High School is currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the We the People..... national finals and continued success in their future endeavors.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to send to the desk a bill cosponsored by Senator KYL of Arizona and Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa for reference to committee. 
   The bill is entitled the ``Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2000.'' 
   The crime of identity theft has become one of the major law enforcement challenges of the new economy because vast quantities of sensitive personal information are now vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse. 
   What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses another person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license number, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car loans, phone plans, or other services in the potential victim's name. Of course, the victim does not know the theft has happened until he or she receives bills for items he or she didn't buy; plans for which he or she didn't contract, and so on. 
   Identity thieves get personal information in a myriad of ways. They steal wallets and purses containing identification cards. They use personal information found on the Internet. They steal mail, including preapproved credit offers and credit statements. They fraudulently obtain credit reports or they get someone else's personnel records at work. 
   All indications are that there is an alarming growth of this highly invasive crime. I believe the time has come to do something about it. A national credit bureau has reported that the total number of identity theft inquiries to its Theft Victim Assistance Department grew from 35,000 theft inquiries in 1992 to over one-half million in 1997. That is over a 1,400-percent increase. It is national. It touches every State and it impacts every area of our citizenry. 
   The United States Postal Inspection Service reports that 50,000 people a year have become victims of identity theft since it first began collecting information on identity theft in the mid-1990s. 
   In total, the Treasury Department estimates that identity theft annually causes between $2 and $3 billion in losses from credit cards alone. 
   The legislation I introduce today, along with Senators KYL and GRASSLEY, tackles this issue. It makes it harder for criminals to access another person's private information, it gives consumers more tools to uncover fraudulent activity conducted in their name, and it expands the authority of the Social Security Administration to prosecute identity theft. 
   The Identity Theft Prevention Act makes it harder for criminals to steal personal information. First, it closes a loophole in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that permits personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, one's mother's maiden name, and birth date to be distributed without restriction to marketers. This sensitive information would be treated under this bill like any other part of the credit report, with its disclosure restricted to businesses needing the data for extensions of credit, employment applications, insurance applications, or other permissible purposes. 
   This bill codifies, also, the practice of placing fraud alerts on a consumer's credit file and gives the Federal Trade Commission the authority to impose fines against credit issuers that ignore the alert. Too many credit issuers are presently ignoring fraud alerts to the detriment of identity theft victims. 
   Additionally, the bill requires credit bureaus to investigate discrepancies between their records and the address, birth date, and other personal information submitted as a part of an individual's application for credit, so that telltale signs of fraudulent applications such as incorrect addresses are immediately flagged. 
   The bill improves how credit card companies monitor requests for new credit cards or changes of address. For example, it requires that credit card holders always be notified at their original address when a duplicate card is sent to a new address. 
   This legislation also gives consumers more access to the personal information collected about them, which is a critical tool in combating identity theft. Currently, six States--Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, and New Jersey--have statutes that entitle consumers to one free personal credit report annually. This act makes this a national requirement. Every consumer across this Nation would have access to a free credit report. In addition, consumers could review the personal information collected about them by individual reference services for a reasonable fee. With greater access to their own personal information, consumers can proactively check their records for evidence of identity theft and uncover other errors. 
   We have worked with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission in preparing this legislation. I believe the staff of the FTC is supportive of this bill. This bill is also supported by the Consumer Federation of America. 
   We try to empower victims in this bill. This legislation calls for measures to help identity theft victims recover from the crime. In cases of identity theft, all too often victims get treated as if they were the criminals. Victims receive hostile notices from creditors who mistakenly believe they have not paid their bills. Victims' access to credit is jeopardized, and they can spend years trying to restore their good name. 
   This legislation calls upon the credit industry to assist victims in notifying credit issuers of fraudulent charges by developing a single model credit reporting form. However, should the credit industry fail to implement these measures, the Federal Trade Commission would then be authorized to take action. 
   Maureen Mitchell, an identity theft victim, recently described why this assistance is needed at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information, a subcommittee on which I am ranking member. She 
   said:  
   I have logged over 400 hours of time trying to clear my name and restore my good credit. Words are unable to adequately express the gamut of emotions that I feel as a victim.  
   Another victim wrote to me:  
   I have spent an ungodly number of hours trying to correct the damage that has been done by the individual who stole my identity. Professionally, as a teacher and a tutor, my hours are worth $35. I have been robbed of $5,250 in time. I have been humiliated in my local stores because checks have been rejected at the checkout. I am emotionally drained. I am a victim and Congress needs to recognize me as such.  
   We try in this bill to do that. 
   This legislation targets the theft and misuse of another person's Social Security number, a major cause of identity theft. While the Social Security Administration has the ability to impose civil penalties for misusing a Social Security number to falsely obtain government benefits, it has no authority over other offenses involving the misuse of Social Security numbers. This bill gives them that authority. The  Identity Theft Prevention Act authorizes the Social Security Administration to impose civil monetary penalties against any individual who:

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
   Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the first in a series of several bills I will be proposing to provide law enforcement with the tools they need to enforce our current gun laws. 
   Let me be clear--I do believe that our current laws need to be enhanced. Too many loopholes allow too many criminals to circumvent the laws already in place. To that end, I will continue to work on legislation to further restrict criminals' access to deadly firearms. 
   But it is also clear that we can do better in enforcing the laws already on the books. As a result, today I am proposing legislation that will tighten up the enforcement of our current laws. The legislation I have sent to the desk, the Firearms Dealer Penalty Flexibility Act of 2000, will provide the Treasury Department, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the ability to punish dealers according to the severity of their crimes. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and I hope the National Rifle Association is listening, too. It is time for that organization to stop just talking about enforcing our current gun laws, and to start supporting legislation to help in that process. So today I challenge the NRA to support this bill and others like it. For too long, opponents of gun control have talked about enforcement, while at the same time working to tie the hands of those that enforce the laws. It is time to move forward. 
   Now let me describe just what this legislation would accomplish. 
   Mr. President, under current law there exists only one penalty for firearms dealers who violate the law--revocation of their license. If a dealer violates the law, the ATF is left with only two options--permanently revoke the dealer's license, or do nothing. 
   The problem, of course, is that not every violation merits the permanent revocation of a dealer's license. The current law is like having the death penalty for every crime--from jaywalking to murder. We have graduated sanctions in the criminal law because different crimes merit different punishment. 
   In most instances, the ATF is understandably reluctant to destroy a dealer's livelihood--and the dealers know this. As a result, thousands of violations every year go unpunished. 
   Last year, ATF conducted 11,234 examinations, and reported 3,863 violations. 
   Yet only 20 licenses were actually revoked. 
   Almost 4,000 violations, just 20 revocations. 
   And this may have actually been the appropriate response. Again, not every violation is deserving of revocation. Many of these dealers are simply businessmen, who may have made one or two simple mistakes. Taking away their livelihood would be inappropriately harsh. 
   But at the same time, ATF has informed me that there are other dealers out there who are taking advantage of the current system. These dealers know that if they commit a violation, they probably won't even get caught--after all, with more than 100,000 dealers and only a few hundred inspectors, the odds of catching a dealer in the act are slim. And even worse than that, these dealers know that even if they are caught, and even if ATF does discover a violation or even a pattern of violations, it is very unlikely that anything will be done. 
   According to ATF, only the most egregious or repeat offenders are punished. 
   Mr. President, it was clearly not the intent of Congress when passing laws to regulate firearms dealers in this country that dealers would be effectively immune from those laws. 
   The current situation leaves law enforcement with little choice--if ATF revokes the license of every dealer that commits a minor violation, the NRA would be up in arms. But if they do the right thing under current law and allow dealers to stay in business, they are criticized for failing to enforce the current law. 
   Well the bill I propose today would put an end to this 
   quandary, and allow  the Treasury Department to impose the proper, proportionate penalties for the variety of violations currently on the books. 
   Specifically, this legislation, supported by the Administration, would do the following: 
   For willful violations of the law, this legislation would allow the Treasury Department to suspend or revoke a dealer's license, or to assess a fine of up to $10,000 per violation; 
   Those same penalties would be available for any dealer who willfully transfers armor piercing ammunition; 
   The legislation allows the Treasury Department to negotiate a compromise with a dealer at any time; 
   And the legislation outlines some clear, procedural protections for dealers-- 
   A right to notice and opportunity for a hearing before any action is taken, so that the dealer may be made aware of the charges and seek to avert the action; 
   A right to written notice of any action taken, including the grounds upon which the action was based; 
   A right to a prompt hearing after a penalty is assessed, during which time the dealer can contest the outcome. This hearing must even be held at a location convenient to the dealer; 
   If the second hearing is not fruitful, the dealer has an additional right to appeal the decision of the Department to federal court, during which time any action is stayed. 
   Mr. President, these procedural safeguards prevent an aggressive agent from pursuing unfair penalties. There are at least three clear opportunities for an aggrieved dealer to make his or her case, including the right to appeal any decision to federal court. 
   As a result, I believe that this bill gives law abiding firearms dealers every opportunity necessary to protect themselves against unwarranted claims. 
   At the same time, this bill provides law enforcement with the variety of sanctions necessary to force true compliance with the laws already on the books. No more will rogue dealers flout the law knowing that no viable recourse is available to law enforcement. 
   Once this legislation passes, the punishment will finally fit the crime. 
   Mr. President, again I challenge the NRA and my colleagues to join me in moving this bill forward. We cannot continue to allow miscreant gun dealers to ignore the laws passed by this Congress.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 14, a proposed constitutional amendment to protect our national flag from physical desecration. 
   S.J. Res. 14 would give Congress, and Congress alone, the authority to draft a statute to protect the flag. It would give Congress the opportunity to construct, deliberately and carefully, precise statutory language that clearly defines the contours of prohibitive conduct. 
   At the outset, let me say that amending the Constitution is serious business, indeed. I know that, and I know we need to tread carefully. The Constitution is, after all, democracy's sacred text. But the Constitution is also a living text. As originally conceived, it had no Bill of Rights. In all, it has been amended 27 times. 
   If the Constitution is democracy's sacred text, then the flag is our sacred symbol. In the words of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, it is ``a symbol of our freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations.'' [dissenting opinion in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 437 (1989)] 
   If the flag had no symbolic value, we would not get chills when we see it lowered to half-mast or draped on a coffin. 
   We wouldn't feel so much pride when we see it flying in front of our homes or at our embassies abroad. I wonder, is there any of us who can forget that wonderful Joe Rosenthal photograph of the six Marines hoisting that flag on the barren crag of Mount Suribachi, after the carnage at Iwo Jima, where over 6,800 American soldiers were killed. There have been many photographs of soldiers. There has been no photograph I know of that so endures in our mind's eye, that has carried so much symbolism, as that one. I remember seeing it because the San Francisco Chronicle ran it on the front page during World War II. I was just a small child, but from that point on, I knew the flag was something special. 
   People speak metaphorically about the fabric of our society and how it has become frayed. I submit that in a very real sense, our flag is the physical fabric of our society, knitting together disparate peoples from distant lands, uniting us in a common bond, not just of individual liberty but also of responsibility to one another. As such, the flag is more precious to us, perhaps, than we may even know. 
   The flag flies over government buildings throughout the country. It flies over our embassies abroad, a silent but strong reminder that when in those buildings, one is on American soil and afforded all the protections and liberties enjoyed back home. 
   Constitutional scholars as diverse as Chief Justices William Rehnquist and Earl Warren and Associate Justices Stevens and Hugo Black have vouched for the unique status of the national flag. In 1974, Byron White said:  
   It is well within the powers of Congress to adopt and prescribe a national flag and to protect the unity of that flag..... [T]he flag is an important symbol of nationhood and unity, created by the Nation and endowed with certain attributes.'' [Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. at 585-87 (1974)]  
   Justice White continued, ``[T]here would seem to be little question about the power of Congress to forbid the mutilation of the Lincoln Memorial or to prevent overlaying it with words or other objects. The flag is itself a monument, subject to similar protection.'' 
   I could not agree more with the opinion of Justice White: ``The flag is itself a monument, subject to similar protection.'' Since that time, unfortunately, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court has now ruled twice that this great symbol of our national unity is not protected under the Constitution. So that is why we are here today, to begin the process of protecting the flag, which is a symbol of all the protections we are afforded as Americans and all the liberties we enjoy. 
   The flag flying over our Capitol Building today, the flag flying over my home in San Francisco, each of these flags, separated by distance but not in symbolic value, is its own monument to everything America represents. It should be protected as such. 
   Our history books are replete with stories of American soldiers who were charged with the responsibility of leading their units into battle by carrying our Nation's flag. To them, it was more than a task, it was an honor worth dying for, and many did. When one soldier would fall, another would take his place, raise the flag, and press forward. They would not fail. Their mission was too important, the honor too great, flag and country too respected to give anything short of the last full measure of their devotion, their lives, to succeed. 
   The American flag is a revered object as well as a national symbol. Indeed, it is our monument in cloth. I believe it should be viewed as such, and not simply as something that serves as one of many vehicles for free speech. 
   Everything about the flag--its tangible form, its very fabric--has significance. The shape, the colors, the dimensions, and the arrangement of the pattern help make the flag what it is. The colors were chosen at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. 
   We all know them well: Red for heartiness and courage; white for purity and innocence; blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. 
   Moreover, our flag is recognized as unique not only in the hearts and minds of Americans but in our laws and customs as well. No other emblem or symbol in our Nation carries with it such a specific code of conduct and protocol in its display and handling. 
   For example, Federal law specifically prescribes that the flag should never be displayed with its union down, except as a signal of dire distress or in instances of extreme danger to life or property. When a flag is flown upside down, it is in fact a signal of distress.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on March 17, 2000, the Irish and the Irish-at-heart around the world celebrated Saint Patrick's Day, a day to remember the spirit of comradery, friendship, and peace the patron saint of Ireland brought to the Emerald Isle. I rise today to pay tribute to the Irish people and the forty million Irish Americans in this country--who are also celebrating Irish-American Heritage Month--and offer my thoughts on an issue close to their hearts and mine: peace in Northern Ireland. 
   The signing of the Good Friday Peace Accords on April 10, 1998 was an historic achievement in the quest for peace. After 32 years of conflict and bloodshed, the leaders of the principal Unionist and Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a new governing structure for the province, one in which Catholics and Protestants would, for the first time, share power in a new assembly and executive. 
   On May 22, 1998, the people of Ireland, in the North and in the South, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Accords. Their message was clear: it was time for a new era of peace based on reconciliation, compassion, and respect. 
   Thanks in no small part to the tireless work of our former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, the power sharing executive finally came into existence on December 1, 1999 and the formal devolution of power from London to the people of Northern Ireland took place. It appeared that the Irish would finally be able to celebrate the true spirit of Saint Patrick's Day. 
   The quest for peace, however, took a step backwards when--on February 11, 2000--the British government suspended the power sharing institutions and resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland from London. The Good Friday Peace Accords is now hanging by a thread. 
   As I stated earlier, the people of Ireland, Protestants and Catholics, in the North and in the South, have made their feelings clear. They support the Good Friday Peace Accords. They support the power sharing institutions. They support peace and cooperation. They believe that the people of Northern Ireland should have the ability to govern their own affairs. 
   Representatives of all parties in Northern Ireland met last week here in Washington with British and Irish leaders in an effort to break this impasse and return home rule to Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that their efforts will prove to be successful. 
   I strongly support the Accords. They represent the best hope for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. I urge all parties to stick to the agreement and make it work. They have a responsibility to keep their word to the Irish people and stop Northern Ireland from slipping back to the ways of the ``Hard Men'': intimidation, violence, and death. 
   On this day, let us reflect on the turmoil the Irish have endured for so many years and commend them for their tremendous hope, persistence, and hard work. Let us remember the true spirit of Saint Patrick's Day and renew our support for the Irish people in the North and the South who desperately want, and deserve, a future of peace and prosperity.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000, a bill that would freeze Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals at their 2000 level for Fiscal Year 2001 and 2002. I hope the Senate can act promptly on this bill. 
   The number of people in our nation who have no medical insurance has hit some 44 million. This is tragic. More than 100,000 people join the ranks of the uninsured monthly. We cannot continue to reduce payments to hospitals that provide care for the uninsured. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of poor people who show up at emergency rooms with no insurance or on the backs of the hospitals that tend to them. 
   California bears a disproportionate burden of uncompensated care. Twenty-four percent of our population is uninsured. Nationwide, the rate is 17 percent. Currently, over 7 million Californians are uninsured. During the past few months, I have met with many California health care leaders. They fear that the Medicaid cuts contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have undermined the financial stability of California's health care system, which many believe to be on the verge of collapse. 
   As a result of Medicaid reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, California's Medicaid Disproportionate  Share Hospital program could lose more than $280 million by 2002. Federal Medicaid DSH payments to California have declined by more than $116 million in the past two years and are slated to be cut by an additional $164 million--17 percent--over the next two years. 
   Without this bill, for example, by Fiscal Year 2002 Los Angeles County- University of Southern California Medical Center will lose $13.5 million. San Francisco General will lose $5.2 million. Fresno Community Hospital will lose $10.5 million. Over 132 California hospitals, representing rural and urban communities, depend on Medicaid DSH payments. Under this bill, millions of dollars will be restored to California public hospitals. 
   Public hospitals carry a disproportionate share of caring for the poor and uninsured. Forty percent of all California uninsured hospital patients were treated at public hospitals in 1998, up from 32 percent in 1993. The uninsured as a share of all discharges from public hospitals grew from 22 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in 1998. While overall public hospital discharges declined from 1993 to 1999 by 15 percent, discharges for uninsured patients increased by 11 percent. Large numbers of uninsured add huge uncompensated costs to our public hospitals. 
   The uninsured often choose public hospitals and frequently wait until their illnesses or injuries require emergency treatment. This makes their care even more costly. California's emergency rooms are strained to the breaking point. Last week at a California State Senate hearing, Dr. Dan Abbott, an emergency room physician at St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton, California said: ``We feel that emergency care in California is overwhelmed, it's underfunded and at times, frankly, it is out-and-out dangerous.'' Statewide, 19 emergency rooms have closed since 1997 despite an increase in the number of uninsured requiring care. The burden to provide care is put on those hospitals who have managed to remain open, and many of those hospitals are currently facing financial problems of their own. 
   California's health care system, in the words of a November 15th Wall Street Journal article, is a ``chaotic and discombobulated environment.'' It is stretched to the limit: 
   Thirty-seven California hospitals have closed since 1996, and up to 15 percent more may close by 2005. 
   Earlier this month, Scripps Memorial Hospital East County closed its doors due in part to reimbursement problems. 
   Eighty-six California hospitals operated in the red in 1999. 
   Academic medical centers, which incur added costs unique to their mission, are facing margins reduced to zero and below. 
   Sixty-two percent of California hospitals are now losing money. Due to the large number of Medicare and Medicaid patients, sixty-nine percent of California's rural hospitals lost money in 1998, according to the California Healthcare Association. 
   Hospitals have laid off staff, limited hours of operation, and discontinued services. 
   California physician groups are failing at the rate of one a week, with 115 bankruptcies or closures since 1996. 
   In short, restoring Medicaid cuts is crucial to stabilizing California's health delivery system. 
   Circumstances have changed since 1997 when we passed the Balanced Budget Act. We have eliminated the federal deficit. Because we have a robust economy, lower inflation, higher GDP growth and lower unemployment, we also have lowered Medicaid spending growth more than anticipated. This climate provides us an opportunity to revisit the reductions contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and to strengthen the stability of health care services, a system that in my State is on the verge of unraveling. 
   We need to pass this bill. Without it, we could have a more severe health care crisis on our hands, especially in California. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill today to establish the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historic Park. This park will be constructed on the former site of Richmond Kaiser Shipyard #2 which produced WWII ships at the site of the present-day Marina Park in Richmond California. 
   The Home Front industrial buildup in Richmond, California and across America to strengthen U.S. military capability and eventually win World War II started in early 1941 with the Lend Lease Program. Employment at the Richmond Shipyards peaked at 90,000 and forced an unprecedented integration of workers into the nation's work force. 
   ``Rosie the Riveter'' was a term coined to help recruit female civilian workers and came to symbolize a workforce mobilized to fill the gap created by working men who left their jobs for active military duty. Nationwide, six million women entered the WWII Home Front workforce, which also provided unprecedented opportunities for minorities. 
   I am proud to offer this legislation to commemorate these invaluable contributions to the U.S. victory in World War II, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which I hope might move the Senate closer to the passage of meaningful campaign finance reform. I have voted for versions of the McCain-Feingold reform legislation at least six times in the past 4 years. I continue to support passage of that bill, and I will vote for it in the future. 
   I am concerned, however, that this legislation might not come up for a vote again in this Congress. Earlier this morning, the Rules Committee, of which I am a member and which Senator MCCONNELL chairs, began a series of hearings on the constitutionality of campaign finance reform. At that time, I indicated that what I wished to do was submit a bill which might have an opportunity to break the gridlock surrounding campaign finance reform, and develop some kind of consensus. 
   So if I may, on behalf of Senator TORRICELLI and myself, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its submission to committee.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill has three simple provisions. First of all, it bans soft money. Second, it raises hard money contributions to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000. Third, it requires the disclosure of those parties who pay for the so-called issue ads, who contribute to the soft money which at present is undisclosed. So it would require disclosure of any expenditure of $10,000 or more of an independent campaign within 48 hours, and it would require disclosure of any individual who contributes more than $3,000 to an independent campaign. That is all this bill would do. 
   I think, any way you look at it, looking at campaign spending reform, one has to look at the unregulated nature of soft money and the appearance--and I use the word ``appearance''--of corruption that it brings to campaigns. 
   Clearly, when in the same session of Congress you have tobacco legislation in front of this body and you have a tobacco company that contributes $1 million in soft money at the same time, you can draw a conclusion--perhaps falsely, but nonetheless draw it--that that money is contributed in large amounts with hopes of gaining votes in support of the company. 
   I think the numbers, the size of soft money contributions, really, are what ought to concern this body. The Republican Party raised $131 million in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. That is a 150-percent increase over the last midterm election, in 1994. So from 1994 to 1998, 4 years, there has been a 150-percent increase in the amount of soft money. The Democratic Party raised $91.5 million during this same period. That is an 86-percent increase over 4 years. 
   At this rate, you can see the amount of soft money is going to, by far, dominate anything individual candidates can raise or do during an election. 
   A recent analysis found that national political party committees together raised $107 million just during 1999 alone. That is 81 percent more than the $59 million they raised during the last comparable Presidential election period in 1995. Congressional campaign committees of the national parties raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 as they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19 million. 
   We clearly have a trendline going. I think the decision one has to make is, is this trendline going to be healthy for the American political process? Those who think it is will be for soft money. But I think most of us believe, truly, that it is not.  
   The problem comes because the contribution limit is so low for an individual candidate. My bill says eliminate soft money, and the tradeoff is to increase the hard money contribution for every individual candidate from $1,000 to $3,000. 
   We heard that the 1971 contribution limit of $1,000 today in real dollars is worth about $328. The limit was set 29 years ago and clearly needs to be raised because the costs of campaign materials, consultant services, television, radio, all of the necessary tools of any viable campaign have clearly increased. So what was worth $1,000 in 1971 is now worth $328. This would clearly be equalized to have a meaningful parity with 1971 if the sum were raised to $3,000. 
   What my bill will do is move campaign contributions from under the table to above the table. Instead of hundreds of thousands of unregulated dollars flowing into the coffers of national political parties, this legislation will increase the amount an individual might contribute to a candidate under the existing rules of the Federal Election Campaign Act. So what we would be doing is exchanging soft money for increased limits, soft money being undisclosed and unregulated and hard money being both disclosed and regulated. 
   It is not the small contributions to an individual's campaign, I think, that Americans view as corrupting. 
   It is the large checks of $100,000, $250,000, and $1 million, or more, to parties that creates this appearance. My bill would eliminate this soft money while still allowing candidates to compete without the influence of the national parties and these huge amounts of money. 
   The final component of the bill is the greater regulation of so-called issues advocacy. A current campaign law loophole allows unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence elections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure restrictions. 
   Issue advocacy does not use the so-called ``magic words'', such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``defeat'' or ``reelect'' that the Supreme Court has identified as express advocacy and, therefore, are not subject to FEC regulation. 
   This bill would define ``electioneering communications'' as an advertisement broadcast from television or radio that refers to a candidate for Federal office and is made 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary. 
   Any individual or organization that spends more than $10,000 on such an ad must disclose the expenditure to the FEC within 48 hours. In addition, all contributions greater than $3,000 to groups that engage in electioneering communications must be disclosed to the FEC within 48 hours. 
   This takes that anonymous area of independent campaigns and clarifies express advocacy and regulates and discloses all of the money. 
   The Annenberg Public Policy Center has studied the amount that independent groups have spent on issue advocacy in each of the last two election cycles: 1995-96 and 1997-98. The study estimates that the amount spent on issue ads more than doubled, to some $340 million. 
   The Center's report indicates that as election day gets closer, issue ads become more candidate-oriented and more negative. This kind of unregulated attack advertisements are poisoning the process and driving voters, I believe, away from the polls. 
   With the passing of every election, it becomes increasingly clear that our campaign system desperately needs reform. I think this reform measure has a very real chance of being passed. 
   Once again, let me say, it bans soft money; it increases hard money contribution limits to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000; it ties them to inflation after 2001; it says simply that anyone engaging in independent campaigns must, in effect, disclose, within 48 hours, contributions greater than $3,000 or expenditures of more than $10,000. 
   I strongly believe that congressional action on meaningful campaign finance reform is a very necessary first step in restoring the public's confidence in our government. I hope that my colleagues will see this as an attempt to reach across the partisan gap, and join me in supporting this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act of 2000, which I have cosponsored. 
   The earnings limit is the amount of money a Social Security recipient can earn without having a portion of his or her benefits deferred. Currently, that limit is $17,000 per year for retirees between the ages of 65 and 69. For every $3 in earnings above that limit, these seniors have $1 in benefits deferred. 
   I believe that this is grossly unfair. Last year, my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, and I proposed lifting the Social Security earnings test on retirees between the ages of 65 and 69. We did not propose outright elimination because we did not think, at that time, that the surplus would be large enough to sustain elimination. Now, a year later--and thanks to our continued economic boom--I believe it is possible to eliminate the earnings test outright, and still adhere to a responsible and fiscally sound budget. 
   Over 1 million seniors nationwide face this earnings test. My own state, California, has more seniors affected by the earnings test than any other state: 161,000, according to the Bureau of the Census. 
   For these 161,000 Californians--and hundreds of thousands of others all across this country--this legislation represents an important step in removing the unfair burden that the earnings test places on them simply because they wish to continue working. As President Clinton said in his February 29 letter to House leaders:  
   We should reward every American who wants to and can stay active and productive.  
   For example, a letter I received from the American Health 
    Care Association holds:  
   The nursing facilities we represent make a concerted effort to employ senior citizens to care for their peers. They're reliable and honest workers, who have compassion for those in their care. We have had difficulty hiring or retaining these employees because of the threat of losing Social Security benefits after their annual earnings have passed $17,000.  
   Elimination of the earnings test is important not just to those retirees who want to continue to work, but to those who need to continue to work and who are currently faced with an Hobson's choice: Continue to work and have Social Security benefits reduced, or stop working and rely only on Social Security for retirement security. For all too many of these retirees--over half of those helped by this legislation have incomes under $45,000 per year, including Social Security--both of these choices leave them financially squeezed. For women, who are twice as likely as men to retire in poverty, this is an especially important issue. 
   This legislation offers a third choice: Continue to work and continue to receive those Social Security benefits. 
   Moreover, I believe that elimination of the Social Security earnings test is warranted because the original logic of the earnings test no longer holds. Congress imposed the earnings test to provide a ``disincentive'' to older workers to continue to work, so as to make room for younger workers during the Great Depression. In our new, twenty-first century economy, unemployment is at historic lows and firms are nearly desperate for workers. 
   I do not believe that passage of this legislation will address many long-term problems regarding the solvency of the Social Security system. We have much work remaining on that score. But for the hundreds of thousands of seniors who either need or want to continue to work past age 65, this legislation represents an important step in creating a fairer and more secure retirement. I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act of 2000.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my long-time friend and Chief of Staff, Michael S. McGill. I have known Mike for nearly two decades and have had the privilege of working with him when I was Mayor of San Francisco and during my tenure in the U.S. Senate. I have a great respect and appreciation for Mike, who has devoted his life to public service and served the state of California with excellence and honor. 
   Mike earned a B.S. in business administration at the University of Kansas, and is still an avid Jayhawks fan. He earned his Master's in political science at the University of Texas, which prepared him for a long and distinguished career in public service. In 1967, Mike joined the U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer and was assigned to the Model Cities Program in Fort Worth, Texas. There he committed his time and energy to issues affecting urban communities. 
   After moving to San Francisco in 1972, Mike developed a passion for water policy, the issue area in which he has provided me with indispensable knowledge and advice. He served for three years as executive director of the Bay Area Economic Forum, and for seven years as executive director of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR). As head of SPUR, he faced competing agricultural, urban, and environmental interests, but he was able to mediate these differences to the benefit of California. 
   Since 1993, Mike has served as my Chief of Staff. He has done an outstanding job. He has managed my five Senate offices, which serve more than 32 million constituents. This in itself is a tremendous undertaking, and I am proud to say that Mike has succeeded in ensuring that the people of California are served with care, compassion, and efficiency. 
   As the cornerstone of my staff for the past seven years, Mike's dedication and integrity have earned him the respect of everyone he has worked with and advised. His door is always open, because no issue is too big or too small for Mike's attention and guidance. 
   In particular, Mike's advice in approaching and solving the water issues that impact California has been invaluable. In my state, water is our lifeblood, and this has made it a contentious issue. I have been thankful to have Mike's experience and insight on an issue that is by no means an easy one. 
   In my office, we can count on Mike and his wealth of knowledge that ranges from politics to baseball to American history. He and his wife Mary enjoy traveling throughout the country, visiting presidential homes and Civil War battlefields. He is also a dedicated father to two wonderful daughters, Deidre and Erin, who are proud of his accomplishments. 
   Mike will be leaving my office to return to one of his passions, urban planning, this time at the General Services Administration. There he will work in the Public Buildings Service, managing and preserving historic buildings and landmarks. I have no doubt that Mike will be an asset to the GSA, just as he has been to my office. 
   It is with sadness, but also great pride, that we bid farewell to Mike McGill. He has been a true friend and a valued advisor throughout the years. Mike is one of California's treasures, and he will be sorely missed.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill which provides a comprehensive watershed plan to protect against flooding in the Colusa Basin. Last year such flooding caused approximately $4.9 million in damage. In 1995 a major flood caused an estimated $100 million in damages to public and private property and crops. 
   This bill would provide the necessary authorization for the Secretary of Interior to participate in the Colusa Basin project on a cost-shared basis. The Colusa Basin project would build the necessary infrastructure (small impoundments) to catch flood water, control the rate of release, restore wetlands and vegetation and ultimately protect the area against flooding. This authorization is needed for the project to continue. 
   I introduced an identical bill in the 105th Congress which passed both Houses of Congress but fell victim to the politics surrounding the omnibus budget bill. This bill once again enjoys bipartisan support. 
   I urge Congress to consider this bill before the end of the 106th Congress.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes as a 7-year member of the Judiciary Committee, to set the record straight on some of the comments that have been made with respect to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have heard that circuit called a rogue circuit, out of control, out of sync with the rest of the Nation. All of this is based on statistics for 1 year, 1996-1997, when the Supreme Court reversed that circuit 27 out of 28 times. 
   The question is, Even in that year, did that place it as the most reversed circuit? The answer is no because even in that year they fell in the middle of the pack. When the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95 percent, it was still less than five other circuits: The Fifth, the Second, the Seventh, D.C., and Federal Circuits all had a 100-percent reversal rate. 
   You can seek out the Ninth Circuit because it has 9,000 cases on appeal as opposed to a circuit with 1,000 or 1,500 cases. But the record is the record, even in that year, that much maligned year that is the basis of all of these comments. 
   Let's look at some of the other years. In the 1998-1999 Supreme Court session, the Supreme Court reviewed 18 cases of the Ninth Circuit; 4 were affirmed, 11 were reversed, and 3 had mixed rulings. So only 11 out of 18 cases were outrightly reversed. That is a 61-percent reversal rate. 
   Is that the worst? No. This is less than the reversal rates for the Third Circuit, 67 percent; the Fifth Circuit, which was reversed 80 percent of the time; and the Seventh Circuit, 80 percent of the time; the Eleventh Circuit, 88 percent; and the Federal Circuit, 75 percent. 
   In terms of reversals, the Ninth Circuit is not at the bottom of the pack, it is in the middle of the pack. 
   I think I know why there were newspaper articles. The Ninth Circuit has been made a target by many conservatives who either want to see it split or, in some way, destroyed. That has become very clear to me as a member of the Judiciary Committee as I have watched proposal after proposal surface. 
   Am I always pleased with the Ninth Circuit? Absolutely not. Do I like all the decisions? Of course not. But the point is, the Ninth Circuit is well within the parameters, and in virtually every year that one can look at reversals, one will see the Ninth Circuit is approximately in the middle of the pack. 
   The argument is also made that Clinton appointees are making decisions that are being reversed. I have looked at the Ninth Circuit judges who were reversed over the last 3 years by the Supreme Court. Once again I correct the record. On only eight occasions in the last three full Supreme Court terms have Clinton appointees on the Ninth Circuit joined in decisions later reversed by the Supreme Court. At the end of the 1998-1999 term, Clinton appointees were 20 percent of the judges on the Ninth Circuit. 
   If one wants to compare, compare Clinton appointees with Reagan appointees. Reagan appointees on the Ninth Circuit have been overturned in 30 instances from the 1996-1997 Supreme Court term through the 1998-1999 term. Currently, there are the same number of Reagan appointees on the Ninth Circuit as Clinton appointees. 
   I have wondered, as I have watched this debate emerge for the last 7 years, why there is this persistent effort to demean, to break up, in some way to destroy this court. I have a hard time fathoming why. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will quickly read the paragraph to which the ranking member alluded. I believe it is worthwhile for everybody to hear this. Judge Hug said:  
   I might make one other observation--I have noted that the reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-97, has assumed some importance in the hearings.  
   These are the hearings on confirmation.  
   Even in that year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95 percent, it was less than five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh and Federal Circuits--all with a 100 percent reversal rate. In the 1997-98 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76 percent, equivalent to that of the First Circuit's 75 percent and less than the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits' 100 percent reversal rate. In the 1998-99 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78 percent, equivalent to the Second and Federal Circuits' 75 percent and less than the Fifth Circuit's 80 percent, the Seventh Circuit's 80 percent, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88 percent reversal rates.  
   Once again, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit attests that the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate is substantially in the middle of the pack of all the circuits. I hope the record stands corrected. 
   I want to speak about the two judges before us and indicate my strong support for the appointment of both Judge Paez and Mrs. Berzon. 
   Judge Paez has been before this body for 4 years. He has had two hearings and has been reported out of committee twice. Marsha Berzon has been before this body for 2 years, and she has had two hearings and been reported out of committee once. 
   I have sat as ranking member on one of her hearings. It was equal in the quality and numbers of questions to any Supreme Court hearing on which I have sat, and I have sat on two of them. She was asked detailed questions on the law, questions about her performance, questions about her background, and, I say to this body, she measured up every step of the way. She is a brilliant appellate lawyer, and she has represented both business clients as well as trade union clients. 
   Judge Paez has 19 years of experience as a judge and 6 years as a Federal court judge. I will speak about his record on criminal appeals. 
   According to the Westlaw database, 32 of his criminal judgments have been appealed; 28 of these were affirmed. The Circuit Court dismissed two appeals for lack of jurisdiction, remanded one for further proceedings, and one judgment was affirmed in part or reversed in part. That is an 87-percent affirmance rate. That is pretty good. 
   Judge Paez has not been reversed on a criminal sentence. Of his 28 criminal affirmances, they include 6 cases where a sentence he imposed was upheld by the appellate court; 4 involved his decision to enhance the defendant's defense level within the guidelines, actually giving the offender a tougher sentence, and 2 involved Judge Paez's refusal to grant a downward departure. 
   Judge Paez was also named Federal criminal judge of the year by the Century City Bar Association. 
   As I have looked at this case and listened to members in the Judiciary Committee, a lot of the objection seems to come down to one speech he made at the University of California Boalt Hall where he criticized a proposition on the ballot which was a very incendiary ballot measure in California. It was Proposition 209, and that may have been somewhat intemperate. 
   My point is, one comment does not outweigh 19 years of good judicial service, 6 of them on the Federal court. I believe strongly that both these nominees deserve confirmation today. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today is a very special day for millions of women around the world. Today is a day that celebrates the promise of a better future. Today is a day that offers the hope that injustices inflicted on too many women in too many societies will disappear from the earth forever. Today, March 8, 2000, is International Women's Day 
   I rise today to recognize this day's importance to the women of today and to the generations of women to come. I rise to cry shame for our failures in fulfilling this day's promise. And, I rise to direct our attention to three critical  issues: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, international family planning, and the international trafficking of women and girls. These are issues in which the United States, and especially this body, are honor-bound to spare no effort in leading the international community to improve the status of women around the world. 
   In 1948, the United Nations dramatically focused world attention on the international human rights agenda when it adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This historic event aimed at increasing public awareness of the need to better the human condition in many places throughout the globe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented a milestone in human history. Regrettably, it glossed over the needs of over half the world's population--women. 
   Women's rights remained unrecognized as a legitimate concern until the Convention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, was drafted to redress this oversight. CEDAW organized all existing international standards regarding discrimination on the basis of gender, and established rights for women in areas not previously subject to international standards. The United States actively participated in drafting of the Convention; President Carter signed it on July 17, 1980. 
   Then the U.S. did nothing. For fourteen years, the United States scrutinized CEDAW with an intense scrutiny normally reserved for judging the merits of a technically demanding international agreement, not a document seeking to establish the fundamental human rights of over half the world's population. CEDAW was not sent to the Senate until September, 1994. 
   In 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee recommended by bipartisan vote that CEDAW be approved with qualifications, but acted too late in the session for the Convention to be considered by the full Senate. 
   Now, almost six years later, the Convention continues to languish in the Senate, locked up in the Committee on Foreign Relations. A bi-partisan group of women Senators, among whom I am proud to be counted, has sponsored Senate Resolution 237 which expresses the sense of the Senate that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should hold hearings on CEDAW and that the full Senate should act on CEDAW by March 8, 2000. 
   Today is March 8, 2000. The date has come, and will go, and this body has yet to take substantive action on CEDAW, even though this Convention contains no provisions in conflict with American law. 
   The Convention has been ratified by 161 countries. Of the world's democracies, only the United States has yet to ratify this fundamental document. Indeed, even countries we regularly censure for human rights abuses--China, the People's Republic of Laos, Iraq--have either signed or agreed in principle. In our failure to ratify CEDAW, we now keep company with a select few--Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Afghanistan among them. Remember, as the old saying goes, we are judged by the 
   company we keep. Is this how we want to be known when it comes to defending the human rights of those unable to defend themselves? 
   In failing to sign on to this Convention, we risk losing our moral right to lead on human rights. By ratifying CEDAW, we will demonstrate our commitment to promoting equality and to protecting women's rights throughout the world. By ratifying CEDAW, we will send a strong message to the international community that the U.S. understands the challenges faced by discrimination against women, and we will not abide by it. By ratifying CEDAW, we reestablish our credentials as a leader on human rights and women's rights. 
   Today, as we commemorate International Women's Day, I call on my colleagues in the Senate to move forward and ratify CEDAW. 
   The second issue I would like to touch on today is one which has seen much congressional attention in recent years: U.S. support for international family planning and reproductive health. 
   The world now has more than 6 billion people. The United Nations estimates this figure could be 12 billion by the year 2050. Almost all of this growth will occur in the places least able to bear up under the pressures of massive population increases. The brunt will be in developing countries lacking the resources needed to provide basic health or education services. If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of their families, they must have access to the educational and medical resources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their health. 
   International family planning programs reduce poverty, improve health and raise living standards around the world; they enhance the ability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children. 
   Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the United States has established a long and distinguished record of world leadership on international family planning and reproductive health issues. 
   Unfortunately, in recent years these programs have come under increasing partisan attack, despite the fact that no U.S. international family planning funds are spent on international abortion. 
   The Fiscal Year 2000 omnibus appropriations bill contained ``Mexico City'' restrictions that prohibit U.S. grants to private foreign non-governmental organizations that perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries. House leaders insisted on these provisions in exchange for acceptance of arrear payments to the United Nations. 
   I was disappointed that the bill included this language. I 
   voted in favor of the legislation because I thought it critical that we pay our back dues to the United Nations, and because it contained a provision granting Presidential authority--which President Clinton later exercised--to waive the restrictions through the end of Fiscal Year 2000. I am pleased the President took this action and that he announced that he would oppose any attempt to renew the ``Mexico City'' restrictions when they expire on September 30, 2000. 
   International family planning programs have experienced significant cuts in funding in recent years. President Clinton's foreign aid budget for Fiscal Year 2001 calls for $542 million for international family planning programs, restoring funding to Fiscal Year 1995 levels. 
   Today, as we mark International Women's Day, I urge my colleagues to recommit themselves to U.S. leadership in international family planning and support the President's request. 
   Lastly, I would like to focus attention on a vicious, and growing problem for women the world over--forced or coerced trafficking of girls and women for the purpose of sexual exploitation. 
   This is a rapidly growing, highly lucrative international business. The United Nations estimates that every year millions of women fall victims to this international trafficking in human life. Criminal organizations make an estimated $7 billion a year on the trafficking and prostitution of approximately 4 million women and girls. They do some by preying on the fears and economic insecurity created by the grinding poverty, rising unemployment and disintegrating social networks common to many poorer societies, today. 
   The traffickers target women from Eastern Europe and East Asia, women who agree to work as waitresses, models or dancers in the industrialized world to escape the grip of poverty in their native lands. But, once they arrive, their passports are seized, they are beaten, held captive and forced into prostitution. Traffickers and pimps hold these women in bondage, forcing them to work uncompensated as repayment for exaggerated room, board, and travel expenses. 
   These victims have little or no legal protection; they travel on falsified documents or enter by means of inappropriate visas provided by traffickers. When and if discovered by the police, these women are usually treated as illegal aliens and deported. Even worse, laws against traffickers who engage in forced prostitution, rape, kidnaping, and assault and battery are rarely enforced. The women will not testify against traffickers out of fear of retribution, the threat of deportation, and humiliation for their actions.  
   We, as a nation, cannot sit idly and allow this vicious exploitation of women to continue unchecked. We must effectively enforce current laws and implement new laws to protect victims and prosecute traffickers. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of Senator WELLSTONE's International Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection of 1999 which provides more information on trafficking and toughens law dealing with the illegal trade of women. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation. 
   The issues I have laid before you today are not just women's issues, they are humanity's issues. As First Lady Hillary Clinton has said, `Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights.' They merit attention throughout the year, not just on one day. 
   We must debate and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and our resources to international family planning programs. And we must enact tough anti-trafficking legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator BOXER from California, for her leadership and for this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I am very happy to support fully. 
   Today, I received a packet of letters. They are from fourth and fifth grade children. I want to read just a few parts of these letters:   
   My name is Nikki. *.*.* I am 11 years old. *.*.* No one in my household has a gun, not one of them. *.*.* One day, I saw a neighbor of mine get shot on her way to the candy house. She got shot 4 times. She got shot 3 times in her side and once in her leg. Now she's paralyzed for life. That really hurt me and a lot of other people. She was only 12 years old and she was a nice girl.  
   Here is another one:  
   I am Talia and I am 11 years of age. And when I'm coming home from school, I see little 13 year old teenagers playing with guns like it's a thing to do. I walk across the street to go get some ketchup for my cousin's house and I see people dragged into the *.*.* park. 
   *.*.* We're little kids. We need to live in a safer community and this is not safe. So write to all the gun stores and let them know what kids think about guns.  
   Here is another one:  
   My opinion is no people should have guns, because one day in the summer that passed this girl was in her house. Then a man dragged her out of her house up the stairs. After he punched her and shot her in the leg, she had a hole in her leg. The police and ambulance had to come and wrapped her leg up. 
   *.*.* I want the Senator to make guns no more. No more guns in this world.  
   Here is another one:  
   I am a fifth grader. And mainly every year I hear at least 20 gunshots. I am scared at night because I think it's going to be a drive-by. I even sometimes can't go outside to recess because gunshots are heard.  
   Here is another one:  
   My name is Justin. I am in the fifth grade. 
   *.*.* At night in my neighborhood there are gunshots and sometimes it keeps me awake. When I walk home from school, there is gangs in one spot and another gang in another spot. 
   Could you please help and make guns illegal? All the kids in my class want you to help. If you help, then I thank you very much.  
   Here is another one:  
   What I know about guns and gun control is to not let guns get into the wrong hands. 
   *.*.* What I want is to not let guns get in the wrong hands. To let it not go to people that just came out of prison to get payback. That is what I want and I hope you can do something about this and I want support of gun control laws.  
   Here is another one:  
   *.*.* When I was 3 years old, I saw a black and silver gun. When I saw it, I ran in my house and saw the person get shot by it. I was so scared I cried my eyes out. So please support us.  
   Another one:  
   *.*.* I think you should stop people from shooting other people. People should have to get a license and people should have to have a background check for getting guns. Please support gun control laws.  
   Another one:  
   *.*.* My experiences are hearing guns, like one day when it was my Aunt's birthday, we were all in the house looking out the window. We had seen this man on top of the hill. He had a gun. Then he just started to point it and then he started to shoot. We all had to drop to the floor. It was scary. 
   What I want is only the police to have guns because they're the only ones who's using them right. I want you to vote to have only police have guns, it's just right. And if police are not using them right, please take them away. I want gun control over guns.  
   Another one:  
   *.*.* I am 10 years old. And I have seen people shoot another person. One night I had heard gunshots. I looked out the window and saw a man running, and another man lying on the street. He was shot about fifty times. My uncle was shot on Christmas night on his way home from work.  
   Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is the real world. This is what is happening out there. How can we stand by and not do anything? 
   I speak as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have been on this committee for as long as I have been in the Senate. I am a supporter of the juvenile justice bill. That day when we debated four commonsense, targeted gun measures--all of them, I thought, no-brainers--I was so proud to be a Member of this body. I remember that Senator JOHN ASHCROFT moved an amendment to say that youngsters, children, could not buy assault weapons. That was a no-brainer. It went through this body. The second amendment was on trigger locks. My colleague from California and others in this body have championed that--that is, that guns should have trigger locks. That way, a 6-year-old can't use the gun. 
   A 5-year-old from Memphis, TN, took a gun to school to kill his kindergarten teacher because the teacher gave him a ``time-out'' the day before. A simple $15 gun lock, or trigger lock, would have stopped that from happening. That was the second measure. Plugging the gun show loophole so that children from a school can't go to a gun show and buy a gun, no questions asked, was the third one. 
   The fourth one was mine, to prohibit the importation of these big clips that are coming in from all over the world by the tens of millions. Some of them are as big as 250 rounds. 
   Those are four simple, commonsense, targeted gun regulations. And what has happened? Nothing. The children from Columbine came here and they begged for help, as did the children in these letters, and what happens? Nothing. I talk to Members of the Senate and I ask, ``Why is nothing happening?'' They tell me that the Gun Owners of America are really resolved that they don't want any legislation. 
   We say the time has come to recognize that the majority of our people have certain basic rights--that our children have the right to go to school without fear, that our children have the right to sleep without hearing gunshots, that you have the right to walk down the street and not fear getting killed by a drive-by shooter. 
   In Los Angeles, in the last 16 years, over 7,000 people have been killed by drive-by shooters. That is what the plethora, the abundance, the avalanche of guns in this country is doing to the real world outside of this beltway. 
   I say to those who yield to this special, unrelenting interest that says, ``You either vote our way or we will defeat you at the polls,'' that the American people have had enough, and the time has come to pass some targeted, commonsense regulations. 
   The resolution of my colleague from California is a beginning. It at least puts us on record. Hopefully, if it should pass, it will send a message to the Judiciary Conference Committee of both these noble Houses. That message is: Pass the juvenile justice bill, and pass these four targeted measures. 
   I defy any Member of this House or the other House to tell me that the second amendment of the Constitution of the United States prohibits the regulation of firearms. 
   Let me add one thing. Today in gun shops all around this great country they are selling .50 caliber weapons, a military weapon, a weapon capable of sending a bullet 4 miles, a weapon capable of producing a shot that can go through a concrete wall. Tell me that we need weapons such as this in a civilized society. Tell me that the second amendment of the Constitution prevents us from regulating firearms. Tell me that these children begging to be safe and to not hear gunshots at night, to not get shot in the car, and not to stand in a living room and have a bullet come through their wall are wrong. 
   I thank the Senator from California for her good work. I add my support. 
   I yield the floor.*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: -Date: -Subformat:

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators SESSIONS, BYRD, LIEBERMAN, and I are offering an amendment to address one of the most significant detriments to good education in our public schools. That is the practice of passing children on to the next grade regardless of whether they make passing grades. It is called social promotion. While this practice may be politically correct, it has, I believe, become the single most important factor leading to the decline in quality of public education in America. 
   Under our amendment, in order to receive Federal funds, States would be required to prohibit the practice of social promotion and adopt achievement standards in the core academic subjects. Decisions about how to implement a nonsocial promotions policy would be left to the States and localities. 
   Implicit in the amendment is that remedial education is necessary and can be provided through a number of different Federal, State, and local sources. 
   This amendment is carefully written so that implementation is left with State and local governments. For example, State and local officials would decide all specifics of promotion policy and the criteria for passing and holding back students, achievement standards, subjects that constitute the core curriculum, grades when students would be tested, grading methods, testing methods, and remedial education. 
   The amendment defines social promotion as a formal or informal practice of promoting a student from the grade for which the determination is made to promote or not to promote to the next grade when the student fails to achieve a minimum level of achievement and proficiency in the core curriculum for the grade for which the determination is made. 
   The amendment covers elementary through secondary grades--grades 1 through 12. It is carefully crafted so that reform changes could be made incrementally, grade by grade, or in any fashion the State or local school districts see fit. 
   Social promotion misleads our students, their parents, and the public. Even educators have concluded that it doesn't work. 
   Let me give you the conclusion of a study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers. I quote:  
   Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school failure and creates problems for everyone: For kids who are deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be successful, or get the message that achievement doesn't count; for teachers who must face students who know that teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the business community and colleges that must spend millions of dollars on remediation; and for society that must deal with the growing proportion of uneducated citizens unprepared to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the nation.  
   The American Federation of Teachers has said that social promotion is rampant and that only 22 States have standards in the four core disciplines of English, math, social studies, and science that are well grounded in content and that are clear and specific enough to be used. 
   They surveyed 85 of the Nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 States representing one-third of the Nation's public school enrollment. 
   None of the districts in the AFT national survey has an explicit policy of social promotion. But almost every district has an implicit practice. According to the U.S. Department of Education, a third of students across the United States perform 
   below the basic level of proficiency; 15 percent who graduate from high school cannot balance a checkbook or write a letter to a credit card company to explain an error on a bill. 
   Mike Wright, a San Diegan, told the San Diego Tribune he continued to get promoted from grade to grade and even graduated from high school even though he failed subjects. At the age of 29, he enrolled in a community college to learn to read. 
   Let me talk for a moment about social promotion in Los Angeles. 
   School officials decided they would end the practice. That is the good news. The bad news was that if it were done all at once, they found that one-half of the entire student population --350 students--would have to be held back. More than two-thirds of eighth graders would be flunked if social promotion were fully ended. 
   The problem was so massive that they have had to scale back their plans and implement the new policy more slowly. They have taken a multistep, phased-in plan, and this legislation is structured to give school officials the flexibility to do just that. 
   I would like to read a letter sent to me yesterday from the superintendent of that school district, a man who was superintendent of public instruction when I was mayor of San Francisco and whom I respect greatly. He points out:  
   One of the solutions is to institute an intensive program of standards-based promotion, eliminating the dastardly practice of social promotion that has advanced the student from one grade to the next without having learned what was required in his current grade. In its initial phase, we are targeting the second and eighth grade and focusing on reading, because that is the foundation of all learning. Our program is very practical in design, and is based on classroom space, materials, professional development, and the availability of staff. 
   It would be my proudest hope that we can and will provide the education for our children of poverty that they deserve. These are the disadvantaged, who in this district are predominantly children of color. I see the end of social promotion as a way to ensure that all children will have the basic skills to become contributing Members of their community.  
   The Governor of California, Gov. Gray Davis, has endorsed our amendment. In a February 29 letter to me he wrote:  
   I write to express my support for your amendment that provides for achievement standards, assessment of student performance in meeting those standards, and an end to the practice of social promotion. As you know, improving education in California is my first, second, and third priority. Last year, I sponsored the California Public Schools Accountability Act which established a comprehensive high stakes school accountability system, the various components of which will be phased in over the next several years. Your amendment will provide an added impetus to reinforce our State's commitment to ensuring the achievement of all students.  
   Mr. President, at least half of my State's 5.6 million students perform below their grade level. California ranks 36th out of 39 States in fourth grade reading proficiency, 32nd out of 36 States in eighth grade reading proficiency, 41st out of 43 States in fourth grade math performance. 
   Let me speak about Chicago, the major city of the Presiding Officer. On June 1, I took a group of top-level California educators and experts to Chicago and spent the day discussing what was being done. In Chicago, they have abolished social promotion. They have established content standards. They test student performance in meeting the standards. They have adopted a core curriculum, teacher lesson plans. They evaluate schools on a regular cycle. They intervene with failing schools. They have performance criteria for teachers and principals and they put in place extensive remedial and afterschool programs providing the very necessary help for struggling students. The Chicago school district is 90 percent minority and 90 percent poverty. 
   If it can be done in Chicago, it can be done everywhere else. The results are there: Reading, up 12 percent; math, up 14 percent. Scores are improving. 
   Chicago stands as an example, but it takes political will and courage to make these changes. Our legislation provides the incentive. 
   I yield 10 minutes to my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think Members can now see the Catch-22. Of course, retention without remedial education is not going to work, but there is not one who can say that our public education system is working with the policy of promoting youngsters even when they are failures, of never coming to grips with failure and then promoting them and graduating them when they cannot read or write, multiply, divide, add, recognize China on a map, or count change in their pocket. How do they get a job in the workplace of this new millennium? They do not. 
   That is why we have had employers come in to us and say: You have to raise the H-1B quota. We need more foreign nationals from other countries because we cannot hire public school graduates who can think, who can do what they need to do, and more and more employers have to provide remedial education which should be the job of the public school system. 
   I went to public school for all of my elementary school. There was a policy of no social promotion, and youngsters learned. There was remedial education. Districts are putting that back into play now. 
   We have different statistics. My staff yesterday talked with the superintendent of the Chicago school district, and these are the figures we were given: 
   No. 1, in 1996, 20.5 percent of students performed at or above national norms in 9th and 11th grade reading. In May of 1999, 32.5 percent of students performed at that level. That is a 12-percent increase in performance. 
   No. 2, he told us elementary reading scores are at their highest since 1990. In 1996, 26.5 percent of students were at or above national norms. In 1999, 36 percent were. That is up 10 percent. 
   No. 3, math scores are up, too. In 1996, 30 percent of children scored at or above national norms in elementary math. In May of 1999, they had risen to 44 percent. That is up 14 percent. 
   During this time, the very mayor who put this system into effect was up for reelection, and the people of Chicago reelected him. The day I was there, there was no question in my mind what parents thought about this program. They liked it. They wanted their children to learn, particularly parents of students of color. They know this is the only way their children are going to get the kind of education they need. 
   The President of the United States has called for ending social promotion. The Secretary of Education has prepared guidelines for educators on ending social promotion and guidelines for using Federal funds to adopt sound promotion policies. 
   In 1998, the California Legislature ended social promotion. Districts are now implementing it. For example, San Diego school officials will now require all students to earn a C overall average and a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades for high school graduation. 
   I have a hard time understanding how people can speak against having accountability and excellence as a goal in public education, how they can rationalize this to say that the system that has brought us to be the 39th among 41 industrialized nations in education is one that we should not change. 
   Studies show that title I moneys are not producing the dividends we had hoped they should. Better those funds be spent on remedial education for poor children, better they be spent in teaching youngsters the basic fundamentals than spent diffusely throughout school districts and not achieving any change. 
   Public education, as we know it today, is in deep trouble. The Achilles' heel of education is this path of least resistance: Simply promoting a youngster regardless of whether they are in school, whether they are a truant, whether they are getting Ds or Fs, and not worrying about it because next year the light may go on and they might learn. I think the facts are clear, the light does not go on. 
   I tell you, I do not buy this business about increasing dropouts because you work with them in remedial education. I do not buy that at all. I think that unless our schools have basic standards, hold teachers and students accountable for performance, public education, as we know it today, will simply continue to sink below the waves. 
   I am proud that the largest State in the Union has taken some steps. I think if we were to target and provide the incentive that title I moneys from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would only go to schools that were willing to observe accountability, and were willing to put in remedial education, and were willing to see the grades mean something, and that students are able to master basic core fundamentals, we would have the enlightened workforce of the future, which would mean that we would not have to continue to increase H-1B  quotas to bring foreign nationals into this country to carry out some of the finest occupations we have that should be going to our own students. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I just read statistics given to me by the superintendent of public instruction of Chicago which showed a 12- to 14-percent improvement in core curriculum grade scores since Chicago ended the policy of social promotion and put in motion remedial education and decreased class size and also set some standards holding students accountable for performance and teachers accountable for performance as well.  
   I have a very difficult time with what the Senator from Minnesota is saying because he is essentially calling this a policy, in a sense, of guaranteed retention. It is not that at all. It is a policy that says there should be standards; that there should be achievement levels set in each of the grades; that there should be a minimum pass requirement for promotion; and that schools should mean something in terms of learning. 
   The problem with the amendment is it obfuscates our amendment. It prevents a clean vote on our amendment, and in effect it would destroy our amendment because it sets up a series of seven conditions which would make it virtually impossible to enact our amendment. 
   For example, the child was taught by fully certified or qualified teachers as defined by the State. In my State, we probably have 30,000 teachers who are not certificated. This would mean under this provision, California should not go ahead and abolish social promotion, put forward standards of accountability for teachers and for students, which, of course, California is now in the process, by the Governor's statement, by the legislature's action, and by individual school districts, of beginning to do. 
   Secondly, that the child's parents had multiple opportunities for parental involvement. I don't know what multiple opportunities for parental involvement are, but it is not just opportunities for parental involvement. It is multiple opportunities for parental involvement, which gives a basis, again, to essentially poison what we are trying to achieve. 
   In addition, that the child has access to high-quality instructional materials and instructional resources to ensure that the child had the opportunity to achieve the highest performance level, regardless of disability, income, and background, that is something we would all subscribe to, but when it is put in this form, it becomes a way of avoiding accountability and avoiding performance. 
   We do not tell a State or a local jurisdiction how to do this. This is up to them. As I have tried to point out, Los Angeles is now doing it in an incremental fashion, in a grade-by-grade fashion. I suspect that schools throughout this country would implement accountability and standards in a different way. That is fine with me. But what this amendment says is, we are not going to waste taxpayers' money by providing money when there is no evidence it is going to provide the remedial education or the kind of opportunity for students that the framers intended in the first place. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think it has been pretty clear, at least to me and certainly to the State of California, the city of Chicago, the city of Los Angeles, the city of San Diego, and other cities around this country, that either an implicit or explicit policy or practice of promoting children when they are failing or when they don't even show up in school is probably the leading cause for many of us for the decline of quality public education across this great country. 
   It isn't politically correct to say we will no longer permit social promotion, but it can make a huge difference in where this Nation goes. This amendment is very carefully crafted to say that Federal education dollars will not be available to a jurisdiction if the State does not have a policy to prohibit the practice of social promotion. If we leave the details to the State and local communities, it does not tell them how, when, or where to do it. It simply says that Federal moneys are contingent upon the abolition of that practice. The fact is that the States are moving in this direction. The fact is that there is still no accountable standards. 
   I wish to stress that it does allow for remedial education; it does allow for Federal dollars to be used for remedial education. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator DEWINE and I are introducing a bill to provide funds to educational organizations to teach the history of the Holocaust. It is entitled the Holocaust Education Assistance Act. Cosponsoring the bill are Senators SMITH of Oregon, MOYNIHAN, LAUTENBERG, SCHUMER, BOXER, WELLSTONE, and DURBIN. 
   This bill authorizes $2 million each year for fiscal years 2001-2005 for a competitive grant program under which schools, museums and other non-profit organizations could compete for grants to train teachers, conduct seminars and develop educational materials on the Holocaust. It is the companion bill to H.R. 3105, introduced by Representatives MALONEY, HORN, WAXMAN, and others. 
   The Holocaust is one of the most horrific events in human history. In the 1930s and 1940s, the German Nazi regime systematically slaughtered more than 6,000,000 Jews and other minorities under the guise of achieving a ``racially pure'' society. Hopefully, this bill can help ensure that the next generation of Americans 
   learns some of the crucial lessons of the Holocaust. The most fundamental of these lessons is that racial and ethnic-based hatred endangers each of us, and that the violation of one person's rights threatens the freedom of all of us. 
   Five states mandate that the Holocaust be taught in schools. They are California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. Eleven others recommend or encourage teaching the Holocaust in school. They are Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. The bill is needed because most teachers have little training and few resources to teach the history of the Holocaust. This bill does not mandate anything, but it does create a funding source for schools and communities that choose to teach youngsters about this horrible chapter of human history. 
   In my state, the following groups support the bill:  
   Holocaust Center of Northern California. 
   Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission. 
   Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance. 
   The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California.  
   The following national organizations support the Holocaust Education Assistance Act:  
   Agudath Israel of America. 
   American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. 
   American Jewish Committee. 
   American Society for Yad Vashem, Inc. 
   Anti-Defamation League. 
   Association of Holocaust Organizations. 
   Braun Holocaust Institute. 
   Facing History and Ourselves. 
   Hatikvah Holocaust Education Resource Center. 
   Institute for Public Affairs of the Orthodox Union. 
   Museum of Jewish Heritage. 
   National Catholic Center for Holocaust Education. 
   Rabbinical Council of America. 
   Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism. 
   Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance. 
   United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. 
   World Jewish Congress.  
   The following regional organizations support the Holocaust Education Assistance Act:  
   Florida Holocaust Museum. 
   Hawaii Holocaust Center. 
   Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois. 
   Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Central Florida. 
   Holocaust Resource Center & Archives, Queensboro Community College. 
   Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia. 
   Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. 
   New Mexico Holocaust and Intolerance Museum and Study Center.  
   Tennessee Holocaust Commission. 
   Tennessee Jewish Federation. 
   West Virginia Holocaust Education Commission.  
   As we enter the new century, we must remain vigilant to ensure that we do not forget the lessons of the last century. The admonition that ``those who forget history are doomed to repeat it'' is as true today as ever. After the Holocaust, survivors and others vowed not to let another such tragedy go unchallenged. Rallying behind the cry: ``Never again!'', Holocaust survivors made a promise to the memories of their mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children. This bill provides a way for us to join with Holocaust survivors in keeping that promise. It ensures that future generations of Americans will remember that bigotry against any group poses a menace to society at large, and that the violation of an individual's rights places every person's freedom in peril. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce this bill today to assist Katy Gill, the owner of KATY radio, a station broadcasting out of a one acre parcel of the San Bernardino Forest and acting as an important public service announcement source for the residents of Idylwood, California. 
   KATY radio has been caught up in some unfortunate circumstances involving an antennae site that the station had at one time, been leasing from GTE. When GTE decided to move out of the area, KATY was no longer able to legally operate. This bill will allow KATY to purchase at fair market value the title to 1.06 acres of land in San Bernardino National Forest so that the station could continue broadcasting. 
   This legislation is supported by the Forest Service and KATY radio station listeners throughout Idylwood, California. I know of no opposition to such legislation. Representatives MARY BONO, JERRY LEWIS and DON YOUNG have introduced similar legislation in the House. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the relevant Senate committee members to ensure that we address this issue before the end of the 106th Congress.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend the legislation that authorized construction of the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project in California. Enactment of this bill would allow water districts in the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project to supplement their federal water supplies with purchases of water from the State Water Project. At present, federal law prohibits the delivery of non-federal water to districts in the San Luis Unit until certain conditions are met. 
   The San Luis Unit is the last component created by federal law in the Central Valley Project, which is the largest Bureau of Reclamation project in the United States. Water service to districts in the San Luis Unit is often curtailed because of limitations imposed in pumping in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
   It is customary for water districts in the San Luis Unit to supplement their supplies through purchases on the open market. However, current federal law prohibits them from purchasing supplies from the State Water Project and having these delivered over federal facilities. Making such deliveries is relatively easy because state and federal project conveyance facilities are interconnected. Prohibiting purchase of state water for delivery over federal facilities limits the opportunities available for San Luis Unit districts to obtain as large a supplemental supply as they would like. 
   Mr. President, this bill has already passed the House as H.R. 3077. It will impose no additional costs on the federal government. It contains provisions which assure that the additional water obtained by districts in the San Luis Unit cannot be used in a manner that would exacerbate current groundwater drainage problems. It is consistent with the provisions in the Central Valley Project Improvement Act that sought to encourage the exchange of water by willing sellers to provide additional supplies at reasonable cost to willing buyers. I urge the Senate to pass this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise to introduce legislation to give farm workers what so many of us take for granted--a safe commute to work. 
   Today, many farm workers are still being transported to fields in crowded vans lacking basic safety equipment. There are reports of vans originally designed for 10 people, transporting up to 20 passengers with no access to seat belts. People should not have to put their lives at risk to travel to a job site. 
   According to the latest United States Department of Labor statistics, farm occupations have the second highest work-related fatalities, and 45 percent of these fatalities are vehicular related. 
   Nationally, 533 farm workers were killed in transportation incidents between 1994 and 1998. And farm workers are 4 times more likely to be killed in on-the-job highway traffic accidents than a typical worker. 
   The following are just a few of the recent accidents involving farm workers traveling in vehicles without seatbelts. 
   Just two weeks ago, on February 10, 14 people were injured when a car ran a stop sign and crashed into a van carrying farm workers in Tulare County, California. Authorities cited the driver of the van three months ago for illegally transporting workers--but at the time of the accident, he still had not received certification to transport workers.  
   On September 10, 1999, 13 people were injured south of Fresno when an unlicensed van driver failed to stop for a posted stop sign and collided with another car. The van had seven seats--all with seatbelts--but four passengers were seated on the floor. 
   On August 9, 1999, thirteen tomato field workers were killed when the van transporting them home slammed into a tractor-trailer truck in rural southwest Fresno County, California. Most of the victims in this horrific crash rode on three bare benches in the back of the van. 
   On July 23, 1999, one man was killed and more than 40 people injured when a big-rig crashed into a Greyhound bus and a farm worker van on Highway 99 in Tulare County, California. The victim rode in the farm-labor van, packed with 19 other passengers. 
   This is a national problem which calls for Federal action. Farm workers live all over the country, and have work that frequently carries them across state lines. 
   Unfortunately, existing Federal laws leave farm workers inadequately protected. 
   Regulations issued under the Migrant and Season Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) prohibit transport of migrant workers unless the vehicles have adequate service brakes, parking brakes, steering mechanisms, windshield wipers, tires, and review mirrors. But, believe it or not, the law does not mandate seating positions or an operational seatbelt for each passenger. 
   The Farm Worker Safety Transportation Act of 2000 will make it illegal to transport farm workers unless each passenger has a designated seat with an operational seatbelt. This applies no matter how the vans are purchased or modified. 
   Federal law now requires vans manufactured with up to 10 passenger seats to have operational seatbelts for each seat. However, after a new van is sold to its first owner, the owner can legally remove the rear seats and install bare benches. Similarly, Federal law permits an individual to purchase a van with an empty cargo hold and install benches without seatbelts. 
   The legislation will direct the Department of Transportation to develop interim seat and seatbelt standards for vans or trucks without seats that are converted for the transport of farm workers. 
   After a seven-year transition period, the commercial vehicles that transport farm workers will have to meet the same seat and seatbelt standards as a new vehicles. 
   A farm worker should have access to a safe commute whether he or she is traveling to a field in Arizona, California, Washington, or Florida. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this sensible, practical legislation that will save lives.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on February 12, we lost the creator of the world's most popular comic strip, Charles Schulz. The ``Peanuts'' comic strip was a daily staple for millions of people--not only in America but around the world. 
   While Charles Schulz' legions of fans mourn the loss of his creative genius, he was also a man with a wonderful family who cared deeply about him. I want to express my deep sympathy to his wife, Jeanne Schulz, his five children (Monte, Craig, Meredith, Amy, and Jill), his two stepchildren and 18 grandchildren. Our hearts are with you. 
   For half a century, the ``Peanuts'' comic-strip has been part of the fabric  of our national culture. Charles Schulz' illustrations have inspired us with its wry humor and endearing cast of characters. Who has not been touched by the trials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the Peanuts family? 
   Here is what some of Charles Schulz' peers had to say about his legacy. 
   Rob Rogers, editorial cartoonist of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said of Charles Schulz' legacy to his profession:  
   Schulz revolutionized the comic strip. Not just with his simply and accessible art style but also his strong character development. He combined the innocence of childhood with the cynicism of adulthood to create realistic, idiosyncratic and empathetic icons.  
   Cartoonist Mort Walker, the creator of ``Beetle Bailey'' said of Schulz:  
   What he brought to the strips was a whole new attitude ..... [He] brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff, and somehow made it funny.  
   As one writer observed, Charlie Brown taught me  
   it's OK to lose. Losing doesn't mean giving up hope. No mater how many times he missed the football, lost the big game, or heard Lucy call him a blockhead, he still believed in himself. This is the lesson that helped me get through childhood and now helps me deal with the tangled kite strings of adulthood. 
   Charles Schulz was born in Minneapolis, MN on November 26, 1922, and was raised in St. Paul. He acquired an interest in cartooning while a teenager, but was drafted as an army infantryman in World War II before he could fulfill his career ambition. 
   In 1947, Schulz started a feature in the St. Paul Pioneer Press called ``Li'l Folks.'' It was syndicated as Peanuts, launching an unprecedented 50-year run of over 18,000 comic strip installments. 
   At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 countries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than 355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz' television special, ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, more than 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced. 
   Charles Schulz' achievements are all the more remarkable because, throughout his career, he had worked without any artistic assistants, unlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz painstakingly drew every line and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, and unparalleled commitment to his art and profession. 
   In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for things that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given generations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with and to teach the small and large lessons of life. 
   In his farewell strip, Charles Schulz wrote, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy *.*.* how can I ever forget them *.*.*'' These characters will stay with us forever and we will certainly never forget their creator, Charles Schulz. 
   There is still something we can do for Charles Schulz and his family. 
   For the past several months, I have worked on legislation to award Charles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal for his outstanding career and community service. 
   In fact, on Thursday, February 10, just 2 days before Charles Schulz' passing, I formally introduced the legislation to award him the Gold Medal. While Charles Schulz can no longer personally receive this honor, the posthumous award would be the proper gesture to his wife Jeanne, their children, and to the millions of ``Peanuts'' fans around the world. 
   As the world's preeminent cartoonist, Charles Schulz is more than qualified to join the 17 other Americans who have received the Congressional Gold Medal for their contribution to the Arts. 
   I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in posthumously awarding Charles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal. This would be one small token of our nation's great appreciation of this man who gave us all so much.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there are few in this body who have worked harder on this issue than my friend from Connecticut, and it has been a real pleasure to work with him on this legislation and on this issue. 
   The Iran Nonproliferation Act is an important piece of legislation which seeks to halt the flow of ballistic missile technology and other weapons of mass destruction from Russia to Iran. I strongly support Senate passage of this legislation. 
   Indeed, even as much of the U.S. focus in the past year--and rightly so, in my mind--has been on the peace process and Israel's relations with Syria and the Palestinians, there may be no greater long term threat to Israel's security and Middle East peace than an Iran actively seeking ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. 
   That is why I believe that preventing the transfer of illegal nuclear and missile technology from Russia to Iran must be at the top of the U.S. policy agenda. 
   As my colleagues are aware, there have been numerous reports over the  past several years of Russian missile technology reaching Iran, sometimes with a semi-official wink from government authorities in Moscow, sometimes by rogue operators. 
   Either way, the Russian government must put a stop to these transfers. 
   As much as we want good relations with Russia, cooperation in this area is crucial. In some ways, I believe it is a litmus test of what sort of player Russia wants to be in the post-Cold War international system. 
   Although Russia has denied that any illegal transfers have taken place, it has taken some tangible steps in response to American concerns--such as the cancellation of a 1997 contract between a Russian missile factory (NPO Trud) and Iran in which rocket engine components were to have been shipped under the guise of gas pipeline compressors. 
   Unfortunately, despite such progress as cooperation with the NPO Trud contract, since issuing an Executive Order in 1998, the United States has been forced to sanction ten Russian entities for continuing to transfer technology for the development of advanced ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, and the Central Intelligence Agency reports that Russian entities continue to provide Iran with assistance. Indeed, there are reportedly over 10,000 Russians in Iran helping Iran with these programs. 
   For its part, and despite some positive signs of moderation in Iran's politics--the recent elections notwithstanding--Iran has not yet moderated any of its policies with regard to the support of international terrorism or the pursuit of advanced ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. 
   Iran has flight-tested the Shihab-3, a missile that can hit Israel and U.S. forces in the Middle East, and is continuing to work on other advanced missile designs, including those capable of delivering nuclear warheads. 
   Because of Russia's mixed record--and Iran's outright dangerous record--I believe that although we should try to build on Russia's record of cooperation, we must also be prepared to take tough action when the situation warrants. In other words, we must be prepared to work with Russia on this issue and offer them a carrot, but, if our interests and those of our friends and allies are threatened, we must also be prepared to use a stick. 
   To that end, last year I offered an amendment on the Department of Defense authorization bill, passed by the Senate, which stated that it is the sense of Congress that the U.S. should increase the quota on commercial space launch services provided by Russia if the Russian government demonstrates a sustained commitment to prevent the transfer from Russia to Iran, or other countries, of nuclear and missile technology. 
   I continue to believe that pending Russian cooperation this quota can be raised to 20 and, if Russia continues to cooperate, incrementally raised again in the coming years. Each launch provides Russia with approximately $100 million in hard currency. A $100 million carrot is a good incentive to cooperate. 
   The bill we consider before us today recognizes that in addition to such carrots, we must also be prepared to take tough action when necessary. The Iran Nonproliferation Act has two parts. 
   First, it requires the President to report credible information about any foreign entity providing dangerous technologies to Iran and authorize the President to sanction these entities in accordance with the President's own Executive Order. 
   Second, it requires that the President must certify that the Russian government opposes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to Iran and is taking steps to oppose such proliferation before the Russian Space Agency is provided with any additional U.S. taxpayer money beyond what has contracted for the International Space Station. These are funds which the U.S. is providing to Russia so that Russia can meet its own obligations to the International Space Station. If Russia and the Russian Space Agency cooperates with the U.S. on proliferation, then cooperation between Russia and Iran on the proliferation of advanced ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction must stop. If Russia and the Russian Space Agency cooperates with the U.S. on proliferation, then I believe we can work in partnership with them to increase commercial space launch and to provide funding for the International Space Station. 
   But there are few things more dangerous or destabilizing to U.S. interests and peace and security in the Middle East than a nuclear armed Iran which continues to support international terrorism. And if Russia does not recognize this and is not willing to work with the United States to build a more stable and more secure Middle East, then we must not shy away from taking the tough action necessary to get results.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this legislation to permit the National Park Service to expand the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) by acquiring critical natural landscapes and scenic vistas. This includes land in San Mateo County, as well as land in San Francisco and Marin County. 
   A key component of this legislation is that about half of the total cost of purchasing these lands will be donated by the local community. This legislation specifically provides that all land transactions involve a willing seller and willing buyer. 
   In introducing this bill, I am joined by my esteemed colleague from California, Senator BARBARA BOXER. This bill also has the bipartisan support of the entire Bay Area Congressional Delegation including original co-sponsors in the House, Representatives TOM LANTOS, NANCY PELOSI, and LYNN WOOLSEY. 
   Furthermore, this bill also has the strong support of local environmental and advocacy and preservation groups, the Point Reyes National Seashore Advisory Commission, and the National Park Service. I know of no opposition to this bill. 
   The three Marin County properties lie in the Marin headlands. Preservation of these lands will protect habitat, ridge-top trails and scenic views of San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. 
   The San Francisco land along the pacific coastline, the city of San Francisco would like to donate to the federal government and has authorized $100,000 for the restoration of this site. 
   The legislation also proposes to include land near Labos Creek, adjacent to the Presido-West Gate, which was damaged during a severe storm in 1997. The American Land Conservancy intends to acquire this land and donate it to the National Park Service. Lobos Creek is the key source of the Presidio's water supply and a unique ecological resource. 
   Together, these parcels offer beautiful vistas, sweeping coastal views and spectacular headland scenery and the preservation of unique bayland ecosystems with added public access. Much of this land also protects the  habitat of several species of rare or endangered plants and animals. Several of the vegetation communities is home to at least 18 endangered or threatened species including the winter-run chinook salmon, American peregrine falcon, the mission blue butterfly and the southwestern pond turtle. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on January 3rd, 2000, Charles Schulz published his last daily ``Peanuts'' comic strip ending a remarkable fifty year run. To commemorate Charles Schulz's extraordinary career, I urge my colleagues to join me in awarding him a Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   Charles Schulz's body of work in the ``Peanuts'' strip deserves recognition as a national treasure. For half a century, his cartoon illustrations have inspired millions of Americans with its wry humor and endearing cast of characters. Who has not been touched by the trials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the ``Peanuts'' family? 
   At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 countries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than 355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz's television special, ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, more that 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced. 
   Charles Schulz's achievements are all the more remarkable because, throughout his career, he has worked without any artistic assistants, unlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz has painstakingly drawn every line and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, an unparalleled commitment to his art and profession. 
   In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for things that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given generations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with and to teach the small and large lessons of life. 
   Seventeen Americans from the arts and entertainment world have been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their achievements in the enrichment of American culture. I urge that Charles Schulz become the eighteenth individual so honored. Please join me in recognizing the lifetime contributions of Charles Schulz by awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support a bill to name the Santa Ana, California Post Office as the ``Hector G. Godinez Post Office Building.'' 
   Hector Godinez, who passed away in May of 1999, was a true leader in his community of Santa Ana, California. He was a pioneer in the United States Postal Service rising from letter carrier to become the first Mexican-American to achieve the rank of District Manager within the United States Postal Service. He served with honor in World War II, was a ardent civil rights activist and an active participant in civic organizations and local government. 
   After graduation from Santa Ana High School, Mr. Godinez enlisted into the armed services and was a tank commander in World War II under General George Patton. For his service, he earned a bronze star for bravery under fire and was also awarded a purple heart for wounds received in battle. 
   Upon his return home in 1946, Mr. Godinez started his first of 48 years of distinguished service as a United States postal worker. 
   Hector Godinez was a true pillar within the Santa Ana community devoting his tireless energy to such civic groups as the Orange County District Boy Scouts of America, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, Orange County YMCA and National President of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the country's oldest Hispanic civil rights organizations. 
   On behalf of the Godinez family and the people of Santa Ana, California, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill to name the Santa Ana, California Post Office in his honor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this afternoon Senators will come to the floor to speak about a problem we believe is a very serious one; that is, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. I know the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, will speak, and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD will speak. I believe others will as well. 
   Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues here this afternoon to address what I consider to be one of the most pressing and important national security and international health issues that we will face in the coming decades: The HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is currently sweeping Africa. 
   I wish to begin by giving my colleagues a sense of the scope and scale of this problem. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. Today, 23.3 million adults and children are infected with the HIV virus in Africa, which only has about 10 percent of the world's population, but nearly 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people. 
   Worldwide, about 5.6 million new infections will occur this year, with an estimated 3.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa--3.8 million people will contract HIV. Every day, 11,000 additional people are infected--1 every 8 seconds. 
   All told, over 34 million people in Africa--the population of my State of California--have been infected with HIV since the epidemic began, and an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998. 
   Each day, AIDS buries 5,500 men, women, and children. We saw a very compelling documentary made by the filmmaker Rory Kennedy, which showed the burials of some of these children as well as the enormous cultural problems that exist in Africa because of HIV/AIDS. By 2005, if policies do not change, the daily death toll will not be 5,500, it will be 13,000--double what it is now--with nearly 5 million AIDS deaths that year alone, according to the White House Office of AIDS Policy. 
   AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in Africa, and it kills many times more people on that continent than war. 
   The overall rate of infection among adults is about 8 percent, compared with a 1.1-percent infection rate worldwide. In some countries of southern Africa, 20 to 30 percent of the adults are infected. 
   AIDS has cut life expectancy by 4 years in Nigeria, 18 years in Kenya, and 26 years in Zimbabwe. As these numbers suggest, AIDS is devastating Africa.  
   AIDS is swelling infant and child mortality rates, reversing the declines that had been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa will themselves become HIV infected. Let me say again, 30 percent of all of the children born to HIV-infected mothers will become HIV infected. 
   There are many explanations for why this epidemic is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. Certainly the region's poverty, which has deprived much of Africa from effective systems of health information, health education and health care, bears much of the blame. Cultural and behavioral patterns, which have led to sub-Saharan Africa becoming the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men, may also play a role. 
   HIV/AIDS is becoming a major woman's issue. AIDS has largely impacted the heterosexual community in Africa, and it has established itself in such a way that it sweeps across and wipes out entire villages. 
   Because of the region's poverty, all too often treatment of AIDS sufferers with medicines that can result in long-term survival has not been widely used in Africa. 
   But I strongly believe that if the international community is to be successful, we must make every effort to get appropriate medicine into the hands of those in need. 
   For too many years there were no effective drugs that could be used to combat HIV/AIDS, but now, thanks to recent medical research, we do have effective drugs. For example, some recent pilot projects have had success in reducing mother-to-child 
   transmission by administering the anti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapine, during birth and early childhood. 
   New studies indicate that Nevirapine can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by as much as 80 percent. NVP is given just once to the mother during labor, once to the child within 3 days of birth. Taking three or four pills can mean that a child is prevented from being born with HIV. In fact, for $4 a tablet--a little more than the cost of a large latte at Starbuck's, which is not a lot here, but a great deal in Africa--this drug regime has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against AIDS. I, frankly, believe it is the single most cost-effective thing that can be done. Currently, however, less than 1 percent of HIV-infected pregnant women have access to interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission. 
   Administered in a treatment regimen known as HAART--highly active antiretroviral therapy--antiretroviral drugs can allow people living with AIDS to live a largely normal life and use of the drugs can lead to long-term survival rather than early death. Such treatment is proven highly effective in developed countries, including our very own. 
   My understanding is that most antiretrovirals are relatively inexpensive to produce. AIDS Treatment News recently reported:  
   AZT in bulk can be purchased for 42 cents for 300 milligrams from the worldwide suppliers; this price reflects profits not only to the manufacturer, but also to the middleman bulk buyer. The same drug retails at my local pharmacy for $5.82 per pill. This ridiculous price bears no relation to the cost of production.  
   Unfortunately--and inexplicably, in my view--access for poor Africans to costly combinations of AIDS medications, or antiretrovirals, is perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the African epidemic. 
   As the U.S. Development Program head, Mark Brown, said at the U.N. Security Council meeting on AIDS in Africa last month:  
   We cannot lapse into a two-tier treatment regime: drugs for the rich, no hope for the poor. While the emphasis must be on prevention, we cannot ignore treatment, despite its costs.  
   I agree with that. Although it is true that the cost of combination therapy is beyond the means of most people living with HIV/AIDS and governments in sub-Saharan Africa--combination therapy in South Africa, incidentally, was estimated at $334 a month, or $4,000 per individual per year, and UNAIDS reports that Brazil treated 75,000 people with antiretrovirals in 1999 at a cost of $300 million--or, again, $4,000 a person. 
   I believe we have a strong moral obligation to try to save lives when the medications for doing so exist. There are several things the United States can do to increase access to lifesaving drugs. 
   First, the U.S. should work with others in the international community to provide support to make these drugs affordable and to strengthen African health care systems so that drug therapies can be effectively administered. The plan for combating HIV/AIDS in Africa recently put forward by the President and Vice President goes a long way towards seeing that the U.S. meets its commitment to this goal. 
   Second, it should be possible for African governments and donor agencies to achieve reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals through negotiated agreements with drug manufacturers. The British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of antiretrovirals, has already stated that it is committed to ``differential pricing,'' which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in Africa. 
   Third, I strongly believe that the United States must work to advocate ``parallel imports'' of drugs and ``compulsory licensing'' by African governments to lower the price of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable, and more people in Africa will be able to have access to them. 
   Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals could be purchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. Under ``compulsory licensing'' an African government could order a local firm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent holder. 
   Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under the World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health emergencies. There can be little doubt that Africa is facing a health emergency of monumental proportions. 
   That is why I, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, introduced an Amendment to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act last year to allow the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa to pursue ``compulsory licensing''. 
   Without ``compulsory licensing'', which would allow access to cheaper generic drugs, more people in Sub-Saharan African will suffer and die. 
   For those of my colleagues who may be concerned that this Amendment may undermine wider Intellectual Property Rights, this Amendment acknowledges that the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) is the presumptive legal standard for intellectual property rights (IPR). 
   The WTO, however, allows countries flexibility in addressing public health concerns, and the compulsory licensing process under this Amendment is consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection of intellectual property with a moral obligation to meet public health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. 
   In other words, this Amendment does not create new policy or a new approach on IPR issues under TRIPS, nor does it require IPR rights to be rolled back or weakened. All it asks is that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. policy on compulsory licensing remains consistent with what is accepted under international trade law. 
   By doing so, this Amendment will allow the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa to continue to determine the availability of 
   HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs. 
   These drugs exist. We need to get them to where this epidemic is reaching monumental proportions. 
   I was pleased to work with the Managers of this bill when the African Growth and Opportunity Act was on the floor of the Senate last November, to modify my Amendment to meet some of their concerns, and to have their support in seeing it included in the final Senate-passed version of this bill. 
   Unfortunately, several pharmaceutical manufacturers are strongly opposed to this measure, and, as I understand it, there are efforts to have this Amendment taken out of the final bill that will be reported out of Conference. 
   I believe that such efforts are reprehensible, and I am determined not to allow this to happen.  
   And if, behind closed doors, this amendment is indeed removed from this bill, I intend to do all I can to--I hope I will be joined by my colleagues--make sure that an African Growth and Opportunity bill without this provision does not pass this Congress. 
   What good is an African trade bill if Africa is going to get wiped out from AIDS? 
   It is clearly in the interest of the United States to prevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and I believe that the ``compulsory licensing'' amendment was a necessary addition to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act if we are to continue to assist the countries of this region in halting the number of premature deaths from AIDS. Antiretroviral drugs can do much to improve quality and length of life. The United States has the power to make these life-saving drugs more affordable and accessible to Africans. We cannot turn our backs on Africa. Our assistance is truly a matter of life and death. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after much deliberation, I am voting in favor of tabling the Feingold amendment on the use of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings. 
   In California, we have had very serious problems with bankruptcy mills, fly-by-night firms that have advised tenants to avoid eviction by filing for bankruptcy. These firms have even gone so far as to place ads in newspapers which encourage renters to ``stop evictions from one to six months by filing for bankruptcy,'' or promise to ``legally stop your eviction for up to 120 days at rock bottom prices.'' 
   In 1996 alone, the Los Angles County Sheriff's Department reported 3,800 cases in which the tenant filed for bankruptcy after all state eviction proceedings were exhausted--causing an extra $ 6 million in costs. 
   While the Feingold amendment is well-intentioned, it does not adequately address the misuse of the ``automatic stay'' in eviction proceedings. 
   Let me explain why: 
   First, once an individual files for bankruptcy, the Feingold amendment only permits an eviction to go forward if the tenant subsequently fails to pay rent again. Thus, a debtor could refuse to pay debts for many months, and when the landlord begins the eviction proceeding, the landlord's hands would be tied if the debtor then starts paying the rent. 
   This in effect gives a renter the ability not to pay rent, go through bankruptcy, and, by agreeing to pay future rent, get to keep the apartment even if no back rent is paid. In the meantime, he could have had eight or ten or twelve months of free rent. 
   Second, the amendment gives landlords the incentive to evict tenants immediately upon non-payment. If, according to the Feingold amendment, the landlord begins eviction proceedings more than 10 days after non-payment of rent and then the tenant files bankruptcy, the eviction would be subject to the automatic stay. This quirk in the amendment could deter landlords from entering into negotiations with tenants and lead to quicker evictions. 
   Finally, I have concerns about the impact of this amendment on small landlords. I have received letters from small, private landlords about the burden of current bankruptcy law. These landlords, who may own just one or two apartments, report that the non-payment of rent by tenants threatens their own ability to meet mortgage payments. 
   I believe strongly in protecting the rights of tenants. However, the Feingold amendment tips the scales too far. A more balanced approach is needed.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying goal of the bankruptcy bill, which is to promote personal financial responsibility. Bankruptcy filings have increased at an astonishing pace since the last overhaul of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978. In 1978, there were 182,000 consumer bankruptcy filings. Twenty years later in 1998, 1,444,812 people filed for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has become so commonplace that more than one in a hundred households will file for bankruptcy this year. 
   The rise in bankruptcy filings is particularly disconcerting given the record expansion of our economy, which this week became the longest expansion in our Nation's history. 
   Bankruptcy should be a last-resort legal option, and not a vehicle for avoiding personal responsibility. People should not be able to file bankruptcy if they can easily pay back their debts. 
   Another key aspect of bankruptcy reform is the need to address the growth of consumer credit. It's a simple matter of arithmetic. The typical family filing for bankruptcy in 1998 owed more than one-and-a-half times its annual income in short-term, high-interest debt. This means the average family in bankruptcy with a median income of just over $17,500, and $28,955 in credit card and other short-term high interest debt. 
   There are over a billion credit cards in circulation--a dozen credit cards for every household in the country. Three-quarters of all households have at least one credit card. Credit debt has doubled between 1993 and 1997 to $422 billion from just over $200 billion. 
   A constituent from Lakewood, California describes the situation aptly: ``What really bugs me about this is that credit card companies send out these solicitations for their plastic cards and then when they get burned, they start crying foul. They want all kinds of laws passed to protect them from taking hits when it's their own practices that caused the problem.'' 
   This legislation has taken some steps to address the problem of consumer credit, but more needs to be done. 
   One of the major reasons that I am supporting the bill is that it includes my amendment to require the Federal Reserve Board to investigate the practice of issuing credit cards indiscriminately, without taking steps to ensure that consumers are capable of repaying their debt, or in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate additional debt. 
   The amendment allows the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations that would require additional disclosures to consumers, and to take any other actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the Board finds necessary to ensure responsible industry-wide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency. 
   In addition, I am pleased that the bill requires credit card companies to warn consumers about interest costs, and provide a toll-free phone where they can find out how long it would take to  eliminate a balance when just paying the minimum balance each month. Credit card companies also are required to better explain teaser rates and late fees in their solicitations. 
   The Senate also has made important improvements to this bill, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor. In my home state of California, for example, we have suffered from the abusive practices of bankruptcy mills including price gouging of debtors, incompetent service, and fraud. The bill includes an amendment to curb this abusive practice. 
   However, I remain very concerned about the minimum wage and tax amendments attached to this bill. Let me first say that I am strong supporter of raising the minimum wager. In the four years since Congress last past a minimum wage increase, the U.S. economy has continued to surge at an unprecedented rate. 
   Nine million new jobs have been added to the economy. More than a million of those are in the retail sector. Unemployment is down and the number of jobs for women, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and teenagers has grown. Clearly the increase in the minimum wage has helped working families and it is time to do so again. 
   The problem with the minimum wage increase in this bill is that it is spread out over too long a period of time. The amendment would raise the minimum wage by $1 in three steps of 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents. 
   California's minimum wage is $5.75. Under this proposal, working families there would not benefit at all in the first year, receive only a 10 cent wage increase in the second year, and would not feel the full increase until 2003. That is simply unacceptable. 
   The time to raise the minimum wage is not when the economy is ailing. It's when the economy is flush and that time is now. 
   Congress should raise the minimum by $1 over two years as proposed by Democrats and we should do it now. 
   The bill also contains a $77 billion tax package whose benefits are skewed toward upper-income taxpayers. Specifically, the package has health insurance and long-term care provisions which would disproportionately benefit higher income taxpayers. I am also concerned about the fairness of the package's pension provision which would principally benefit highly-compensated employees. 
   In summary, I think there is a lot of good in the bankruptcy bill, and I intend to vote for it because it can still yield a worthwhile final product. However, extensive improvements are still needed in conference. The Conference negotiations must resolve the minimum wage and tax problems, and other deficiencies is the bill. 
   I need to work with my Senate colleagues to implement these needed changes.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as January 2000, National Biotechnology Month, comes to a close, I want to recognize the importance of the biotechnology to the nation and to commend this industry for its innovations in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. 
   The United States is the leader in the biotechnology industry, and I am proud to say that California has the nation's largest concentration of health care technology companies. California, alone, is home to over 2,500 biomedical companies and employs over 241,000 people in health care technology and biomedical and clinical research fields. California's health care technology companies are producing leading edge products, for example, the first new therapy for cystic fibrosis in 30 years, Genetech; technology that enables doctors to do heart surgery without opening the chest cavity, Heartport; a cancer drug that is genetically engineered and stimulates the bone marrow to produce important white blood cells, Amgen; linear accelerators for treating cancer, Varian; and intraocular eye lenses, Allergan. 
   Biotechnology has enabled us to reduce hospital stays, to detect cancer and other life-threatening illnesses earlier in order to begin treatments earlier; to attack diseases cell by cell to eliminate unnecessary side effects, and to use vaccines to prevent abnormal cell growth. This is a critical time in biotechnology, as scientists continue to make strides in cellular and genetic research, and I am hopeful that this work will improve our health and well-being. I am confident that as this industry continues to grow, we will see treatments to greatly improve the lives of millions of Americans, and we will see cures to illnesses that we did not think were possible. 
   I commend the more than 150,000 employees of the biotech industry nationwide and join them in observing January as National Biotechnology Month.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, no matter what our party affiliation, no matter what our beliefs, no matter whether we are Members or staff, we are all here for one purpose--that is, we believe in the nobility of public service. And while the enormity of the issues before this body bring it, and us, much notoriety, it is to the many thousands of dedicated public servants at the State and local level that we owe a debt of gratitude. 
   San Francisco has been fortunate for the last 25 years to have had the services of a public servant of great ability and dedication, Andy Moran. Andy's talents first came to my attention when I was Mayor. He has risen through the ranks of municipal government and has, for the last six years, served as the General Manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. For those who do not know, our PUC includes the Hetch Hetchy Water and Power Division, the Water Department and San Francisco's Clean Water Program. 
   As one might imagine, the challenges of this job are many, and they are varied. Andy has met those challenges with practice, intelligence, good humor, and a sense of fairness. His accomplishments are too numerous to mention here, but I would be remiss if I don't pay special tribute to his expertise on the all-important issue of California water. Water is our lifeblood in California, and the demands on our water supply and our water supply system have increased dramatically in the last generation. 
   Andy has been a part of that evolution. He has an institutional memory and an understanding of those issues which are born of first hand experience. He has played pivotal roles in such landmark agreements as the Bay-Delta  accord and the settlement of Tuolumne River water rights with Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts. His accomplishments have been widely recognized by his peers, and he has served on numerous California water committees, including a term as Chair of the Association of California Urban Water Agencies. 
   Mr. President, we do not know what the future holds for Andy Moran, but we do know that his future will be met with continued success. He has been a mainstay of San Francisco's municipal government and will be greatly missed. We owe Andy a tremendous debt of gratitude, and we wish him the very best in his life ahead. Andy Moran is a true public servant.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a grandmother, and as a member of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, I want to say a few words about the case of Elian Gonzalez, and particularly to indicate my strong support for the concurrent resolution Congressman RANGEL has introduced in the House. Senator DODD has just submitted a similar resolution in the Senate this afternoon, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   As you know, this resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that Elian Gonzalez should be reunited with his father, Juan Gonzalez of Cuba. I have been in California, but nonetheless I have been following, as closely as anyone could over the television, the events surrounding this youngster--the very tragic events. 
   Based on my understanding of the situation, Elian has enjoyed a very close and loving relationship with his father and his grandparents in Cuba. As a grandmother, this has a lot of meaning to me. Those who know Juan Gonzalez have described him as an ``ideal father'' who spent as much time as he could with his son. 
   Elian has been living in his father's home, where his grandparents also play a role in raising him. Although Elian's mother and father shared joint custody of the child, he actually spent 5 out of every 7 days of the week in his father's home. It is my understanding that his father can support him, that he can provide a good home for him, and, above all, he is a good and loving father. Both he and Elian's mother had joint custody of the youngster. 
   To the best of my knowledge, there is no evidence that Juan Gonzalez was either neglectful or abusive in his relationship with his son. After all, a strong parental bond should be the overwhelming test for reunification--that and the fact that the touchstone of U.S. immigration policy has been to protect and reunite the family. 
   Elian's maternal grandparents also took part in raising their grandchild, often keeping him when either parent was working. Despite the divorce of Elian's mother and father, both parents and their respective families maintained, warm relations and continued to play an active role in the youngster's life. 
   We cannot know of the mother's true motivations or intentions when she and Elian left Cuba. Elian's father has maintained, however, that Elian's mother, Elizabet Broton, took their son without his knowledge or consent. 
   Elian's fate should not be subject, I believe, to the politics of any one party or political ideology. I urge all of us--in Florida, in Cuba, and in the Halls of Congress--to cool the rhetoric, to set aside any political views, and commit ourselves to seeing this process to a rightful conclusion. 
   The central issue in this case should not be America's policy toward Cuba but, rather, the sanctity of the family bond between a parent and his child. Without evidence of abuse or neglect on the father's part, no government has the authority to disrupt that bond, no matter if the bond is in the United States or Cuba, or any other place. The father is the father and should have lawful custody. 
   In addition to my concerns about the negative impact of legislation to grant citizenship to Elian on him and his family, and what that does to the pending court case, I also have deep concerns about the impact this would have on our own immigration policy. It would certainly, at the very least, reflect an uneven application of immigration policy by the United States. It would be, I believe, a case of major political first impression and set a precedent all across this land in virtually every case from anywhere. It could also create a precarious situation for an American child abroad. 
   The INS continues, to this day, to send back children to their home countries, even those with repressive regimes. Several months ago, two Haitian children were sent back to Haiti while their mother remained in the United States to file for asylum. Here you have a mother in the United States filing for asylum, and during that period the children were sent back to Haiti. It is true that, after protests and several weeks of separation from their mother, Federal authorities did permit the children to reenter the United States. 
   Or you can look at the case of a 15-year-old Chinese girl who today is being held in juvenile detention and has been held in juvenile detention for 7 months. At her asylum hearing, the young girl could not wipe away her tears because her hands were chained to her waist. According to her lawyer, her only crime was that her parents had put her on a boat so she could get a better life over here. She remains in detention to this day. 
   I think that is a terrible wrong. Here is a youngster who was put on a boat by her parents, who is now in a jail on the west coast of the United States and goes to a hearing chained like a common criminal. In cases such as these, I believe we should review and perhaps even change immigration laws as they relate to minors in certain situations. 
   I am in the process of writing a letter to the chairman of my subcommittee, the Senator from Michigan, asking that he hold hearings on some of these cases as well as on whether immigration law with respect to children should, in fact, be changed in certain circumstances. 
   I believe our immigration policy must be consistent and fair. In any given year, the INS handles more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors, and the vast majority are sent back to their families. Others are detained. 
   I have received scores of phone calls from citizens in California who say, if this child were Salvadoran, if he were a Mexican child, if he were a child from China, the child would be sent back to his country. Why is this child different? Because political organizations in a couple of States want to make a point with this child's situation? 
   I think the point is, granting American citizenship in this manner will affect every other situation. We might as well know what we are doing when we do this. I think the only way to look at it is to take a look at all of our immigration laws, as they affect children, in an orderly way over a period of time. But in the meantime, current law should be followed with respect to this youngster. 
   I think granting U.S. citizenship in this manner, which is really without any precedent, would be a very far-reaching action. It would also play out negatively for U.S. children who might be taken to foreign countries without the consent of the U.S. citizen parent. I have actually tried to help in a case involving a child in Saudi Arabia and  found it most difficult. Once we begin to violate that law, what does it say for other American children who might find themselves in a similar circumstance in a foreign country? As a grandmother, I must say, I shudder to think how I would feel in this same situation. 
   In conclusion, I don't believe our role as a national legislature is to interpose ourselves in a decision that should rightfully be made by a father. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation that would provide lawful permanent residence status to Guy Taylor, a Canadian national who was orphaned at age 16. Guy is now 18. 
   Guy Taylor was born in Canada but spent the first half of his life in the United States attending school and living with his mother. Guy's father died before he was born. In the summer of 1998, his mother died of a drug overdose. This left him without any other family except for his extensive family in Southern California. 
   Upon his mother's death, Guy's grandmother, Oleta Hansen, flew to Canada to secure her daughter's body and bring her grandchild back to the United States. 
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allowed Guy to temporarily enter the United States by granting him a one-year humanitarian parole. Once the parole expired, the INS extended for one more year. This is a very rare act on the INS' part. 
   Initially, Guy had sought to obtain permanent resident status by being declared a dependent of a United States court. However, the Orange County, California Social Services referee declined to name Guy a court dependent because he was considered to be under the guardianship of his grandmother. 
   Because the INS has declared Guy too old to be a dependent of his grandmother, Guy is unable to obtain permanent residence in the United States. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents. 
   Guy's dream is to join the United States Army. Although Guy's Army recruiter said he has successfully tested and is qualified for enlistment, without permanent resident status, Guy will be unable to join. 
   Today Guy, a first-year college student and a young man willing to fight for his adopted country, faces deportation. 
   News about this young man's imminent deportation has shaken the community in southern California. More than 1,000 of Guy's friends and neighbors have signed a petition calling for legislation on his behalf. 
   I hope you support this bill so that we can help Guy rebuild his life and continue to contribute to his community in the United States.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Tony Lara, a remarkable young man from El Salvador who has lived in the United States since he was 10 years old. 
   Tony's story is particularly compelling. In less than twenty years of this young man's life, Tony has faced one tragic setback after another. However, through his optimism, intelligence, and hard work, he has bravely confronted challenges that most would view as insurmountable. In spite of enormous odds, Tony has become a high school graduate, a California State Wrestling Champion and an inspiration to his community. 
   An unfortunate chapter in Tony's story is that he faces deportation and separation from his younger sister because at age nineteen, Tony is an orphan. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents. 
   Ten years ago, Tony Lara and his younger sister Olga were brought to the United States by their parents who were fleeing the civil war in El Salvador. That same year, Tony's mother was deported back to El Salvador. She tragically died in a drowning accident while trying to reenter the United States. Tony's father turned to drugs, abandoned his children and was eventually deported in 1994. He has not heard from him since. At age 11, Tony became a surrogate father to his younger sister. 
   Tony and his sister were taken in by an uncle who had neglected to care for them. Eventually, Tony's neighbors, Philip and Linda Bracken, invited the children to live with them. The Brackens later adopted Olga, who now has permanent residency in this country. The couple lacked the resources, however, to adopt Tony and at age 16, Tony was left without a home. 
   Unfortunately, the adults to which Tony turned for advice counseled against turning himself in to the Department of Children Services. They feared he could be deported and would never see his sister again. Tony could not bear losing the only family he had left; thus he remained on his own. 
   In 1996, Tony met his high school's wrestling coach, Terrence Fisher. Mr. Fisher knew little about Tony's circumstances, but he noticed his slight build and extreme sadness. When the coach had discovered Tony was homeless and hungry, he invited him to live with his family. Mr. Fisher also invited Tony to try out for the school's wrestling team. Although he had never wrestled before, Tony was truly a natural. 
   By his senior year, Tony had worked hard and captured the California state wresting championship for his age group and weight class. He had also excelled socially and academically. After Tony graduated from high school, he continued to win wrestling championships and has become a role model in his community. He is continuing his education by studying business at West Valley Occupational Center. 
   Tony has been featured on two television programs. In 1998, he was featured on an NBC news program called ``Beating the Odds,'' which was about young people of great achievement who have overcome enormous obstacles. Last year, Tony was featured on a Univision hour-long special program, which also spoke to Tony's special circumstances. 
   I can think of no one more deserving of permanent residency in this country. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached bill be entered into the record with this statement.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Coverdell-Feinstein Drug Kingpin bill, which is contained in modified form within this Intelligence Authorization Conference Report. 
   That bill, also co-sponsored by Senators LOTT, TORRICELLI, DEWINE, HELMS, CRAIG, GRAHAM and REID, is designed to strengthen the President's hand in combating foreign narcotics traffickers around the world. Senator COVERDELL and I have worked for months to answer questions about the bill, iron out remaining problems, and satisfy the concerns of the Clinton Administration over how the bill will work. 
   We and our staffs met with representatives from the White House, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the Department of State, the National Security Council, other Senate offices and many others during that time. I am gratified to report that we now have the support of this Administration, as well as both Houses of Congress. 
   Let me speak a bit about this provision and why it is so important. This  provision is patterned after an Executive Order issued by President Clinton in 1995, which targeted the assets of the powerful Colombian drug kingpins. 
   That Order expanded the International Emergency Economics Powers Act to include ``Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers.'' As issued, the President's Executive Order applies to four drug traffickers affiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal is to completely isolate the targeted drug traffickers. 
   The Executive Order blocks any financial, commercial and/or business dealings with any entity associated with the four named drug traffickers--to include criminal associates, associated family members, related businesses and financial accounts. 
   Under the Coverdell-Feinstein provision now contained in this Conference report--as under the President's Executive Order--the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would develop a list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers in consultation with the Department of Justice, the CIA and the Department of State. Now, this list can contain traffickers throughout the world, and not just in Colombia. 
   By focusing on the financial relationships between drug cartels and their associated business relationships, the Executive Order--and now this new provision--is directed toward the entities that are creating the drug problem in our country--the drug cartels. 
   Now, this provision will codify and expand that Presidential directive to include other foreign narcotics traffickers considered a threat to our national security--Colombia was a good start, and we believe it is time to set our sights elsewhere around the world. 
   The goal is to isolate targeted drug traffickers and their affiliated businesses by freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction and cutting off their ability to do business in the United States. 
   Under the Executive Order, more than 400 companies and individuals affiliated with drug trafficking have been targeted by the Treasury Department. 
   These entities are denied access to banking services in the U.S. and Colombia, and existing bank accounts have been shut down. 
   As a result, more than 400 Colombian accounts have been closed, affecting over 200 companies and individuals engaged in drug trafficking. 
   By February 1998, over 40 of these companies, with an estimated combined annual sales of over $200 million, had been forced out of business. 
   Drug cartels today are more powerful, more violent and have a far greater reach than traditional organized crime organizations ever had been in the past. And, I believe they pose a major threat to our national security. 
   Indeed, measured in dollar value, at least four-fifths of all illicit drugs consumed in the U.S. are of foreign origin, including virtually all the cocaine and heroin. 
   With the authority to reach countries beyond Colombia, the President can work to isolate major criminal drug syndicates around the world, and impose upon them and their associates a similar fate as that of the Cali cartel. 
   It is my hope that with new emphasis on this expanded authority, and with a concerted intelligence effort to develop sufficient data about the cartels and their associates, in this country and abroad, the United States will be able to work with our allies to expose, isolate, and cut off the major drug trafficking syndicates that pose a tremendous threat to our societies. 
   This crucial mission can only be accomplished together, and we must work together to see that our governments are properly equipped to carry it out successfully. 
   To that end, this amendment establishes clear procedures through which the various parts of our own government will be able to share information with their counterparts, and make recommendations to the President as to those cartels that represent the greatest risk to our nation. 
   Coordinated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department of Treasury, the expanded program will target new international drug cartels with the same successful financial choke holds that worked so well in Colombia. 
   And let me also be clear about one thing. Nothing in this provision should in any way be read to say that the United States Government should stop cooperating with other governments in the fight against drugs. 
   To the utmost extent possible, the United States under this provision should continue and even expand upon its current agreements with other nations in the fight against drugs. While valid concerns over the compromise of national security, sources and methods, or ongoing investigations must be taken into account, we must also make sure that we continue to work cooperatively with those governments also intent on solving this drug crisis. 
   This will not be an easy process, and the results will not be immediate. But over time, we hope that the flow of drugs across our borders will be diminished. 
   Before I yield the floor, I want to address one concern that has been raised about due process for American citizens under this bill. Some have expressed a concern that this bill would leave U.S. citizens without redress for blocked assets, in possible violation of their due process rights. Such an outcome is certainly not what we are trying to accomplish with this bill, and I have been assured by the Treasury Department that avenues of redress will remain open to United States Citizens. 
   According to Richard Newcomb, the Director of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the entity responsible for carrying out the provisions of this bill:  
   Even when assets are properly blocked under U.S. law, a U.S. citizen can petition OFAC for a license unblocking the U.S. Citizens interest in blocked assets. OFAC has a long-established policy of utilizing its licensing authority in sanctions programs to minimize adverse impact on U.S. persons while vigorously implementing the sanctions against targeted foreign persons.  
   Second, according to Newcomb, OFAC will have the ability under section 805(b) of this Act to completely unblock assets:  
   If the U.S. citizen believed that its interest in the foreign person's assets is mistakenly or wrongfully blocked, that U.S. citizen could petition OFAC to have the interest unblocked.  
   Finally, ``Also, as section 805(f) must be read to avoid any Constitutional problems, a U.S. citizen would not be precluded from that section from pursuing any Constitutional claims.'' 
   In other words, Mr. President, U.S. citizens are now, and will continue to be, offered significant protections against wrongful blocking or seizure of their assets. The Treasury Department has assured us that nothing in this bill will eliminate a U.S. citizen's absolute, Constitutional right to due process, and nothing in this bill attempts to do so. The clear purpose of the bill is to seek out foreign drug kingpins and cut off their access to the American economy. 
   I'd like to thank Senator COVERDELL for working so tirelessly with me on this bill, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting our efforts. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their tireless efforts on patent reform. I strongly support passage of S. 1798, which is included in this omnibus measure, because so many companies in California and across the nation depend on a strong and well-functioning patent system.  
   While S. 1798 will provide important protection for inventors and innovators and help reduce needless patent litigation, I do have some concerns regarding the compromise reached regarding the reexamination procedure set forth in Title VI. As I understand it, this section will reduce the burden of patent cases in our federal courts. However, we need to be sure that the procedure fully and fairly protects the rights of all parties, and some concerns about this process have been brought to my attention over the last few weeks. 
   Out of deference to the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and being sensitive to the compromise that the House reached, I did not seek amendments to this title of the bill. Furthermore, I feel strongly that the bill should move forward without further delay, so I support its final passage. This does not mean, however, that I believe we should cease to be concerned about how the new system will function. Accordingly, I would like to receive assurances from Chairman HATCH that we will keep a close eye on how well this new reexamination system works. In particular, I would like to request that the Committee obtain an interim report from the Patent and Trademark Office under the authority specified in section 606 of S. 1798 not later than 18 months after this bill becomes effective. I would also invite Chairman HATCH to hold a hearing to consider this information, and to obtain views from people who both supported and opposed this compromise system.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased the Senate is considering the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, to restore some of the unanticipated cuts in Medicare and Medicaid made in 1997 and I commend the Senate leadership, the Finance Committee, Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, and the Administration for their hard work in developing this bill. The bill includes several important provisions. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has been one of several factors threatening the overall stability of the health care system in California, which many believe to be on the verge of collapse. Today I will focus on eight provisions of the bill which are particularly important to California. 
   CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ERODING
   During the past few months, I have met with many California health care leaders who have convinced me that the Medicare and Medicaid cuts contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have undermined the financial stability of California's health care system. In the past 6 months, I have urged President Clinton, Secretary Shalala, and Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN to join me in addressing the impact the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is having on our nation's health care system. 
   California's health care system, in the words of a November 15th Wall Street Journal article, is a ``chaotic and discombobulated environment.'' It is stretched to the limit: 
   Thirty-seven California hospitals have closed since 1996, and up to 15 percent more may close by 2005. 
   By 2002, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will result in cuts of $5.2 billion for California hospitals. For California's two largest Catholic health systems, Catholic Healthcare West and St. Joseph's Health System, the loss amounts to over $842 million. 
   Over half of my state's hospitals lose money on hospital operations annually. 
   Hospitals have laid off staff. 
   California physician groups are failing at the rate of one a week, with 115 bankruptcies or closures since 1996. 
   Academic medical centers, which incur added costs unique to their mission, are facing margins reduced to zero and below. 
   The University of California's five medical centers will lose $225 million. 
   California hospitals are contending with the impact of BBA while facing a projected margin of negative 7.58 percent by 2002, compared to the national rate of negative 4 percent. 
   For rural California hospitals, because 40 percent of patients receive Medicare and 20 percent receive Medicaid, 69 percent lost money in 1998, according to the California Health Care Association. 
   In short, restoring Medicare cuts is crucial to stabilizing California's health delivery system. 
   HOSPITALS
   This bill contains several provisions that will help stabilize California's hospitals by restoring $400 million, according to preliminary estimates of the California Health Care Association. This bill clarifies that Congress' intent was not to impose a 5.7 percent cut in outpatient services, which restores $137  million to California, according to preliminary estimates by the California Health Care Association. Cancer hospitals are held harmless permanently. Since Medicare is a major payer for hospital care, improving payment rates and methods is a significant way to stop further closures and stabilize the system.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that commends and remembers events that transpired in Remy, France as its citizens honored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps pilot, Lieutenant Houston Braly. This inspiring story happened over fifty years ago, but its example of compassion and brotherhood remains in our hearts and minds. 
   On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. After three unsuccessful attack runs at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion. 
   Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and nearly all buildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its historic stained-glass windows were shattered. 
   It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly at only twenty-two years of age. 
   Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German authorities. 
   The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers continued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of punishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople. 
   Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, discovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization that would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a gesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds. 
   On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.'' 
   I know that my fellow senators will want to join me in commending the people of Remy for their kindness and recognize the comrades of Lt. Braly for their good will. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed at this point in the RECORD.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today is November 18. It has been almost 6 months since the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill and more than 5 months since the House followed suit with its own legislation. 
   Since that time, the students at Columbine High School went home. They spent a summer trying to heal the wounds of one of our Nation's greatest tragedies, and they returned to school more than 2 months ago. 
   Many of those students touched by the tragedy even came to Washington to plead for our help. Yet this body has done nothing to stop future incidents of gun violence and nothing to fix our broken juvenile justice system. 
   The Columbine incident shocked this Nation and, I believe, this Congress. Watching events unfold on television made even the most skeptical observers realize that something should be done about gun violence. We have witnessed a number of other instances of gun violence in the media since then. In Atlanta, we saw a depressed day trader gun down his family and colleagues. In California, a bigot killed a postal worker just because he was Filipino, and then wounded five others in the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills. Again, the pictures of those young children being led away from the scene of the tragedy were heart wrenching. 
   But since Columbine, more than 2,000 more children have died from gunshot wounds, about 12 to 13 a day, in incidents of gun violence that go relatively unreported and with outcomes not so public. These incidents will never stop until we do something to stop them. The death rate will never be diminished unless we stand up and take action. 
   When will the Congress realize that the time has come to move forward? The conference committee, which was appointed at the last minute before the August recess, has met but once, over 3 months ago. No issues have been resolved. The entire juvenile justice bill remains in doubt, in limbo. 
   Democrats in both Houses have been ready and willing to meet for months. Democrats are ready to discuss the merits of our differences and to reconcile them. The time has come to stop running away from the issue of gun violence. The time has come to enact some meaningful provisions to stem this tide of violence sweeping our schools and to institute some much-needed change to the system of juvenile justice in this Nation. 
   The Senate spent more than a week in May debating and voting on dozens of provisions to stem the tide of youth violence in this country and to try to curb the flood of guns reaching children and criminals. But still we have faced delay after delay, and the delays come in many forms--political maneuvering, parliamentary tactics; for example, my clip ban was blue slipped, and other tactics. 
   Enough is enough. It is time to come together to make some tough decisions and move forward with the Nation's business. No longer can we stand by, and I hope the Nation will not let us stand by, to allow the National Rifle Association to dictate the legislative needs of this Congress. The future of this bill rests squarely with the Republican leadership in both the House and  the Senate. They have said they want to make progress with our gun laws, and they have it within their power to do so. 
   The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill is not an overreaching statement of where we want to go with gun control. I, for example, believe we should have universal registration and licensing of firearms, and in the next session I will introduce my legislation. I believe we should allow the Federal Government to set safety and consumer standards for guns, and I believe we should ban outright possession of military-style assault weapons. But none of these measures were even discussed in the Senate debate. 
   The provisions, rather, are very small in our bill. They are reasonable, and they can make a difference in the lives of our children. None of them are controversial, and every one of them, by virtually every poll, has a dominant majority of the American people supporting them. Let me describe what I am talking about. 
   That bill contains just four commonsense provisions to address gun violence. Does anyone in this Nation truly believe juveniles should be able to buy assault weapons? The answer is going to be no. That is one provision in Senator ASHCROFT's bill which would prohibit juveniles from possessing assault weapons. 
   Does anyone in this country truly believe the children from Columbine who went to a gun show and bought two assault weapons as juveniles with no information, no data check, no nothing--does anyone believe that loophole should not be closed? I do not believe so. 
   In Memphis, TN, not too long ago, a 5-year-old took a pistol off his grandfather's bureau and brought it to kindergarten to kill the teacher because the teacher had given that child a timeout the day before. Stories are legion about children mistaking real guns for play guns and shooting their friends. 
   The third provision is simple. It would require a safety lock with every gun sold. Does anyone believe guns should not 
   be sold without safety locks? I do not believe so. 
   Finally, there is my provision which would plug a major loophole in the 1994 assault weapons legislation. That legislation, in fact, says you cannot today manufacture, transfer, sell, or possess a clip, drum, or strip of more than 10 bullets manufactured in the United States. That is the law today. The loophole is to permit the foreign importation of these clips, and they are coming into this country by the tens of millions with literally tens of thousands of them in drums of 250 rounds. They come in, as a matter of fact, from the United Kingdom, and they come in from 20 different countries throughout the world. 
   My provision would simply close that loophole and prohibit the importation. It actually passed the House by unanimous consent, and both the Speaker and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee have assured me personally that they see no problem with it and would support it. 
   These are the four provisions relating to guns. Other than that, this bill contains countless provisions to stem the tide of youth violence. I sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have worked on this bill. I have worked on it with Senator HATCH. Part of this bill is a gang abatement act. It provides a Federal helping hand to local law enforcement agencies to fight criminal street gangs that are now crossing State lines and moving into so many of the cities of our Nation. You, Mr. President, were mayor of a great city. You know this to be the fact. This is an important part of this legislation. 
   It also contains the James Guelff Body Armor Act which contains reforms to take body armor out of the hands of criminals and put it in the hands of police. It is named after a San Francisco police officer by the name of James Guelff who went to a call at the corner of Pine and California Streets and came across a Kevlar-clad sniper with thousands of rounds of ammunition and a number of guns. He had a .38 revolver. As he speed loaded his revolver, this officer was shot in the head and killed. It took 150 police officers to equal the firepower of one sniper clad in Kevlar with high-powered weapons. 
   The Senate bill also establishes a new $700 million juvenile justice block grant program for States and localities, representing a significant increase in Federal aid to the States for juvenile crime control programs. These programs include additional law enforcement and juvenile court personnel, juvenile detention facilities, and prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble before they turn to crime, something both of us know, as past mayors, is vital if we are going to reverse juvenile crime in this country. 
   The bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, 
   and it implements a series of graduated penalties that ensure that subsequent offenses are treated with increasing severity, so that if you are going to be a continuing offender, the sentences are going to reflect that. 
   The bill also reforms juvenile record systems through improved record keeping and increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and schools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in my State, California, can know if they have committed violent offenses in Arizona, or a juvenile in your State, Ohio, had committed violent offenses in another surrounding State. 
   It extends Federal sentences for juveniles who commit serious violent crimes. 
   All of these commonsense provisions now remain in legislative purgatory. I am here to urge, once again, the majority to proceed with the conference, come to a compromise, and move this bill. That compromise should preserve intact the Senate-passed gun control legislation--four targeted measures--commonsense, reasonable; I call them no-brainers. Every poll shows a dominant majority of Americans supporting each of these. And they represent together a bare minimum of what we should do this year to stem the gun violence that is increasingly common on our streets and in our schools. 
   School has now been back in session for several months, and this Congress is about to adjourn for the year. So far, it looks as if we are going to be receiving a failing grade from the American people. There is still time to buckle down, to do the work, to pass the test that this Nation gave us so many months ago. What a wonderful Christmas gift it would be for the people of America. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator BOXER in introducing a bill to designate the United States Post Office located at 14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California, as the ``Joseph Ileto Post Office.'' This post office would be designated in memory and in celebration of the life of Joseph Santos Ileto, the Filipino American postal worker who was brutally gunned down during his postal route in August by Buford Furrow, Jr., a white supremacist. Only hours earlier, this same assailant opened fire on the North Valley Jewish Community Center, wounding three young children, one teenager, and one elderly woman. 
   Joseph Ileto touched many lives. He was a kind-hearted, intelligent man who gave so much to those he loved and even to those he did not know. He was known for his unselfishness and his willingness to give a helping hand to anyone in need. In fact, the day Joseph Ileto was killed, he was filling in for another mail carrier, as he had done so many times before. His life and death exemplify the ultimate sacrifice of public service, which we too often take for granted. As a U.S. Postal Service employee, he served our nation with honor and dignity and died doing his job. 
   My heart goes out to the Ileto family, who is grieving over the death of their son, brother, and friend. Despite the sadness of their loss, they can be proud that the life and spirit of Joseph Ileto lives on. His death only confirms the urgency in which we as a community must take a strong stand against hate crimes and racism. The number of hate crimes in the U.S. has increased during the last five years, and the time is now to have dialogue and pass meaningful legislation to address this issue. As a first step, it is my hope that we can expedite passage this bill, to remember and honor the life of Joseph Ileto.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the San Diego Regional Printing Facility of the John H. Harland Company. 
   The John H. Harland Company was founded in 1923, and is the second largest check printer in the United States. 
   The John H. Harland Company opened its doors in California in 1969. Today, the San Diego Regional Printing Facility employs 249 employees and fills 98,900 orders per week. The jobs this facility has brought to our state throughout the years have been of great benefit to California. 
   I offer my congratulations to the John H. Harland Company and its employees on the occasion of its 30th Anniversary and wish it great, continued success in the future.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is submitted on behalf of Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont and myself. This is the same amendment that passed the Senate last year by voice vote. It is an important amendment, which is why I wish to do it today and ask for a rollcall vote. 
   Last year it was deleted in conference. I believe it will suffer the same fate today if it were simply accepted. I note that the managers have agreed to accept the amendment. I particularly want the Senator from Iowa to know that I am very grateful for that accommodation. However, I run the risk in allowing it to be accepted that it is again expunged in conference. 
   This amendment requires the Federal Reserve Board to investigate the practice of issuing credit cards indiscriminately and inappropriately and to take necessary action to ensure that consumer credit is not extended recklessly or in a manner that encourages practices which cause consumer bankruptcies. 
   One part of the amendment, a brief paragraph, is a sense of the Senate that finds that certain lenders may offer credit to consumers indiscriminately and don't take steps to ensure that consumers have the capacity to repay the resulting debt, possibly encouraging consumers to even accumulate additional debt. We all know that to be true. The amendment then goes on to say that the resulting consumer debt may increasingly be a major contributing factor to consumer bankruptcies. 
   This amendment would authorize the Federal Reserve Board to conduct a study of industry practices of soliciting and extending credit indiscriminately without taking those steps that are prudent to ensure consumers are capable of repaying that debt. Within 1 year of enactment, the Federal Reserve Board would make a public report on its findings regarding the credit industry's indiscriminate solicitation and extension of credit. 
   The amendment then would allow the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations that would require additional disclosures to consumers and to take any other actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the Board finds necessary to ensure responsible industry-wide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency. 
   Why this amendment? Why is this amendment needed? This amendment directly addresses one of the major causes of personal bankruptcies: bad consumer credit card debt. The typical family filing for bankruptcy in 1998 owed more than 1 1/2 times its annual income in short-term, high-interest debt. This means that the average family in bankruptcy, with a median income of just over $17,500, had $28,955 in credit card and other short-term, high-interest debt--almost double the income of debt. 
   Studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the FDIC, and independent economists all link the rise in personal bankruptcies directly to the rise in consumer debt. As consumer debt has risen to an all-time high, so have consumer bankruptcies. Any meaningful bankruptcy reform I think must address irresponsible actions of certain segments of the credit card industry because, after all, this is the major problem that is exacerbating bankruptcy and increasing the number of filings. 
   Last year, the credit card industry sent out a record 3.45 billion unsolicited offers. That is 30 solicitations for credit cards to every household in America. The number of solicitations jumped 15 percent from the last time I did this amendment to this time I am doing this amendment. So instead of slowing down irresponsible offers of credit to people who cannot possibly repay that credit, they have sped it up. 
   There are over 1 billion credit cards in circulation, a dozen credit cards for every household in this country. Three-quarters of all households have at least one credit card. Credit card debt has doubled between 1993 and 1997, to $422 billion from just over $200 billion. 
   During this 2-year debate on this bankruptcy bill, which I support, my staff has contacted numerous credit card issuers. The overwhelming majority of these companies do not check the income of the consumers being solicited. In other words, credit card issuers have no idea whether persons to whom they issued credit cards have the means to pay their bill each month. 
   One of my constituents from Lakewood, CA, wrote, and this really describes this aptly:  
   What really bugs me about this is that credit card companies send out these solicitations for their plastic cards, and then when they get burned, they start crying foul. They want all kinds of laws passed to protect them from taking hits when it's their own practices that caused the problem.  
   There is a real element of truth in this. This amendment will not affect any responsible lender. It will not affect the vast majority of the credit card industry who responsibly check consumer credit history before issuing or preapproving credit 
   cards. 
   Representatives of large credit card issuers have assured me and my staff that they do not provide credit cards to consumers without a thorough credit check. However, I note that major credit cards, such as Visa or MasterCard, do not require banks who issue their cards to check credit history. That is a bona fide area at which an investigation and a study should take a look. Is this a good practice, not to check the bank who issues your card under your auspices and see that they also check the creditworthiness of the individual? 
   This amendment would affect lenders who fail to even inquire into the consumer's ability to pay or those who specifically target consumers who cannot repay the balances. It was news to me that there is a whole category of companies out there who actually go after people who are overcome with credit card debt and offer them more credit cards to repay that debt. A growing segment of the credit industry, known as subprime lenders, increasingly searches for risk borrowers who they know will make inappropriately low minimum monthly payments and carry large balances from month to month and have to pay extraordinarily high interest rates. 
   This kind of lending has become the fastest growing, most profitable subset of consumer lending. Although losses are substantial, interest rates of 18 percent to 40 percent on credit card debt make this lending profitable. Many of these often relatively unsophisticated borrowers do not realize that minimum monthly payments just put them deeper in a hole which, in many cases, leads to bankruptcy. 
   I have somebody close to me who is in that situation and has been in that situation from 1991 to the present day with six or eight credit cards, does not have the income to repay them, and all this individual has had is mounting interest payments and can never get to the principal of the debt. No matter how this individual responds within his or her capabilities, he or she cannot possibly pay off the debt. I even stepped in and made an offer to the credit card companies to repay the debt with a modicum of interest attached to it for this individual and was turned down. They said they made an offer to settle and they rejected the offer, they withdrew the offer of settlement. 
   Industry analysts estimate that using a typical minimum monthly payment rate on a credit card in order to pay off a $2,500 balance--that is a balance of just $2,500--assuming the consumer never uses the card to charge  anything else ever again, would take 34 years to pay off the balance. That is the situation in which people find themselves. 
   It is my belief that this is irresponsible. What we are asking is the Federal Reserve do a study, an investigation to see if they agree this is irresponsible. 
   So this is the core concept. 
   Oh, let me make one other point. On the situation I just indicated to you, that somebody who had that balance of $2,500 never used the card to charge anything else again, it would take 34 years to pay off that balance. Total payments would exceed 300 percent of the principal. 
   So what I have found out is, there are people who are needy, who succumb to these credit cards, who engage in not just one credit card with $10,000, but five or six or seven or eight, and maybe have an income of $17,000 or $15,000 a year. They make these purchases, they get into trouble, and they can never pay off their debt. So, yes, bankruptcy looms as the only alternative. 
   To tighten up their obligations to pay back the debt--which I am in agreement of doing--and yet not evaluate whether these policies of lending are as responsible as they should be is absolutely wrong. 
   So for the second time in 2 years, I offer this amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays in the hopes that the amendment will be agreed to and will remain in the bill in conference.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, to sum up my amendment, what this bankruptcy bill is all about is encouraging debtor responsibility--in other words, to the extent that an individual possibly can, they should repay their debt. That is one side of it. 
   I think to the extent the credit industry can be responsible, you need to have a balance between the two. Right now, there is not a balance between the two. I think we all know of people who have a number of credit cards who do not have the income even to pay back the minimum debt or the minimum monthly payment plus interest over a period of time. 
   Let me give an example. If you have a $1,500 debt and your minimum monthly payment is $25 and you have no late fees, no new purchases, at 19.8-percent interest, it takes 282 months to pay that debt off. I know people in this situation who shouldn't have credit cards, who should have been checked out, who have six, who are going into bankruptcy because they didn't understand this simple concept. 
   What the amendment before you would do is ask the Federal Reserve to do a study of lending practices in this area and make public their findings, and also have the ability to set new regulations if they believe those regulations are warranted. 
   This amendment was passed a year ago by a voice vote. It was removed in conference. The amendment would be accepted. My concern is that it would again be deleted in conference. Therefore, I have asked for the yeas and nays. I am hopeful this Senate will go on record as supporting this study by the Federal Reserve. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in June, joined by Senators REID, BOXER, and BRYAN, I introduced the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (S. 1192) which would jump start the process of cleaning up Lake Tahoe. 
   Lake Tahoe, one of the largest, deepest, clearest lakes in the world is in the midst of an economic crisis. Water clarity is declining at the rate of more than 1 foot each year; more than 1/3 of the trees in the forest are either dead or dying; and sediment and algae-nourishing phosphorus and nitrogen continue to flow into the lake from a variety of sources. 
   Over the last few months, I worked with the Congressmen from the Tahoe areas, Representative DOOLITTLE and Representative GIBBONS to craft a House version of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act that could garner bipartisan support. I am pleased that we've been able to build on S. 1192 and develop a compromise bill which I am introducing today. 
   Like S. 1192, this bill first and foremost authorizes the necessary funding to clean up and restore Lake Tahoe. This bill includes two major changes: 
   First, to address the problem of MTBE in the Lake Tahoe basin, I added a section that provides $1 million to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and local utility districts to clean up contaminated wells and surface water. 
   Second, to help local governments who would otherwise be burdened by relocation costs that may be needed to clean up the basin, this bill promises that the federal government will pay 2/3 of any needed relocation costs. 
   I believe these provisions improve on the original bill and increase the breadth of support for this bill. 
   The bill requires the Forest Service to develop an annual priority list of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $200 million dollars over 10 years to the forest service to implement these projects on federal lands. The list must include projects that will improve water quality, forest health, soil conservation, air quality, and fish and wildlife habitat around the lake. 
   In developing the environmental restoration priority list, the Forest Service must rely on the best available science, and consider projects that local governments, businesses, and environmental groups have targeted as top priorities. The Forest Service also must consult with local community leaders. 
   The bill requires the Forest Service to give special attention on its priority list to five key activities: acquisition of environmentally sensitive land from willing sellers, erosion and sediment control, fire risk reduction, cleaning up MTBE contamination, and traffic and parking management, including promotion of public transportation. 
   The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act also requires that an additional $100 million be authorized over 10 years be as payments to local governments for erosion  control activities on non-federal lands. These payments will help local governments conduct soil conservation and erosion mitigation projects, restore wetlands and stream environmental zones, and plant native vegetation to filter out sediment and debris. 
   I spent my childhood at Lake Tahoe, but I had not been back for a number of years until I returned for the 1997 Presidential summit with President Clinton. I saw things I had never seen before at Lake Tahoe. 
   I saw the penetration of MTBE in the water and learned that 30 percent of the South Lake Tahoe water supply has been eliminated by MTBE. I observed gasoline spread over the water 
   surface. I noticed that a third of the magnificent forest that surrounds the lake was dead or dying. I saw major land erosion problems that were bringing all kinds of sediment into the lake and which had effectively cut the lake's clarity by thirty feet since the last time I had visited. And then I learned that the experts believe that in 10 years the clouding of the amazing crystal water clarity would be impossible to reverse and in 30 years it would be lost forever. 
   The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that it will cost $900 million over the next 10 years to restore the Lake. 
   For me, that was a call to action and prompted me to sponsor this bill which will authorize $300 million of Federal moneys on a matching basis over 10 years for environmental restoration projects at Lake Tahoe to preserve the region's water quality and forest health. Put simply, this crown jewel deserves the attention, and the fact that the federal government owns 77 percent of that troubled area makes the responsibility all so clear. 
   Through funding over the past few years we have already begun to make some early strides such as the purchase of important pieces of land like the Sunset Ranch and the planning for a Coordinated Transit System. 
   Already, California and Nevada have begun contributing their portion of the restoration efforts. 
   California is in the second year of a ten year $275 million commitment through the California Tahoe Conservancy, Caltrans, and the Parks Service. 
   Nevada has authorized the issuance of bonds that will constitute an $82 million contribution over an 8-year period. 
   Local governments and private industry have also agreed to commit $300 million. The Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a coalition of 18 businesses and environmental groups, including Placer County, El Dorado County, the city of South Lake Tahoe, Douglass County in Nevada, and Washoe County in Nevada have all agreed. This is an extraordinary commitment for a region with only 50,000 year-round residents. 
   President Clinton took an important first step in 1997 when he held an environmental summit at Lake Tahoe and promised $50 million over 2 years for restoration activities around the lake. Unfortunately, the President's commitments lasted for only 2 years, so important areas like land acquisition and road decommissioning were not funded at the levels the President tried to accomplish. What is needed is a more sustained, long-term effort, and one that will meet the federal government's $300 million responsibility to save the environment at Lake Tahoe. 
   The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will build upon the President's commitment to Lake Tahoe and authorize full funding for a new environmental restoration program at the lake. 
   I am also grateful to the Lake Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a local consensus group of 18 businesses and environmental groups, who has worked extremely hard on this bill. 
   Thanks in large part to their work, the bill has strong, bipartisan support from nearly every major group in the Tahoe Basin. 
   The bottom line is that time is running out for Lake Tahoe. We have 10 years to do something major or the water quality deterioration is irreversible. 
   I am hopeful that Congress will move quickly to consider the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. I urge my colleagues to join Senator REID, Senator BOXER, Senator BRYAN, Congressman DOOLITTLE, Congressman GIBBONS, Congresswoman ESHOO, and me in preserving this national treasure for generations to come.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the nomination of my friend and former colleague, Carol Moseley-Braun, to be Ambassador to New Zealand. 
   I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Moseley-Braun for six years and I know her to be a dedicated, caring, intelligent, and hard-working public servant. I am confident she will carry these qualities to her new post in New Zealand. 
   Prior to her service in the United States Senate, Senator Moseley-Braun distinguished herself as a member of the Illinois Legislature and as the Recorder of Deeds for Cook County, Illinois. From 1973 to 1977 she also served as Assistant District Attorney in the Northern District of Illinois. 
   In 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun made history by becoming the first African American female elected to the United States Senate. As a United States Senator, she dedicated herself to issues that would make a difference in the lives of ordinary Americans: increased funding for education, HMO reform and family and medical leave. 
   Following her service in the Senate, Senator Moseley-Braun continued to stay involved in the issues that mean most to her and become a consultant to the United States Department of Education. 
   On October 8, 1999, President Clinton presented her with a new challenge and nominated her to be United States Ambassador to New Zealand. I am sure her tenure as Ambassador will only add to this long and distinguished career. 
   The overwhelming and bi-bipartisan vote in favor of her nomination by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should answer any critic that questions her qualifications to be the next ambassador to New Zealand. 
   New Zealand is an important ally and a vital part of our relations in the Asia-Pacific region. We need an ambassador who will be able to handle all aspects of United States-New Zealand relations and best represent our interests. Carol Moseley-Braun is the right person for that job. 
   Mr. President, I was proud to serve with Senator Moseley-Braun, I am proud to call her a friend and I am proud to support her nomination to be Ambassador to New Zealand.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Japanese Imperial Army Disclosure Act of 1999. 
   This legislation will require the disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act classified records and documents in the possession of the U.S. Government regarding chemical and biological experiments carried out by Japan during the course of the Second World War. 
   Let me preface my statement by making clear that none of the remarks that I will make in discussing this legislation should be considered anti-Japanese. I was proud to serve as the President of the Japan Society of Northern California, and I have done everything I can to foster, promote, and develop positive relations between Japan, the United States, China, and other states of the region. The legislation I introduce today is eagerly sought by a large number of Californians who believe that there is an effort to keep information about possible atrocities and experiments with poisonous gas and germ warfare from the pubic record. 
   One of my most important goals in the Senate is to see the development of a Pacific Rim community that is peaceful and stable. I have worked towards this end for over twenty years. I introduce this legislation to try to heal wounds that still remain, 
   particularly in California's Chinese-American community. 
   This legislation is needed because although the Second World War ended over fifty years ago--and with it Japan's chemical and biological weapons experimentation programs--many of the records and documents regarding Japan's wartime activities remain classified and hidden in U.S. Government archives and repositories. Even worse, according to some scholars, some of these records are now being inadvertently destroyed. 
   For the many U.S. Army veteran's who were subject to these experiments in POW camps, as well as the many Chinese and other Asian civilians who were subjected to these experiments, the time has long since passed for the full truth to come out. 
   According to information which was revealed at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, starting in 1931, when the so-called ``Mukden incident'' provided Japan the pretext for the occupation of Manchuria, the Japanese Imperial Army conducted numerous biological and chemical warfare tests on Chinese civilians, Allied POWs, and possibly Japanese civilians as well. 
   Perhaps the most notorious of these experiments were carried out under General Ishii Shiro, a Japanese Army surgeon, who, by the late 1930's had built a large installation in China with germ breeding facilities, testing  grounds, prisons to hold the human test subjects, facilities to make germ weapons, and a crematorium for the final disposal of the human test victims. General Ishii's main factory operated under the code name Unit 731. 
   Based on the evidence revealed at the War Crimes trials, as well as subsequent work by numerous scholars, there is little doubt that Japan conducted these chemical and biological warfare experiments, and that the Japanese Imperial Army attempted to use chemical and biological weapons during the course of the war, included reports of use of plague on the cities of Ningbo and Changde. 
   And, as a 1980 article by John Powell in the Bulletin of Concerned Asia Scholars found,  
   Once the fact had been established that Ishii had used Chinese and others as laboratory tests subjects, it seemed a fair assumption that he also might have used American prisoners, possibly British, and perhaps even Japanese.  
   Some of the records of these activities were revealed during the Tokyo War Crimes trials, and others have since come to light under Freedom of Information Act requests, but many other documents, which were transferred to the U.S. military during the occupation of Japan, have remained hidden for the past fifty years. 
   And it is precisely for this reason that this legislation is needed: The world is entitled to a full and compel record of what did transpire. 
   Sheldon Harris, Professor of History Emeritus at California State university Northridge wrote to me on October 7 of this year that:  
   In my capacity as an academic Historian, I can testify to the difficulty researchers have in unearthing documents and personal testimony concerning these war crimes *.*.*. Here in the United States, despite the Freedom of Information Act, some archives remain closed to investigators *.*.*. Moreover, ``sensitive documents--as defined by archivists and FOIA officers--are at the moment being destroyed.  
   Professor Sheldon's letter goes on to discuss three examples of the destruction of documents relating to chemical and biological warfare experiments that he is aware of: At Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and at the Pentagon. 
   This legislation establishes, within 60 days after the enactment of the act, the Japanese Imperial Army Records Interagency Working Group, including representation by the Department of State and the Archivist of the United States, to locate, identify, and recommend for declassification all Japanese Imperial Army records of the United States. 
   This Interagency Work Group, which will remain in existence for three years, is to locate, identify, inventory, recommend for classification, and make available to the public all classified Imperial Army records of the United States. It is to do so in coordination with other agencies, and to submit a report to Congress describing its activities. 
   It is my belief that the establishment of such an Interagency Working Group is the best way to make sure that the documents which need to be declassified will be declassified, and that this process will occur in an orderly and expeditious manner. 
   This legislation also includes exceptions which would allow the Interagency Working Group to deny release of records on the basis of: 1. Records which may unfairly invade an individual's privacy; 2. Records which adversely affect the national security or intelligence capabilities of the United States; 3. Records which might ``seriously or demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a foreign government''; and, 4. Records which might contribute to the development of chemical or biological capabilities. 
   My purpose in introducing this legislation is to help those who were victimized by these experiments and, with the adage ``the truth shall set you free'' in mind, help build a more peaceful Asian-Pacific community for the twenty-first century. 
   First, the declassification and release of this material will help the victims of chemical and biological warfare experimentation carried out by the Japanese Army during the Second World War, as well as their families and descendants, gain information about what occurred to them fifty years ago. If old wounds are to heal, there must be a full accounting of what happened. 
   Second, and perhaps just as importantly, this legislation is intended to create an environment of honest dialogue and discussion in the Asia-Pacific region, so that the countries and people of the region can move beyond the problems that have plagued us for the past century, and work together to build a peaceful and prosperous Asian-Pacific community in the next century. 
   If the countries of Asia are to build a peaceful community it is necessary that we deal fully, fairly, and honestly with the past. It is only by doing so that we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and build a more just world for the future. 
   Indeed, as Rabbi Abraham Cooper has remarked, ``Since the end of World War II, professed neutral nations like Sweden and Switzerland have had the courage to take a painful look back at their World War II record; can Japan be allowed to do anything less?'' 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I met with Alan Stepakoff, the father of six-year old Joshua, who was among five victims--three children ages 5 and 6; one 16-year old teenager and a 68-year old adult--gunned down at a Los Angeles Jewish community center last August by Buford Furrow, Jr., a white supremacist. Fortunately, the son and the four other victims survived the shooting and are on their way to recovery. Unfortunately, within minutes of this tragic shooting, the Nation learned that the same assailant had murdered in cold blood U.S. Postal Service carrier Joseph Ileto, a Filipino American, on account of his race. 
   This episode is but one of a growing list of hate crimes targeting places once believed to be safe havens--including schools, synagogues, churches, community centers. This incident is a grim reminder of how hate can provoke violence against the young and innocent. Unless we address this hatred and violence in our communities immediately and unequivocally, the list of such horrific events will certainly grow. 
   We have before us legislation that would address this growing blight on our society: the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This important legislation was introduced by my colleague Senator KENNEDY and adopted by the Senate as part of Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act. 
   Unfortunately, the measure was stripped from the first Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill presented to the President. I urge my colleagues to insist on this provision's inclusion in the next such bill. 
   This legislation is urgently needed to compensate for two limitations in the current law. First, even in the most blatant cases of racial, ethnic, or religious violence, no federal jurisdiction exists unless the victim was targeted while exercising one of six federally protected activities--attending a public school or college; participating in a service or program sponsored by a state or local government; applying for or engaging in employment; serving as juror in a state court; traveling or using a facility of interstate commerce; and enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public accommodation. 
   These limitations have led to acquittals in several of the cases in which the Department of Justice has determined a need to assert federal jurisdiction and has limited the ability of federal law enforcement officials to work with state and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of many incidents of brutal, hate-motivated violence. 
   A second limitation in current law is that it provides no coverage whatsoever for violent hate crimes committed because of bias based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. As a result, federal authorities cannot prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others based on these characteristics. This is especially disturbing given the fact that according to the FBI, crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked third in reported hate crimes in 1998, registering 1,260 or 15.6 percent of all reported incidents. Unfortunately, there are those who would stop short of supporting this important legislation because it extends protections to those targeted on account of their sexual orientation. 
   The hate crimes legislation introduced this year would remedy would expand the legislation I authored in 1994, which provided a bifurcated trial and enhanced penalties for felonies spawned by hate that took place either on federal land or in pursuance of a federally protected right (such as voting or attending a public school). 
   The Hate Crimes Protection Act broadens federal jurisdiction to cover all violent crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. It would also include sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of protected categories within current federal hate crime law, provided there is a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. 
   At the same time, federal involvement would only come into play if the Attorney General certifies that federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. In recent years, the existing federal hate crimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases where the state criminal justice system did not achieve a just result. 
   For many years I have been deeply concerned about hate 
   crimes and the immeasurable impact they have on victims, their families and our communities. As I have previously mentioned, in 1993 I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in 1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Today, I believe the Hate Crimes legislation will build on this effort by modifying the current laws to allow the federal government to provide the vital assistance to states in investigating of crimes of this magnitude. 
   Sadly, hate crimes are becoming too commonplace in America. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 1998, 7,775 hate crime incidents were reported in the United States and 9,722 victims. Of that total, 4,321 or 58 percent of the crimes were committed on account of the victim's race. More than 3,660 victims of anti-Black crimes; 1,003 victims of anti-White crimes, 620 victims of anti-Hispanic crimes; and 372 victims of anti-Asian/Pacific Islander crimes. 
   In that same year, 1,390 or roughly 16.0 percent of the victims were targeted because of their religious affiliation. The number of anti-Jewish incidents is second only to those against blacks and far exceeds offenses against all other religious groups combined. Moreover, while by most accounts anti-Semitism in America has declined dramatically over the years, the level of violence is escalating. 
   Civil rights groups as well as federal and State authorities agree that in the last five years, reported hate crimes have increased annually, from 5,932 in 1994 to 7,755 in 1998. As of 1998, four States still do not collect hate crime data. Yet, even if all States were reporting these incidents, it would be difficult to gauge the true extent of the hate crime problem in this country because bias-motivated crimes typically are under reported by both law enforcement agencies and victims. 
   And while these crimes have become more numerous, they have also become more violent. Monitoring groups have observed a shift from racially-motivated property crimes, such as spray painting, defacement and graffiti, to personal crimes such as assault, threat and harassment. On a national scale, according to FBI statistics, almost 7 out of 10 hate crimes are directed against people. Nonhate crimes, by  contrast, are directed against people only 11 percent of the time. 
   This legislation is long overdue. Looking back on this year alone, one might recall the litany of news stories describing a murderous rampage at a school in Littleton, Colorado; or the drive-by shooting attacks on Jews, an African-American, and Asian-Americans in Chicago, Illinois; or the two pipe-bomb explosions at the predominantly African American Florida A&M University; the brutal murders of two gay men in California; or the torching of synagogues in California; all despicable acts of virulent hatred. 
   We should work to give our citizens protection from those who would do them harm simply based upon their race, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. Enactment of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act would send a message to our nation and the world that the singling out of an individual based on any of these characteristics will not go unnoticed or unpunished. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to enact this important legislation prior the end of this session.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator JAMES INHOFE of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, in introducing a bill, S. 1886, to allow the governor of a state to waive the oxygenate content requirement for reformulated or clean-burning gasoline. The bill also requires U.S. EPA to conduct a study on whether voluntary standards to prevent releases of MTBE from underground tanks are necessary. 
   This is the fifth bill I have introduced in this Congress to address the widespread contamination of drinking water by MTBE in my state. I do this in hopes that this bill will be a straightforward solution to a very serious problem--MTBE detections in ground and surface water in my state and at lest 41 other states. 
   The Clean Air Act requires that cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline (RFG) be sold in areas with the worst violations of ozone standards: Los Angeles, San Diego, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, Sacramento. (In addition, some states and areas have opted to use reformulated gasoline as way to achieve clean air.) Second, the Act prescribes a formula for reformulated gasoline, including the requirement that reformulated gasoline contain 2.0 percent oxygen, by weight. 
   In response to this requirement, refiners have put the oxygenate MTBE in over 85 percent of reformulated gasoline now in use. MTBE stands for methyl tertiary butyl ether. The problem is that increasingly, MTBE is being detected in drinking water. MTBE is a known animal carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen, according to U.S. EPA. It has a very unpleasant odor and taste, as well. 
   The Inhofe-Feinstein bill, S. 1886, would allow governors, upon 
   notification to U.S. EPA, to waive the 2.0% oxygenate requirement, as long as the gasoline meets the other requirements in the law for reformulated gasoline. 
   On July 27, the U.S. EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline recommended that the 2 percent oxygenate requirement be ``removed in order to provide flexibility to blend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.'' In addition, the panel agreed that ``the use of MTBE should be reduced substantially.'' Importantly, the panel recommended that ``Congress act quickly to clarify federal and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline additives that pose a threat to drinking water supplies.'' 
   This bill, while not totally repealing the 2 percent oxygenate requirement, moves us in that direction. It gives states that choose to meet clean air requirements without oxygenates to do so. It allows states that choose an oxygenate, such as ethanol, to do so. Areas required to use reformulated gasoline for cleaner air will still be required to use it. The gasoline will have a different but clean formulation. Areas will continue to have to meet clean air standards. 
   MTBE has contaminated groundwater at over 10,000 sites in California, according to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Of 10,972 groundwater sites sampled, 39 percent had MTBE, says the state Department of Health Services. Of 765 surface water sources sampled, 287 or 38% had MTBE. 
   Nationally, one EPA-funded study found, of 34 states, MTBE was present more than 20 percent of the time in 27 states. A U.S. Geological Survey report had similar findings. An October 1999 Congressional Research Service analysis concluded that 41 states have had MTBE detections in water. 
   In California, Governor Davis concluded that MTBE ``poses a significant risk to California's environment'' and directed that MTBE be phased out in California by December 31, 2002. There is not a sufficient supply of ethanol or other oxygenates to fully replace MTBE in California, without huge gas price spikes and gasoline supply disruptions. In addition, California can make clean-burning gas without oxygenates.  Therefore, California is in the impossible position of having to meet a federal requirement that is (1) contaminating the water and (2) is not necessary to achieve clean air. 
   On April 12, 1999, Governor Davis asked U.S. EPA for a waiver of the 2% oxygenate requirement. I too wrote U.S. EPA--on May 18, 1999; December 3, 1998; September 29, 1998; September 28, 1998; September 14, 1998; November 3, 1997; September 24, 1997; April 22, 1997; and April 11, 1997. I have met with EPA officials several times and have talked directly to Administrator Carol Browner. To date, EPA has not granted California a waiver of the two percent. Again, today I call on EPA to act. In the meantime, I will continue to urge Congress to act. 
   Time is of the essence. California Governor Davis is phasing out MTBE in our state, but the federal law requiring 2 percent oxygenates remains, putting our state in an untenable position. Refiners needs a long lead time to retool their facilities and time is growing short. 
   A major University of California study released last year concluded that MTBE provides ``no significant air quality benefit'' but that its use poses ``the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially ground water. .....'' Oxygenates, say the experts, are not necessary for reformulated gasoline. 
   California has developed a gasoline formula that provide flexibility and provides clean air. Called the ``predictive model,'' it guarantees clean-burning RFG gas with oxygenates, with less than 2 percent oxygenates and with no oxygenates. Several refiners, including Chevron and Tosco, are selling MTBE-free gas in California, for example, in the Lake Tahoe area. 
   Under S. 1886, air standards would still have to be met and gasoline would have to meet all other requirements of the federal reformulated gasoline program, for example, the limits on benzene, heavy metals, emission of oxides of nitrogen. 
   This is a minimal bill that will give California and other states the relief they need from a unwarranted, unnecessary requirement. It will allow states that want oxygenates in their gasoline to use them and those that do not to not use them. 
   The bill does not undo the Clean Air Act. The bill does not degrade air quality. 
   Importantly, it can stop the contamination of drinking water in may state by MTBE.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the untimely death of Sacramento Mayor Joe Serna. This past Sunday, November 7, 1999, the City of Sacramento and the State of California lost an inspirational public servant and a great statesman. The death of Mayor Serna represents a loss for all of those who had the honor to know him, and for the entire City of Sacramento. 
   Mayor Serna had a distinguished public career, culminating in the election as Mayor of our State's Capital City in 1992. He served his country and his community as an educator, Peace Corps worker and public servant. He was a man of compassionate spirit, dedicated ideals and principled acts. 
   Mayor Serna's accomplishments, both personally and professionally, are many. Here are a few highlights: 
   1966--Earned his Bachelor's degree in Social Science and Government at California State University, Sacramento. 
   1966--Earned his Master's degree in Political Science at University of California, Davis. 
   1966--Served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala. 
   1969--Joined the faculty at California State University, Sacramento. 
   1975--Served as Education Advisor to then-Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally. 
   1981--Elected to the Sacramento City Council, where he would serve 11 years. 
   1991--Received the Distinguished Faculty Award. 
   1992--Elected as Mayor of Sacramento. 
   1995--Received the Economic Development Leadership Award by the National Council for Urban Economic Development. 
   1996--Reelected as Mayor of Sacramento. 
   1998--Led the effort for the redevelopment of downtown Sacramento. 
   1998--Received an honorary doctorate degree from Golden Gate University. 
   I have known Mayor Serna for many years, and he was a visionary for Sacramento and the region. 
   Mayor Serna led California's Capital City toward a more positive and prosperous direction. He was extremely dedicated to the economic revitalization and redevelopment of Sacramento. Under his leadership, the Sacramento City Council helped to revitalize the downtown community, the region's heart and center. He appointed the first Council of Economic Advisors to help frame the City's economic agenda. In addition, Mayor Serna assembled a negotiating team that preserved the Sacramento Kings, the region's National Basketball Association Team, when the King's owners threatened to move the team out of town. 
   Mayor Serna was not only an honorable mayor, he was also a role model to the Latino community and an inspiration to all Californians. He was the first Latino elected as mayor of one of California's major cities, exemplifying the success that one can attain through education, hard work, and commitment--regardless of ethnicity. I believe Mayor Serna transcended ethnic politics without every losing sight of his ethnic background and his humble beginnings. 
   Mayor Serna grew up working in the fields of San Joaquin County. In the early 1960's he was an activist with the United Farm Workers, fighting for farm workers and for disadvantaged people. He went on to earn his bachelor's degree in Social Science and his master's degree in Political Science. He later entered the Peace Corps to serve the people in Guatemala as a community-development volunteer. Mayor Serna went on to became a professor at California State University in Sacramento and then served his community as Mayor of the City of Sacramento. 
   Along the way, he helped to inspire a host of talented Latino elected officials at all levels of government. Community leaders such San Joaquin County Supervisor Steve Gutierrez, State Senator Deborah Ortiz, and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante attribute their participation in public service in part to the example and inspiration of Joe Serna. 
   As Supervisor Steve Gutierrez said, ``Mayor Serna went from being a farm worker to organizer to an educator to mayor of Sacramento. He was truly an exemplary public servant and leader.'' 
   Most recently, I had the pleasure to meet with Mayor Serna in Sacramento just hours after a heinous shooting had occurred at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. We had an opportunity to discuss at length the issue of hate crimes and other regional issues. Mayor Serna was passionate about his community and he deeply cared for its people. Even until his final days, he worked for a better life for his fellow citizens. 
   Joe Serna leaves a powerful legacy in many lives and a lasting vision for his beloved city of Sacramento. He was a dynamic leader, and we Californians were fortunate for his service. Mayor Serna will be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Isabel, the entire Serna family, and the community of Sacramento.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff on the fifth anniversary of his death in the line of duty. 
   This coming Saturday, the City of San Francisco will honor Officer Guelff by having his name enshrined at the corner of Pine and Franklin in San Francisco where he was slain on November 13, 1994. 
   Responding to a distress call, Officer Guelff, stationed at Northern Police Station, reached the crime scene and was immediately fired upon by a suspect shielded by body armor and armed with an AK 223, an Uzi, two semi-automatic pistols, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In an attempt to defend himself, Officer Guelff returned fire but his police issue revolver could not penetrate the gunman's kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff was killed under the barrage of the assailant's bullets as he attempted to reload his revolver. 
   Officer James Guelff bravely faced an assailant with defensive armor and firepower no police officer should ever confront. In response to his death, his relatives and fellow officers embarked on a national campaign to restrict felons' access to body armor. 
   This incident helped raise awareness of the unacceptable risks officers face on the street when they encounter gunmen with equal or better defensive protection. The bottom line is that criminals who use body armor have a deadly offensive weapon. 
   It is a tribute to the memory of Office James Guelff and a tribute to the persistence and dedication of his family and fellow officers that California passed legislation restricting the use of body armor by felons. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 to enact Federal regulations on body armor. First, the measure increases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines. Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor. 
   This legislation is included in S. 254, the Juvenile Justice Crime bill, which is in its final negotiations in a joint House-Senate conference committee. 
   It is my hope that the Conference Committee will finish its job quickly so that we can provide a lasting tribute to Officer James Guelff. This legislation will better protect our police officers by making sure they are adequately supplied with body armor, and that hardened criminals are deterred from using body armor. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me on this special day in honoring Officer James Guelff and celebrating the life of a true American hero.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I rise in support of the amendment offered by the minority leader to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 in two steps by September 1 of the year 2000. Before addressing my remarks directly, I want to make two comments. The first is really to thank the senior Senator from Massachusetts for his prodigious, sustained, and enthusiastic work on a minimum wage increase. I very much doubt that this would be on the calendar were it not for his constant perseverance. 
   The second is to say that I do not believe there is any piece of legislation that has been passed by this Congress or this Senate this year that can have the possible positive impact on Americans an increase in the minimum wage will at this particular point in time. I want to make that argument. 
   This amendment is about families making ends meet. It is about people being able to pay for rent and put food on the table. The bottom line is that the current minimum wage is simply not enough to live on. An estimated  11.4 million workers will benefit from the passage of this amendment; 1.5 million of them are in California alone. For a full-time worker, a $1 an hour increase in the minimum wage means a $2,000 a year raise. That is an extra $2,000 to pay the rent, to buy groceries, to send their children to school. For these workers, an increase in the minimum wage will make a huge difference. 
   Although the number of people living in poverty in the United States since 1992 has declined--and it has--by about 9 percent, from 38 million people to 34.5 million people, in California the number of people living in poverty has actually remained relatively unchanged, 
   5.19 million people to 5.12 million people living in poverty. 
   As recently as 1997, California has actually seen a 5 percent increase in the number of people living in poverty. Despite the incredible economic growth the United States has experienced throughout the mid and late 1990s, in California more than 15 percent of the population of the seventh largest economic engine on Earth lives in poverty. That is incredible. This troubling statistic clearly shows that not all segments of the workforce are benefiting from the economic expansion. 
   On September 4, the Center on Budget and Policy Priority released what I am sure my colleagues know, and hopefully will agree, is a very disturbing report on the widening gap between the rich and the poor over the last 20 years. California is an example of that gap. 
   Based on data collected by the Congressional Budget Office, the study found that the average after-tax income of the top 20 percent of households increased from about $74,000 in 1977 to more than $102,000 in 1999. The average after-tax income of the top 1 percent of the economic earners in this country will almost double, going from $234,000 to $515,000 in 1999. This indicates that those in the top income levels are doing very well all across this great Nation. 
   The bad news is that the income of the bottom fifth of households is actually falling. It has fallen from $9,900 to $8,700 over the same period. 
   So while the top income earners are prospering, those at the lower end of the income scale are doing worse than a generation ago. 
   When you have a high-cost State, this chasm is actually exaggerated. So what you have is a growing split between the very wealthy and the very poor in this country. 
   In 1977, the top 1 percent of the U.S. households received 7.3 percent of the Nation's after-tax income, and 22 years later that has gone up; they received 12.9 percent. That is a 4.4 percent increase for upper income Americans. In fact, the top 1 percent will receive as much after-tax income as the bottom 38 percent. This means the 2.7 million wealthiest Americans will be earning the same amount as the poorest 100 million Americans. 
   That is the case with 15 percent of the people in California. 
   Over the past several years, we have seen an explosion in the creation of wealth that is unprecedented in U.S. history. The strong economy has brought prosperity to large numbers of people. But that is not the whole story. More individuals and families are earning less and having a difficult time making ends meet. 
   It is time, I think, that we recognize this and do something about it. Passing the Daschle amendment is the first step we can take--50-cent minimum wage increase the first year and 50-cent minimum wage the second year. 
   Perhaps the greatest testament to the inadequacy of the minimum wage is that many communities are now recognizing how inadequate it is. And they are moving on their own to create a new concept that is called a ``living wage.'' These jurisdictions are insisting that those who do business with the local government pay their employees a living wage salary. 
   San Jose, CA, has adopted a living wage of $10.75. 
   In San Antonio, TX, it is $10.13 an hour. 
   In Boston, it is $8.23 an hour. 
   In my hometown of San Francisco, there is consideration ongoing for a living wage of $11. 
   More than 35 other localities and municipalities have adopted living wages. Clearly, it is a reaction to the inadequacy of the Federal minimum wage, which is generally too little too late to sustain people. So it is time for the Federal Government to follow the lead of our cities and take the simple step that is so important to millions of working families. 
   Many families in this country are just one paycheck away from disaster, whether it is an illness, the need to move, or a car that breaks down. People live paycheck to paycheck, and they live with the fear that they might not be able to make it this month or next month. 
   I think those figures and those statements are responsible for some of the things the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out on the floor a little bit earlier: The fear that families have, the stress that women work under, and the additional hours for women in the workplace more than men, the fact that so many children wish their family could have less stress, and could spend more time with them is all a part of this picture. 
   People can work 40 hours a week. In the most industrialized country on Earth, those people still can't support their family, still can't repair a broken car, still can't pay their rent, and still live from paycheck to paycheck. 
   In fact, a minimum-wage worker who works 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year earns only $10,300 a year. The poverty line for a family of three is $13,880, and, for a family of four, it is $16,700. 
   So you have a worker who is working at a minimum-wage job and has a family, that worker is substantially below the poverty level and the family is below the poverty level. What happens? People are forced to hold two jobs. Families are forced to have both parents working. Children are often left alone because child care, of course, is too costly or nonexistent. 
   Let me give you one case, a resident of San Francisco. Her name is Bernardine Emperado. She works more than 60 hours a week at a rental car job, and she supplements this salary by selling hot dogs at 49ers games on Sunday. 
   Nobody can tell me rental car agencies shouldn't pay a minimum wage of $6-plus. Nobody can ever convince me of that. Despite two incomes, she can't afford her own apartment. She lives with her mother and college-age daughter. Something is seriously wrong with our wage scale if someone working 60 hours a week is unable to afford life's basic necessities. 
   The traditional argument against raising the minimum wage is that when you increase wages, it costs jobs. And we just heard the majority whip make that point eloquently. The facts don't bear that out. Since the minimum wage was increased in October of 1996, we have gained 8.7 million new jobs in this country, most of them in the form of small businesses and new businesses. As a matter of fact, that has been the explosion--new businesses, small businesses, just the businesses that pay many of their people a minimum-wage salary. 
   In a strong economy, raising the minimum wage will not cost jobs. And it is time to do it. As a matter of fact, there is no better time to do it than when the economy is flush. And the economy has not been this flush in a long time. 
   I say to you that if we fail to raise the minimum wage, and to raise it on a regular basis, we will see virtually every city in this Nation, in addition to the 35 that are now doing it, enact their own living wage. 
   This will vary. I think we will increasingly find this minimum wage is going to be $10 or more if it is left to the city. 
   I think it is prudent to raise the minimum wage. I think this is the time to do it. I think it is unfair to ask someone to live on $10,000. I think for the millions of workers who, as a product of this action, will have $2,000 more in their pocket to pay for rent, to pay for clothes, to fix a car, to make a move, this is the single most important piece of social economic legislation this body can pass. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Financial Services Modernization Act. I would like to explain why I will vote in favor of this conference bill, but I also want to discuss one area where I feel this legislation falls significantly short--privacy. The financial modernization bill deserves the support of this body for several reasons:

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the African Growth and Opportunity Act and to discuss two amendments I hope to offer. I would like to begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member of the committee for their good work on this bill. Anyone who has spent time in Africa knows the poverty and environmental problems inherent on that continent. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, I believe, is the most hopeful vehicle for positive change that has come about. It opens the door to trade, investment, economic growth, and a higher quality of life for people of African nations. It will give Africans options and new abilities to build economically, to develop, to improve opportunities for trade worldwide, and to build new businesses on African and Caribbean soil. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa is a market of some 700 million people. Yet less than 1 percent of our Nation's total trade is currently conducted with nations of this region. Expanding trade with this emerging market will help keep America competitive with Europe and Asia, who are already expanding their markets in the African nations. As the nations of sub-Saharan African reform their economies to spur economic growth, U.S. exporters will have access to new and larger markets for their products. This, in the long run, creates and sustains American jobs. 
   Just as important, this legislation contains provisions to support and encourage democracy and human rights in sub-Saharan Africa. A country is not eligible for trade and investment benefits if it engages in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights and does not respect basic labor rights, such as the right to organize and bargain, the right of association, and acceptable working conditions.  Now, I recognize that those rights aren't as strong and enforceable as some might want. Nonetheless, they are the basic rights that are inherent in virtually every trade bill. 
   Finally, as President Clinton noted, deepening our economic ties with these nations will also strengthen our cooperative efforts to address a host of transnational threats, such as environmental degradation, infectious disease, and illicit drug trafficking. I had intended to offer an amendment to address any potential impact this legislation might have on the domestic apparel industry of our Nation. The amendment I would have introduced would have created a tax credit of 30 percent for the first $12,300 in the first year of employment, rising to 50 percent over 5 years for domestic garment and sewn manufacturers who hire a worker who is at or below the poverty line in this country. For an individual, that is $8,240; for a family of four, it is $16,700. 
   However, both the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee have made it clear they don't believe tax credit amendments should be offered to this legislation, and I respect that. The offset we also had in mind, it turns out, has been utilized. However, the amendment has been scored. I will not offer this domestic textile worker tax credit amendment on this bill, though my intention is to offer it as a separate bill with an offset at a later time. 
   I think this legislation would provide real incentive for domestic manufacturers to keep jobs in the United States, to hire American workers, and to keep them on the job. Moreover, by targeting the benefits to employees who, before being hired, are living at or below the poverty line, the amendment would 
   also help move families off of welfare and public assistance and provide them good jobs in which they can support themselves and their families. 
   My second amendment addresses the need for the United States to remain in the forefront of the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa. 
   Mr. President, this bill inadvertently threatens to undermine the fight against AIDS in Africa. Approximately 34 million people, if you can believe it, in sub-Saharan Africa--that is the equivalent of the population of the State of California--are or have been infected with AIDS or HIV. And 11.5 million people of those infected have died--11.5 million people. These fatalities comprise 83 percent of the world's total HIV/AIDS-related death. Eighty-three percent of the death from AIDS in the world are in the sub-Saharan African countries. So the impact of AIDS in Africa is huge. It continues to be a major threat to the well-being of the entire African Continent. Frankly, it even threatens the well-being of this legislation if it is left unaddressed. 
   Unfortunately, this legislation carries with it intellectual property rights for the American pharmaceutical companies which prevent the licensing, manufacture, and sale of cheaper generic AIDS drugs. That is a practice known as ``compulsory licensing.'' 
   Without compulsory licensing, a practice fully consistent with international law, the vast majority of HIV/AIDS patients in Africa could not afford the more expensive drugs from American pharmaceutical companies and, thus, more will suffer and die simply without treatment. AIDS drugs in this country literally cost several hundred dollars a month. They must be taken several times a day regularly, and they often necessitate other drugs to ward off serious side effects of AIDS-reducing drugs. 
   The amendment I have authored, which is cosponsored by Senator FEINGOLD, on which we have worked with the staff on both sides, and which we believe will be acceptable to both sides, draws on a provision in Senator FEINGOLD's HOPE for Africa bill. It allows the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to pursue compulsory licensing by preventing the U.S. Government from enforcing one specific U.S. intellectual property right that, when implemented, would prevent the license, manufacture, and sale of generic AIDS drugs in Africa. 
   For those of my colleagues who may be concerned that this amendment may undermine wider intellectual property rights, this amendment acknowledges the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property and that that is the presumptive legal standard for intellectual property rights. 
   The WTO, however, allows countries flexibility in addressing public health concerns, and the compulsory licensing process under this amendment is consistent with the WTO's balancing of intellectual property rights with the moral obligation to meet public health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. 
   When 11 million people die of a single disease, it certainly deserves and merits this kind of consideration. 
   In effect, this amendment will allow the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to continue to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with more affordable HIV/AIDS drugs. 
   It is clearly in the national interest of the United States to prevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and I believe that this amendment is an important improvement to this legislation if we are to continue to assist the countries of the region to bring this deadly disease under control. 
   I am pleased to support the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Initiative because I believe they are both in the national interest of this country. 
   I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their support of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this week marks the fifth anniversary of the California Desert Protection Act, a bill I authored that was signed into law on October 31, 1994. This Act marked a watershed event for California and for the 2.8 million people who visit this pristine national treasure each year. This was the most extensive land-protection bill in U.S. history and protected the largest parcel of land in the continental U.S. 
   The bill was unique in many ways. It designated national park and Bureau of Land Management wilderness areas comprising more than 7.7 million acres, the highest category of federal protection. It also designated the Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park in areas that formerly fell under less protected ``national monument'' status and created the 1.6 million acre Mojave National Preserve. 
   At the time of its passage, the Desert Protection Act was the centerpiece of a long and contentious battle among a variety of different stakeholders. It faced enormous opposition from groups and individuals concerned about private property rights, grazing permits, mining claims, and access for off-road vehicle use. The bill took nearly eight years to pass over objections from miners, property owners, hunters, ranchers and off-road enthusiasts, who thought the legislation would restrict too much land and hurt business. I worked hard to craft a bill that protected private property rights and safeguarded the region's job base while preserving a treasured resource--the California Desert. 
   I am proud to say that after 5 years there has not been a single instance of a land transaction that did not involve a willing seller and willing buyer. Grazing has not been impeded and valid mining rights have been upheld. The 25 million acres of California desert remain a place of extraordinary beauty and diverse resources. There are soaring sand dunes, ninety mountain ranges, extinct volcanoes, streams, lakes, wildflowers, the world's largest Joshua Tree forest, waterfalls and cactus gardens. 
   The land also includes over 100,000 archeological sites, including the only-known dinosaur tracks in California, believed to be more than 100 million years old. More than 760 different wildlife species call the rugged California desert home. The protected land has aided in the recovery of the desert tortoise and has provided thousands of acres of needed habitat for big horn sheep. 
   The Death Valley National Park consists of more than 3.3 million acres of spectacular desert scenery, interesting and rare desert wildlife, complex geology, undisturbed wilderness and dozens of historical and cultural interest sites. It contains the lowest point in the Western hemisphere, the Death Valley badwater, which rests 282 feet below sea level. The Joshua Tree National Park comprises two deserts and vividly illustrates the contrast between high and low desert. Below 3000 feet, the eastern half of the park is the land of the creosote bush, smoke trees and occotillo. The higher, cooler and slightly wetter Western part is dominated by Joshua Trees. 
   But the crown jewel of the California Desert is the Mojave National Preserve whose geographical and wildlife diversity are practically unrivaled. The area contains eleven mountain ranges, four dry lakes, cinder cones, badlands, innumerable 
   washes, mesas, buttes, lava tube caves, alluvial fans and one of California's most complex sand dune systems. 
   I would like to especially thank Mary Martin, the Mojave National Preserve Superintendent for her diligence and the commendable job she has done balancing the diverse needs of the Preserve with those of all the stakeholders who work and/or use the land. 
   The desert parks have attracted record numbers of tourists in recent years from across the globe. Tourism has increased the visibility of California's natural resources, created jobs for desert residents and brought additional income. In 1997, the three parks created more than 6,000 jobs and over $22 million in tax revenue from tourist expenditures. 
   The passage of the California Desert Protection Act has been one of my proudest accomplishments in the Senate. But there is still more work to be done. 
   To encourage out nation's westward expansion, in 1864 Congress gave the railroad industry every other section of land in a 50 mile swath in what is now the Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park. Most of this remaining checkerboard arrangement of land is owned by the Catellus Development Corporation. 
   Earlier this year David Myers, the Executive Director of the Wildlands Conservancy, brokered a deal with Catellus to sell these lands at well below market value. Through David's hard work, The Wildlands Conservancy raised $25.5 million in private funding and donated land. The Catellus Corporation agreed to donate an additional $16.4 million in land. 
   Through the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund the U.S. would acquire 487,000 acres of protected land. This includes 150,000 acres of Congressionally designated Wilderness areas, 87,000 acres in the Mojave National Preserve, 18,700 acres in Joshua Tree, land in Big Morongo, San Gorgonio wilderness, and the Kelso Dunes. 
   This acquisition would formalize rights-of-way over 165 jeep trails and dirt access roads leading to 3.7 million acres of land used for hunting, hiking, sightseeing, camping and recreational vehicle use. 
   The land includes the biggest cactus gardens in the world at the Bigelow Cholla Gardens. 
   The acquisition also includes one hundred miles of scenic lands and historic water stops along historic route 66 and would help to conserve one of the single most intact portions of America's ``Mother Road'' which provided many Americans their first look at the Golden State and became the source of much of America's western migration folklore. 
   The purchase is supported by an overwhelming majority of constituents in the 40th Congressional District including Republicans and Democrats alike and a broad coalition of interest groups from the Sierra Club to the National Rifle Association. This transaction would be one of the biggest land acquisitions in California history and one of the most substantial gifts ever to the American people. 
   It is my hope that we can take advantage of this rare opportunity to purchase these valuable lands and remove any remaining impediments for the millions of hikers, campers, and other recreationists who will continue to visit and enjoy this pristine area in the heart of California.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that provides permanent resident status to Sergio Lozano who, with his younger sister and brother, were granted immigrant visas to come to the United States with their mother in 1997. Unfortunately, they lost the opportunity to be come immigrants when they tragically lost their mother in that same year. 
   Sergio Lozano lived with his siblings and their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until her death in February of this year due to complications from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the three siblings have been living with their closest relative, their U.S. citizen grandmother who lives in Los Angeles and has since adopted the two younger children. 
   Without his mother, Sergio does not have the legal right to remain in the United States. When he first arrived in the U.S. at 17, he was unable to obtain lawful permanent residence because immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children without their parents. However, as a child of 17, he was also outside the age limit for adoption by his grandmother. As a result, Sergio, through no fault of his own, has been left in limbo in the United States. 
   Without legal status, this young man can be deported by the INS despite the fact that he has no immediate family in El Salvador except their estranged father who was alleged to have been abusive to the mother and the children. 
   Without the legislation, Sergio will most likely be separated from his brother and sister and sent back to El Salvador. Here in the U.S., he can remain with his brother and sister, further his education and continue to thrive in the loving environment provided by his U.S. citizen grandmother and uncles. 
   I have previously sought administrative relief for all three Lozano children by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS told my staff that there was nothing further they could do administratively and a private relief bill may be then only way to protect the children from deportation. Since then, the two younger Lozano children have been adopted by their grandmother and have received approval of their lawful permanent resident petitions. Like his siblings, Sergio has too suffered a sense of loss and bewilderment after losing a parent. However. unlike his sister and brother, he stands to be deprived of the security of his American family and deported back to a land he no longer knows, if only as a consequence of being born two years too soon. 
   Last year, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the private bill I introduced on behalf of Sergio Lozano and his siblings. However, the 105th Congress came to a close before the House was able to act. 
   This year, I hope you will support the bill on behalf of Sergio Lozano so that we can help him begin to rebuild his life with his loving family in the United States.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will create a national promotion, research and information program for Hass avocados. This industry-financed promotion program will help farmers without costing taxpayers any money. 
   This legislation provides California's 6,000 Hass avocado growers with the ability to achieve together that which would not be possible alone--the establishment of a national program to enhance avocado marketing and consumption. Pooled industry resources create the potential for an impact much greater than what would be possible through a solely state-funded program. 
   Like producers who have successful national promotion programs, including those for beef, cotton, dairy, eggs, pork and soybeans, producers of Hass avocados are seeking a new vehicle for expanding the consumer market for avocados. A nationwide promotion program would provide the avocado industry with the means to market avocados to a much wider consumer audience, and build demand at a time when the aggregate supply of avocados is rapidly increasing. 
   California has a long history of state marketing programs for its many diverse agricultural commodities. In fact, the avocado industry has long benefitted from an innovative state grower-funded program administered by the California Avocado Commission. 
   In recent years, however, increasing imports are supplying a larger share of the U.S. consumer market. In 1998, for example, import levels reached 100 million pounds, or nearly one-third the size of U.S. avocado production. If not offset by increased demand, this rapid escalation of supply will lead to market instability. Given this dynamic, it is only fair that the cost of a national promotion program be shared fairly among importers and domestic producers. 
   The ``Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1999'' is a self-help national checkoff program that will allow avocado growers to fund and operate a coordinated marketing effort to expand domestic and foreign markets. The avocado promotion program will be operated at no cost to the federal government and will be funded by U.S. Hass avocado growers and Hass avocado importers. 
   The key elements of this avocado promotion legislation include: (1) an 11-member Hass Avocado Board comprised of both domestic producers and importers; (2) new programs for the advertising and promotion of avocados to develop new markets; (3) research on the sale, distribution, use, quality or nutritional value of avocados; (4) an up-front referendum of qualified producers and importers during a 60-day period preceding the effective date of the Secretary of Agriculture's implementing order; and (5) an initial assessment rate on Hass avocados on 2.5 cent per pound. 
   Hass avocados are an integral food source in the United States and are a valuable and healthy part of the human diet. Avocados are enjoyed by millions of persons every year for a multitude of every day and special occasions. The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new markets and uses for Hass avocados is needed to preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the domestic Hass avocado industry for the benefit of producers and the benefit of other persons marketing, processing and consuming Hass avocados. 
   Agricultural commodity promotion programs are a proven means of increasing market share for commodities. The Hass avocado growers in my state want to have a program that will help increase their market share of the consumer food dollar. California's Hass avocado growers have made extensive efforts over the last two years to unify the industry, which has resulted in the development of this highly supported national promotion program. The 1996-1997 value of domestic Hass avocado production was $259 million--a substantial market that could be even greater if properly promoted. 
   This national avocado promotion program is an opportunity for Congress to help an agricultural industry create increased economic activity and job opportunities, with no expenditure of tax collars. I urge you to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from Nevada in saying a few words about Senator JOHN CHAFEE. I believe our Nation lost a pillar of the Senate last evening. I found JOHN CHAFEE to be a deeply principled and highly intelligent Senator. Additionally, he was one of the nicest men I have ever had occasion to know in the Senate or anywhere else. 
   I had the pleasure a couple of years ago of being a dinner guest at the home of JOHN and Virginia CHAFEE in McLean, a warm, hospitable home, a home that had 8, 10 people gathered around the table informally for dinner, where both JOHN CHAFEE and Virginia Chafee presided with a warmth and a hospitality that made it the nicest evening I have ever spent in my 7 years in Washington. 
   I really liked JOHN CHAFEE, and I had the pleasure of working with him on a number of issues. His record on the environment, on health care, and on gun control is second to none. As chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator CHAFEE was a leading voice in crafting the Clean Air Act of 1990 which strengthened the Nation's emissions standards. Recently, he led successful efforts to enact oil spill prevention and response legislation and a measure to strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator LAUTENBERG to introduce the Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act of 1999. This bill will reclassify powerful .50 caliber military sniper rifles under the National Firearms act, thus making it much more difficult for terrorists, doomsday cults, and criminals to obtain these guns for illegitimate use. 
   Let me just talk a little bit about what a .50 caliber gun is, and then I will describe why I believe it is vital to tighten the rules surrounding their use and purchase. 
   These .50 caliber firearms are weapons of such range and destructive capability that it seems unthinkable for them to fall into civilian hands. These  .50 caliber guns, manufactured by a small handful of companies and individuals, are deadly, military style assault rifles. The M82A1, one common example of these guns, was manufactured with one purpose in mind--the efficient destruction of enemy armaments and personnel. These guns, weighing 28 pounds and capable of piercing light armor at more than 4 miles, enable a single shooter to destroy enemy jeeps, tanks, personnel carriers, bunkers, fuel stations, and even communication centers. As a result, their use by military organizations worldwide has been rapidly spreading during the course of this decade. 
   But with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also seen increased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists around the world. 
   The weapons are deadly accurate up to 2,000 yards. This means that a shooter using a .50 caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than a mile away. In fact, according to a training manual for military and police snipers published in 1993, a bullet from this gun ``even at one and a half miles crashes into a target with more energy than Dirty Harry's famous .44 magnum at point-blank'' range. 
   And the gun is ``effective'' up to 7,500 yards. In other words, although it may be hard to aim at that distance, the gun will have its desired destructive effect at that distance--more than 4 miles from the target. 
   The weapon can penetrate several inches of steel, concrete, or even light armor. 
   Many ranges used for target practice do not even have enough safety features to accommodate these guns--it is just too powerful. 
   This gun was used extensively in the gulf war by American troops. Ideal for long range destruction of personnel, light armor or communications, there is no question that this gun is an effective wartime tool. 
   Recent advances in weapons technology, however, allow this gun to be used by civilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and even aircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the gun apparently promoted the weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars' worth of jet aircraft with one or two dollars' worth of cartridge.'' 
   One new version of the .50 caliber weapon is a modified machine gun capable of accepting ammunition belts, and yet is still allowed for civilian use by BATF. 
   This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover GAO investigators ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time before someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits a school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50 calibers. This gun is just too powerful.'' 
   Mr. President, a recent study by the General Accounting Office revealed some eye-opening facts about how and where this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained. 
   The GAO reports that many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and international terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, drug traffickers, and violent criminals. 
   One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns and stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition and other guns. 
   At least one .50 caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities after a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. The gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the guns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide. 
   Accoring to a recent news story, another .50 caliber sniper rifle, smuggled out of the United States, was used by the Irish Republican Army to kill a large number of British soldiers. 
   And ammunition for these guns is also readily available, even over the Internet. Bullets for these guns include ``armor piercing incendiary'' ammunition that explodes on impact, and even ``armor piercing tracing'' ammunition reminiscent of the ammunition that lit up the skies over Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war. 
   Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing ammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the investigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored limousine or maybe to ``take down'' a helicopter. 
   In fact, our own military helps to provide thousands of rounds of .50 caliber ammunition, by essentially giving away tons of spent cartridges, many of which are then refurbished and sold on the civilian market. 
   The bill I offer today will begin the process of making these guns harder to get and easier to track. 
   Current law classifies .50 caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to the least government regulation for any firearm. Sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and even handguns are more highly regulated than this military sniper rifle. 
   In fact, many states allow possession of .50 caliber guns by those as young as 14 years old, and there is no regulation on second-hand sales. 
   Essentially, this bill would re-classify .50 caliber guns under the National Firearms Act, which imposes far stricter standards on powerful and destruction weapons. 
   For instance: 
   NFA guns may only be purchased from a licensed dealer, and not second-hand. This will prevent the sale of these guns at gun shows and in other venues that make it hard for law enforcement to track the weapons. 
   Second, purchasers of NFA guns must fill out license transfer applications and provide fingerprints to be processed by the FBI in detailed criminal background checks. By reclassifying the .50 caliber, Congress will be making a determination that sellers should be more careful about to whom they give these powerful, military guns. 
   ATF reports that this background check process takes about 60 days, so prospective gun buyers will face some delay. However, legitimate purchasers of this $7,000 gun can certainly wait that long. 
   Clearly, Mr. President, placing a few more restrictions on who can get these guns and how is simply common sense. This bill will not ban the sale, use or possession of .50 caliber weapons. The .50 caliber shooting club will not face extinction, and ``legitimate'' purchasers of these guns will not lose their access--even though that, too, might be a reasonable step, since I cannot imagine a legitimate use of this gun. 
   The bill will simply place stricter requirements on the way in which these guns can be sold, and to whom. The measure is meant to offer a reasoned solution to making it harder for terrorists, assassins, and other criminals to obtain these powerful weapons. If we are to continue to allow private citizens to own and use guns of this caliber, range, and destructive power, we should at the very least take greater care in making sure that these guns do not fall into the wrong hands. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I begin by thanking the Senator from California for her leadership on this issue. I have watched her on the floor. She has carried the message of this important issue in a very significant way. I thank her very much. 
   I want to speak today as a mother of a daughter, as a stepmother of three young women and a grandmother of one granddaughter. I speak as a woman who grew up in this country when abortion was illegal, who went to university at that time and saw things I wish I hadn't seen, like young women on the verge of suicide because of the predicament they were in. I want to speak about a time when I sat on the California Women's Parole Board in the 1960's, a board that sentenced doctors who performed abortions and women who had had abortions. Abortion carried a sentence of 6 months to 10 years. I remember their stories. I used to read the case histories of the patients and I saw the terrible morbidity and mortality that took place in California when abortion was illegal. I don't want to go back to those days and those stories of absolute desperation. 
   As I have listened to the debate, what I have heard has been a kind of moral sanctimony of people who think they know better than anyone else. They maintain that their lifestyle, their way of handling problems, is the way everybody should handle problems. In the real world, it doesn't work that way. Nobody knows anyone else's condition, circumstances, health, life or frailties. 
   Roe v. Wade came down in 1973 and established a trimester system for the Nation which took abortion out of the arena of politicians telling my four daughters what they could do or could not do with their reproductive systems. 
   Frankly, I find the discussion deeply humiliating and very distressing--the discussion of women's body parts in the Senate of the United States of America, as if we don't have sense enough to do with our bodies what we know is ethically and morally right. 
   The fact is, the overwhelming majority of women in this great Nation do know and they do what is right. They want to have children and they do deliver children. The beauty of Roe v. Wade was that it took the explosive issue of abortion out of the political arena and set a trimester system that made sense, both for the unborn child as well as for the woman herself. 
   I will quickly summarize what that is. Roe essentially said that for the stage prior to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, the abortion decision must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman and the woman's attending physician. For the stage approximately following the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. 
   Finally, for the stage following viability--that is, the time when the fetus can live outside of the womb--the State, in promoting its interests in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, regulate and even ban abortion, except where it is necessary, in the appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. 
   That is Roe v. Wade. It took the debate off these legislative floors all across this great Nation. It set up a constitutional right so that women could protect themselves from the views of one person who got elected to public office or another person who got elected to public office, an imposition of their views on all of the women of America. 
   Roe v. Wade has stood the test of time. It should be supported, and we now have an opportunity to do so. Let me make a couple of comments on what we have before us. 
   Since 1992, there have been 120 votes that sought to infringe on Roe and sought to constrain a woman's right to control her own reproductive system; 113 of them have been successful. My colleague from California and I have watched the march to limit a woman's right to choose, to find ways to encroach on it, whether it is not allowing women on Medicaid to have abortions; whether it is not giving money to the District of Columbia if the District of Columbia uses Federal, or even its own dollars for abortion services for women; limiting the rights of women in the military, and on and on and on--a steady march to eliminate Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. And now we have this issue of so-called partial-birth abortion before us. 
   I sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have attended all of the hearings on this subject. What has been interesting to me is, in the many years that we have discussed this, there has been no medical definition presented in the legislation describing what a partial-birth  abortion really is. No one has used what I think they aim at, which is something called intact D and X, which is in fact a specific medical procedure and which is known to physicians. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a statement of policy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, instead of recognized medical language like that of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the language the underlying bill before us is vague. 
   Let me tell you why I say it is vague. It is vague because it not only affects third-trimester abortions, it affects second-trimester abortions; therefore, it is a continuation of the march to limit and constrict a woman's rights under Roe v. Wade. 
   Let me give you some examples of testimony that we had in our Judiciary Committee hearings. Doctors who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee could not identify, with any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical procedure this legislation refers to. The vagueness meant that every doctor who performs even a second-trimester abortion could be vulnerable and face criminal prosecution. 
   The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has told us that ``the legislation could be interpreted to include, and thus outlaw, many other widely used, accepted, and safe abortion and operative obstetric techniques.'' 
   Dr. Louis Seidman, Professor of Law from Georgetown University, told us:  
   ......as I read the language, in a second-trimester previability abortion, where the fetus will in any event die, if any portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to the technical death of the fetus, then the physician is guilty of a crime and goes to prison for two years.  
   That is what we are doing here. Dr. Seidman continued his testimony before our committee and said this:  
   If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the fetus is technically dead, much less being able to demonstrate that after the fact.  
   Dr. Courtland Richardson, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, testified in the House that:  
   In any normal second trimester abortion procedure, by any method, you may have a point at which a part, a one-inch piece of [umbilical] cord, for example, of the fetus passes out of the cervical [opening] before fetal demise has occurred.  
   That would violate the so-called partial-birth abortion ban and subject a physician to 2 years in prison. That is the impact of this legislation. People can say what they want, but that is the impact, the medical impact. 
   Now let me give you the legal impact. 
   The legal impact is that courts throughout America have ruled that partial-birth abortion laws are unconstitutional. Most recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit unanimously ruled unconstitutional three State laws--in Arkansas, in Iowa, and in Nebraska--that mirror the Santorum bill. The Eighth Circuit is the first Federal appellate court to review the legal merits of partial-birth abortion bans. In ruling on the Iowa and Nebraska laws, which were nearly identical to S. 1692, the district court in both cases held that the language in the State laws was unconstitutional because it was overly vague, imposed an undue burden on pregnant women and did not adequately protect a woman's health and life. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling, noting that the State law's vague language would ban more than just partial-birth abortion; it would ban other abortion procedures protected by the landmark Roe v. Wade. Circuit Court Judge Richard Arnold wrote--and I quote this because it is important:  
   The difficulty is that the statute covers a great deal more. It would also prohibit, in many circumstances, the most common method of second trimester abortion, called a dilation and evacuation (D and E).  
   This is the circuit court writing. 
   D and E is a recognized medical procedure, dilation and evacuation. Judge Arnold continued:  
   Under the controlling precedents laid down by the Supreme Court, such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion. It is therefore our duty to declare the statute invalid.  
   In 20 out of 21 States, partial-birth abortion laws have been blocked or severely limited; 18 State partial-birth abortion laws have been blocked by a Federal or State court; 6 out of 9 States that passed partial-birth abortion laws using the language as found in S. 1692 have had their laws enjoined, including Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, and West Virginia. One court limited the enforcement of Georgia's partial-birth abortion ban to redefine partial-birth abortion in medical terms, to limit its application to postviability abortion. That is the point. 
   If proponents of this bill are really serious, they should use a medical procedure and prohibit that procedure in postviability abortions. 
   And the court stated that Georgia's law was invalid because it created an exception in the law to allow abortions in cases necessary to protect the health of the woman. Six States, where the laws have been blocked, used identical language to H.R. 1122, vetoed by President Clinton in 1997. 
   Mr. President, courts across the country have made it all too clear that legislation like S. 1692 does not do what the proponents of the bill say it does. The bill does not limit State bans on abortion to postviability procedures. It does not protect a woman's  health. For these reasons, this bill violates the basic constitutional rights of women provided by Roe v. Wade in 1972, and other Supreme Court decisions. Simply stated, the main bill before us today is unconstitutional on its face and will be struck down. 
   I urge this body to support the Harkin resolution and to defeat the underlying Santorum bill. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today in recognition of ``National Women's Business Week'' and of the vital role women business-owners play in our economy. 
   I would also like to recognize the appointment of Vivian L. Shimoyama to the National Women's Business Council. Ms. Shimoyama is the Founder and President of Breakthru Unlimited, a California company that designs and manufactures projects with a message: hand-made glass artwork of jewelry, executive gifts, limited editions, and custom awards. A brilliant sample of her work is her ``Breaking the Ceiling'' line of jewelry that has adorned the lapels of Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. Currently, she serves as the Chair of the National Association of Women Business Owners--Los Angeles. In 1999, she was honored as the Small Business Administration's ``Women Business Advocate of the Year''. 
   Ms. Shimoyama runs one of the 1.2 million women-owned businesses headquartered in California. According to a study by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO), these businesses employ 3.8 million workers and generate $548 billion in annual sales, a growth of 164 percent in seven years. 
   Without a doubt, women entrepreneurs have played a crucial part in the growth of our economy. NFWBO reports that between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103 percent nationwide, employment increased by 320 percent, and sales increased by 436 percent. As of 1999, there are 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the U.S., which employ 27.5 million people and generate over $3.6 trillion in sales. To put the sales of these businesses into context, they are twice the size of the Federal budget, and greater than the Gross National Product of every country in the world but the United States and Japan. 
   An increasing number of these businesses have focused on emerging industries such as high technology. These businesses demand a greater access to capital and information resources than ever before.  
   Mr. President, I will do all I can to ensure that the women in my state and all over the country have access to the opportunities and resources they need to start new business ventures. However it is also imperative that we invest in the business development resources that will help women sustain and grow these new businesses. This small investment yields big returns in the form of job creation, revenues, and overall growth of the nation's economy.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my extreme disappointment in the Senate's failure to invoke cloture on the campaign finance reform legislation. This is the third consecutive year we have held this debate and I am disturbed that each attempt to move this bill has failed. 
   Our campaigns are awash in money. Over the weekend, both the Washington Post and the New York Times ran stories detailing the rise of soft money contributions and the impact it is having on our electoral process. 
   We do not need newspapers to tell us what we already know. We have run the campaigns, we have raised the money, and we have felt the sting of negative attack ads. 
   I am now entering my fourth statewide campaign in California. In the 1990's, I have raised more than $40 million. In the 1990 race for Governor, I had to raise about $23 million. In the first race for the Senate, $8 million; in the second race, $14 million. This process has got to stop. 
   I want to speak for a few minutes about my last campaign. All of us in the Senate have all faced tough campaigns, but I think this election was a little different because of the record amounts of money that were spent. 
   In 1994, my opponent spent nearly $30 million in his effort to defeat me. It wasn't simply the amount of money spent that made this race unpleasant, however. It was how the Money was spent. 
   This race was not a discussion of issues. Instead, money was spent on negative ads that misrepresented votes I had taken and mislead voters about my positions. This campaign was primarily about bringing a candidate down, not promoting a view or even another candidate. 
   I wish I could say that this was a unique circumstance in which a wealthy individual used unlimited resources to mount this type of campaign. Unfortunately, it has become all too common. Instead of wealthy candidates using their own money, political parties and outside organizations are raising millions of dollars in soft money contributions. They are bankrolling attack ads designed solely to defeat candidates. 
   Studies have clearly shown that as election day gets closer, ads become more candidates oriented and more negative. Instead of promoting a position or an issue, these ads attempt to influence an election by painting a distorted view of a candidate. 
   The impact that this type of campaigning is having on the electorate as whole is of much greater consequence than the effect on any single race. Voter disenchantment with the political process is at an unprecedented level. Negative campaigning may be designed to drive candidates from office, but it is actually driving voters away from the polls. 
   Over the past several days, much has been said about the rise in soft money spending and its influence over our elections. The numbers are clear and unquestionably disturbing. Soft money spending doubled between 1992 and 1996 and it is projected to double again this cycle. 
   I believe the most distressing effect of soft money, however, has been the impact on the voters. Since the early 1990s, when soft money began to explode, voter turnout has significantly  declined. Between the presidential election years of 1992 and 1996, the percentage of eligible voters participating in elections fell 6 points from 55 to 49 percent. 
   Voting participation in midterm elections fell from 38.78 percent in 1994 to 36.4 percent in 1998. There may be a number of reasons for this decline, but I believe it is largely due to a growing distaste for the political process. The political dialogue has become dominated by personal attacks and unsubstantiated charges and voters have chosen to not participate. 
   I voted in favor of the Shays-Meehan legislation that the minority leader offered as an amendment. I believe it represents the most comprehensive reform of the current system. This bill has already passed the House by a decisive, bipartisan margin and the Senate should have followed suit. 
   I also supported the streamlined version of the McCain-Feingold bill. As we know, this bill contains only the ban on soft money and permits union members to prevent the use of their dues for political activities. 
   I supported this bill, but I did so with some misgivings. One of the key provisions that was dropped from the original legislation dealt with issue advocacy. This is a loophole in the current campaign finance system that allow unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence elections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure restrictions. 
   I am very concerned that banning soft money without addressing issue advocacy will simply redirect the flow of undisclosed money in campaigns. Instead of giving soft money to political parties, individuals, and organizations that want to influence elections will create their own ``independent'' attack ads. 
   One study now estimates that between $275 million and $340 million will be spent on so-called issue advertisements during the last election cycle. This amount of spending becomes a third campaign where candidates can't respond because they don't know from where the attack is coming. 
   Despite the lack of issue advocacy, I voted in support of the soft money ban. While this may not entirely solve the problems in our campaign finance system, at least it would move the debate forward. Banning soft money is an important and necessary step in a larger effort to reform the system. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate did not invoke cloture on either amendment and it now appears the bill will be removed from the floor and the debate ended for the year. 
   This is the worst possible outcome. As a result of our actions today, the influence of soft money will continue to grow, attack ads will saturate the airwaves during each election, and voters will continue to lose interest in the process. 
   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to take down this bill. Let us go forward with the amendment process and give us an opportunity to pass this legislation. We owe it to the American public.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the amendment offered by the minority leader and the Senator from New Jersey. As you know, this amendment is almost identical to the Shays-Meehan bill that passed the House of Representatives by a decisive, bipartisan vote of 252-177. It is time for the Senate to show the same courage and pass this important legislation. 
   as I enter my eleventh political campaign and my fourth California statewide election, I am one who knows a little about the dynamics of campaigning in expensive races. In the 1990 race for Governor, I had to raise about $23 million. In the first race the Senate, $8 million; in the second race, $14 million. In 1994, my opponent spent nearly $30 million in his attempt to defeat me. My experiences have led me to believe that the current campaign finance system is badly flawed and in need of overhaul. 
   Since 1976, the first election after the last major revision of campaign finance laws, the average cost of a winning Senate race went from $609,000 to $3.8 million in 1998. The average cost for a winning House candidate rose from $87,000 in 1976 to $679,000 in 1998. 
   Campaigns in 2000 are very different than they were in 1976. Clearly, our campaign finance system must be reformed to reflect these differences. 
   I have been a strong supporter of federal campaign finance reform since my first election to the Senate. Campaigns simply cost too much and it is long past time that Congress does something about it. 
   I believe very strongly that this will be the final real opportunity this millennium to make significant structural reforms to our campaign finance system. Two of the fundamental changes that I believe must be made are a complete ban on soft money contributions to political parties and making independent campaign ads subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements as are a candidate's campaign ads. 
   While I have a great deal of respect for the persistence the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have demonstrated in pushing the Senate to act on campaign finance reform, I am concerned that the underlying bill, S..1953, is too narrow to constitute a real reform of the campaign finance system. Banning soft money without addressing issue advocacy will simply redirect the flow of undisclosed money in campaigns. Instead of giving soft money to  political parties, the same dollars will be turned into ``independent'' ads. 
   The issues of soft money ban and independent advertisements go hand in hand and one can not be addressed without the other.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Hispanic community. As we commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to recognize the contributions made by millions of Latinos in our nation. California is truly a multi-cultural state and I am honored to help represent this community in the United States Senate. 
   This month we celebrate a community that shares the common goals of other Americans of freedom, opportunity and a chance to build a better life. In pursuing these aspirations, they have made important contributions to life in the United States in the fields of business, politics, science, culture, sports, and entertainment. Latinos have served in the armed services with bravery and courage and many have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives for the common good of our country. 
   Today, I honor these brave Americans and their families. I also honor Latino heroes and heroines like the late Julia de Burgos, Arturo Alphonso Schomburg, Roberto Clemente, and Cesar Chavez. These teachers, advocates, athletes, and activists have brought pride to their community, enriched our country, and provided role models for all of us to emulate. 
   Indeed, Latinos are changing the way America looks at itself. Today there are 31 million Hispanics in the U.S. By 2050, the population is projected to hit 96 million--an increase of more than 200 percent. Latinos are making their mark, Sammy Sosa leading the great American home-run derby. Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Carlos Santana topping the pop music charts. Salma Hayek, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, Edward James Olmos, and Rita Moreno are making great contributions to the entertainment industry. 
   I commend the Latino community for its courage and persistence and want to warmly acknowledge the contributions and vitality this community brings to our nation. I thank the leaders of this community for leading by example and for promoting a national policy agenda which highlights basic human necessities that should be the right of every American. 
   Between 1984 and 1998, Latino voting jumped nationwide in midterm elections by 27 percent, even as overall voter turnout declined by 13 percent. In my own state of California, Latinos are participating and contributing to civic life. For the first time in the California State Legislature's history, two of its three highest offices are occupied by Latinos, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Speaker of the Assembly Antonio Villaraigosa. 
   A democratic and prosperous society should not step back from a national commitment to provide assistance to those who strive to achieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to emphasize the importance of a quality education for the success of Latino children. Our Latino young people are a great source of strength and hope for the future of this nation and they should be able to participate fully in the American experience. 
   I am proud to honor California's Hispanic community and to have the opportunity to ensure that Latino contributions and sacrifices do not go unnoticed.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Unfortunately, the vote outcome today looks to be a tragedy of major proportions. It will leave the world a far less safe place and means the United States relinquishes its imperative as a leader in nuclear nonproliferation. I would like to take a few minutes to explain why I support this treaty, and to address some of the arguments presented by those who are opposed to this Treaty. 
   I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because I believe it strengthens the U.S. ability to play a leadership role in global nuclear non-proliferation. The treaty is a key element of the global non-proliferation regime, and if the U.S. fails to ratify the CTBT, it sends a clear message around the world that the development and possession of nuclear weapons are acceptable. As former U.S. Ambassador to India Frank Wisner expressed in a letter earlier this year, if the U.S. walks away from the CTBT ``I do not want to contemplate treaty failure here followed by a breakdown with India and Pakistan and the effect these moves will have on rogue states like Iraq, Libya, Iran and North Korea.'' 
   Second, the CTBT will constrain the development of nuclear capabilities by rogue states, as well as the development of more advanced weapons by declared nuclear states. Any significant nuclear program requires extensive testing, and while a rogue state might develop a primitive first generation  weapon without testing, that testing would not be adequate to develop a sophisticated weapon. And, because new types of weapons also require testing, the CTBT will also curb the ability of states which already possess nuclear weapons from developing more advanced designs. As John Holum, Acting Undersecretary of State and the former Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, has noted, the United States does not need tests; proliferators need tests. 
   Third, the CTBT will improve the U.S. ability to detect and deter nuclear tests. The American Geophysical Union and the Seismological Society of America, in a joint statement issued on October 6, found that when the International Monitoring System--with over 300 seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide monitoring stations--is in operation, no nation will be able to elude them, even with a small-yield test. 
   And, finally, the CTBT will make the world a safer place and safeguard U.S. national security interests. The treaty constrains the development of nuclear weapons by other states. That is good. It provides the United States with additional means to detect nuclear activities of other countries. It provides the United States with means and leverage to act if we discover that other states are, in violation of the treaty, developing nuclear weapons. And, given the size and sophistication of the U.S. nuclear arsenal--second to none in every respect--it preserves U.S. nuclear superiority and our deterrent capability. It will help make the world a safer place. It is in the national interest. 
   The Joint Chiefs believe that this Treaty safeguards U.S. interests. Former Chiefs, including Generals Colin Powell, John Shalikashvili, David Jones, and Admiral Crowe all endorse the treaty. Presidents of both parties, from Eisenhower and Kennedy to President Clinton have worked for a ban on nuclear test explosions. The NATO alliance has endorsed the Treaty. And other leading U.S. military and diplomatic figures--including Paul Nitze, Admiral Turner, Admiral Zumwalt--all support this treaty and believe that it makes the U.S. more secure in the world, not less. 
   Let me now address several of the arguments that have been raised by opponents of this treaty: That it is not verifiable; that it will compromise the reliability and integrity of the U.S. nuclear arsenal; that the U.S. needs to maintain the ability to improve our nuclear arsenal and that we can only do so with additional tests; and that others, such as North Korea and Iran, will develop nuclear weapons under the CTBT while our hands are tied. 
   First, several opponents of this treaty have commented that it is impossible for the CTBT to offer a 100% fool-proof means of detecting low-yield tests. 
   It is true that the CTBT will not provide the means for 100% verification of low-yield tests--those tests less than one kiloton in size. But it is undeniable that the additional seismic monitors, including a system that will be well-calibrated to pick up tests smaller than one kiloton (in areas of interest) and the treaty's on-site verification provisions, will increase our current verification capabilities. As the statement of the American Geophysical Union and the Seismological Society of America asserts, the CTBT will add significant capabilities to what we can now detect, and the increased likelihood of detection will serve as a real deterrent to any state contemplating a test. 
   In addition, as physicist and arms control expert Sidney Drell has noted, ``very low yield tests are of questionable value in designing new nuclear weapons or confirming that a new design will work as intended.'' In other words, even if the CTBT is not 100% verifiable for small-yield tests, tests of this size are only of a limited utility to a state seeking to develop nuclear weapons. 
   Second, questions have been raised about the adequacy of the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the reliability and integrity of U.S. weapons systems. 
   Simply put, according to General Shalikashvili in testimony before Congress, ``our warheads, having been adequately tested in the past, continue to be safe and reliable.'' With the Stockpile Stewardship Program, further nuclear testing is not necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. arsenal. The U.S. has conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests. We have a high level of knowledge and sophistication and sufficient data to maintain the safety and reliability of our weapons. The U.S. does not need to conduct further nuclear tests--it is other states that need to test if they seek to develop nuclear programs, and it is precisely tests by other states that the CTBT will constrain or prevent. 
   In fact, because the U.S. does not need to continue to test, in 1992 President Bush signed into law legislation that established a moratorium on U.S. testing, and we have not tested a weapon in six years. 
   Each year the heads of Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore have certified that the U.S. stockpile is safe and reliable. There is every indication that, aided by sophisticated computer modeling and other stockpile stewardship initiatives, they will be able to continue to make these certifications. In fact, in a February 2, 1998 statement, the three lab heads stated that ``We are confident that the Stockpile Stewardship program will enable us to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.'' 
   Critically--and this point should not be overlooked or ignored by opponents of the treaty--if at any point the United States finds that it can not continue to certify the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, under the President's safeguards package incorporated in the Democratic Amendment, the U.S. will maintain the prerogative to pull out of the CTBT and conduct tests or take whatever measures are necessary to maintain stockpile integrity. In other words, our very ability to maintain stockpile safety is a condition of U.S. participation in the CTBT. 
   Third, questions have been raised as to whether the U.S. needs to continue to test to maintain the ability to improve our nuclear arsenal to face the security challenges that lie ahead. 
   While the CTBT might constrain our ability to develop whole new classes of weapons, the CTBT does allow us to make modifications to our weapons, including casings, detonators, batteries, and arming systems. In a letter to President Clinton, Dr. Hans A. Bethe, head of the Manhattan Project's theoretical division and professor of physics emeritus at Cornell University, states that ``If any component shows signs of deterioration it will be refabricated. If the fuel itself is degrading, it will be refreshed.'' 
   Parts that wear out can be replaced, and modifications can 
   be made that will improve the capabilities of our nuclear arsenal. Thus, for example, in 1996 a B-61-7 nuclear bomb was modified to a B-61-Mod V earth penetrating weapon by hardening the outer casing. Unlike the B-61-7, the B-61-Mod V has additional capability to penetrate hardened targets. 
   In other words, the CTBT, while effectively preventing other states from developing nuclear weapons, will still allow the United States to modify its arsenal to meet the challenges that we may face in the years ahead. 
   Finally, there is the argument that under the CTBT other states--especially such states as North Korea or Iran--will do what they want while our hands will be tied. 
   In the final analysis some states will do what they want in violation of the norm established by the international community anyway. In other words, they will seek to develop nuclear weapons whether or not the CTBT is in force. 
   The real question, then, is if the CTBT will make it easier or more difficult for these states to develop nuclear weapons. 
   For example, with or without the CTBT the U.S. will face problems verifying small-yield tests. And the fact of the matter is that without the CTBT, relying only on national intelligence means, we will have greater difficulty in detecting any tests and less leverage to do anything about it if we do. 
   Again, to quote General Shalikashvili,  
   On the issue of verification we have concluded that a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will actually put us in a better position to obtain effective verification than we would have without the Treaty. The Treaty does not provide ``perfect verification,'' but that  level of verification that would allow us to detect, to identify and to attribute that level of testing that could undercut our nuclear deterrent.  
   The CTBT may thus deter some from going forward with nuclear developments entirely--India and Pakistan have indicated that they would adhere to a test ban, for example--and for those it will not deter, it will make the development of nuclear weapons that much more difficult, and perhaps impossible. 
   I do not believe the CTBT, or any treaty for that matter, can prevent a determined state from doing what the treaty forbids. But that is neither the right nor the fair standard to measure the treaty against. One cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
   The bottom line is that by any measure the CTBT will make the development of nuclear weapons by other states more difficult, will add to the U.S. ability to detect tests, and will enhance U.S. national security by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons while assuring that the U.S. maintains a strong and capable nuclear deterrent second to none. And we also know that failure of the U.S. to ratify the CTBT will have disastrous repercussion. 
   The United States has led the international effort to keep the nuclear genie in the bottle for the past five decades. As we prepare to enter a new century we should not now uncork that bottle, and make our legacy to the twenty-first century the unleashing of a global nuclear weapons race. 
   Although I do not believe that this is the appropriate time for this Senate to vote on this treaty, I urge my colleagues to support ratification of the CTBT.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today legislation to assist Mrs. Ruth Hairston, of Carson, California. Identical legislation has passed the House without objection under the sponsorship of Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I am pleased to support this effort in the Senate. 
   Mrs. Hairston requires this extreme step in order to be able to pursue a federal court appeal of the Merit Systems Protection Board (# CSF 2221413), which denied Mrs. Hairston's eligibility for an annuity following the retirement and untimely death of her former husband. The legislation does not require the annuity, but will only permit the filing of an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. As a result, Mrs. Hairston will be permitted to challenge the denial on the merits, rather than accept the denial due to the failure to file an appeal within thirty days. 
   I would briefly like to describe the facts that warrant this legislation. 
   Mr. Paul Hairston retired in 1980, electing a survivor annuity for Mrs. Hairston to receive one-half the retirement benefit under the settlement terms. Mr. and Mrs. Hairston began receiving benefits in 1988. 
   The Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews Civil Service retirement claims, concluded Mr. Hairston had failed to register Mrs. Hairston for survivors benefits following passage of 1985 law, renewing the survivor annuity previously selected in 1985. As a result the spousal survivor benefits for Mrs. Hairston were canceled. Following Mr. Hairston's death in 1995, Mrs. Hairston's benefits, her portion of his retirement benefit under the divorce settlement, ceased. Mrs. Hairston was denied eligibility as a surviving spouse, but did not challenge or appeal the denial of eligibility, due to hospitalization and poor health. 
   I am pleased to introduce this private legislation to assist my constituent Mrs. Ruth Hairston. While this legislation represents an extraordinary measure, the step is necessary in order to permit her to appeal the denial of eligibility by the Merit Systems Protection Board in federal court. As I have previously stated, this legislation does not require any specific outcome. The federal court will review the appeal with all the rigor the case deserves. However, Mrs. Hairston will receive her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board to deny her eligibility. 
   I understand Mrs. Hairston is under considerable financial pressure and could face foreclosure on her home. I am pleased to try to assist Mrs. Hairston in her appeal. Mr. President, I hope you and the subcommittee will support this bill so that Mrs. Hairston may begin to rebuild her life.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that the USDA, which has the expertise to make an informed decision about the value of fruit and other foods in children's diets should be left alone to design the composition of the WIC food packages. Over the past several years, the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill has become a vehicle for the debate surrounding the content of sugar in certain foods eligible for inclusion in the WIC program. More recently, the fiscal year 1999 Statement of Managers instructed the Department to provide $300,000 for a study by the National academy of Sciences on this issue, which was not conducted. Now, the fiscal year 2000 Statement of Managers includes language directing that no exception to the sugar cap be made. I assume that this pattern of direction is as frustrating to all of us as it is to WIC program administrators, participants, and suppliers. 
   Our goal, quite simply, should be to promote a healthy diet for all Americans. USDA nutrition policy should consider the totality of U.S. eating habits and aim for consumer education and program implementation that deals with a person's overall diet rather than one burdened by requirements attached in a piecemeal fashion. 
   It is unfortunate that the grip of political consideration has taken hold of a matter best left to nutritionists and those trained in the science of public health. It is also unfortunate that the result has been inconsistent policy development where certain nutritional limitations have been imposed on some components of USDA nutrition programs, but not on others. This issue should be resolved by experts who can best determine dietary guidelines properly suited for all Americans. My intent also does not suggest that USDA nutrition programs should be made more complicated than they are, but that a simple injection of common sense should prove refreshing and, hopefully, a basis for sound public policy.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. This amendment would needlessly delay OSHA from implementing regulations to prevent one of the leading causes of work place injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). 
   Each year, more than 600,000 American workers suffer work related MSDs and it is costing businesses $15 to $20 billion in workers' compensation costs alone. It is estimated that one out of every three dollars spent on worker's compensation is related to repetitive motion injuries. 
   Many of the jobs that are disproportionately subject to ergonomic injuries are held by women. In fact, while women experience 33 percent of all serious workplace injuries, they suffer 61 percent of repetitive motion injuries. This includes: 
   91 percent of all injuries related to repetitive typing; 
   61 percent of repetitive placing injuries; 
   62 percent of work related cases of tendinitis; and 
   70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases. 
   The supporters of this amendment argue that OSHA should delay ergonomic protection until the National Academy of Sciences completes a second review of existing studies. This comes despite the fact that there is already substantial scientific evidence linking MSDs to the workplace. 
   The first study completed by the National Academy of Sciences found that ``research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rates of musculoskeletal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' That peer reviewed study was conducted just last year. 
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed more than 2,000 studies of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. They concluded that ``compelling scientific evidence shows a consistent relationship between musculoskeletal disorders and certain work related factors.'' 
   In a letter to the Department of Labor, William Grieves, president of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, notes that ``there is an adequate scientific foundation for OSHA to proceed with a proposal and, therefore, no reason for OSHA to delay the rulemaking process while the National Academy of Science panel conducts its review.''

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All of these studies have found links between repetitive motion injuries and workplace factors and suggest that OSHA must be permitted to go forward with sensible regulations to insure a safe workplace. 
   Ergonomic programs have proven to be effective in reducing repetitive motion injuries in the workplace. Many businesses which have voluntarily instituted an ergonomic program have found the long term benefits to far outweigh the short term costs. 
   Red Wing Shoes in Minnesota found that their workers' compensation costs dropped 75 percent in the 4 years after they began an ergonomic program. 
   Fieldcrest-Cannon in Columbus, Georgia, saw the number of workers' suffering from repetitive motion injuries drop from 121 in 1993 to 21 in 1996. 
   By redesigning its workstations, OshKosh B'Gosh reduced workers' compensation costs by one-third. 
   Mr. President, I certainly agree that decisions on government regulations should be based on sound science. In this case, there is already a substantial body of scientific evidence which concludes that there is a relationship between MSDs and the workplace and that ergonomic programs can significantly reduce these injuries. 
   During this decade, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered from serious workplace injuries as a result of ergonomic hazards. As we move into the next century, American workers must be given adequate protection from these preventable injuries. Congress must allow OSHA to move forward with sensible ergonomic regulations. I urge my colleagues to vote to defeat this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the FY 2000 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, H. R. 1650, because it addresses important priorities of the American people. 
   Among other increases, this bill increases funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $2 billion, including a $384 million increase for the National Cancer Institute. This will continue us on the path of doubling the funding of NIH over five years. The President requested only a 2.1 percent increase over FY 1999, which does not keep pace with medical research inflation, projected to be 3.5 percent next year. 
   The National Institutes of Health--often called the ``crown jewel'' of the federal government--offers hope to millions of Americans who suffer from diseases like diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimers, Tourette's Syndrome, Parkinson's and on and on. Sadly, NIH can now only fund 31 percent of applications. Under the Presidents's FY 2000 proposal, it could have fallen to 28 percent, a 10 percent drop. This is the wrong direction, especially at a time when research is opening many new scientific doors. 
   Federal support for curing diseases and finding new treatments is not a partisan issue. Federal spending on health research is only 1 percent of the federal budget. Sixty eight percent of Americans support doubling medical research over five years; 61 percent of Americans support spending part of the surplus on medical research. Fifty five percent of Californians said they would pay more in taxes for more medical research, in a Research America poll. 
   NIH is especially important to my state where some of the nation's leading research is conducted. The University of California received $1.7 billion in NIH funds in 1998. The federal government supports over 55 percent of UC's research. 
   I am pleased that the bill includes $ 3.28 billion for the National Cancer Institute. This is an increase of $384 million or 13 percent over last year. With  this, NCI will be able to fund at least 10 percent more grants. If we had gone along with the President proposed 2 percent increase for cancer research, NCI would have been able to fund 10 percent fewer grants. That is the wrong direction, at a time when cancer incidence and deaths are about to explode. 
   Today, one in every four deaths is due to cancer. Cancer costs over $100 billion a year. Because of the aging of the population, the incidence of cancer will explode by 2010, with a 29 percent increase in incidence and a 25 percent increase in deaths, at a cost of over $200 billion per year. The cancer burden will hit America the hardest in the next 10 to 25 years as the country's demographics change. (These are the findings of the September 1999 Cancer March Research Task Force.) Cancer deaths can be reduced from 25 to 40 percent over the next 20 year period, saving 150,000 to 225,000 lives each year if we do the right thing. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for including in the committee report language indicating that we need to increase cancer research funding consistent with the recommendations of the Research Task Force of the Cancer March. The Cancer March called for increasing the National Cancer Institute budget by 20 percent each year for four years, to get to $10 billion by 2005. This bill with its 12 to 13% increase in funds is a step on the way. 
   The National Cancer Dialogue, a national group representing leaders of the entire cancer community and over 120 cancer organizations, recommended that NCI be funded at $5 billion in FY 2000 and CDC cancer activities at $516 million. 
   What can be accomplished with $5 billion for research? 
   More drugs: NCI could bring 40 new cancer drugs from the laboratory to clinical trials. In NIH's entire history, only 70 drugs have been approved for treating cancer. 
   Cancer Genetics: Continuing to identify genes involved in cancer. Improving our understanding of the interaction between genes and environmental exposures. 
   Imaging: Finding new ways to detect cancers earlier when they are small, not invasive and more easily treated. 
   Clinical Trials: Increase participation from 2 percent currently. Medicare beneficiaries account for more than 50 percent of all cancer diagnoses and 60 percent of all cancer death. 
   Prevention: 70 percent of all cancers are preventable says the American Cancer Society. By expanding the CDC's efforts to provide cancer screening, cancer registries and other measures to help people prevent cancer screening, cancer registries and other measures to help people prevent cancer. For example, tobacco-related deaths are the single most preventable cause of death and disability and account for 30 percent of all US cancer death. 
   I am also pleased to see an increase of $200 million over last year and $100 million over the President's request for Ryan White AIDS, as well as a 12 percent increase for AIDS research at NIH. 
   California has the second highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the US. While the AIDS death rate has declined it is still too high. Over 40,000 new infections develop each year. In California, 100,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS. Half of all HIV-infected people do not receive regular medical care according to the Rand study, December 1998. 
   We face serious challenges. We must find a cure. We must find new treatments. HIV lingers in cells so long that the ``virus cannot be eradicated at all with current treatments *.*.* it remains tucked away longer than though,'' according to the New England Journal of Medicine, May 1999. 
   This funding bill also includes important funding for education at all levels. There is hardly a more important function of government than providing a solid education for our youngsters. 
   The bill raises education by $2 billion over last year. This is important in light of the decline in the federal share of total education funding from 14 percent in 1980 to six percent in 1998, according to the Office of Management and Budget. 
   No doubt we need to do more. Our nation's schools face unprecedented challenges. My state is fraught with problems: California has 6 million students, more students than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country, California will need 210,000 new teachers by 2008. We have about 30,000 teachers on emergency credentials. We have the most diverse student body in the county. In some schools, over 50 languages are spoken. While this diversity is one of my state's great strengths, in the classroom, it places huge responsibilities on teachers. 
   Buildings: We need to build 6 new classrooms per day, $809 million per year. Some elementary schools have over 5,000 students. Our schools are too big. 
   In higher education, California is preparing for ``Tidal Wave II,'' the demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers which will inundate our colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010. 
   And so our needs are huge. Our challenges are great. 
   I am disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the Murray amendment that would have ensured that $1.4 billion be used to hire teachers and reduce class size. By adding $200 million and raising the allocation from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and specifying that it be used to hire teachers and reduce class sizes, California could have hired 1,100 new teachers, on top of the 3,322 that will provide funding for last year. I hope the conference will see the importance of this. 
   One area of this bill that I have given my attention to is ESEA Title I, the program that provides over $8 billion for educating poor children. Unfortunately, despite my efforts in the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to delete what is known as the ``hold harmless'' provisions. Also, the committee would not accept my amendment to clarify and insure that any new or additional funds, over last year, go to states that are hurt by the hold harmless provision. 
   The Title I hold harmless provisions (there are two in the bill, for basic grants and for concentration grants) hold states and districts ``harmless.'' They say in essence that no state or district will receive less than it did the previous year despite changes in the number of poor children. In the bill, these apply to the Title I basic grants and the concentration grants. These provisions freeze funding in place despite the number of poor children, despite their eligibility. 
   I tried to delete these provisions in the committee, but because, frankly, there are more low-growth states than high-growth states like mine, in the Senate, did not have the votes to completely eliminate them. 
   Here is why the hold harmless provisions are wrong: One, they violate the purpose of the program since 1965, to target funds on poor children, two, they contravene the census update requirement. The authorizing law requires the Department to update child poverty data every year so that each state will receive funds according to the number of poor children. The hold harmless renders that requirement virtually meaningless. 
   Secretary Riley wrote, April 29, 1999: ``I do share your concern that the 100 percent hold-harmless provision undermines the apparent statutory intent that allocations for Title I and other programs be based on the most recent census data.'' 
   Three, a poor child is a poor child. Congress recognized that poor children need extra help, wherever that child may be. A poor child in California is as worthy as a poor child in Mississippi and should not be deprived of funding.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to note that since June 30 of this year, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has, once again, been allowed to lapse. As this body considers whether to enact a so-called ``extenders'' package, I want to urge my colleagues to include and pass a permanent extension of the Research and Experimentation tax credit. 
   The research and experimentation tax credit provides business an incentive to fund development of the technologies of tomorrow by providing a tax credit for investments in research. 
   The research and experimentation tax credit is an important element in the creation of strong economic growth and rising productivity. Industry leaders have credited it with spawning private enterprise investments. It is especially important to the high-tech and emerging growth industries that are driving the California economy. And, because it creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and experimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back the benefit of the credit. 
   Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and experimentation tax credit remains, inexplicably, a temporary tax provision requiring regular renewal. 
   In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four instances the research credit had expired before being renewed retroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six months. 
   This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business investment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, computers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will provide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy. 
   Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California economy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because of the critical role played by innovative research and development efforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries. 
   Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-over $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. Much of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake long-range and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies. Scores of California companies--and companies across the country--owe much of their success and growth to the incentive provided by the research and experimentation tax credit. 
   Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology development, and if we want to continue to replicate the successful growth that has characterized the U.S. economy during this past decade it is crucial that we create a permanent research and experimentation tax credit. 
   For example, Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, has expanded from a start-up company in 1990 to a company with over $50 million in revenue and 175 employees by the end of last year and is ranked by Deloitte Touche as one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley. According to a letter I received from Pericom, utilization of the research and experimentation tax credit has been key to their success, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand their technology base. 
   Indeed, according to a 1998 study conducted by the national accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP by nearly $58 billion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The productivity gains from a permanent extension will allow workers throughout the Nation to earn higher wages, and the additional tax revenue created by these new jobs will help pay back the benefit of the credit. 
   Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or environmental design, research and development are critical ingredients for fueling the process of economic growth. 
   Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for U.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace. For example, American biotechnology is the world leader in developing effective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical technologies for the 21st century. With other countries heavily-subsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. companies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to stay on top of breakthrough developments. 
   I recently received a letter from the CEO of Genentech, for example, in which he wrote:  
   The R&D tax credit is especially important to Genentech and our patients. Our newest therapy, Herceptin, which is used to treat metastatic breast cancer, is a prime example. The early clinical trials for Herceptin showed that it was a somewhat effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, but the results were not particularly robust. It was a classic case of a research project being ``on the bubble'' in terms of deciding whether to go forward into the most expensive phase of human clinical trials. However, because the value of the tax credit to Genentech directly means that we are able to move one additional drug candidate each year into clinical trials, we were able to move forward with the Phase III Herceptin clinical trial in late 1994. I dare say that without the R&D credit, Herceptin might well not have become a reality. Today, thousands of patients are receiving this important treatment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Most biotech research and development efforts are long term projects spanning five to ten years, sometimes more. The uncertainty created by the temporary and sporadic extensions is incompatible with the basic needs of biotech innovation--providing companies with a stable time frame to plan, launch, and conduct research activities. In the case of a promising but financially intensive research project, such unpredictability can make the difference as to whether the project is completed or abandoned. 
   Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in the past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how research and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, and even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from breakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to cleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax credit. 
   Over the past two decades the research and experimentation tax credit has proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs and in growing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled by remaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the uncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to work to make sure that any Senate tax bill contains a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President I am pleased to join my colleague Senator KYL in introducing the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act.'' 
   The control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. However, more and more, this burden is shifting to the states. The ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act'' (SCAAP II), properly shifts the fiscal burden of illegal immigration into the hands of the Federal Government. This bill builds upon the existing Federal obligations under the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program'' (SCAAP I) by providing $200 million for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to help border communities defray the indirect costs of illegal immigration, and an additional $200 million to help state and local governments cope with the cost of providing emergency medical care to illegal immigrants. 
   The issue of illegal immigration, is one of national consequence that requires a Federal response. Unfortunately, Federal reimbursements have consistently failed to cover the actual costs borne by States and local communities confronting the effects of illegal immigration. For those communities that continue to shoulder this burden, the control of illegal immigration has become an unfunded mandate. 
   Mr. President, while I consider illegal immigration an issue that pervades communities across the nation, I would like to share with my colleagues how this issue has affected my home State of California. As you might imagine, the border counties in California are among the hardest hit in terms of dollars spent on incarceration, court costs, and emergency medical care for those who have entered the U.S. illegally. 
   San Diego County, for example, spent an estimated $10.1 million in 1998 to cover the costs of illegal alien incarceration and spends an estimated $50 million annually to provide emergency medical care for illegal immigrants. Imperial County estimates that it spent more than $4 million last year in detention costs and another $1.36 million in emergency medical expenses. 
   I am greatly concerned about the disproportionate burden these costs impose on the criminal justice system, hospitals and residents of San Diego and Imperial Counties, especially given the counties' limited tax base and fiscal resources. Given what I have witnessed in my own state, it is not hard for me to understand the frustration and concern of communities in a growing number of other states. Similar burdens have fallen on border communities in states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Each year, the costs borne by states to respond to illegal immigration continue to soar, while Federal involvement remains minimal at best. 
   Unfortunately, we can only expect these costs for border states to swell over the next few years as border enforcement initiatives force illegal migration to shift further eastward from San Diego County to neighboring southern States and counties as well as to the more porous northern state borders. In launching Operation Gatekeeper, for example, the INS has  achieved considerable success in deterring illegal border crossings along the San Diego border. 
   At the same time, Gatekeeper has had the effect of shifting a large volume of migrant crossings to the more rugged East San Diego County mountain area and the desert region of Imperial County where there have been numerous instances of illegal immigrants in need of emergency care. One county hospital in El Centro, for example, reports that the Border Patrol has dropped off countless numbers of undocumented aliens found in the desert suffering from hypothermia or dehydration, or from broken limbs and fractured skulls as result of failed attempts at scaling the fence along the San Diego border. 
   The more ``fortunate'' border crossers are being detained at state and county jails. Although states receive Federal reimbursement for some of the direct costs of incarcerating adult illegal immigrants, the Federal Government does not reimburse states and localities for the indirect costs relating to the incarceration or the control of illegal aliens, including: court costs, county attorney costs, indigent defense, criminal juvenile detention, and unsupervised probation costs. Nor does it compensate state and local hospitals for the emergency medical care provided to illegal immigrants who are not in Federal custody. 
   Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the SCAAP II bill in hopes that it will alleviate some of the fiscal strains illegal immigration has imposed on border states and communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move it through the Senate.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Foreign Operations Conference Report and to express my disappointment that in passing this report the Committee has not provided funding for the U.S. commitment to the Wye River agreement. 
   This conference agreement, which provides $12.6 billion in funding, is nearly $2 billion below the President's request and $1 billion less than last year's bill. This low level of funding makes it all but impossible for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in the international community. Indeed, nearly every major account in the conference report is underfunded, including funding for voluntary international peacekeeping, the Peace Corps, Multilateral Development Banks, the Enhanced Threat Reduction Initiative, African development loan initiatives, the Global Environment Facility, and debt relief for the world's poorest countries. 
   Most troubling, one specific initiative, the Wye assistance for the Middle East peace process, is nonexistent. 
   As Israel and the Palestinian Authority move ahead with implementation of the Wye agreement and final status negotiations, it is vital that the United States also do its part in meeting its commitments and obligations. 
   On Monday I, and twenty-one of my colleagues, sent letters to the President and to the Majority and Minority leaders about the critical importance of meeting our Wye commitments. Let me tell you why I consider this to be such an important issue. 
   On September 4, 1999 Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian Authority President Arafat signed the Sharm el-Shiekh Memorandum, expediting the fulfillment of Israeli and Palestinian obligations under prior treaties, particularly the Wye agreement, and establishing a time line for the completion of final status negotiations by  September 13, 2000. Under this agreement: Israel has now relinquished an additional 7 percent of the West Bank, with 5 percent more slated for turnover to the Palestinian Authority later this year; Israel has released 199 Palestinian prisoners with another 150 scheduled for release later this year; Israel has started to open the Shuhada Road in Hebron; the Palestinian Authority has submitted its list of police; and, Israel and the Palestinian Authority have formally initiated final status negotiations. 
   Israel and the Palestinian Authority are meeting their obligations, and as Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority continue to make progress in these negotiations, it is all the more critical for the United States to provide the financial assistance and support that has been promised. 
   Whereas the first land transfer from Israel to the Palestinian Authority did not involve the movement of Israeli troops or bases, the next two planned transfers will involve the redeployment of troops, bases, and other infrastructure at considerable cost to Israel. In fact, there is some concern in Israel that if the U.S. is unable or unwilling to meet its commitments under Wye, the budget of the government of Israel will be thrown into chaos. 
   The United States has pledged to provide $1.2 billion to Israel, $400 million to the Palestinians, and $300 million to Jordan to assist them in meeting their obligations under the Wye accord, as well as for economic assistance for Jordan and areas under the Palestinian Authority. 
   The United States has a deep commitment to Israel and its Arab partners in the peace process to help advance negotiations and to help meet the financial burden placed on the parties in the peace process in meeting their obligations. We have undertaken this commitment both because it is the right thing to do and because it serves well vital U.S. national security interests. 
   The Wye agreement represents an important step on the road to peace in the Middle East. We must meet our obligations under Wye, and I do not believe that Congress should pass a Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that does not include such funding. 
   I do not believe that the United States can adequately pursue our national interests and foreign affairs priorities with this Conference Report. It will not allow the U.S. to continue to operate important international programs at current levels, will undoubtedly detract from the stature of the U.S. in the international community, and lets down our partners in the Middle East peace process. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this conference report.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to a problem my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have no doubt encountered--poor air quality on commercial airline flights. 
   Cabin environmental issues have been a part of air travel since the inception of commercial aircraft almost 70 years ago. However, with the exception of the ban on smoking on domestic flights in 1990, no major changes have occurred to improve the quality of air on commercial flights. 
   Commercial airplanes operate in an environment hostile to human life. According to Boeing, the conditions existing outside an airplane cabin at modern cruise altitudes off 35,000 feet, are no more survivable by humans than those conditions that would be encountered outside a submarine at extreme ocean depths. 
   To make air travel more conducive to passengers and flight crews, airplanes are equipped with advanced Environmental Control Systems. While these systems are designed to control cabin pressurization, ventilation and temperature control, they have not diminished the number of health complaints reported by travelers. 
   It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that the most common complaints from passengers and flight crew are headaches, dizziness, irritable eyes and noses, and exposure to cold and flu. With the amount we travel, I would not be surprised to learn some of my friends in the Senate have suffered some of these symptoms themselves. But complaints of illness do not stop there. Some passengers complaints are as serious as chest pains or nervous system disorders. This is a serious consideration and should be addressed. 
   Airlines say the most common complaints are a result of the reduction in humidity at high altitudes, or of individuals sitting in close proximity to one another. Airlines even say the air on a plane is better than the air in the terminal. But the airplane cabin is a unique, highly stressful environment. It's low in humidity, pressurized up to a cabin altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level and subject to continuous noise, vibration and accelerations in multiple directions. Air in the airplane cabin is not comparable with air in the airport terminal. It's apples and oranges. 
   The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers--or ASHRAE--recently released standards it found suitable for human comfort in a residential or office building. ASHRAE determined that environmental parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity--and nonenvironmental parameters such as clothing insulation and metabolism--all factored in to create a comfortable environment. Airlines immediately chimed in, saying average cabin temperatures and air factors fell within the ASHRAE guidelines for comfort. 
   But once again, the air in an airplane cabin is not comparable to air in an office building. The volume, air distribution system, air density, relative humidity, occupant density, and unique installations such as lavatories, galleys all make for a unique condition. The ASHRAE guidelines simply do not translate to the airplane cabin. 
   It is high time we make a concerted effort to study the air quality on our commercial flights and make some changes. Studies done by the airlines are simply not thorough enough. My amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation--in conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences--to conduct a study of the air on our flights. After completion of the 1-year study, the results will be reported to Congress. It is my sincere hope this will be a step toward more comfortable travel conditions for everyone. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to first thank our minority leader for all of his effort in bringing public attention to the plight of pending judicial nominees. 
   Thanks to Senator DASCHLE's efforts, we have made some progress. Jim Lorenz, a fine California attorney who served seven years on my judicial selection committee, was confirmed on Friday along with Victor Marrero of New York. 
   Jim Lorenz's confirmation will help address a desperate shortage of judges in the Southern District of California. I have spoken several times with Marilyn Huff, Chief Judge of the Southern District of California, about the District's caseload crisis. 
   A recent judicial survey ranked the Southern District as the most overburdened court in the country. The weighted average caseload in the Southern District is 1,006 cases per judge, more than twice the national average. 
   It is also a significant step forward for the Senate that we will have a vote tomorrow on Associate Attorney General, Ray Fisher, to be a Circuit Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. 
   Ray Fisher is an extraordinary nominee who will add some support to the skeleton crew of judges currently presiding on the Ninth Circuit. 
   Currently, the Ninth Circuit has seven vacancies, which is 25 percent of the total judgeship positions on the circuit. 
   Each one of these judicial vacancies qualifies as a judicial emergency. The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit reports that the Circuit could handle 750 more cases right now if the vacancies were filled. 
   Prior to his appointment as Associate Attorney General, Ray Fisher was considered one of the top trial lawyers in Southern California. His legal skills are so highly regarded that he recently was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers, an honor bestowed on only the top one percent of the profession. 
   During his 30 year career in private practice, Ray Fisher specialized in the toughest of cases, complex civil litigation, and in alternate dispute resolution. In 1988, he founded the Los Angeles Office of Heller Ehrman, White and McAullife, an office that has grown from 6 attorneys to 48. 
   The Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association has deemed Mr. Fisher ``Well Qualified'' for appointment as Judge of the United States Court of Appeals. 
   Ray Fisher graduated from Stanford Law School in 1966, where he was president of The Stanford Law Review and awarded the Order of the Coif. Following law school, he served as a law clerk for Judge J. Skelley Wright of United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. 
   I am confident Ray Fisher's acute interest in public service, specifically in public safety, and his overarching concern for fairness will serve the Ninth Circuit well. 
   However, I am disappointed that the Senate could not confirm other pending Ninth Circuit nominees. Ray Fisher is a start, but six vacancies remain on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Two of those vacancies should be filled by Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez. 
   It is a disturbing fact that women and minority nominees are having a difficult time getting confirmed by the Senate. 
   A report by the independent, bipartisan group Citizens for Independent Courts released last week found that during the 105th Congress, the average time between nomination and confirmation for male nominees was 184 days, while for women it was 249 days--a full 2 months longer. 
   This disturbing trend continues this year. Women and minorities constitute over 55 percent of the President's nominees in 1999; by contrast, only 41 percent of the nominees confirmed this year by the Senate are women or minorities. 
   All we have ever asked for Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez is that both nominees get an up-or-down vote. If a Senator has a problem with particular nominees, he or she should vote against them. But a nominee should not be held up interminably by a handful of Senators. 
   Let me assure my colleagues, this does not mark the end of a fight. At some point, legislation is not going to move until Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez get an up-or-down vote. Let me take a moment to discuss the nominations process that these two nominees have experienced. 
   Judge Richard Paez, the first Mexican-American District judge in Los Angeles, was nominated on January 25, 1996--almost four years ago. He still hasn't made it to the Senate Floor for a vote. Any problem with his nomination can't be with his legal background. 
   He has 17 years of judicial experience. The American Bar Association found him to be ``well-qualified.'' He is also strongly supported by the legal community in Los Angeles including Gil Garcetti, the District Attorney, the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. Judge Paez has described this interminable nominations process as a ``cloud'' hanging over his head. Litigants in his court constantly query him if the case is going to be continued, if his case is going to be assigned to someone else, or if Judge Paez is going to keep it. No nominee should have to face this uncertainty. His family has been thrust into the public limelight, and for four years every action he has taken has been subject to microscopic scrutiny. 
   Marsha Berzon was nominated almost a year and a half ago. She had her first hearing on July 30, 1998, and a second hearing in June 1999. Only in July 1999 was she reported out of committee and her nomination is pending before the Senate. Nationally renowned appellate attorney with over 20 years of appellate practice, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Brennan and U.S. Court of Appeals Judge James Browning. She graduated Order of the Coif from Boalt Hall, has the support of law enforcement including the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) and the International Union of Police Organizations, has strong bipartisan support including former Idaho Senator James Mclure and former EPA Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus. 
   The slow pace of this nomination has caused an incredible burden on Marsha Berzon both personally and professionally. Due to uncertainty over her future, she has significantly curtailed her private practice, and no longer is representing clients before the Supreme Court or the Ninth Circuit. 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist recently said that ``[t]he Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' 
   Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon do not deserve to have their distinguished  careers and personal lives held in limbo. Our institutional integrity requires an up-or-down vote. 
   Until Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez get votes, this nominations process will remain tainted. 
   I assure my colleagues in the Senate that the nominations of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez will not fade away. We will keep pressing for these nominees until they get the vote they deserve.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Senator MURRAY, is a no-brainer. I want to say why I believe it is a no-brainer and why I believe it is prudent for the Senate to move ahead with it and approve it today. 
   The Federal share of elementary and secondary education in this country has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent of the share going to schools in 1998. Let me say this another way. Back in 1980, we funded 14 percent of elementary and secondary education needs; in 1998, we funded 6 percent of those needs. 
   Essentially what Senator MURRAY is trying to do is raise the appropriation level by $200 million and say let's go do it. 
   What does she want to do? She says, let's reduce class size. What does that mean? In 1999, we spent $1.2 billion on the first installment of hiring 100,000 new teachers all across this great country. The United States could hire 30,000 teachers under that appropriation; my State, California, could hire 3,322 teachers. President Clinton's request for this year, FY 2000, was $1.4 billion. That meant the United States could  hire 8,000 teachers to continue that and California could hire an additional 1,100 teachers. 
   The recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member, is $1.2 billion. How the money would be used is not specified. The legislation reads that it is for ``teacher assistance'' and that it can only be appropriated if it receives the authorizing legislation. 
   Senator MURRAY's amendment adds $200 million and deletes the contingency language. Therefore, with the passage of this amendment, the United States could hire 8,000 new teachers all across this great land. For my State, California, that means 1,100 additional teachers. That is important. Class size reduction is important. 
   I think there are three things that can be done to improve education: 
   One, elimination of the practice of social promotion, under which youngsters are promoted from grade to grade even when they fail, even when they don't show up in class, even when there are major disciplinary problems and youngsters are not learning. But they are still promoted. This has come to denigrate the value of a high school diploma all across this great land. 
   We also have large class sizes. California has some of the largest classes in the Union. I have been in elementary schools, K through 6, with 5,000 students in the school. In California, in some schools, students speak 50 different languages, which adds additional burdens on the teachers. No one can learn adequately in overcrowded classes with overburdened teachers. 
   Because of the challenge of diversity, of the need for additional English training, of the challenge of tightened core curriculum standards, smaller class sizes across this land makes sense. I don't think there is anyone in the Nation who has a youngster in public school who wouldn't say: My youngster can learn better in a class size that is smaller. 
   That is what this money will go to--reducing class size. Class size reduction, school size reduction, elimination of social promotion, and more qualified teachers across this land can make a huge difference in the accountability and excellence of education for our youngsters. 
   My State has 6 million students, more students than 36 States have in total population. We have one of the highest projected enrollments in the United States. California will need 210,000 new teachers by 2008--210,000 new teachers. How could I say, let's 
   wait and authorize this some other time? We don't even know whether there will be an elementary and secondary education bill this session. We have an opportunity to address a big problem in education right now. I would hazard a guess that States such as that of the Presiding Officer, Ohio, could also benefit from small class size reduction. 
   The Murray amendment essentially provides $200 million in additional funds and specifically says the funds will go for class size reduction and the hiring of this additional increment of teachers. That is why I say it is a no-brainer. The need is there; the need is clear. Every parent knows their child is better educated in a smaller setting than a larger setting in elementary school. Why not do it? 
   California needs to build six new classrooms a day--$809 million a year just in our State--to be able to meet demand. It is a huge obligation. Our teachers are actually spending $1,000 a year out of their own pockets to pay for books, Magic Markers, scissors, and other school supplies. Our needs are huge. 
   I think reducing class size, increasing the amount of Federal dollars that go to the schools for education, is something we should do, and something we should do forthwith. We should do it because we face an emergency in our schools. 
   I commend Senator MURRAY for her effort in this. Mr. President, $200 million more dollars can help get the job done. We have an opportunity, and we should use it. 
   I also take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, as well as the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member. I actually think this is a good bill in terms of dollars. It has at least $2 billion more for health research. This bill probably includes the largest single priority bill of the American people. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee. I compliment the ranking member, the Senator from Iowa. We may have some differences over how the money should be spent, we may have some differences over stem cell research or some of the specific wording of the bill, but the bill does provide many of the necessary dollars. 
   I will speak at a later time on the health aspects of the bill. I ask unanimous consent I be afforded 15 minutes after this vote on the amendment to be able to speak on the health aspects of this bill.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to clarify that children receiving health insurance under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in states like California are eligible for free vaccines under the 1993 Federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. 
   I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI who is introducing a companion bill in the House today. 
   I am introducing this bill because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as 528,000 children in California have lost or will lose their eligibility to receive free vaccines, under California's Healthy Families program. Approximately 169,000 kids have lost eligibility to date. 
   California ranks 37th overall among States having children fully immunized by the age of 18 to 24 months. From 1993 to 1997, Orange County, California, had 85 hospitalizations and four deaths related to chicken pox. Across the State in 1996 there were 15 deaths and 1,172 hospitalizations related to chicken pox. More recently, the Immunization Branch in California reports that in 1998 over 1,000 whooping cough cases, including 5 deaths, were reported--the largest number of cases and deaths since the 1960's. Whooping cough and chicken pox are diseases for which there are vaccinations. We must do more to increase access to vaccinations for our nation's children. 
   The Federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in 1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In 1998, as many 743,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or on Medicaid, received these vaccines. This number is down by approximately 32,000 children in comparison to the 1997 immunization figures for California's poor children. California received $80.3 million in 1999 from the Federal Government to provide vaccines. 
   Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than immunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--diseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows that vaccines are fundamental to children's 
   good health. 
   Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the program, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can take to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold them from children who (1) have been getting them when they were uninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become insured. 
   According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of California's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the fact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Our uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 24 percent, the third highest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. As for children, 1.85 million or 19 percent of our children are without health insurance, compared to 15 percent nationally, according to UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need. 
   In creating the new children's health insurance program in California, the state chose to set up a program under which the state contracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible children care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, HHS has interpreted this form of ``health insurance'' as making them ``insured,'' as defined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for the federal vaccines. I disagree. 
   It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress made eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, children who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe that in defining the term ``insured'' at that time Congress clearly meant private health insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's new Healthy Families program are participating in a federal-state, subsidized insurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families apply to the state for participation. They are not insured by a private, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the Vaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B). On February 23, the California Medical Association wrote to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, ``As they are participants in a federal and state-subsidized health program, these individuals are not ``insured'' for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).'' 
   The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is administering the new program with the Department of Health Services, wrote to HHS on February 5, ``It is imperative that states like California, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same support and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at no cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.'' The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, ``More than half a million California children should not be deprived of vaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality .....,'' calling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.'' 
   Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper childhood  immunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help me keep our children healthy.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan by May 1, 2000 for bringing all underground storage tanks into compliance with federal safety requirements. 
   Why do we need this amendment? 
   Leaking underground storage tanks are the leading source of groundwater contamination and petroleum is the most common substance leaking out. Most of the 825,000 regulated underground tanks in this country store petroleum products, from the local gas station on your neighborhood corner to the industrial complex using a large motor fleet. 
   I am offering this amendment to make underground storage tanks safe as a way to stop the contamination of drinking water by the gasoline additive MTBE. 
   What is MTBE? MTBE is methyl tertiary butyl ether, a gasoline additive. It is used by most refiners to make oxygenated or reformulated gasoline. It is the oxygenate of choice by refiners who sell gasoline in areas that need clean-burning gasoline to meet or maintain clean air standards. The major way MTBE gets into groundwater is from defective underground tanks storing petroleum products. 
   What's Wrong with MTBE?

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 
   today I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover screening tests for cancer. The bill requires plans to cover screening tests that are currently available and for which there is broad consensus on their value. To address future changes in scientific knowledge and medical practice, the bill allows the Secretary to change the requirements upon the Secretary's initiative or upon petition by a private individual or group. This bill is a companion to H.R. 1285, introduced by Representatives CAROLYN B. MALONEY and SUE KELLY. 
   A major way to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths and increase survival is to increase screening rates. The American Cancer Society predicts that the annual cancer death rate this year--563,100 Americans--will equal five Boeing 747 jumbo jets crashing every day for a year. Because early detection can save lives, requiring plans to cover detection tests can decrease the number of people who die each year from cancer. 
   To put cancer deaths in perspective, the number of Americans that die each year from cancer exceeds the total number of Americans lost to all wars that we have fought in this century. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 1 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States this year, including 132,500 in California. 
   Despite our increasing understanding of cancer, unless we act with urgency, the cost to the United States is likely to become unmanageable in the next 10-20 years. The incidence rate of cancer in 2010 is estimated to increase by 29 percent for new cases, and cancer deaths are estimated to increase by 25 percent. Cancer will surpass heart disease as the leading fatal disease in the U.S. by 2010. With our aging U.S. population, unless we act now to change current cancer incidence and death rates, according to the September 1998 report from the Cancer March Research Task Force, we can expect over 2.0 million new cancer cases and 1.0 million deaths per year by 2025. Listen to these startling statistics: 
   One out of every four deaths in the U.S. is caused by cancer. 
   This year approximately 563,100 Americans are expected to die of cancer--more than 1,500 people a day. 
   There have been approximately five million cancer deaths since 1990. 
   Approximately 12 million new cancer cases have been diagnosed since 1990. 
   The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 8.2 million Americans alive today have a history of cancer. 
   One out of every two men, one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. 
   Too many Americans die each year from cancer. The tragedy is that we have tools available which can prevent much unnecessary suffering and death. Early detection--finding cancer early before it has spread--gives a person the best chance of being treated successfully. Early screening for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer can increase survival rates. Having insurance coverage for cancer screenings is a major way of encouraging people to get examinations and tests. 
   Screening examinations, if given on an appropriate schedule by a health care professional, have proven their value. Screening-accessible cancers, such as cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis, and skin, account for approximately half of all new cancer cases. The five-year relative survival rate for these cancers is about 81 percent. According to the American Cancer Society, if all Americans participated in regular cancer screening, this rate could increase to more than 95 percent. For example, people can have colon cancer long before they know it. They may not have any symptoms. Patients diagnosed by a colon cancer screening have a 90 percent chance of survival while patients not diagnosed until symptoms are apparent only have a 8 percent chance of survival. 
   Finding cancers in their early stages can mean that treatment is less expensive. Treatment of breast, lung, and prostate cancers account for over half of annual medical costs, which by National Institutes of Health estimates is $37 billion annually. 
   A colon cancer screening costs approximately $125-$300.00. If a patient is not diagnosed with colon cancer until symptoms are apparent, care during the remaining 4-5 years of life can cost up to $100,000. Similarly, the initial average cost of treating rectal cancer that is detected early is about $5,700. This is approximately 75 percent less than the estimated $30,000-$40,000 it costs to treat rectal cancer that is further along in its development. 
   The cost of lost productivity due to cancer is $11 billion annually, while the cost of lost productivity due to premature death is $59 billion annually. We can't afford not to screen. 
   Insurance coverage is a major determinant in whether people obtain preventive screenings. In short, when screenings are covered by plans, people are more likely to get them. In California, screening rates for cervical and breast cancer are lower for uninsured women, who are less likely to have had a recent screening and more likely to have gone longer without being screened than women with coverage. 
   According to a University of California-Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research study from February 1998, in California women ages 18-64, 63 percent of uninsured women had not had a Pap test during 1997 versus 40 percent of insured women. Additionally, approximately 67 percent of uninsured Californian women ages 30-64 had not had a clinical breast examination during 1997, compared to 40 percent for insured women in the same age group. 
   In 1997, Congress added cancer screening coverage under Medicare for certain cancers, such as breast and cervical. Medicare beneficiaries now receive cancer screenings without having to pay out-of-pocket for such tests. Americans under the age of 65 who are privately insured deserve the same health care. Under Medicaid, preventive services are optional benefit. States can choose to cover them or not so coverage varies state to state. 
   All Americans deserve access to cancer screening, regardless of whether one has health insurance because they are an employee of the Department of Defense, a Medicare beneficiary, or a veteran. Certainly individuals who have private health insurance through their employers--56 percent of Californians have private health insurance--should be guaranteed access to life-saving and life-prolonging cancer screenings. Offering coverage for cancer screening simply makes good sense. 
   The bill requires plans to cover screenings according to current guidelines: 
   Annual mammograms for women ages 40 and over and for women under 40 who are at high risk of developing breast cancer. 
   Annual clinical breast exams for women ages 40 and over and for women between the ages of 20 and 40 who are at high risk of developing breast cancer. 
   Clinical breast exams every three years for women who are between the ages of 20 and 40 and are not at high risk for developing breast cancer. 
   Annual pap tests and pelvic examinations for women ages 18 and over or women who are under the age of 18 and are or have been sexually active. 
   Screening procedures for men and women ages 50 and over or under age 50 and at high risk for developing colorectal cancer, including annual screening fecal-occult blood test and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy every 4 years. 
   Men and women at high risk for colorectal cancer (in any age group) may receive a screening colonoscopy every 2 years. 
   Annual digital rectal examination and/or annual prostate-specific blood test for men ages 50 and over or males who are at high risk. 
   The bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify coverage requirements to reflect changes in medical practice or new scientific knowledge, based both on the  Secretary's own initiative or upon petition of an individual or organization. 
   Cancer touches virtually every American in some way. The Comprehensive Cancer Screening Act can be one way to alleviate the fear and reality of cancer felt by millions of Americans. We all want to believe that when a family member is diagnosed with cancer, he or she will get care of the highest quality and that their medical team will conquer this disease. Early detection, while it does not prevent cancer from occurring, can stop cancer before it spreads, extend life, reduce treatment costs, and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. By requiring private health plans to cover cancer screening as a preventive measure, my bill is cost effective and could ease the cancer burden felt by America due to lost productivity related to cancer deaths and illness. 
   It is long past due for this Congress to send a strong message to insurance companies. Cancer screening is an important prevention measure and should be covered under all insurance plans. America cannot afford not to screen.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to FEMA's proposed Public Assistance Insurance Rule that is currently pending at the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is referenced in the report language of both the House and Senate VA/HUD Appropriations bills. 
   I support FEMA's efforts to reduce the costs of federal disasters. However, the proposed rule, in its current form, would require public institutions to purchase ``all hazard'' insurance for public buildings. This includes local school districts, cities, non-profit hospitals, universities and other non-profits. 
   California risk managers and insurance brokers have told me there currently is no insurance available to public institutions. They would be unable to obtain, at any price, the coverage required by the FEMA rule. 
   Even if insurance were to be available, it is highly unlikely that the individual insurers would be able to pay out in the event of a catastrophic earthquake. The financial implications for California are enormous and should be considered before implementing the proposed FEMA rule. 
   During Committee markup, I was told by Senator BOND that cities and counties that could not obtain hazard insurance would be exempt from the FEMA rule. FEMA says this is not the case. I believe the FEMA proposal is ambiguous in many areas and it needs to be more thoroughly examined. I am concerned that FEMA may be rushing to implement this regulation without a thorough understanding of its true impact. 
   The House VA-HUD bill requests a GAO study of this issue before moving forward with the proposed rule. The Senate bill makes no mention of a GAO study, and supports the proposed rule change. It is my sincere hope that we can work together to develop an approach similar to that of the House. I believe that we must have an independent analysis of this important and potentially costly issue before it is finalized.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was dismayed to learn that the Senate  Interior Appropriations budget has zeroed out funding to the State of California for its share of the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve Settlement. By right, the State should receive $36 million this year. This is the money that California gives to retired teachers whose pensions have been most seriously eroded by inflation. 
   Here is the brief history of the issue: In 1996, Congress authorized the sale of Elk Hills Naval Reserve. However, a portion of the property consisted of more than 1300 acres of school lands owned by the state of California. Until the California's land claims were resolved, the sale could not go forward. Ultimately the Federal Government reached an agreement with California in which the state released its claim in exchange for installment payments over a seven-year period. 
   The settlement allowed the federal government to sell the reserve for $3.65 billion. California kept its part of the bargain. Now the Federal government must meet its obligations. Last year the first installment of the $36 million was paid. But six years of installments remain. 
   Actually, the money needed to compensate the state had been waiting in escrow. 
   The House has properly allocated $36 million in the House Interior Appropriations Bill. 
   I am hopeful that the Senate will also recognize the importance of keeping the Federal government's end of the bargain. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the House appropriation of $36 million be upheld in Conference.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD for all their hard work on the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   In 1994, I authored the Desert Protection Act, which created two new national parks, Joshua Tree and Death Valley along with the Mojave National Preserve and 100 wilderness areas; thereby promising to protect more than 6 million acres of desert property. However, these parks and wilderness areas still contain hundreds of thousands of acres of private inholdings. 
   Earlier this year, the Wildlands Conservancy, a California non-profit, negotiated a one-time deal whereby nearly 500,000 acres of these inholdings, many of which are owned by the Catellus Corporation would be purchased by matching $36 million in funds from the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund with $26 million in private donations. 
   Catellus, the Wildlands Conservancy, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management subsequently signed a letter of intent to sell to the Federal Government up to 437,000 acres of California desert owned by Catellus. An additional 20,000 acres of property owned by others within Joshua Tree National Park would be bought and preserved. 
   All told, up to 483,000 acres of private inholdings in the California Desert will be acquired, ensuring public access to over 4 million acres of Federal national parks and wilderness areas in the California Desert. 
   The location of these particular inholdings are significant because this area serves as the gateway for both private landowners and for people who wish to use the public portions of the preserve. Acquiring this checkerboard of inholdings is the only to assure public access for the lands provided for in the California Desert Protection Act. 
   If the government does not purchase these lands the Historic Mojave Road and the East Mojave Heritage Trail are likely to be closed and it is also possible that there will be no more public access to large portions of the Mojave! 
   Government acquisition of these lands will protect endangered species habitat, keep the fragile Desert ecosystem intact, and improve recreation opportunities and access for millions of Americans. 
   This proposal enjoys overwhelming support from community activists, conservationists, private industry, elected officials, Democrats, Republicans, and everyone who recognizes what a great deal this is for the U.S. Government. In fact, even most opponents of the California Desert Protection Act support this appropriation because of the issue of public access. If these lands are not purchased by the government, 1,500 miles of roads will be closed off to hunters, recreationists and the general public. 
   This Interior Appropriations bill contains a line item of $15.1 million for the phase 1 purchase of these lands. Presently, there is no allocation in the House Interior Appropriations bill to fulfill the Federal Government's end of the bargain. These purchases have been held hostage in the House as a result of an unrelated U.S. Army expansion. Although this military issue does not directly affect any of the Catellus land holdings, it is preventing the appropriation of the necessary funding to execute these land purchases. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Conference committee to ensure that the government follow through on its commitment to purchase these lands.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, as a Senator representing California, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, I have to say a word or two on this subject. 
   First, I believe the chairman of our committee, Senator HATCH, has been very fair with respect to these judges. I believe he has tried his level best to move the calendar along. 
   I think what we on this side are encountering is the holding up of judges, particularly on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, for years on end. That must stop. A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them down. To keep them hanging on--the court has 750 cases waiting for a judge. These judges are necessary. If someone has opposition to a judge, which I believe to be the case in at least one, they should come to the floor and say that. 
   It is also my understanding and my desire to ask that there be some commitment from the other side as to when specifically the nominations of Judge Paez, Marsha Berzon, and Ray Fisher, pending on this calendar--  Judge Paez pending for 4 years; Marsha Berzon through two sessions now--can at least be brought to the floor for a vote. 
   I am prepared to vote on the judges that the majority leader mentioned. I am prepared to vote affirmatively, but I can't do that unless I have some knowledge that judges who have stood on this calendar for years can be brought up before this body for a vote. I don't think that is too much to ask the other side to do. 
   What this does to a judge's life is, it leaves them in limbo--I should say, a nominee's life--whether they have a place to live, whether they are going to make a move. It is our job to confirm these judges. If we don't like them, we can vote against them. That is the honest thing to do. If there are things in their background, in their abilities that don't pass muster, vote no. 
   I think every one of us on this side is prepared for that. The problem is, we have a few people who prevent them from having a vote, and this goes on month after month, year after year. 
   The ranking member of the committee said something that I believe is concurred in on this side; that is, women and minorities have an inordinately difficult time having their nominations processed in an orderly and expeditious way. I don't think that befits this body. 
   What I am asking for, as a Senator from California, on these three judges, is to just tell us when we might see their nominations before the Senate for a vote up or down. I think there is also an understanding by the White House that will be the case as well. 
   I ask the majority party to please take this into consideration, allow us a vote up or down, and give us a time when this might happen. 
   Once again, I thank the ranking member and the chairman of the committee. I know the Senator from Utah has done everything he possibly can to move these nominations. I, for one, very much appreciate it. I am hopeful the leadership of his side will be able to give us some accommodation on this. 
   Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I first began to believe that global warming was a major threat in 1998 when a 92-mile long and 30-mile wide iceberg broke loose from the Antarctic Ice Shelf. It was 1 1/2 times the size of Delaware. NOAA said it was a possible indicator of global warming. 
   I began to take a look at some of the other things that have happened in the last few years. I find that we have the first species extinction in Costa Rica because of it. I find that it now has an impact on the El Nino cycle in the Pacific Ocean. I find that there is a serious degradation of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, and 70 percent of the existing coral reefs are affected. 
   I am a SUV owner. I own three jeeps. I love my jeeps. I have no doubt, though, that my jeeps can have the same kind of fuel efficiency standards as my automobile. 
   Then you have to look and say, well, if my three jeeps have the same kind of fuel efficiency, what would that do for global warming? 
   Carbon dioxide is the main culprit in global warming. Our country is the largest emitter and producer of carbon dioxide in the world. The United States saves 3 million barrels of oil because of fuel efficiency standards. If SUVs, similar to my jeeps, had fuel efficiency standards equal to those of automobiles, we would save another 1 million barrels of oil a day. If the 8 million or so of the other SUVs around the United States and the light trucks had these same standards, it would eliminate 187 million tons of CO2 from the air. The experts have said it is the largest single thing, bar none, that we can do to influence global warming in a positive way. 
   It seems so easy to do it. We know it can be done. We know it need not influence the efficiency of the engines. And we know there is technology that can make it so. 
   So raising these so-called CAFE standards or fuel efficiency standards so the SUVs are equal to other passenger automobiles at about 27 miles per gallon instead of 20 miles per gallon does not seem to me to be an unrealistic thing to ask Detroit to do. But instead, since 1995, there has been a rider in this bill which says to the Government that we can't even look, we can't even study, and we can't even make any findings to see whether, in fact, it is possible to bring SUVs up to automobile standards with respect to fuel efficiency. 
   I believe very strongly that this is the largest single positive environmental step this Congress can take to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. To have a rider in a bill which says you can't even study it, you can't even see if what I am saying is true, I think makes no sense whatsoever. 
   As I say, I love my three jeeps. But I will tell you, I am going to look for a sports utility vehicle that has equal fuel efficiency standards in the future. 
   Additionally, what would this do for the consumer? It is estimated that by simply requiring SUVs to meet the same average CAFE requirements as automobiles would save the consumer more than $2,000 in fuel costs over the life of each vehicle. It seems to me that is a pretty easy way to give people almost a kind of tax rebate. You save money buying fuel for your car because you buy less of it over the life of the car. And it is estimated those savings are $2,000 per vehicle. 
   More importantly, 117 million Americans live where smog sometimes makes the air unsafe to breathe where asthma is on the increase and where respiratory problems are developing. Almost one-half of this pollution is caused by so-called nonpoint sources. That means the automobile. Attempting to improve the efficiency of vehicles we drive helps address this problem as well. 
   There is no substantive evidence to support the fact that this would provide technological problems that Detroit cannot meet. 
   I hasten to point out, we do not include in this amendment, and the intent of this amendment is not to include, agricultural equipment that works on agricultural products in fields. However, with this amendment we would learn a couple of things. One, the air would be cleaner. Consumers would save significant money in fuel costs--$2,000 over the life of each vehicle--and we would go a long way to address the problem of global warming. 
   I am hopeful that this measure will pass today. 
   I view with some surprise the degree to which this measure is being lobbied by automobile interests in this country. As an SUV car owner, as a jeep lover, as someone who would like to buy additional cars, this is an important point to me. It seems to me some automobile company ought to be willing to address it, to bring these SUVs up to automobile standards. 
   I stand strongly in support of the amendment. I thank my colleagues, Senator BRYAN, Senator GORTON, and others, who also support the amendment. I am hopeful there will be enough Senators to say: Let's not go about this with blinders; let's take one good look and see if this is really possible; let's do the necessary studies; let's work together to do the largest single thing we can do, relatively painlessly, to reduce global warming. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of the things I have found is the use of ``CAFE'' which we bandy around so much--most people don't know exactly what that means. We are really talking about the efficiency of a gallon of gas to go farther. Therefore, the efficiency of a gallon of gas is what we are talking about and applying those standards to SUVs as you would to passenger sedans.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of the things that I think is particularly disingenuous about the opposition is that if SUVs and light trucks had the same fuel efficiency or even an increased fuel efficiency, it would impair the functioning of the car and the vehicle would not be able to function at optimal standards. 
   Would the Senator reflect on this for the Senate?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I commend and thank the Senator for answering my questions. I appreciate it very much. If he would allow me one brief comment. 
   I think one of the reasons that for awhile the American automobile had lost the cutting edge was the reluctance to do research and development to develop those kinds of automobile products that became very popular, that were produced by the Japanese marketplace. Since then, the American automotive companies have changed dramatically. The very kind of innovation that was absent for so long has now been restored. So it would seem to me any innovation in weight or size or engine capacity could very easily overcome these problems and that these vehicles could function as efficiently. I will point out it is the largest single thing we could do to alleviate global warming. So I thank the Senator from Nevada.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to address Senate Joint Resolution 33, regarding the President's granting of conditional clemency to certain Puerto Rican prisoners. 
   Before addressing the merits of this resolution, I must note that I am troubled by the procedure which has been employed for its consideration. Almost two weeks ago, Senator COVERDELL announced that he would hold a hearing on President Clinton's decision in the Terrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, this coming Wednesday, September 15. Last Wednesday, the Judiciary Committee also gave notice of a hearing on this subject for September 15. However, notwithstanding these planned hearings, the Republican leadership filed this resolution condemning the clemency and scheduled a vote related to it for today. 
   Holding a vote before the hearings is akin to having the verdict first, and then the trial. 
   Nevertheless, since we must vote, I will address the merits of the President's decision, based upon the information which is available to me before the hearings. 
   At the outset, let me say that serious, thoughtful people urged the President to offer this clemency. These people include former President Carter; eleven Nobel Peace Prize winners, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Coretta Scott King; and dozens of religious leaders and organizations. President Clinton's decision was not a frivolous one, nor did it appear from out of thin air. 
   However, that having been said, I believe strongly that the decision the President made was the wrong one. 
   In the post-Cold War era, terrorism presents perhaps the greatest threat to our national security. As Ranking Member of the Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I have done what I can to assist law enforcement in combating terrorism. 
   These prisoners were terrorists, and granting them leniency is exactly the wrong thing to do. We have tried in recent years to send a clear, unequivocal message to terrorists: if you plan or commit acts of terrorism against the United States, we will find you, hunt you down, and punish you severely. Until this point, President Clinton's administration carried this message forward forcefully, including, for example, apprehending and punishing the Oklahoma City bombers and taking retaliatory strikes against Osama bin laden. However, the President's decision last month undermines this message. 
   Some have described these prisoners as political prisoners. They were not. They were terrorists. Let me describe for a minute some of what they did. 
   These prisoners were members of the FALN, the Armed Forces for National Liberation, which seeks to make Puerto Rico and independent nation, through violent means. While some of them will not admit it, this was alleged and proven in the trials against them. 
   According to the FBI, and I quote, ``In the past, Puerto Rican terrorist groups struggling for Puerto Rico's independence from the United States have been responsible for the majority of terrorist incidents perpetrated by domestic terrorist groups within the United States.'' The FBI's Terrorist Research and Analytical Center reported in 1996 that the ``FALN has been linked to over 130 bombings which have resulted in over $3.5 million in damages, 5 deaths, and 84 injuries.'' 
   The prisoners who received clemency were active participants in this campaign of terror. For instance, Alejandrina Torres, Edwin Cortes and Alberto Rodriguez were convicted of conspiring to, and I read now from the indictment against them, ``oppose by force the authority of the government of the United States by means of force, terror and violence, including the construction and planting of explosive and incendiary devices at banks, stores, office buildings and government buildings ..... It was a further part of the said conspiracy that the conspirators would claim credit in the name of the FALN for certain ..... bombings through either telephone calls or typed communiques.'' This is classic terrorist activity. 
   As part of this plot, Torres and Cortes stockpiled dynamite, weapons, blasting caps and bulletproof vests. Together with Rodriguez, they planned to bomb U.S. military facilities in the Chicago, cased the facilities, and reviewed a communique to be published in conjunction with the planned bombings. They built bombs containing 21 pounds of dynamite. They also planned to use explosives to free FALN leader Oscar Lopez (who also was offered clemency by the President) from prison, to rob a Chicago Transit Authority facility to fund FALN operations, and to harbor another FALN leader who had escaped from prison. 
   Four others who were offered clemency were convicted in connection with  the armed robbery of seven million dollars from a Wells Fargo depot, to fund a similar Puerto Rican revolutionary independence group, Los Macheteros. This is an organization that ambushed a Navy bus and killed two U.S. servicemen and launched a rocket attack at the federal courthouse in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. 
   Madam President, building bombs and committing armed robberies on U.S. soil are not political acts. They are crimes, plain and simple, and these people were appropriately locked up for their offenses. It should make no difference that the prisoners had political motivations which some may share. Virtually all terrorists are politically motivated, and many justify their acts in the cause of ``national liberation.'' But terrorism is a cowardly and evil means to achieve such ends, which can never be justified, and which must be punished harshly. 
   It has been reported that the clemency petition was opposed by the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons. The Fraternal Order of Police has vehemently condemned this offer, calling it a ``horrendously bad idea.'' 
   Clemency proponents have asserted that these prisoners harmed no one. A former Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted some of these FALN members counters this assertion, noting: ``A few dedicated federal agents are the only people who stood in their way. The conspirators made every effort to murder and to maim. It is no small irony that they should be freed under the guise of humanitarianism.'' 
   History has shown us that making concessions to terrorists spurs increased terrorism. The President made the wrong decision. I hope and pray that his decision will not have this effect, but I fear it will. 
   Despite the flawed procedure, I will vote to proceed to Senate Joint Resolution 33, and I will subsequently vote for its passage. Terrorism does not deserve leniency.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was pleased yesterday when President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia agreed to work with the United Nations to allow international peacekeepers to restore peace and stability to East Timor. The reprehensible wave of violence that engulfed East Timor in the week following the announcement of the August 30 referendum was inexcusable, and demands the harshest condemnation by the international community. 
   But, more importantly, the international community must now work to bring an immediate end to the violence in East Timor, protect refugees, safeguard humanitarian aid for displaced persons, and work with Indonesian troops already in East Timor to see to it that they fulfill their mission of protecting the East Timorese. 
   On August 30, close to 98 percent of the eligible voters of East Timor went to the polls for the United Nations sponsored vote on East Timor's autonomy. This vote was in keeping with the May 5 agreements between Indonesia, Portugal, and the United Nations regarding the future of East Timor. 
   On September 4, the Secretary General of the United Nations announced the outcome of the August 30 vote, and the results show that the people of East Timor have spoken with a clear voice: 78.5 percent rejected autonomy in favor of complete independence from Indonesia. 
   Under the May 5 agreements, if East Timor opted for independence, the Government of Indonesia committed itself to a process of peaceful and constitutional change, in which the United Nations would oversee the transition to independence for East Timor. 
   Unfortunately, following the Secretary General's announcement of the clear, overwhelming, and freely-expressed choice of the East Timor people, anti-independence militias, backed by the Indonesian military and police, began a systematic and organized campaign of terror, violence and intimidation in an effort to overturn the will of the people of East Timor. 
   The criminal action undertaken by the militias and their backers in the Indonesian military are reprehensible: mass looting, arson, systematic destruction of infrastructure, and most disturbing of all, murder. 
   According to the United Nations, hundreds, and possibly thousands, have been killed and more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. There are also reports of mass killings and a systematic campaign of political assassination. 
   The May 5 Agreements between the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal and the United Nations mandated the popular vote on the offer of autonomy and clearly delegated responsibility for peace and security before, during and after the ballot process to the Government of Indonesia. And the Government of Indonesia freely agreed to take on that responsibility. 
   Yet, in the face of widespread violence, the Indonesian army and police forces have stood aside and, worse, assisted the anti-independence militias. I, like many of my colleagues, was startled by the Government of Indonesia's unwillingness or inability to control its own military forces and police in East Timor. 
   Now that the Government of Indonesia has agreed to work with the United Nations to restore peace to East Timor, there is much work to be done. 
   First, I am heartened by the willingness of the Australian government to lead peacekeeping efforts to restore peace in security to East Timor, by the willingness of the states of ASEAN to participate in this peacekeeping mission, and by the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to engage the Government of Indonesia to address these issues. The United States, along with our partners in the United Nations and the international community, must be responsive to these efforts and provide appropriate assistance. 
   Second, I believe that it is essential that the international community condemns the acts of violence that have occurred in East Timor in the past week--as it has in Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, and elsewhere--and urge a complete investigation into any criminal acts with those responsible being brought to justice. 
   Third, now that the Government of Indonesia has agreed to allow international peacekeepers into East Timor, I am hopeful that it will continue to work with the United Nations to implement the August 30th vote and safeguard East Timor's transition to independence. The United States and the international community must remain engaged and involved with this transition, and strongly encourage the Government of Indonesia to make those changes that the people of East Timor in the August 30 referendum overwhelmingly supported. 
   Lastly, I believe that President Clinton's decision to review U.S. international financial and military assistance to Indonesia in the context of the violence in East Timor was wholly appropriate, and that Jakarta must understand that as much as we value our relations with the people of Indonesia, future U.S. assistance will depend on  their continued cooperation with the international community in resolving this deplorable situation. 
   Mr. President, the people of East Timor have made their feelings clear. They want a peaceful transition to independence. The Government of Indonesia has made a commitment that they would grant the people of East Timor independence and oversee a peaceful transition. As the Government of Indonesia has belatedly recognized, it must live up to its commitments. The international community can play a crucial role in providing support and helping guarantee the security of the people of East Timor in this transition to independence. We must not let them down.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators BOXER, MIKULSKI, AKAKA, BINGAMAN, and SARBANES in submitting a resolution to condemn all prejudice against individuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United States, and to support the full participation by such individuals in the political and civic affairs of the United States. 
   Given some of the recent reactions and media coverage of the Cox committee report and campaign finance allegations, this resolution expresses the sense of Congress that no individual or institution of the United States should stereotype an entire group of people and that all individuals in the United States, including people of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry, are entitled to the same rights and privileges. 
   Indeed, over the past several months I have grown increasingly disturbed by some of the reactions and media coverage of the allegations of espionage at our national labs and illegal campaign financing that have called into question the loyalty of Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent. 
   Clearly, any individuals who are suspected of engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, regardless of their ancestry or heritage, should be investigated. 
   However, the entire Asian and Pacific Island community should not be stereotyped or impugned as a result of the alleged actions of a few. 
   Throughout the history of the United States, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry have suffered from unfounded and demagogic accusations of disloyalty. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have been subjected to discriminatory laws, such as the 1882 Chinese Exclusionary Act and a 1913 California law relating to alien-owned land. 
   They have also been subjected to discriminatory actions, including the interment of patriotic and loyal Japanese Americans during World War II, the repatriation of Filipino immigrants, and the prohibition of individuals from owning property, voting, testifying in court or attending school with other people in the United States. 
   In light of this history, I am appalled that in recent months some have resorted to negative stereotypes to question the integrity of an entire community. 
   In an impassioned letter, one of my constituents expressed, ``As a Chinese American . . . I ask no more than what is due to every citizen of this country, namely, to be treated with respect and dignity. I resent those who would question the loyalty of Chinese Americans any time a particular Chinese American is suspected of an egregious act. In their haste to decry the alleged espionage by an individual, not only are these public officials and said media guilty of a rush to judgment but of tarring with a broad brush other American citizens who are guilty of nothing else other than having the same ethnicity of the suspect.'' 
   Another one of my constituents wrote, ``It appears that China has become Washington D.C.'s latest scapegoat. The accusations coming out of Washington severely damage what could be an excellent relationship and are dangerously close to spilling over in this country to an anti-Chinese and anti-Asian bias against solid U.S. citizens.'' 
   These comments should not be taken lightly. All Americans should be highly offended by the negative stereotypes and media coverage of members of our community who have made profound contributions to our nation. Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have made great contributions to the arts, the economy, the sciences, politics, sports, and technology, among other areas. They have honorably defended the United States in times of armed conflict, from the Civil War to the present. By virtue of their membership in American society, they have just as much stake in this country as an American from any other ethnic background, and should not be held to a different standard. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this resolution and join us in taking a firm stand against discrimination and prejudice against individuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry in the United States.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will be pleased to join the Chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator BENNETT, in presenting to the Senate what I believe is a very good conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 2000 budget. 
   Under the strong leadership of Chairman BENNETT, as well as Mr. TAYLOR, the House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, and Mr. PASTOR, the Ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee, we were able to work our differences in a way that ensures that the essential functions for which appropriations are contained in this bill are able to continue their operations and to carry out their responsibilities efficiently and without any diminution of service. 
   In all, the recommendations that we are presenting today total just over $2.45 billion, almost $21 million below the Subcommittee's allocation. In reaching compromises on the various issues in the conference, Chairman BENNETT was very careful to ensure that the cuts did not unnecessarily impair the programs where those cut were taken. I shared the concerns of the Chairman that these reductions be carefully considered as to their effects, before they were agreed to. 
   In his statement, Chairman BENNETT has already laid out to the Senate the details of the conference agreement, which I will not repeat at this time. 
   I wish to congratulate the Chairman, Senator BENNETT, for his hard work throughout the year on this bill. This was my first year to serve as the Ranking Member of this important Subcommittee, and Senator BENNETT could not have been more helpful to me and my staff. It has been a real pleasure to work at his side on this bill and I look forward to continuing to work with him on all matters that are in the jurisdiction of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I thank the staff who have worked so diligently throughout the year in assisting Chairman BENNETT and myself--Mary Dewald, who recently left the Committee staff, Edie Stanley, her successor, and Jim English, as well as Chris Kierig of my staff. They, together with Christine Ciccone, the Majority Clerk of the Subcommittee, and Chip Yost of Senator BENNETT'S staff, have carried out their responsibilities in their usual, highly professional manner. Our staffs work together, as do Chairman BENNETT and I, in a non-partisan way so that the decisions that we have made throughout the year have been reached based on objective considerations, rather than partisanship. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of this conference report.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I rise in support of the McCain amendment. I first got involved in the sugar program when the last remaining West Coast sugar refinery came into my office to essentially say they were in the process of being put out of business by this program because they could not buy enough sugar on the world market to refine it. That refinery is C&H Sugar. I found that the sugar program is little more than a system of import restrictions, subsidized loans, and price supports that benefit a limited number of sugar growers. 
   Recently, Congressman GEORGE MILLER and I asked the GAO to take a look at the sugar program. A week ago, they put out this report entitled ``Sugar Program: Changing the Method For Setting Import Quotas Could Reduce Costs to Users.'' In short, the GAO found that the USDA's policy has allowed too little sugar to be imported into the country. This has increased costs to consumers and restricted our domestic refineries' access to sufficient quantities of sugar. 
   The GAO found:  
   USDA has continued to target the same stocks-to-use ratios for determining annual tariff-rate quotas, despite the fact that the resulting quotas have maintained domestic market prices that are 2 or more cents higher than necessary for avoiding loan forfeitures. This imposes unnecessary costs on U.S. sugar users--about $400 million annually.  
   They also found that:  
   USTR's current process for allocating the sugar tariff-rate quota does not ensure that all sugar allowed under the quota reaches the United States market.  
   This finding is particularly troubling to me. By limiting the amount of raw cane sugar available for production, 40 percent of the jobs in the sugarcane refining industry have been lost in this country. Since 1982, 9 out of 21 cane sugar refineries in the United States have been forced out of business by this program. Those that have remained open are struggling to survive under onerous import restrictions. 
   I first became involved in this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, the president and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, informed me his refinery was forced to temporarily close because it had no sugar. This 93-year-old refinery is the Nation's largest, and the only such facility on the West Coast. C&H refines about 15 percent of the total cane sugar consumed in the United States. 
   C&H requires in excess of 700,000 tons of raw cane sugar to meet its sales demand. Hawaii is C&H's sole source for its domestic raw cane sugar needs. But Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for over 10 years. This has meant that C&H is forced to cover over half of its annual consumption through imports from other countries. 
   The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C&H to pay an inflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. This is just plain wrong. Even more devastating, however, the quota system limits the amount of sugar available to the refinery. Simply put, C&H has been unable to get enough sugar to refine, and it has been forced to close its doors on several occasions. This is as a result of the sugar program. 
   In a letter to me, Mr. Koncelik notes:  
   The C&H Sugar refinery in Crockett, California, was forced to close from November 8 to November 15 because it ran out of raw sugar. This closing is extremely costly. Other competitor refineries, Savannah and Domino, have had similar experiences. The Government-imposed shortage is forcing up the market price for raw sugar to levels that are bankrupting refiners.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The reduced production capacity has resulted in a severe downsizing of the workforce at this refinery. As recently as 1987, C&H employed over 1,400 people. These are not minimum wage jobs we are talking about; the average employee in the cane refining industry earns about $43,000 a year. In 1995, C&H had to eliminate 30 percent of its workforce just to remain viable under the quota system mandated by the sugar program. 
   C&H now employs just over 500 people. These jobs and many others around the Nation are at risk if reforms are not made to the sugar program. 
   In addition to choking off the refineries' access to sugar, the U.S. sugar policy also has had an adverse impact on consumers. An earlier report by the GAO found that the program costs sugar users an average $1.4 billion annually, as has been mentioned. That equates to $3.8 million a day in hidden sugar taxes. 
   The report found that:  
   Although the sugar program is considered a no-net-cost program because the Government does not make payments directly to producers, it places the cost of the price supports on sweetener users--consumers and manufacturers of sweetener-containing products--who pay higher sugar and sweetener prices.  
   What this means is that, unlike traditional subsidy programs, the funds don't come directly from the Treasury. Instead, the sugar program places the cost on consumers by restricting the supply of available sugar which causes higher domestic market prices. This is our Government program; it makes no sense. 
   On numerous occasions over the past 5 years, I have asked the administration to reform the sugar program. Simply increasing the amount of sugar available through the import program would provide immediate relief to C&H and all other domestic refineries. To date, no such permanent reform of the program has occurred. In the absence of these reforms, Congress must take stronger action. 
   Congress has had opportunities in the past to kill this program and we have not taken them. As a result, workers have lost jobs and consumers have lost money. 
   Regardless of what happens with this amendment, the effort to reform the sugar program is not going to end. Senators SCHUMER, CHAFEE, GREGG, MOYNIHAN, myself, and others have introduced legislation that would phase out the subsidy over the next several years. 
   If the administration refuses to work with us to make the program responsive to the needs of the domestic sugar refinery industry and to our consumers, we will have no choice but to push for passage of this bill.  
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment on low-income housing tax credit to be offered by my colleague from Pennsylvania, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   This issue--affordable housing--is of great importance in my state of California, as it is for much of the nation. Low income families in San Francisco, San Diego, and cities across the country are finding it harder and harder to find affordable housing for rent. 
   The low-income housing tax credit is a great help. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in housing credits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income families. 
   The current housing credit cap--$1.25 for each resident of a state--has not been adjusted since the program's inception. Annual cap growth is limited to the increase in state population, which has been less than five percent nationwide over the past decade. During the same time period, inflation has eroded the housing credit's purchasing power by nearly 50 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
   The budget reconciliation bill increase the credit cap to $1.75 over five years. This is an important step, but it's not enough. Senator SANTORUM and I have proposed this amendment to index the low-income housing tax credit cap for inflation. 
   The estimated cost to index the cap for inflation is $43 million over ten years. It is my understanding the cost has been fully offset. It is important to see that the housing tax credit will not depreciate over time. 
   By not indexing the credit for inflation over the past 13 years, it has eroded by between 40 and 45 percent. Costs to build and rehabilitate affordable housing developments have continued to climb, requiring more credit per project in order to achieve economic feasibility. As a result, less and less affordable housing is made available under the credit. 
   Assuming an inflation factor of just three percent, California would have an additional $1.23 million in the first year of indexing. This would produce approximately 150 more affordable apartments in California annually. 
   Nationwide, demand for housing credits outstrips supply by more than three to one. In California, it's four to one. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 90 percent of renters in Los Angeles pay more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent. Seventy-three percent spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent. 
   In the city of San Diego, the affordable housing situation is not much better. There, 106,000 families spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, and 57,000 families spend more than 50 percent on rental housing. 
   In the San Francisco Bay Area, the situation is even worse. The average family pays roughly 58 percent of its monthly income on rent. We need to aggressively work to fix this shortage. We need to ensure the tax credit will remain a workable incentive for home builders nationwide. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, although I have a great deal of respect  for the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, close examination of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 has led me to conclude that the $792 billion Republican tax bill passed out of the Finance Committee is too much too soon and could well have serious adverse effects on federal priorities and the national economy. 
   The Republican tax plan would devote virtually the entire projected non-Social Security surplus over the next ten years--some $932 billion out of $964 billion, according to the CBO--to tax cuts. That would leave just $32 billion for everything else--Medicare needs, defense, health care, education, combating crime, everything else that the government does. Clearly, that is not sustainable. 
   In fact, the Republican plan may well lead to substantial deficits unless the Congress and the President are willing to not only keep the present caps, but to tighten them even further. 
   By devoting 97 percent of a surplus that has not yet been generated to tax cuts and to the additional interest costs of not reducing the debt--$932 billion--the Republican plan creates a great risk that we will return to the era of deficits and rising debt. 
   When I first came to the Senate in 1993, the Federal budget deficit was $290 billion, and expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 
   Through the imposition of tough fiscal discipline--and by making tough budgetary choices--we have now managed to bring the federal budget back in balance. We should not now precipitously put these gains at risk. 
   If we abandon the fiscal discipline and responsibility that have allowed us to get to where we are today--our economy growing and our budget in balance--we will once again find 
    ourselves running up annual deficits in the tens of billions of dollars. 
   The bottom line is that the Republican plan is too much, too soon, too fast. It: 
   Spends money which Congress does not yet have. This surplus has not yet materialized and will not until next year--assuming projections are correct, which they may not be. What happens if there is a military need? What happens if there are large national disasters? What happens if the economy slows down? Answer: All surplus projections are in the wastebasket. 
   In fact, the projected surpluses which have set off the tax-relief movement may never materialize. It will only come about if the economy continues to grow and if Congress cuts spending even more deeply. 
   The Republican plan does nothing to protect Medicare. No budget resources are set aside for Medicare solvency. And by giving nearly all the surplus outside of Social Security's need to tax cuts, the Republican plan does nothing to extend the solvency of Medicare trust fund, which will be bankrupt by 2015. 
   Nor does it provide coverage for prescription drug benefits to be added. As a matter of fact, they are made impossible. 
   The Republican plan endangers virtually all domestic program priorities, forcing cuts of close to 40 percent in domestic spending over the next decade. The Republican plan would commit the nation to major cuts in military readiness, education, healthcare, and crime-fighting, just to name a few areas. 
   In fact, under this plan, to avoid deficits, domestic spending will have to be cut an additional 23 percent by 2009. But if defense programs are to be funded at the level recommended by the Joint Chiefs--as I believe they should be--then domestic spending will have to be cut by 38 percent. Cuts of this magnitude would: 
   Reduce Head Start services over one-third, from the 835,000 children who would otherwise be served to 460,000. 
   It would slash Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, programs, denying 4 million children in high poverty communities throughout this nation (from the 14.6 million projected) access to key educational services necessary to improve their future prospects. 
   It would cut the National Institutes of Health budget by $8.6 billion from the current baseline, which would endanger NIH's ability to fund new research grants. It would gut the cancer program and certainly prevent the doubling of funding for cancer research as this body has supported by a vote of 98-0 in 1997 in a Sense of the Senate. 
   It would cut Superfund cleanup funds by $870 million, eliminating all new federally-led clean-ups due to begin in 2009, and making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the EPA's 900-site cleanup goal in 2002. 
   There are 96 Superfund sites in California on the National Priority Cleanup List, including Iron Mountain near Redding and the San Gabriel Valley site in Los Angeles county. Construction is underway at just 38 percent of these sites. The Republican tax plan may put continued work on these sites in jeopardy. 
   The Republican plan cuts to the Immigration and Naturalization Service could result in a reduction of over 6,000 Border Patrol Agents (from the number projected); cuts to the FBI could result in a reduction of over 6,000 FBI agents (from the number projected). 
   Does not eliminate publicly held debt. Today, public debt stands at $3.6 trillion. We have an opportunity to eliminate this public debt entirely by 2015--critical if we wish to keep interest rates low--if we stick with a fiscally responsible approach. 
   I represent the most populous state in the union. Most 
   important issues before the Senate produce letters and e-mail in excess of 10,000 a week, and often 20,000 or 30,000. Yet, I have received remarkably few letters urging tax cuts. And those letters that I have received--109 last week--have been equally split. In fact, only one person has written to me saying that it is vital for their survival that the massive Republican tax package be passed. 
   I would like to read from some of the letters that I have received, to give my colleagues a sense of what the people of California are thinking about this issue. 
   A letter I received from a woman in Berkeley sums up much of this debate quite well, and is reflective of much of the mail I have received. And it is further testament to the fact that the American people are often more wise then many of their elected leaders. This letter reads:  
   I am very concerned about proposed tax cuts and urge you to be cautious! 
   First, we really do not know if the proposed surplus will be there in the next 15 years. 
   Second, we have enormous debt, and, in my mind, the major portion of the surplus should be used to pay down our debt. This would be a boom to baby boomers, etc since their ``invested'' surplus Social Security taxes are already spent. Talk about ``family value''--pay your debt first. 
   Third, Social Security, Medicare, and child services all need financial attention. 
   Please do not vote for a large tax cut. It is not the right thing for our national financial future.  
   For those of my colleagues who may be quick to dismiss a letter coming from Berkeley, I also received a note from a couple in Sonoma which read: ``We are two registered Republicans who would prefer no tax cut. Pay off the national debt and lower interest rates thereby. Also secure Social Security and improve healthcare for everyone.'' 
   A man in San Diego wrote:  
   I want the national debt payed down. I want Social Security and Medicare shored up. I don't want more government spending. If we can do that and get a tax cut fine. If we can't fine. I don't want to depend on your economist's estimates of overages, since we know their abilities are mediocre at best!  
   And from an e-mail from Aptos:  
   I am opposed to the recent large tax break legislation in the House. We need instead to be paying down the debt and saving tax cuts for when they are truly needed. The more we pay off our national debt, the more of our hard earned tax dollars will actually go to programs, not debt repayment, and the more we will be able to afford true tax cuts in the future. Lets not spend our future away.  
   In fact, I believe that if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were willing to put partisan posturing behind them, a responsible tax cut would be possible within the context of the budget plan proposed by the President. 
   I support the Administration in setting aside 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security, some $3.5 trillion over 15 years. It extends the program's solvency to 2053, and eliminates publically held debt by 2015. This means that the ``baby boomer'' generation's Social Security is protected. 
   I support extending the solvency of Medicare from 2015 to 2027 by dedicating 13.5 percent of the surplus, some $794 billion over 15 years to Medicare. This is vital if there is to be a solvent  system. It is mandatory if addressing a change in benefits is contemplated. 
   Finally, I strongly support itemizing 2.5 percent of the surplus, or $156 billion over 15 years for education, and 6 percent of the surplus or $366 billion over ten years for various discretionary programs such as defense, veterans affairs, research, agriculture, and environmental protection. 
   That would leave $271 billion over the next ten years which could be utilized as a tax cut. 
   Indeed, that is why I worked with my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, to put together and introduce earlier this year a moderate bill that provides needed tax relief for working families while fitting within the budget framework set out by the President to protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   The Grassley-Feinstein plan would cost $271 billion over ten years. It provides a $61.4 billion cut in the marriage penalty; a 100 percent deduction for health insurance expenses and a tax credit for long-term care ($117 billion over ten years); an increase in the low-income housing credit ($6.6 billion over ten years); tax credits for child care and education, including help for stay at home parents, with the HOPE college credit, and with student loan interest payments ($32.3 billion over ten years); and it helps our economy continue to grow by making permanent the R&D tax credit ($27.4 billion over ten years). 
   In fact, it is much like the Democratic plan. It is a common sense, bipartisan approach. 
   Of all the tax cuts that have been proposed, I believe the one that would be of the most help to the American people would be marriage penalty relief. 
   It makes sense for social reasons: It reinforces the important institutions of family and marriage. 
   And it makes sense for economic reasons: It eliminates what many of us see as a vast inconsistency in our tax law, that two people could find that they pay more in taxes if they are married then if they stay single. It makes no sense. 
   Another approach to this tax relief question would be to simply eliminate the marriage penalty outright, starting in 2002, and allow married couples to file either individually or jointly at their option. This would cost some $234 billion for the eight years. 
   A tax relief plan which starts with a $234 billion cut in the marriage penalty would also allow us to include other important provisions. I would support including an immediate increase in the low-income housing tax credit, indexing that credit to inflation, which would cost $6 billion over ten years. The low-income housing tax credit is critical for financing housing for low income families. I would also support the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit,which costs some $27.4 billion over ten years, and provides an important incentive for U.S. companies to continue to develop the cutting-edge technologies of the 21st century. 
   So, the complete elimination of the marriage tax, the low-income housing credit, and the R&D credit would total some $269 billion over the next years, well within the $271 billion cap. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican plan passed by the Finance Committee is neither common sense nor bipartisan. 
   It is a tax plan which will endanger the federal budget, places Medicare at risk, force deep and unnecessary cuts in important domestic priorities, and may undermine the long-term health of the U.S. economy. It is unwise, and I urge my colleagues to think long and hard before plunging headlong and heedless down this path of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   Congress has an unprecedented opportunity to put our fiscal house in order. We can protect Social Security and Medicare, meet other domestic and international priorities, and eliminate the federal debt. And we can provide the American people with significant and much needed tax relief. This is not some pie in the sky scenario, but a realistic appraisal of what we can do if we are willing to move beyond partisan posturing and politics as usual, and do what is right for the American people.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to both the majority and the minority leaders in their ongoing efforts to get the juvenile justice bill to conference. I believe it is about time. I was an original cosponsor of the juvenile justice bill and helped write the gang abatement provisions of that bill. These provisions are really designed to provide a helping Federal hand to State and local governments for those gangs, criminal gangs, who are now crossing State lines and illegally conducting criminal activities in various States all across this great country. 
   Both Houses of Congress passed this legislation weeks ago. There are a few commonsense measures, targeted and precise, that provide some regulation of firearms in this country. They are not sweeping, they are actually rather small, yet they have become the focus of debate and stopped a good bill from moving further. The issue of the bill has remained essentially in legislative purgatory, and the will of the Congress and the American people has so far been denied. 
   I will speak for a moment about the few so-called gun pieces that are in this bill. The first is a bill by Senator ASHCROFT in the Senate which essentially says that juveniles can't possess or buy an assault weapon, assault weapons which were created for military use to kill large numbers of people in close combat--that is the purpose of these weapons, clearly. They were not made for civilian defensive purposes. It is a no-brainer to say that juveniles shouldn't be able to buy them or possess them. 
   Secondly, trigger locks should be put on weapons sold to the American public. We know they can be. We know they are not costly, and we know they will save lives in instances such as the one that happened a few weeks ago, when a youngster 8 years old picked up a gun, playing a war game with a 7-year-old, and shot the 7-year-old, not knowing the gun was loaded. Again, a no-brainer. Why not sell a gun with a trigger lock if it is going to save innocent lives? 
   Thirdly, we would close certain gun show loopholes. Does anyone in America really believe that a juvenile should be able to go to a gun show and, unidentified, surreptitiously, buy a gun and not even have a background check? I don't think so. 
   Finally, I authored a piece of legislation which to me was another no-brainer. We have in prior legislation prohibited American manufacturers from making the big banana clips, large ammunition-feeding devices, some of them as large as 250 rounds, which are used in the so-called grievance killings, 9 of which have taken place in high schools all across this great country in recent years. 
   That is the law of the land. You can't make them domestically. You can't sell those that are made domestically, and you can't possess them, if they were made following the assault weapons legislation which became part of the crime bill in 1994. 
   There is a loophole. The loophole is that they can be imported to this country. Last year alone, from almost 20 different countries, 11.4 million large-capacity, ammunition-feeding devices, over 50,000 of them of more than 250 rounds, came into this country. The President couldn't stop it by executive order; we had to legislate; and, in fact, we did. Twenty Republicans voted for this. We had 59 votes in the Senate. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee moved it as an amendment on the floor, which was passed by unanimous consent in the House.  
   I will talk more about that in a moment because something rather dastardly has happened to it. 
   At Columbine High School earlier this year, 13 innocent children died from gunshot wounds. We were all horrified. Since that time, dozens, if not hundreds, of other children across this Nation have also died from gunshot wounds. Congress has done nothing to solve the problem, no measures to try to prevent this from happening in the future. 
   On August 16, the children of Columbine will return to the very school that witnessed one of the worst incidents of gun violence this Nation has ever seen. When they return, they are going to be asking themselves, their parents, their teachers, and even us a lot of questions: 
   What has been done to make our school safer? 
   Is it harder for kids to get guns today? 
   What has Congress done to help us? 
   And who is really trying to make a difference? 
   Many of those same children came here from Littleton this month, and they asked us those same questions. I believe their questions went largely unanswered. 
   The children received assurances from leadership on both sides of the aisle that Congress is working hard to reduce or eliminate future school shootings and that Members of Congress sympathized with them and would do anything they could to help. 
   But as one child from Littleton put it bluntly: ``It is one thing for them to say they sympathize with our pain; it is quite another to look down a gun barrel and think that maybe you are going to die.'' 
   This was from a girl just 17 years old, but a girl forced to grow up very quickly after the events of this past year. This is what the issue is all about--the boys and girls out there who fear for their lives every day because of gun violence. 
   I have asked fourth graders in California schools what is their greatest fear. Do you know what it is? Getting shot on the way to school. 
   Yet still we wait and we do nothing. 
   We spent more than a week in this body debating and voting on dozens of provisions to stem the tide of youth violence in this country, and--as much as some would still refuse to accept it--to curb the flood of guns reaching criminals and children. 
   This debate isn't all about just controlling guns. I think this debate really has three pertinent parts to it: One, improving parenting. Parents need to spend more time with their children. They need to set limits and they need to see that they are observed. They need to spend a lot of time with the young people. This has become less and less in a world that requires two parents to work. That is one thing--better parenting. 
   There is a second thing. Youngsters left alone are more often more dependent on media than I was when I was raised. In my younger days, there wasn't even television, believe it or not. Today, media is surrounded by a culture of violence--even video games. So youngsters are much more exposed to violence today than I was when I was growing up in this country. 
   Third, the Nation is awash in guns. These three things make a very combustible mix, and we need to deal with it. 
   But still we wait and we do nothing. 
   The delays have come in many forms, as I have said--political maneuvering, parliamentary tactics, and others. Just recently, in a virtually unprecedented move, anti-gun control forces in the House of Representatives raised a last-minute ``blue slip'' challenge to the amendment I just spoke about, which would stop the importation of these big clips--over 11 million of them last year. 
   It is my understanding this may have been the first time in history that such a challenge was raised to an amendment under Title 18, the criminal code. The first time in history--but that didn't stop the NRA or its supporters in this Congress. 
   The clear goal of this amendment, and of the overwhelming majority of Members in both Houses of Congress who voted for it, is to keep those foreign-made, high-capacity ammunition clips off our streets and out of the hands of children and criminals. That is the intent. You can't use them for hunting. They are not good for defensive purposes. They are offensive in their use. 
   For most people, stopping these big clips from flowing into our country and into the hands of children and criminals is simply common sense. But not for the NRA. They have tried to kill this measure for years. They supported the loophole in the first place. This most recent attempt, the blue slip challenge, popped up at the last minute--after the amendment had passed the Senate, after it had passed the House unanimously, and after we had already waited for weeks for a conference to start the juvenile justice bill. 
   Essentially, the challenge raised to the bill involves the constitutional prerogatives of the House of Representatives to originate all revenue bills. Several Members of the House argue that because the importation of large-capacity, ammunition-feeding devices creates some revenue for the Treasury, the prohibition of such importation would cost us money, and thus the entire juvenile justice bill becomes a revenue bill. Because no similar measure was in the House bill, it was proclaimed that the Senate had illegally originated a revenue bill. After little debate and much 
   misinformation, the House voted to send the juvenile justice bill back to the Senate so that we could remove the clip provision. 
   I don't believe such action was warranted, and I would have liked an opportunity to make my case before the vote took place, but there wasn't time. In the end, I had little choice, and I picked up the telephone and called the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who was most gracious. He took my call. He said he did not want to kill the clip ban. He did not believe the House of Representatives--the majority--wanted to kill the clip ban, and he would support its reinstitution. I then called the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the very distinguished Henry Hyde of Illinois, and he had made the clip ban amendment on the floor, which passed unanimously in separate legislation. He said he was supportive of the clip ban. He said he would move to put it back in conference and that he believed a conference committee that he would appoint on the House side would support its reinstitution into the bill. 
   Put plainly, we were sideswiped, and we were given no time to recover. But make no mistake, the juvenile justice bill is not a revenue bill, and this challenge, I believe, was simply an attempt to further delay the will of the American people. 
   I want to explain why I don't believe the clip import ban is a revenue measure, as it is meant by the Constitution, despite what the House Parliamentarian has said. I want to put my views on the record in the hope that this type of cynical maneuver won't happen again in the future. 
   I am not a constitutional scholar, but to me, this is simple common sense. In my view, the mere fact that a small part of a very large bill may incidentally effect some revenue doesn't make the bill a revenue bill. The Constitution states that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House. This has been interpreted to mean all bills affecting revenue, I guess, because although the clip ban does not raise revenue, it does affect revenue in a small way by causing the Treasury to lose the proceeds from a 4.2-percent tariff on ammunition clips that are used in certain types of firearms--I believe, handguns. 
   I don't believe the intent of this constitutional provision was to prevent the Senate from ever passing a bill that somehow affects revenue. After all, almost everything we do, in some way, affects revenue. We constantly pass bills establishing or eliminating fees. We put new requirements on the executive branch that will clearly lead to increased costs. We establish programs that will bring extra money to the Treasury in ways many people find hard to imagine. Our Founding Fathers wanted the House to originate legislation that raises taxes, and that I understand and concur with. But I don't believe they meant for the House to originate every bill in Congress, which would be the logical extension of the arguments made during this very short debate. 
   The juvenile justice bill was clearly not a bill for raising revenue, and neither was the clip ban amendment  itself. The juvenile justice bill was a bill to stop crime. The clip ban was an amendment to eliminate large-capacity, ammunition-feeding devices from our streets. 
   Any revenue affect was incidental, and any claim to the contrary is simply mistaken. 
   In fact, the revenue effect of this bill was so incidental that nobody even realized that tariffs would be lost until a few short weeks ago. Not when the amendment came to the Senate floor and passed. Not when the amendment came to the House floor and passed. Not during the days and weeks that the juvenile justice bills sat on the calendar. 
   Only when the pressure was finally getting too great--only when the Senate Majority leader and the House Speaker promised conferees that week--only then did this issue come up for the first time, at the very last minute, before a rushed vote. 
   Mr. President, in at least two Supreme Court cases--U.S. versus Munoz in 1990 and another as far back as 1897--the Court has held that ``revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue.'' 
   Clearly, Mr. President, the juvenile justice bill is not a bill that levies taxes ``in the strict sense of the word,'' but rather it is precisely the type of bill the Supreme Court agrees is not a revenue bill--one that is, and I quote it again, ``for other purposes which may incidentally'' affect revenue. 
   Unfortunately, the House of Representatives never had a chance to review those Court cases, because this issue came up so quickly. 
   In the end, whether or not a Senate bill is a revenue bill boils down to the opinion of a majority of House Members, and those Members have spoken by returning the juvenile justice bill to us for correction. But I firmly believe that if the House had been given an opportunity to study the facts and review the precedent, the outcome would have been different. Instead, the issue was rushed, the debate cut off, and the outcome predetermined. 
   I can only hope that we have now overcome the remaining hurdles and we can quickly move to conference on these bills, because we are running out of time. 
   With fewer than 8 legislative days left before the children of Columbine High go back to school, the future of this bill rests squarely with the Republican leadership in both the House and Senate. They have said they want to make progress with our gun laws, and they now have it within their power to do so. 
   I am encouraged that it now appears that the logjam has been broken, but the inventive and imaginative delays we have faced so far leave me wary of future shenanigans. 
   The question is, Will those who claim to support reasonable gun control finally put their money where their mouths are, or will they continue to use unprecedented parliamentary maneuvering to avoid the issue and give the NRA its very own Christmas in July? 
   I, for one, certainly hope that the American people win out, and I thank the majority leader for getting this process moving. 
   I also would like to extend my thanks to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for their support. Chairman HYDE was very supportive of the assault weapons legislation, which was moved as an amendment to the crime bill in 1994, and his integrity has remained strong and unchallenged in that regard. 
   That is the one confidence that I have that this clip ban has a chance to fly once again. That rests on the integrity of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which I believe is unblemished, and also on the Speaker of the House of Representatives, both of whom have given me their firm assurances. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns about appropriations for the census--an issue that is critical for the State of California and for the Nation. 
   The Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bill for FY 2000 allocates $2.8 billion for census operations. It does not include the additional $1.7 billion that the Administration requested to pay for its revised census plan. This funding shortfall will certainly result in an undercount in the 2000 Census. 
   In the 1990 Census, California lost $2.2 billion because not everyone was counted, and that's not fair. Although the Administration's request was submitted late in the appropriations process, it is crucial that we equip the Census Bureau with the funds necessary to make the Census 2000 as accurate as possible. How can the Census Bureau do its best to carry out an accurate census in 2000, if they do not have the appropriate resources? We can be sure that the Census 2000 will fail if the Census Bureau does not have the extra $1.7 billion it needs for this operation. 
   The census has real impact on the lives of people across the Nation. Information gathered from the census count determines how nearly $200 billion of federal funds are allocated. In addition, census information is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways, and by businesses in making their economic plans. 
   The 1990 Census undercounted the U.S. population by more than eight million Americans (mostly children, the poor, and communities of color), and more than four million Americans were counted twice. In California alone, the 1990 Census missed more than 834,000 people. A disproportionate number of those undercounted in California were minorities: Nearly half the net undercount--47 percent--were Hispanic-American. Twenty-two percent were African-American and eight percent were Asian Pacific-American. Such differences in census coverage introduce inequities in political representation and in the distribution of funds. Communities from these undercounted ethnic minority populations have been disadvantaged by not receiving the resources they need for various government programs. 
   A recent study by the General Accounting Office estimates that the economic consequences of the undercount in California caused my state to lose over $2.2 billion in federal funds, more than any other state and more than the additional appropriations requested by the Administration. As a result, the state did not get its fair share of funds for Medicaid, Child Care and Development, Rehabilitation Services, Adoption Assistance, and Foster Care, to mention only a few of the federal grant programs affected. Each person missed in the census cost California $2,660 in Federal funds over the decade. 
   Some of the top 10 undercounted cities in the 1990 census, two of which are from my state, include: 
   Los Angeles (138,808); San Diego (32,483); Chicago (68,315); Houston (66,748); Dallas (37,070); Detroit (28,206); and Philadelphia (23,365). 
   Unless the Census Bureau is allowed to carry out its plan to produce a more accurate count than that which was produced in 1990, California and other states will again lose billions of dollars in federal assistance and will again have to subsidize federal programs with state and local tax dollars. 
   Since the flawed 1990 population count, the Census Bureau has worked with experts from across the country to design a more accurate census for 2000. The National Academy of Sciences, in three separate reports, concluded that the key to improving accuracy in the census is the use of sound statistical methods. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Bureau could not use statistical sampling for apportionment purposes. 
   Because the Census Bureau cannot use sampling, it has revised its census plan and requested additional appropriations to carry out a full enumeration census, using mail-back census forms and employing an army of bureau workers to personally and repeatedly visit those who do not respond. The Census Bureau's operational plan for carrying out the 2000 Census will be the largest peacetime effort in our nation's history, and will employ more than 860,000 temporary workers.  
   Mr. President, Congress must make every effort to support the Census Bureau's plan to count all Americans in 2000. The census should not be about politics. This is an issue of fairness, that impacts Americans nationwide. I urge my colleagues to support the additional $1.7 billion appropriation that the Census Bureau needs to carry out an accurate census in 2000. We must do everything we can to ensure that everyone is included in the count, and that our communities are provided with the resources we need. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in expressing my strong support for the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment, legislation of which I am a cosponsor. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment is urgently needed to compensate for two limitations in the current law. First, the current federal hate crimes law covers only crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. As a result, federal authorities cannot prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   In addition, current law limits federal hate crime prosecutions to instances in which the victims was targeted because he or she was exercising one of six narrowly defined federally-protected activities (such as serving on a jury, attending a public school, eating at a restaurant or lodging at a hotel). As a result, the law does not reach many cases where individuals kill or injure others because of racial or religious hatred. 
   The Hate Crimes Amendment would remedy the glaring gaps and inadequacy of the current law by broadening the federal jurisdiction to cover all violent crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. It would also include sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of protected categories within current federal hate crime law, provided there is a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. 
   At the same time, federal involvement would only come into play if the Attorney General certifies that a federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. In recent years, the existing federal hate crimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases where the state criminal justice system did not achieve a just result. 
   What does this mean? It means that crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin would be covered under the federal hate crimes law whenever the defendant causes bodily injury, or through the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive, attempts to case injury. 
   Crimes based on sexual orientation, gender or disability would be limited to the same types of violent crimes, but only if the crime has a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. 
   In all cases, the prosecution would have to show that the crime was motivated in part by the actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim--and this would be a matter for the jury to determine. 
   As would be the case for every element of a criminal offense, federal prosecutors would have to prove motivation beyond a reasonable doubt. In all cases, these prosecutions would present evidence that a motivating factor in the crime was bias against a particular group. 
   Hate crimes in these cases would carry a heavy penalty. Persons who cause bodily injury to another, or, through the use of fire, firearms, or explosives, attempts to cause bodily injury in the furtherance of a hate crime would face imprisonment up to 10 years. If the hate crime results in death or the offense included kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to kill, the convicted offender could face life imprisonment. 
   Mr. President, for many years I have been deeply concerned about hate crimes and the immeasurable impact they have on victims, their families and our communities. In 1993, I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in 1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act increased the penalties for hate crimes directed at individuals because of their perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, disability or sexual orientation. 
   Today, I believe the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment, builds on this effort by modifying the current law to allow the federal government to provide the vital assistance to states in investigating of crimes of this magnitude. 
   This legislation is long overdue, Mr. President. The brutal murders last year of an African American, James Byrd, in Texas; a gay man, Matthew Shepard, in Wyoming; and the murderous rampage in Littleton, Colorado earlier this year vividly portray why this legislation is so urgently needed. 
   Just recently, our nation awakened to the news of drive-by shooting attacks on Jews, and African-American, and Asian-Americans in Chicago, Illinois. These shootings were the despicable acts of virulent hatred. Undoubtedly these crimes have affected so many lives beyond its immediate victims. 
   Two weeks before the shootings, three synagogues were torched in Sacramento, California, sending shock waves throughout the Jewish community in America. 
   Sadly, hate crimes are becoming too commonplace in America. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 1997, the last year for which we have statistics, 8,049 hate crime incidents were reported in the United States. That is almost one such crime per hour. Within these incidents, there were 10,255 victims of these crimes. 
   Of that total, 4,710 or 58.5% of the crime were committed on account of the victim' s race. Of these reported crimes, there were almost 1,300 victims of anti-black crimes; 649 victims of anti-Hispanic crimes; and 466 victims of anti-Asian crimes. 
   In that same year, 1,385 or roughly 17% of the victims were targeted because of their religious affiliation. The number of anti-Jewish incidents is second only to those against blacks and far exceeds offenses against all other religious groups combined. Moreover, while by most accounts anti-Semitism in America has declined dramatically over the years, the level of violence is escalating. 
   The FBI reports that crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked third in reported hate crimes in 1997, registering 1,102 or 13.7% of reported incidents. And, gender-motivated violence occurs in our country at alarming rates. According to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, ``society is beginning to realize that many assaults against women are not `random' acts of violence but are actually bias-related crimes.'' 
   In addition, according to the California Attorney General, more than 1,800 of the 8,000 hate crimes reported by the FBI were committed in California. That's a shocking number when one considers the motivation behind a hate crime. These are truly among the ugliest of crimes, in which the perpetrator thinks the victim is less of a human being because of his or her gender, skin color, religion, sexual orientation or disability. 
   By enacting this legislation, federal prosecutors will be able to work in full partnership with their state counterparts. In Wyoming, despite clear evidence that the killing of Matthew Shepard was motivated by bigotry against homosexuals, federal authorities lacked jurisdiction to assist state and local authorities in investigating the case. 
   It is imperative, therefore, that Congress move swiftly to address this situation and enact this legislation. Although the Byrd and Shepard, as well as the Littleton and Chicago atrocities, all have shocked the conscience of our nation, many hate crimes happen daily in our communities and do not receive national exposure and universal condemnation. 
   For example, an 18-year-old San Francisco youth was savagely attacked and beaten after a recent athletic event between St. Ignatius College Preparatory School and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory School. During the beating, his attackers yelled racial  slurs at him. Just a few days later, a 17-year-old senior at San Marin High School was beaten outside his school in Novato, a derogatory word regarding his presumed sexual orientation was etched into his arm with a pen. 
   And, in an especially disturbing case in Ventura, California, four skinheads attacked a Latino couple and an African-American couple returning from a high school homecoming date. Singing, and then shouting racial epithets, the skinheads followed the two couples and threw a brick at the head of the African-American teenager. When the students tried to drive away, the skinheads kicked the car and beat it with a baseball bat, causing $2,000 in damage. 
   These recent cases show far more vividly than I can express here today why we need this legislation now more than ever. 
   This amendment does not create any ``special interests.'' Hate crimes are not just the concern of any one race, one gender, or one segment of society. The victims of these types of attacks are black and white, young and old, gay and straight, mother and son, father and daughter. Most importantly, they are all human beings whom other human beings loved and depended on. No one, no matter where he lives or to what group she belongs can be certain who will suffer from senseless acts of violence sparked by bigotry, hatred and prejudice. 
   History is replete with instances in which mindless fear, ignorance and prejudice propel unspeakable acts of inhumanity. There is a great monument to this in this very city: the Holocaust Museum. The Holocaust Museum serves as a stark and cogent reminder of how unchecked hatred can spiral into the genocide of countless millions of Jews and others who were singled out by Nazi Germany for no other reason than that they were different. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, as recent events suggest, we do not have to look back sixty years to find example of inhumanity fostered by hate. We can look across the oceans to Kosovo, 
   where the consequences of ``ethnic cleansing,'' mass rapes, and rampant crime, all point to the utter disregard for life and human dignity. 
   Mr. President, American values do not include attacking those who are ``different'' or those with whom we disagree. No one here can reasonably argue that violently attacking a person because of his or her race, gender, disability, or sexual orientation is an acceptable form of behavior. 
   No one here can reasonably argue that protecting American values should not include protecting women, disabled persons, or gays and lesbians from hate crimes. 
   And no one here today need fear a breakdown of society simply because we extend Federal protection from acts of violent prejudice to those members of our society who currently face such an extraordinary threat of hate violence. 
   Instead, as Americans, we value the freedom to be individuals. We value the freedom to express ourselves peacefully. And, above all, Mr. President, we value freedom from fear and tyranny. 
   And, what we must take from the experience of World War II and Kosovo is that our nation must never sit still and permit acts of hatred to go unpunished and undeterred. 
   That is why, if we truly want to defend American values, we should work to give our citizens protection from those who would do them harm simply based upon their race, gender, disability or sexual orientation. 
   And, the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment aims to send a message to our nation and the world that the singling out of an individual because of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or disability will not go unnoticed or unpunished. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment will make certain that those who commit violent acts because someone is of the ``wrong gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, or disability'' will be prosecuted because everyone, I repeat, everyone has a right to be free from violence and fear when they are going to school, work, travel, or doing something as simple as going to a movie. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment, which includes this important measure. I also urge the conferees on the Commerce, Justice, States appropriations bill to maintain this position during the conference. All Americans, and our future generations, deserve no less.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, about funding in this measure for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, popularly known as the SCAAP. 
   As the Senator knows, states and localities, especially those such as California with high immigrant populations, face extraordinary costs in incarcerating illegal aliens who have committed serious crimes in the United States and sentenced for their felony offenses. 
   The burden on states and localities which incarcerate criminal aliens continues to grow. In California, for example, during February 1997, there were 17,904 criminal alien inmates with INS holds on them. This rose to 19,355 in 1998. At the end of February, 1999, there were 21,792 alien inmates in the California state correctional system who have INS holds. 
   Congress appropriated $585 million for SCAAP in fiscal year 1999 to help reimburse state and local governments for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens. 
   Given the increasing numbers of illegal aliens that California and other states must incarcerate, one would reasonably expect that funding for this important program would be increased in fiscal year 2000. 
   But it is my understanding, Mr. President, that the bill reported by the committee actually makes dramatic cuts in federal funding for SCAAP, reducing the level of funding by more than 80 percent to only $100 million. 
   Given the urgency of the need and the fact that all 50 states, the District of Columbia, two territories and 244 localities received SCAAP funding in the most recent reimbursement period, I would like to inquire of my friend from New Hampshire if there is something that can be done to increase funding in this bill for SCAAP to a more appropriate level.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their encouraging words. As I am sure they know, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did not nearly cover the costs states and localities incurred to incarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions. 
   In fiscal year 1998, the last year for which such cost figures are available, the cost for states and localities amounted to $1.7 billion. Thus, last year's funding level covered only 30 percent of actual costs. 
   A cut along the magnitude of that which is included in the Committee bill would be absolutely devastating. I understand the House CJS Subcommittee is recommending an FY00 SCAAP funding level of $585 million. I will work closely with the Chairman and Ranking Member and others in both bodies during the weeks to come to assure that the conference on this bill adequately funds this program.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with real pleasure that I rise today to note the swearing-in this afternoon of California State Senator Diane Watson as United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia. Senator Watson's confirmation was a long time coming, and I am proud that today she will finally come to occupy the Ambassadorial posting which she so well deserves. 
   State Senator Watson was the first African-American women elected to the California State Senate, and has represented California's 26th District--which includes Los Angeles, Culver City, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills, Palms, Miracle Mile, Mar Vista, Cheviot Hills, and Koreatown--since 1978. Senator Watson has been a real leader in California politics and community life, and has been in the forefront of the fight for civil rights and human rights in Los Angeles and the entire state of California for her entire career. She was a dedicated crusader in  the desegregation of Los Angeles school, and, in 1975, became the first elected African American to serve on the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
   Prior to her elected office, Senator Watson led a distinguished career in the field of education, including service as an assistant superintendent of child welfare, a school psychologist, and as a member of the faculty at both California State university Los Angeles and Long Beach. She has also traveled extensively, participating in numerous international conference on women's health issues, democracy building, and trade. 
   As a member of the State Senate and as an educator, Diane Watson has always brought honor to the organizations and people she has represented. For many years now she has been a leader in improving the lives of Californians, and I am pleased that the people of the United States will now also be able to benefit from her experience, energy, and talents as our Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I want to call my colleagues attention to a new effort in California, the International Museum of Women. Elizabeth Colton, the president of the Board of Directors of the International Museum of Women is building broad support among community leaders and public officials. The museum will be built in San Francisco, since this city has roots which reach virtually every corner of the globe. The museum will start construction in 2003, and the total cost of the museum is $50 million. 
   Women have made important contributions and this museum can help us to better explore the role of women in history. This museum will seek to not simply bring recognition to women and their contributions, but it will re-examine history to more accurately incorporate the effects and implications of women's actions and ideas. The museum's educational programs can play a significant role in shaping how society views women and girls. 
   In addition, International Museum of Women can provide role models for women and girls, furnish a new context for historical interpretations, and portray the importance and existence of the historic, ongoing fight for equal rights. This museum can open the doors to endless possibilities and limitless opportunities for females. 
   I call on my colleagues to join me in saluting the International Museum of  Women, as one way to eradicate inequality and open doors to opportunity.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion made by the Senator from New Hampshire to discharge S.J. Res. 27, which would disapprove of the President's recommendation of normal trade relations with China, from further consideration by the Committee on Finance. 
   My opposition to this motion is based both on procedural grounds as well as my opposition to the policy goals advocated by the proponents of this motion. 
   Aside from these procedural questions raised by this motion --whether the Senate should act in advance of the House and whether the committee should be discharged of this resolution before it has the opportunity to give it full consideration--which have been eloquently addressed by the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, there is also a real factual question raised by this motion which must also be addressed. 
   The factual question is this: Is it in the U.S. interest to continue to extend normal trade relations to China? 
   In my view it is. 
   The United States extends NTR to all but a handful of rouge states: North Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, and the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Even Iraq and Iran--two countries which the United States is trying to isolate--currently have NTR. Placing China on a short list or rouge nations to whom we deny NTR would be an irreversible step in the wrong direction and a severe blow to the national interest of the United States. 
   Let us remember, we do not extend NTR to China as a favor to China, but because maintenance of NTR with China is in our national interest. 
   It is in our national interest as a matter of simple economics. The United States benefits from, and should continue to foster, free and fair trade with China. 
   In 1991, United States-China bilateral trade totaled $25 billion. Last year it was close to $85 billion. In 1991 China was our eighth largest trading partner. Today it is our fourth, and still moving up fast.U.S. trade with China supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Revoking China's NTR status would be shooting ourselves in the foot. 
   Indeed, for my state, California, the growth of trade relations with China over the past decade has been just as dramatic. In 1998, exports to China and Hong Kong together were California's fourth largest export destination. In 1998, while California's total exports declined 4.17%, due to the Asian financial crisis, our exports to China (not including Hong Kong) increased 9.28%. 
   Critics of United States-China trade relations may argue that even 
   though U.S. exports to China have more than doubled in the past decade, Chinese exports to the U.S. have gone up even faster, resulting in a sizable trade deficit. I would reply that this underscores the importance of normalizing and improving our trade with China through continued NTR: U.S. companies must get continued and better access to emerging Chinese markets. 
   Extension of NTR is in our national interest because the United States will benefit by the further integration of China into the world trading system. The stakes are huge. Extension of NTR is a necessary precursor for Chinese accession to the WTO, which presents us an historic opportunity to integrate China--soon to be the world's largest economy--into the international trading system. 
   Extension of NTR is in our national interest because having China in the world trading system levels the playing field. The WTO's system of reporting, compliance, and dispute resolution would require China to play by same rules all WTO members follow. 
   Extension of China's NTR status is in our national interest because history has shown us that, despite the turmoil of the past few months, U.S. trade and engagement with China has encouraged economic, political, and social change in China. These changes have improved the living standards for millions of Chinese and reduced cold-war tensions. Those who are serious about seeing China continue to change will understand and realize that extension of NTR is the best course of action for the U.S. to follow. 
   There is no question that China's political system remains undemocratic. But we should not fail to acknowledge the progress that has been made over the past two decades, thanks in part to the leverage provided by U.S. trade. To acknowledge this change is not to minimize the real problems that do exist; it is only to recognize that changes are taking place, and that many of these changes are a direct result of greater engagement with the West. 
   To seek to deny China NTR status is tantamount to seeking to slam shut the Chinese people's door to a free world, and consigning them to isolation and repression. That is certainly not in our national interest, and it is not in the interest of the Chinese people, either. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleague to oppose this motion.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Georgia so well stated, this legislation is patterned after the President's Executive order that he issued in 1995 which targeted the assets of the powerful Colombian drug kingpins. 
   That order expanded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to include ``specially designated narcotics traffickers.'' As issued, the President's Executive order applied to four drug traffickers affiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal is to completely isolate those targeted drug traffickers. 
   The Executive order blocks any financial, commercial, and/or business dealings with any entity associated with those named traffickers--to include criminal associates, associated family members, related businesses, and financial accounts. 
   The way this amendment would work is the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would develop a list of specially designated narcotics traffickers worldwide in consultation with the Department of Justice, the CIA, and the Department of State. 
   The President could amend the list, and he would officially sign off on the list. Then that Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would enforce sanctions with criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation for corporations, and $250,000 for individuals, as well as up to 10 years in prison. 
   It is a meaningful sanction. 
   By focusing on the financial relationship between drug cartels and their associated business relationships, the Executive order--and now this amendment--is directed toward those entities that created the drug problem in our country. And those entities can be located anywhere in the world. They are major drug traffickers. 
   This order has proven successful in quelling the Colombian Cali cartel. This amendment expands it worldwide. Under this Executive order, more than 400 Colombian and other companies and individuals affiliated with drug trafficking have been targeted by the Treasury Department. These entities are denied access to banking services in the United States and Colombia. Existing bank accounts have actually been shut down. As a result, more than 400 Colombian accounts have been closed. That has affected over 200 companies and individuals engaged in drug trafficking. 
   By February 1998, through the President's Executive order, over 40 of these companies with estimated combined annual sales of over $200 million have been forced out of business. 
   The Rodriguez Orejuela business of the Cali cartel has been particularly damaged by their lack of access to banks in the United States and Colombia. These companies have been forced to operate largely on a cash basis because most banks now refuse to provide them services. 
   One of the cartel's holdings, Laboratorios Kressfor, eventually went through liquidation because of blocking actions by the U.S. banks. Other business accounts were closed because of the sanctions it incurred as a result of doing business with drug traffickers. This company, too, is now in liquidation. 
   Drug cartels today are more powerful, more violent, and have a far greater reach than traditional organized crime organizations ever had in the past, and they kill more people. 
   I believe they pose a most significant threat to the national security of this country. 
   We have seen that destructive power over and over again. In Colombia, Mexico, Burma, Cambodia, Nigeria, and elsewhere drug traffickers have used violent means to pursue their deadly trade. They are the common enemy of all civilized nations. We need to work together to meet this common threat. 
   The United States is not immune from the devastating effects of global drug trade. Measured in dollar values, at least four-fifths of all illicit drugs consumed in the United States are of foreign origin. Four-fifths of drugs consumed in the United States are of foreign origin, including virtually all of the cocaine and heroin. 
   These cartels have now made strong inroads in major cities including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas, San Francisco, and San Diego. They are enlisting and have enlisted street gangs as distributors. They are spreading their operations throughout our Nation and arrests are taking place in less likely places--Des Moines, IA; Greensboro, NC; Yakima, WA; New Rochelle, NY. 
   The President's 1995 Executive order targeting the Cali cartel in Colombia was an effective means of isolating the cartel and its affiliated businesses. It choked off vital revenue streams and helped the Colombian Government take down the cartel. 
   With the authority to reach countries beyond Colombia, the President can now work, if this amendment is passed, to isolate other major criminal drug syndicates around the world and impose upon them and their associates a similar fate to that of the Cali cartel. It is my hope that with a new emphasis on this expanded authority and with the concerted intelligence effort to develop sufficient data about the cartels and their associates in this country and abroad, the United States will be able to work with our allies to expose, isolate, and cut off the major drug-trafficking syndicates that pose a threat to all of our societies. 
   This crucial mission can only be accomplished together. We must work together to see that our governments are properly equipped to carry it out successfully. To that end, this amendment establishes clear procedures through which the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the CIA, and the Defense Department can gather information, share that information with their counterparts, and make recommendations to the President as to those cartels that represent the greatest risk to our Nation. 
   Coordinated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department of Treasury, the expanded program will target new international drug cartels with the same successful financial choke holds that worked so well in Colombia. This will not be an easy process. The results will not be immediate. A great deal depends on intelligence and its availability. It also must be applied universally. 
   This legislation is a serious effort to hit the world's major traffickers where they live and to put them and their associates out of business. 
   I thank Senator COVERDELL for working so tirelessly with me on this bill. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting our efforts. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator DODD to increase patient access to life-saving clinical trials. This amendment could assist in prolonging the lives of millions of patients with life-threatening or serious illnesses, for which no standard treatment is effective, by offering them access to new experimental therapies. 
   Clinical trials are the primary means of testing new therapies for deadly diseases such as cancer, congestive heart failure, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. Many health insurance plans cover the patient's routine costs associated with clinical trials. Recently, however, research institutions--particularly cancer centers--are finding that managed care plans will not pay for the costs associated with clinical trials. For many patients whose conditions have not responded to conventional therapies, clinical trials may be the only viable treatment option available. 
   The Dodd amendment requires health plans to cover the routine patient costs associated with these trials. Eligible patients are those with life-threatening or serious illnesses for which no standard treatment is effective, and those for whom participation offers meaningful potential for significant clinical benefit. Trials are limited to those approved and funded by one or more of the following: the National Institutes of Health (NIH); a cooperative group or center of the NIH; or, certain trials through the Department of Defense or the Veterans Administration. 
   The Republican bill does not provide for coverage of any routine costs related to clinical trials. Instead, they require only a study on the issue. The Republican bill does not offer hope to patients who have exhausted all other options except the promise of experimental treatment. We should not have to tell the thousands of desperate women with terminal breast cancer that we need to study this issue some more before we can offer them access to clinical treatment that might save their lives. 
   Republicans claim that we do not have enough information about the costs of clinical trials. They say we need, once again, yet another study. Every day we delay, with conversations about the need for another study which will undoubtedly demonstrate the continue importance of clinical trials, another patient suffers; another patient dies. The Republicans' claim that clinical trials are more expensive than conventional therapies is unjustified. The fact is that the cost of conventional therapies is not known with any precision. The cost varies case-by-case. 
   Republicans claim that covering the cost of patient care in clinical trials would be too expensive. The Congressional Budget Office found that 90 percent of health plans already cover routine patient costs in clinical trials. In an attempt to block patient access to clinical trials, insurance companies try to claim that a clinical trial is more expensive than conventional therapy. However, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the cost of treating pancreas, breast, colon, lung, and ovarian cancer pursuant to a clinical trial were compared to the costs of treating the same cancers with standard therapies. Utilizing Medicare patients for this comparison, the average cost per patient was actually lower for those patients enrolled in clinical trials. 
   Let me explain who pays for trials. There are three categories of costs associated with a clinical trial: 
   First, the cost of the investigational drug is provided free of charge by the pharmaceutical sponsor. 
   Second, the costs associated with collecting and analyzing the data from  the trial is covered by the trial sponsor through a federal research grant or other funding source (i.e., National Institutes of Medicine, Food and Drug Administration). 
   Third, routine patient care costs--physician charges, hospital fees and routine diagnostic tests--are the only costs that managed care plans would be asked to cover for patients participating in clinical trials. And as I mentioned earlier, over 90 percent of health plans already cover routine patient costs in clinical trials. 
   By early in the next century, Hispanics, African-Americans, and Native Americans will comprise nearly one-half of our nation's. In fact, Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group in America today. This is alarming since heart disease, cancer, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes are disproportionally affecting minority communities. 
   Some specific forms of cancer affect ethnic minority communities at rates up to several times higher than national averages. African-American males develop cancer 15 percent more frequently than white males. Although the rate of breast cancer among African-American women is not as high as that among white women, African-American women are more likely to die from the disease once it is detected. Cervical cancer is nearly five times more likely among Vietnamese American women than white women, and it disproportionally affects Hispanics. Liver cancer is more than 11 times higher among Vietnamese Americans than among whites. Colon and rectal cancer is higher among Alaska Natives than other ethnic groups. Lastly, American Indians experience the lowest cancer survival rate of any U.S. ethnic group. 
   However, access to clinical trials is especially limited for racial and ethnic minorities. Of the people participating in clinical cancer trials, only 2-3 percent are minorities. The September Cancer March's Research Task Force said that one way of encouraging more participation is to require public and private insurers to cover the routine medical costs associated with clinical trials. Senator DODD's amendment to the Patients' Bill of Rights does just that. 
   In addition, women, the elderly, ethnic and racial minorities, and cancer patients are not participating in clinical trials proportional to the population. The September Cancer March's Research Task Force testified before the Senate Cancer Coalition that only 2 percent of cancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials. Of those participating, only 25 percent are elderly, even though the elderly represented some 63% of the cancer patient population during the mid-1990s. 
   Breast cancer is one of many diseases that cause more deaths among minorities than among white women. Researchers and patient advocates agree that understanding differences in disease progression requires the recruitment of a representative number of minorities to clinical trials. So why don't more ethnic/racial minorities participate in clinical trials? There are several reasons. Lack of access to health care and lack of insurance coverage are major reasons; 43 million Americans are uninsured. This number does not include the millions who are under-insured. 
   In closing, real improvements in health care, advancements in medical knowledge, are possible only through increased scientific clinical research and development. We cannot lose sight of the fact that without continued clinical research and access to clinical trials, life threatening diseases such as cancer will continue to ravage communities. Encouraging participation in clinical trials is essential, if not crucial, to the millions of Americans who live daily with life-threatening diseases. The unrelenting focus by HMOs on cutting rather than focusing on the long-term quality of our health care system is harming the American people, and we are not gaining scientific knowledge. 
   As our nation continues to move to a managed care based health system, patient enrollment in clinical trials is dropping. One of the reasons for this decline is the unwillingness of many health plans to cover routine patient care costs associated with participation in a clinical trial. This amendment to the Patients' Bill of Rights is the first step to ensuring access to clinical trials. We cannot continue to let HMOs put profits before patients.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my heart is heavy because, as I believe the Senator from Vermont knows, I was the lead Democratic sponsor of the D'Amato bill on mastectomy and cancer rights in the last Congress. Then Senator SNOWE became the lead Republican author on it when Senator D'Amato left the Senate and I am the lead Democratic sponsor in this Congress. So I feel very strongly about this bill and the amendment before us. 
   But what I see in the tactics being used is of very deep concern to me. Yesterday, we saw the Frist language on medical necessity essentially wiping out the Democratic language requiring that medical necessity be based on generally accepted principles of medicine. Our amendment would have covered a hospital stay for mastectomy as well any other hospital stay, by simply giving the physician the responsibility to make the call on how long a patient should stay in the hospital. 
   Now we have these individual cases like hospitalization for mastectomy. It is a very strong case that the Senator from Vermont makes. I myself saw, in 1996, where a major HMO in California was doing a same-day mastectomy and women who had surgery at 7:30 in the morning were being pushed out on the street in the afternoon, not recovered from anesthetic, with drains in their body, not knowing where they were or how to care for themselves. That simply is not the good practice of medicine. 
   So I think all of us have resolved that we want to do something about this situation. But at the same time, you give us a Hobson's choice, and that is unfortunate because Senator Dodd's amendment, requiring plans to cover the routine costs of clinical trials, is a good amendment. 
   I am the vice chairman of a national cancer dialogue initiated by the American Cancer Society. President George Bush is the chairman. Not too long ago I had the pleasure of spending the day with President Bush on one side of me and Mrs. Bush on the other while I chaired a meeting of the cancer dialogue. One of the outstanding results of that particular day was strong support for more access to clinical research trials. The entire clinical trial research effort is not going to be successful unless there is more access to these trials, and particularly by the minority population where participation is very small, largely because managed care plans do not cover the non-research, routine costs of care. 
   Therefore, Senator DODD's amendment is timely, it is necessary, it is scientifically correct, it will help us speed these trials, add more trials, and it will mean a quicker cures for diseases if we pass the Dodd amendment. 
   The Hobson's choice, for those of us who have worked on this now for over 3 years, is that by voting for Senator Snowe's amendment, we negate the Dodd amendment. That is not right. It is not good medicine. It is not good politics. 
   I, too, join in complimenting my colleague and friend from California and the Senator from Maryland, both of whom spoke eloquently on this. Please, please, please don't do this. 
   Senator DODD asked that his amendment be modified to include the Snowe amendment in his amendment. Twice I heard the Senator from California and the Senator from Maryland propound a unanimous consent request. I am also going to do the same thing. Don't present this body with this kind of Hobson's choice. Both amendments are necessary. Don't wipe out the clinical trials coverage amendment while attempting to put in patient protections for cancer patients. The American public deserves to be able to participate in clinical trials which, after all, could save your life, save the lives of the women of America, and men, because breast cancer affects men too. My father-in-law died of breast cancer when my husband was 10 years old. 
   Please, don't do this. 
   I, too, propound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that S. 1344, the Daschle substitute, be modified with language from the Snowe amendment No. 1241 prohibiting drive-through mastectomies and coverage for second opinions.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the importance of patients being able to see medical specialists. I support the Bingaman amendment to the HMO bill before us. 
   As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I am keenly aware of the importance of being able to see a doctor that has the expertise to properly diagnose and treat illnesses, particularly a complex or difficult-to-diagnose illness. There are hundreds of medical conditions that probably require a specialist and sooner or later we all have to visit with one--whether it be a dermatologist, a cardiologist, or an oncologist, to name a few. 
   For cancer, here's how the American Cancer Society has expressed it:  
   Diagnosing and treating cancer is complex, multi-stage process often involving many visits with an oncologist or other specialist. Timely referrals are critical. However, according to a poll [March 1997] by the Commonwealth Fund, 8 of 10 physicians in managed care plans report ``somewhat or very serious problems with being able to refer patients to specialists of their choice.'' This same poll also found that 22 percent of physicians with more than half of their patients in managed care plans say they have a direct disincentive to refer.  
   The amendment before us would: 
   Require plans to refer patients, who have conditions requiring treatment by a specialist, to specialists in a timely manner. If a qualified specialist is not available in the plan, it requires the plan to cover services provided by the outside specialist at no additional cost to the patient. If a qualified specialist is available in the plan, it requires the patient to pay any costs over what the plan would pay; 
   Require plans to permit patients to designate specialists as their primary  care physician, when the patient has a life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling disease requiring specialized care over a prolonged period of time, such as cancer or heart disease. The specialist would coordinate the patients' overall care; and 
   Require plans to give patients with a condition requiring ongoing care, a standing referral to the specialist so that patients do not have to obtain a separate referral for each visit. 
   We need to pass this amendment guaranteeing access to specialists because we have heard story after story about managed care plans refusing to let sick people see a specialist and using financial incentives to, for example, punish doctors who refer to specialists. A study reported in the November 19 New England Journal of Medicine found that 57 percent of physicians said they felt pressure from managed care plans to limit referrals. 
   Sick people need specialized care. This amendment addresses the concerns of many doctors and patients who have shared their experiences with me. Specialists, from neurologists to pediatric nephrologists, report that plans regularly deny referrals for their specialized expertise. Even more troubling, these specialists report that they often still find themselves called for advice in these complicated cases without the benefit of ever having seen or examined the patient. 
   Here are some examples: 
   Dr. Jack Thomas, of Long Beach, California, in a Los Angeles Times article on May 13, 1999 said that one patient was ``in severe pain for several weeks while awaiting orthopedic consultation'' and that urgent consultation with gynecology was not approved after a two-week wait for another patient who continued ``to experience severe dysfunctional uterine bleeding.'' 
   When the list of providers for the HMO did not have any physicians skilled in the treatment of brain tumors with which her daughter Sarah had been born (and as had been recommended by a neurosurgeon), Brenda Pederson, of San Mateo, California reports that her HMO told her ``we're not giving you second best, we're giving you what's on the list.'' Patients such as Sarah should not be limited to who is ``on the list,'' but should be able to go the doctor her mother and her doctor believe has the expertise to treat the illness. 
   Dr. Jack Shohet, Director of Neurology, University of California, Irvine, has said, ``Delay of referral is very common in the area in which I practice.'' He gives the following example: A 48-year old woman presented to her primary care provider about 6 months before seeing Dr. Shohet, with complaints of an ear ache. She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics over 5 months by her primary care physician. The primary care physician noted a large mass in her auditory canal and biopsied it. It was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. He then referred to her Dr. Shohet (who is out of network) for therapy. By this time, she had a fungating mass with metastasis and cancer and spread in her neck. She had to have an operation which necessitated sacrificing her hearing. He says, ``One wonders how extensive her disease would have been 5 months earlier had she been referred early on to a qualified specialist.'' 
   Denial of care is the biggest ethical concern to a majority of younger physicians, according to the August 1998 California Physician. 
   Having a standing referral to a specialist for ongoing care is important too. Patients should not have to continually return to their primary care provider for a referral when they have found a specialist who can treat that illness. California has a state law allowing enrollees who require continuing care to have standing referrals to specialists. 
   Writing to me in March of this year, a constituent who has battled chronic disease for twenty years requiring multiple surgeries noted, ``I cannot underscore the incredible waste of time it is for patients with Crohn's disease to have to see two doctors for every visit to the gastroenterologist!!'' This bill requires a standing referral to specialists for persons who require ongoing care from specialists so that patients can get the care they need in a timely manner. 
   Care by specialists benefits patients with chronic disease. Analyzing data about asthma patients in a major California HMO (Health Net), a report in the March 9, 1998 Archives on Internal Medicine concluded ``asthma specialists provided more thorough care than did primary care physicians.'' A 1997 study from the Mayo Clinic notes that ``outcomes, coordination, and patient satisfaction are superior when specialists have a central role'' in the management of chronic rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. 
   Specialists' care is good business. Providing access to speciality care makes good business sense. Citing its ``market-driven design'' including use of focus groups, Blue Shield of California has been offering direct access to speciality care since 1998. Its ``Access Plus'' plan allows patients to go directly to a specialist for a fixed, $30 copayment per visit. In the May/June 1999 issue of Health Affairs, Blue Shield senior managers Kathleen Richard and Ken Wood report that the health plan is the fastest growing HMO in California. They also report that patient satisfaction has increased by 50 percent. 
   And how much did this new program cost? Blue Shield found that the actual cost of the direct access program was much, much lower than even they themselves had forecast--fully 75 to 90 per-cent less than what they had anticipated. 
   Providing prompt, continued access to specialists can also result in cost savings in a managed care environment. Dr. Roland Blantz who heads the Division of Nephrology at the University of San Diego noted in a visit to our office a seven-year Kaiser study in the Los Angeles area which showed highly significant savings when patients were referred to kidney specialists for evaluation and treatment of elevated creatinine levels. 
   Our California experience shows that access to specialists can improve patients' health and increase plan satisfaction while keeping costs down. 
   Delayed care hurts. The bill requires that plans provide timely referrals to specialists who are available and accessible. A December 1998 General Accounting Office report on specialty care found that heart attack survivors who were seen regularly by cardiologists have better compliance with medications, by a factor of almost 50 percent, over treatment by generalists. Having to wait weeks or even months to get an appointment with a specialists from an HMO is a frequent complaint. 
   Mary Schriever of Cypress, California tried to get a referral from her HMO for psychiatric care for her son Bill who had performed self-mutilation on his arms by burning and carving himself. After two refusals over 18 months, they paid themselves for him to see a counselor. But even as his behavior deteriorated more, their further attempts to obtain the help of a specialist continued to be rebuffed. It was only in jail, after he was taken into custody by the police, that he finally saw a physchiatrist. Before being released and after a fight, he died of a brain hemorrhage. 
   Some have said, HMOs are fine--until you get sick. 
   A recent survey by Franklin Health entitled ``Facing Serious Illness in America'' and published on May 17, 1999, found that ``fully 6 out of 10 Americans believe that the current system is profoundly inadequate when it comes to dealing with medical catastrophes'' and that 93 per-cent of those surveyed believed that it is very important to have the right to choose one's own doctor regardless of plan. 
   Patients should not have to fight for their health care. This amendment will ensure that when people are really sick and need to see experts, they can. They will be able to use often what little energy they have when ravaged by serious illness to obtain the specialized care they need to make important decisions at such critical times. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. This amendment essentially puts into the bill the basic premise of the Republican plan, which is to let the HMO define what is medically necessary, decide what the treatment should be, what the length of hospitalization should be for a patient, not based on that patient, not based on medical necessity, but based on standards that individuals who have not even seen the patient determine. 
   I must tell you I have a very real problem with that. The insurance plan would determine medical necessity, not the physician who sees the patient. It would substitute an independent review process for the knowledge and the skill of the independent physician who is actually seeing the patient, who has done the diagnosis, who knows the patient, the patient's history the patient's problems. 
   This past week I spent a good deal of time in California talking with physicians and patients up and down the State. I probably talked with more than 50 people, including patients, hospital administrators, county medical societies of many different counties as well as the California Medical Association. What I found was a dispirited, demoralized medical profession because medical decisionmaking was being taken out of their hands. I learned that a physician would prescribe medication, the patient would go to the druggist to have the medication filled and the druggist would make a substitution, often without even the doctor knowing. The patient would say: I cannot take this drug. And the pharmacist would have to say: We cannot furnish what your physician prescribed because it was not on your plan's list. This is what we mean by medical necessity --the most appropriate medical treatment for that particular patient in the judgment of the treating physician. 
   I contend there is not anyone who has not seen a patient, who doesn't know what patient is all about, who can adequately prescribe for that individual. That, in fact, is what is happening. 
   Let me read a statement by someone who testified before a congressional House committee a couple of years ago in a hearing. This individual was the reviewer for an HMO. As an HMO reviewer, she countermanded a physician. Let me read her words:  
   Since that day I have lived with this act and many others eating into my heart and soul. For me, a physician is the professional charged with the care of healing of his or her fellow human beings. The primary ethical norm is, `Do no harm.' I did worse. I caused death. 
   Instead of using a clumsy weapon, I used the simplest, cleanest of tools, my words. This man died because I denied him a necessary operation to save his heart. I felt little pain or remorse at the time. The man's faceless distance soothed my conscience. Like a skilled soldier, I was trained for this moment. When any moral qualms arose I was to remember I am not denying care, I am only denying payment.  
   That is why this Republican amendment is so fallacious. Let me read the actual language in the bill:  
   A review of an appeal under this subsection relating to a determination to deny coverage based on a lack of medical necessity and appropriateness, or based on a experimental or investigational treatment, shall be made only by a physician with appropriate expertise including age appropriate expertise, who was not involved in the initial determination.  
   My father, chief of surgery at the University of California, would turn over in his grave with this kind of language. That is not what someone goes to medical school and does a residency, does a surgical residency, does graduate school work for, to get overturned  by an insurance company reviewer who has not even seen 
   the patient. This amendment, I contend, is in the worst of medical practice because it allows a panel that has never seen the patient to make the determination of whether a patient gets a lifesaving operation, gets a drug that might make them well, gets a treatment from which the physician thinks they might benefit.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As a matter of fact, I can read terminology right out of insurance contracts, which I was going to read had my amendment been able to come to the floor. As the Senator knows, the purpose of this amendment is essentially to defeat the amendment I was going to offer, that I did offer to the Agriculture Appropriations bill and that I said last week that I was going to offer to this bill, to allow the physician to give the treatment and prevent the HMO from arbitrarily interfering with or altering the treating physician's decision, whether it be the treatment or the hospital length of stay.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if this definition, the definitions we have been debating on what is medical necessity--if the Republican definitions were supported by medical organizations, I might think they are pretty good. But there is virtually no physician-oriented organization anywhere in the United States that I know of that supports this particular definition of medical necessity. Every single one of them supports the definition in the Daschle bill. 
   I think the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from North Carolina spoke eloquently as to why. Since the Senator from North Carolina remains on the floor, I would like to ask him this question. The Senator from Rhode Island read the definition from a particular insurer. Let me reread it:  
   [This company] will have the sole discretion to determine whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a physician or other provider will not establish that the care is medically necessary.  
   Then, in view of that, if you read on the top of page 180, in the bill, which sets out the guidelines for the standard of review for the independent reviewer, at the top of the page and the bottom of page 179:  
   The independent reviewer will take into consideration appropriate and available information including any evidence-based decisionmaking or clinical practice guidelines used by the group health plan or insurance issuer.  
   How would an independent reviewer make a decision?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But there is a small chance a bone marrow transplant might help you, I would advise that you have it, 
   and if the health plan with this language turned it down, I would have no opportunity to have that bone marrow transplant?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In other words, if I may, through the Chair, if this amendment were to be adopted, every enrollee of an HMO plan would have to read the fine print very carefully, because all an HMO would have to do is put in a disclaimer, either medical necessity based on least cost or medical necessity based on the fact that the plan would have the ultimate say on how medical necessity is defined.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I must respond to the Senator from Oklahoma because he mischaracterizes the Democratic plan. His statement might be correct if it were taken in an isolated sense. But if you take it with the medical necessity definitions on page 85 of the Democratic plan, you will see that ``a group health plan and a health insurer, in connection with a provision of health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services are delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment.'' 
   Then it goes on to define medical necessity as a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice. It does not give the plan the opportunity in its fine print to throw out medical necessity.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the long road to enacting this critical legislation is finally coming to an end. 
   The conference report now before the Senate is the product of more than seven months of tough, complex negotiations between the high-tech industry, the White House, trial lawyers, consumer groups, computer consultants, countless Members of the House and Senate and other interested parties. 
   The final, bipartisan bill--now supported by the President--will create a once in a millennium, three-year law. Without it, I believe we could see the destruction or dismemberment of America's cutting edge lead in technology. 
   Mr. President, several well-known consultants and firms, including the Gartner Group, have estimated that Y2K litigation could quickly reach as high as one trillion dollars. This potential litigation flood could prevent companies from solving Y2K defects, and as a result could put the high-tech engine that has propelled our economy to new heights at risk. 
   This bill is especially important to California, where over 20 percent of the nation's high-tech jobs are located. 
   And the problem extends beyond high tech companies into the lives of employees, stockholders and customers of a wide range of American business. 
   We solved part of the Y2K problem last year when Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation to protect companies who make statements about Y2K problems in order to help others predict and solve these problems before they occur. 
   But we must now take an extra step, in order to encourage companies to work to prevent and fix Y2K problems with minimum delay. 
   Without this bill, companies may be forced to devote far too many resources to preparing for lawsuits rather than mitigating damages and solving Y2K problems. 
   And many consultants have come to us and said that they have refused to become involved in helping companies solve Y2K problems, for fear that they will open themselves up to being sued later on. They would rather just not get involved. 
   As a result, the very people capable of fixing Y2K defects are unavailable to perform those fixes. 
   I believe we face a real problem, and we have tried to craft a real solution. 
   And crafting that solution has not been easy. On almost a daily basis, Senate staffers, industry representatives, opponents of the bill and others have met for hours at a time to hammer out differences, clarify language, and make significant, substantive changes to the early versions of these bills. 
   In fact, even before the Conference Committee met over the last week, the original sponsors of Y2K litigation reform, including myself and Senators HATCH, MCCAIN and WYDEN, made dozens--if not hundreds--of changes to these bills. We addressed every concern we could, we significantly limited the scope of the bills, and we clarified many sections to ensure that plaintiffs and defendants alike will find an even, uniform playing field once the bill passes. 
   And it is important to remember that nothing in this bill is permanent--rather, it is a three-year bill limited to certain specific cases. The bill applies only to Y2K failures, and only to those failures that occur before January 1, 2003. 
   This bill contains a number of key provisions meant to deter frivolous suits and encourage remediation, arbitration, and problem-solving. 
   Most of these provisions have been modified or limited during the negotiations that have taken place over the last seven months. Several changes were made as late as this week, during negotiations with the White House. 
   The bill provides a 90-day ``cooling off period'' during which time no suit may be filed, so that businesses can concentrate on solving Y2K problems rather than on fending off lawsuits. 
   Only one 90-day period may be invoked per lawsuit, and the 90-day period does not delay any injunctive relief--a plaintiff may immediately file for a temporary restraining order or any other type of injunctive relief. 
   The purpose of this section is to give both parties an opportunity to focus on identifying and then correcting any Y2K problems quickly and efficiently. 
   The bill also provides for proportionate liability in many cases, so that defendants are punished according to their fault, and not according to their ``deep pockets.'' 
   Under our current system of joint and several liability, a defendant found to be only twenty, ten or even one percent at fault can nonetheless be forced to pay 100 percent of the damages. 
   This system often encourages plaintiffs to go after ``deep pocket'' defendants first, in order to force a quick settlement. 
   I believe that this system is fundamentally unfair, and I am pleased to say that this bill eliminates joint and several liability in many Y2K cases. 
   Under the new system, defendants will be responsible only for that portion of damages that can be attributed to them. 
   However, the bill does have several specific exceptions to the elimination of joint and several liability. 
   First, any plaintiff worth less than $200,000 and suffering harm of more than 10 percent of that net worth may recover against all defendants jointly and severally. This exception in the bill protects those plaintiffs with a low net worth, but will not unduly injure defendants because the damages recovered will not be great. 
   Second, any defendant who acts with an intent to injure or defraud a plaintiff loses the protections under this bill and is again subject to joint and several liability. We do not want to protect those acting with an intent to harm. 
   Finally, the original Senate bill provided a compromise for those cases in  which certain defendants are ``judgement-proof.'' In cases where a plaintiff cannot recover from certain defendants, the other defendants in the case would each liable for an additional portion of the damages. However, in no case could a defendant be forced to pay more than 150 percent of its level of fault. The Conference Committee increased that cap to 200 percent, making it even easier for plaintiffs to recover the fullest possible extent of their damages. 
   The Conference Committee also inserted provisions in the bill, at the request of the White House, that will allow any individual consumer to recover jointly and severally against defendants for any share of damages that are uncollectible from other, judgment-proof defendants. 
   And for Y2K class action suits, the bill requires that a majority of plaintiffs have suffered some minimal injury, in order to avoid cases in which thousands of unknowing plaintiffs are lumped together in an attempt to force a quick settlement. 
   The bill moves many Y2K class actions into federal court for purposes of uniformity, but at the request of the White House the Conference Committee increased the threshold to get to federal court from the one million dollar level found in the Senate bill to ten million now. Furthermore, the number of required plaintiffs required to move a class action to federal court has been doubled from fifty to one hundred. 
   And the punitive damages section, which has been severely curtailed since early versions of the bill, now caps punitive damages for small businesses only--to $250,000 or three times compensatory damages, whichever is lesser. 
   Another change made to the bill in Conference exempts most intentional torts from the limits on recovery for economic loss. 
   Finally, the conference report provides that state laws on unconscionability will not apply to cases in which individual terms within a contract should not be enforced--a move further protecting the plaintiff's right to recover. 
   Each of the changes made before and during the Conference Committee negotiations has narrowed the focus and effect of the bill, while still maintaining the bill's clear intent to allow companies to prevent, solve and remediate Y2K problems without undue delay stemming from frivolous lawsuits and meritless claims. 
   The ``one trillion dollar litigation headache'' is rapidly approaching, and this Congress can provide some preventative medicine and some anticipatory pain relief in the form of the reasoned, fair, and thoughtful compromise before us. 
   The bill sets forth clear rules to be followed in all Y2K cases, and the bill levels the playing field for all parties who will be involved in Y2K suits--plaintiffs and defendants. 
   Companies and individuals alike will know the rules, and will know what they have to do. And most importantly, the stability that will come from this bill will allow companies to prevent Y2K problems when possible, fix Y2K defects when necessary, and proceed to remediation of damages in an orderly and fair manner. 
   This bill has been through a tortuous legislative drafting process, with criticisms, suggestions and changes made from every side and by every sector of our society. 
   So let us pass this conference report today, let us send it to the President, and let us show this nation that the Y2K crisis will not cripple our courts, will not disrupt our economy, and will not put a halt to the technology engine driving our progress towards the twenty-first century.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to commemorate the Zinfandel grape. 
   The Zinfandel grape has a long and unique history that mirrors the diversity and agricultural development of our nation. Unlike other grapes that today have international recognition--such as Cabernet, Chardonnay, or Pinot Noir--the Zinfandel grape is uniquely and distinctly American. One writer has referred to it as ``the Horatio Alger of varietals, the True American.'' 
   While Zinfandel's exact origins are unclear, we know that it was consumed as a table grape in New England in the 1830's, and that Zinfandel cuttings from a nursery in Long Island were taken by the settlers as they headed west. During the California Gold Rush of 1849, Zinfandel vines were planted and their products consumed as table grapes and as wine. By the 1880's, Zinfandel was the most commonly planted red grape in the West, and the wine made from Zinfandel grapes began winning awards as early as 1859. 
   Today the Zinfandel grape is our most versatile of viticultural products. It is used in jams, jellies, pasta sauces, mustards, and other food products. It is produced as a wine in 14 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas. 
   Zinfandel products now touch every region of the United States, yet knowledge of its uniquely American heritage is poor. I hope that passage of this resolution will bring greater awareness to the public of the notable and uniquely American attributes of this important agricultural product. 
   In my state, there are grape vines in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains that have been alive since the late 1800's. These ancient vines still produce grapes, and the genetic qualities of these grapes so interest scientists that the University of California at Davis has established a ``Heritage Vineyard'' project specifically to study these plants. 
   On a more prosaic level, these old vines are a living link to our past--to a time when many Americans living in the East uprooted themselves and moved to West to cultivate and settle the entire expanse of our country. We should recognize and treasure these historical connections to the development of our nation. 
   Mr. President, let me clarify that this resolution does not seek to commemorate an alcoholic product, or any particular commercial product. It does not seek to commemorate a ``western'' issue, since Zinfandel food products are consumed nationwide and Zinfandel grapes are made into wine in every major portion of the country. Indeed, the very origins of Zinfandel are in the East. Rather, my colleagues and I seek to commemorate a uniquely American agricultural product that has gained international recognition and that is produced and enjoyed in every part of this country. 
   I am pleased to submit this resolution to commemorate the Zinfandel grape and establish January 23-29, 2001, as Zinfandel Grape Appreciation Week.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and colleague, Senator BARBARA BOXER, to introduce a Sense of the Senate Resolution condemning the acts of arson at three Sacramento, California synagogues on June 18, 1999. The resolution also calls on all Americans to categorically reject crimes of hate and intolerance. 
   I believe this measure is important not only to the Sacramento community but also to all Americans who abhor intolerance. 
   I was shocked and saddened when I first heard the news that three synagogues in Sacramento had been targeted by arsonists. Committed just a few hours before dawn, this heinous attack was carried out over a 45 minute time span signaling to us that this was deliberate and premeditated act. 
   In that time, $1.2 million in damage was done to the Congregation B'nai Israel, Congregation Beth Shalom and the Kenessett Israel Torah Center. While the damage to the property was severe, no dollar amount can reflect the true damage done when hateful crimes such as these strike at the heart of a community. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is tragic that even though we have made significant progress to increase tolerance in this nation that such vicious hate crimes continue to be committed. 
   This resolution expresses our resolve to ensure that such acts of ignorance and bigotry will not be tolerated in this nation and those who commit them will face swift justice. While the resolution condemns these specific acts of arson in the Sacramento area, it also declares our collective abhorrence to all crimes of intolerance. 
   The resolution also says that the Senate is committed to using Federal law enforcement personnel and resources to identify the persons who committed these heinous acts and brings them to justice in a swift and deliberate manner. It also recognizes and applauds the residents of Sacramento area who have so quickly joined together to lend support and assistance to the victims of these despicable crimes, and remains committed to preserving the freedom of religion of all members of the community. 
   I believe that one of the most sacred rights we have as Americans is the freedom of religion. This country came to be because people wanted to be able to choose how they worshiped. I hope that in the wake of this sorrowful event, we are all reminded of the importance of this freedom. 
   Whatever the motive in these arsons, all people of faith in the Sacramento community and this nation must stand together to fight such hatred. The bottom line is that hatred, bigotry and racism all come from the same place--ignorance. 
   California's modern heritage is one in which diversity is to be respected, not scorned. As long as hate crimes continue to counter that heritage, we must work together to denounce intolerance and the protect the rights of all. 
   Mr. President, while we have made progress to increase tolerance in this nation, tragic events like these in Sacramento prove that we still need to do more. Together, we must send the strongest possible message that hate crimes will not be tolerated.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, and my colleagues in urging the majority to appoint conferees and proceed to conference on the juvenile crime bill. 
   It has now been one month and four days since the Senate passed the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, by an overwhelming margin of 73-25. It has been nearly two weeks since the House of Representatives passed its counterpart bill. 
   And yet, since that time, there has been no progress at all toward going to conference on these two bills. In fact, it appears that there are some on the other side of the aisle who deliberately want to forestall or even de-rail the conference that is necessary to pass this vitally-needed legislation. 
   When the House passed its counterpart bill, they did something that is very unusual: they did not take up the Senate bill, insert the text of their bill, and request a conference, as is routinely done. This is not the kind of thing that happens by accident. For a conference to take place, both Chambers of Congress must pass the same bill.  
   Because the House of Representatives did not do this, one of the two Chambers must take up the other one's bill, pass it, and ask for a conference. This presents numerous opportunities for procedural mischief and delay by those who would rather not see any bill pass than one containing modest gun safety provisions, such as the Senate bill. 
   Mr. President, I am very disturbed by this delay in taking the next step to pass this important legislation. 
   Our nation was rocked 2 months ago by the tragic shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, coming as it did in the wake of earlier school shootings in Jonesboro, Arkansas; West Paducah, Kentucky; Springfield, Oregon; and elsewhere. We cannot tolerate or evade this shocking school violence. We should not let our children start a new school year without passing this important legislation to address youth violence. 
   The Senate bill is a wide, sweeping measure, which will help us to confront the problem of juvenile crime. It includes a number of provisions which I authored and which I have worked on for several years, including: 
   A ban on importing high capacity ammunition magazines; 
   A ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines; 
   A comprehensive package of measures to fight criminal gangs; 
   Limits on bombmaking information; 
   The James Guelff Body Armor Act, which contains reforms to take body armor out of the hands of criminals and put it into the hands of police; and 
   Crime prevention programs. 
   It also contains other modest reforms to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, including: Requiring the same background checks at gun shows which gun dealers have to preform; and requiring the sale of child safety locks with handguns. 
   The Senate bill also establishes a new $700 million juvenile justice block grant program for states and localities, representing a significant increase in federal aid to the states for juvenile crime control programs, including: 
   Additional law enforcement and juvenile court personnel; 
   Juvenile detention facilities; and 
   Prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble to begin with. 
   Our bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, through the implementation of graduated sanctions to ensure that subsequent offenses are treated with increasing severity. 
   It reforms juvenile record systems, through improved record keeping and increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and schools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in California can know if he has committed violent offenses in Arizona; and extends federal sentences for juveniles who commit serious violent felonies. 
   Let us not delay further in enacting these important measures. I join my colleagues in urging the majority to proceed to conference and appoint conferees, so that we can enact this vital legislation. 
   I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the 2nd degree Amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky. Without the McConnell Amendment, I find that I must oppose the underlying Amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas. 
   Although I think that many of the goals and objectives of Senator BROWNBACK's Amendment are worthwhile--I too believe in establishing a policy of greater U.S. engagement with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia--I find that I must oppose this Amendment because it contains a fatal flaw: I do not think that Congress should get rid of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which this Amendment does, so long as Azerbaijan continues its decade-long blockade of Armenia and Karabakh. 
   The McConnell Amendment, which retains Section 907, would fix this flaw. 
   Expanding Azerbaijan's eligibility for assistance from the United States without seeking progress on the resolution of this issue runs the risk of legitimizing precisely the sort of behavior which the United States, on the cusp of a new century, must seek to discourage. 
   Azerbaijan is already eligible for U.S. humanitarian assistance, as well as funds for democracy building and many trade benefits. All that Azerbaijan has to do under Section 907 to be eligible for the full range of U.S. assistance is to ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' 
   In other words, all it has to do is end hostilities, end an act of war, and seek to settle this dispute peacefully. If Azerbaijan were to take these simple steps there would be no need to repeal Section 907--its restrictions would no longer apply. Is it too much to ask another country that it end a state of war before we provide it with additional foreign assistance? 
   In fact, given Azerbaijan's continued unwillingness to make an effort to peacefully resolve this issue, gutting Section 907 rewards Azerbaijan for continued bad behavior, and sends a very disturbing message to others who might behave likewise. Basically we would be saying that it is O.K. to attack your neighbor, impose a blockade, stop food, fuel, and medicine from getting through to those in need, the United States will simply look the other way. In fact, we will do more than look the other way, we will consider offering you military assistance. I do not think this is the sort of message we should be sending. 
   The nations of the region must solve their problems via direct negotiations and mutual compromise, not by acts of war. When Azerbaijan shows a willingness to end its blockade and seeks a peaceful resolution of the outstanding issues with Armenia then, and only then, should the United States provide it with the sort of assistance that this Amendment would allow. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the McConnell Amendment. And, unless the McConnell Amendment, which retains Section 907, is passed by this body, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to the underlying Brownback Amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues an issue which I believe is of importance in the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill: U.S. assistance to Egypt. Before I begin, however, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for their expert and sound guidance on this bill. They deserve our commendation for working with such tight 302(b) allocations. 
   Egypt is a country that many in the Senate hold in high regard. Egypt is a dependable and steady ally in the Middle East. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of peace between Israel and Egypt, a peace which has served and continues to serve as a benchmark of the end of hostilities between Arabs and Israelis. Since peace between Egypt and Israel was established in 1979, Congress has recognized that in America's relations with these two allies that fair treatment of both Israel and Egypt in the provision of foreign assistance is a key feature in preserving peace and stability in the region. 
   The administration requested as part of its FY 2000 budget that a portion of Egypt's military assistance held in reserve to pay for the potential termination of contracts accrue interest. This proposal, known as an interest bearing account (IBA), would allow interest to accrue on approximately $470 million in the termination liability account for Egypt. Israel's military assistance has been treated in this way for some time, treatment that I and many others here support. The net impact of granting Egypt this treatment would be about $20 million in interest to Egypt, without any additional cost or outlay by the U.S. taxpayer. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I support the administration's request for an IBA for Egypt, and I feel very strongly that Egypt should have the  same terms as Israel. The Department of State has made a commitment to Egypt on this issue, and I think it is important that this commitment be kept. 
   Despite our support for an IBA, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that the IBA would be scored as a $470 million outlay--despite the fact that it actually costs nothing--and would thus break the Senate's tight outlay ceiling for this bill. Although support for an IBA for Egypt is strong--I am confident that on the merits an Amendment proposing an IBA would have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues--the Senate is confined at this time in our actions by budgetary pressures. 
   I am hopeful that we might still be able to resolve this scoring issue and perhaps address the question of an IBA for Egypt in Conference. 
   Again, I thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for their work on this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with them on this issue.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks and appreciation to Ambassador James Sasser for the excellent job he has done as United States ambassador to China. After more than three years of dedicated service, Ambassador Sasser will be stepping down from his position. 
   Ambassador Sasser served during an interesting, often strenuous, period of U.S.-China relations. Drawing on his experiences as a distinguished three term United States Senator and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he worked tirelessly to ensure that the United States remained engaged with China to promote stability, openness, and prosperity in that country. Even Henry Kissinger, who initially expressed misgivings about Ambassador Sasser's appointment, recently remarked, ``I have known no American ambassador who has done a better or more passionate job on Sino-U.S. relations than Ambassador Sasser.'' 
   Even during the bad times, when relations soured, Ambassador Sasser has maintained a high level of communication with Chinese leaders and provided a calm and steady influence. He recognized that no single issue can make or break U.S.-China relations and that open and frank dialogue is essential to promoting American values, especially those in the area of human rights. 
   Though he served with distinction for more than three years, perhaps Ambassador Sasser's finest hour came only a few weeks ago. After the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, tens of thousands of angry protesters gathered in front of the American embassy in Beijing and hurled bricks and rocks at the building. The situation was dangerously close to spinning out of control and the lives of those inside the embassy were potentially in danger. Rather than seek cover in a safer place, Ambassador Sasser stayed. 
   Near the end of his service, he provided us with a lasting image of poise, strength, and courage. His actions were indeed inspiring to those that were with him in Beijing and also to those of us who were watching as the events unfolded on television. He represented the finest of Americans who serve their country in embassies and consulates around the world--he was a diplomat who would not give up his post. 
   Again, I congratulate Ambassador Sasser for a job well done and wish him the best for his future endeavors.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his remarks. I don't think anyone in the Senate has ever done more to advance the cause of responsible medical reform than Senator KENNEDY from the State of Massachusetts. He also has been here day after day, with comment after comment, in speech after speech, trying to urge this body to act. 
   My general style is probably not as forceful as that of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. But about this particular issue I am going to be persistent, and I am going to be here for as long as it takes, until there is an opportunity to have a vote on this amendment. 
   Today, this morning, another arrow in the quiver of reform was played out above the fold in the Washington Post--something, as a doctor's daughter and a doctor's wife for many years, I never thought I would see in the United States of America--and that is, the American Medical Association voting to unionize doctors. The subhead under the headline reads: ``Group Acts in Response to Managed Care's Effect on Rights, Duties of Physicians.'' 
   I want to quote two brief things from the article:  
   In setting up what they are calling a ``national negotiating organization,'' AMA officials contended that only through collective bargaining can doctors win back control over which drugs they may prescribe for patients and how much treatment they can provide.  
   Mr. President, it is a disturbing day when physicians have to unionize to be able to prescribe and treat patients as they see fit. I can't believe that this day has come in the United States of America. 
   Let me end on this subject, with one quote from the AMA president, Dr. Nancy Dickey. She said:  
   Traditional unions are there primarily to care for their employee's needs. We are looking for a vehicle that will allow us to carry out the covenant we have with our patients.  
   That is the reason I am proposing this amendment--or hope to propose the amendment. I hope to have an opportunity to offer an amendment that represents the heart of HMO reform. 
   This amendment will prevent managed care plans from arbitrarily interfering with or altering the physician's decision of what is a medically necessary service. The term medically necessary, or appropriate, is defined as ``a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' That is something none of us can be opposed to. If this amendment were in fact the law, it would not be necessary for the American Medical Association to vote to unionize physicians. Physicians would have that right guaranteed by this amendment. Let me prove that by reading the actual wording of the amendment:  
   A group health plan, or health insurance issuer, in connection with health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with, or alter, the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services are delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnose to the extent that such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit. 
   The amendment is saying that if an individual buys a policy which specifies treatment for certain illnesses, the physician will be free to treat that patient as medically appropriate with respect to both the treatment and the setting. 
   That is what physicians at the AMA meeting yesterday just voted, to unionize to be able to care for their patients. Why do they need to have a union to achieve something which is self-evident, which is a part of medical training, which is the history of medicine in the United States of America, and has been the history of medicine in this country, up to the growth of managed care, which again could change and alter that history rather dramatically? 
   The terms ``manner'' and ``setting'' mean the location of treatment and the duration of treatment. That means, whether the treatment is in the office or the hospital, the physician has the right to determine the type of treatment and the length of, for example, the hospital stay. The physician would have the right to determine these things. 
   Physicians today are going to unionize in order to get that basic right, a right which we, the Congress, the Senate of the United States, could, if we chose, give them legislatively. 
   The term ``medically necessary or appropriate'' is defined in the amendment as a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted medical practice--a very standard definition, a very well-accepted definition. 
   This amendment is intended to restore the physician to medical care. Very simply stated, I agree with the American College of Surgeons, which said:  
   Any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon [or doctor] and the patient from the medical decision-making process only undermines the quality of the patient's care and his or her health and well-being.  
   Our system today has done just that. And the action taken by doctors to unionize strongly suggests that. 
   Medical providers today are feeling kicked around, arm twisted, ``incentivized,'' and compromised when they try to provide good care to sick people. 
   I am compelled to offer this amendment because I have no other choice. Yes, I want to pass an agriculture appropriations bill, but I have been trying for almost 3 years now to pass legislation like this to restore medical decisionmaking to medical professionals. As Congress dawdles, the complaints keep rising, people get poor care, and people die. 
   Let me talk a little bit about managed care. 
   Managed care is a growing form of health insurance in America. I support managed care. I believe it can in fact be a cost-effective way of delivering good health care to large numbers of people. But it can't do that if accountants and the ``green eyeshade'' personnel make the decision for the physician. The physician has to make the decision as to what is appropriate medical care. 
   Today over 160 million Americans--or 75 percent of the insured population--have managed care plans. My State of California--this is the reason I have decided to be so persistent--has the highest penetration of managed care of any state. Eighty-five percent of insured Californians are in some form of managed care. 
   As managed care has grown, so have the complaints. There seems to be a steady stream of them into my offices, and into other Congressional offices and in the media.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to respond to the distinguished--I was going to say the difficult Senator, but I mean the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. 
   I feel caught on the horns of a dilemma. On one hand, what I am seeing is this is never going to happen on an agriculture appropriations bill. On the other hand, what I am hearing is, you have an offer to offer your amendment; it will be second-degreed; it will be defeated; there won't be a real opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on the amendment. 
   Our leader, I believe, is willing to come to a reasonable agreement whereby the main points of the Patients' Bill of Rights can be debated on the floor with an agreement that amendments be voted up or down within a certain period of time. 
   But he is very astute. I do not think he wants us to find out that someone comes on the floor, takes up all the time, there is no opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the amendments, there is one vote en bloc, and then the majority leader can come on the floor and undo it all after it is over. 
   What we are asking for, and maybe now is as good a time as any--I have learned there are times when you go to the wall and there are times when you do not go to the wall, and it is important to know the difference in the timing. 
   Let me share with the Senator one story that happened at UCLA, which is why I feel so strongly about this Senate passing legislation that prevents arbitrary interference with the physician's treatment and the setting of that treatment, in other words, the hospital length of stay. If the Senator wants, I can give him the doctor's name and he can verify it. 
   This is about a neurosurgeon who performed surgery at the UCLA Medical Center to remove a brain tumor. The patient's managed care plan covered 1 day in the intensive care unit. After that day, the patient had uneven breathing and fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The doctor wanted her to stay in the hospital another day for monitoring. The HMO utilization reviewer consulted the guidebook that said only 1 day was allowed in the ICU, so she was denied the extra day. The doctor thought it would be medically unethical to move the patient out of the ICU, so he kept her there. The next day, the HMO called again and said the cost of the second day would be deducted from the surgeon's fee. 
   That is the kind of thing that is happening. We have to put an end to it because the result is going to be terrible for the practice of medicine. There are now doctors voting to unionize, to collectively bargain. I know some people have said with some disdain: Oh well, that's just over their wages. I am here to say it is not. 
   My own doctor at Great Mount Zion Medical Center, now part of the University of California, after 30 years of practice, says he has never been so disillusioned, never been so disappointed. He said the morale of doctors is so low from being countermanded all the time by medical plans and having to hassle to get a drug approved. Using this kind of disincentive of, if you believe a patient belongs in ICU after brain surgery for an additional day, we are going to deduct it from your fee--what kind of a practice of medicine is that? 
   These are big issues, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, because, in my view, they are life-or-death issues. We have a chance to address it. I do not want to legislate on an agriculture appropriations bill, but, on the other hand, I believe to the depth and breadth and height of me in this amendment. Other colleagues have other amendments. 
   The time has come to have a debate on the issue. Our leader will negotiate a fair agreement. I really think it is in your hands. We want an up-or-down vote on these amendments. 
   This is not an amendment that has been just quickly put together for what someone might say is a political purpose. This amendment has been worked on, it has been vetted, and it is supported by 200 organizations and supported by every single medical organization in this country--nurses, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association--across the board. 
   No one should be afraid to keep a patient, following brain surgery, in intensive care for an extra day. The gall of the 
   health insurance plan to say, OK, we are deducting it from the doctor's fee. I hope the Senator will have some reaction to this, because I know that is not the way he wants to see medicine practiced in this country. 
   I can go on and on. Perhaps because my State is such a big managed care State, there are so many examples. They need to be stopped, and there is no better time than right now. All we need is an agreement that will allow some amendments--leave it up to our leaders--up-or-down vote, and prevent the opportunity from sidetracking that up-or-down vote. At the end of this, we will have something. 
   Senator KENNEDY was absolutely right. I remember all the wrangling over the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, and then finally, bingo, it just got done. That is what we are asking for now. That is what the people of America are asking for now as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask the Senator, before you do, may I respond to one quick thing you said on ``medical necessity''? 
   You made the comment: Nobody really knows what ``medical necessity'' is. Let me just very briefly read you the definition because it is a standard definition. The term ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriateness'' means, with respect to a service or benefit, ``a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' That is the definition of ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriateness'' in this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't want to be redundant, but I would like to continue the statement I began to make earlier this morning. Let me quickly put it in perspective. 
   The statement further explains an amendment that I have at the desk, which essentially says that a group health plan or an insurance issuer may not arbitrarily interfere with, or alter, the decision of the treating physician with respect to the manner or the setting in which particular services are delivered if those services are medically necessary or appropriate. 
   It then goes on to define ``medically necessary'' as ``that which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' The amendment, of course, means that the doctor can determine what is a medically necessary length for a hospital stay, and the doctor can determine the kind of treatment or drug the patient can be best treated with. 
   I know some people wonder why am I so vociferous about physicians making medical decisions. California has the largest number of individuals in managed care. We have around 20 million people in managed care plans in California. 
   I have heard of many different cases. Let me just give you one other case--I just talked about the person with the brain illness. I can also give you the case of the Central Valley man, 27 years old who had a heart transplant and was forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not pay for more days. That constituent of mine died. That is the reason I feel so strongly. 
   Additionally, I know--and the Washington Post this morning documents--that doctors are increasingly frustrated, demoralized, and hamstrung by insurance plans' definitions of medical necessity. An American Medical Association survey reported in the March 2, 1999, Washington Post, quoted an AMA spokeswoman who said that some managed care companies have begun to define explicitly what treatments are ``medically necessary,'' and they have chosen to define them in terms of lowest cost. 
   She says:  
   Doctors used to make that decision solely on the basis of what was best for the patient.  
   She stressed that doctors are unhappy that managed care organizations are ``controlling or influencing medical treatment before the treatment is provided.'' She said, ``Denials and delays in providing care directly harm the health and well-being of the patients.'' 
   A fall 1998 report found that ``patients and physicians can expect to see more barriers to prescriptions being filled as written,'' according to the Scott-Levin consultant firm, because HMOs are requiring more ``prior authorizations'' by the plans before doctors can prescribe them. 
   Then, as I spoke of a little earlier, there is the issue of financial incentives, another form of interference in medical necessity decisions. In November, the New England Journal of Medicine pointed out:  
   Many managed care organizations include financial incentives for primary care physicians that are indexed to various measures of performance. Incentives that depend on limiting referrals or on greater productivity applies selective pressure to physicians in ways that are believed to compromise care.  
   That is what we are trying to stop.  
   Incentives that depend on the quality of care and patients' satisfaction are associated with greater job satisfaction among physicians.  
   Let me describe how Charles Krauthammer put it in writing in the January 9, 1998 Washington Post under the headline, ``Driving the Best Doctors Away'':  
   The second cause of [doctors leaving the profession] is the loss of independence. More than money, this is what is driving these senior doctors crazy: some 24-year-old functionary who knows as much about medicine as he does about cartography demanding to know why Mr. Jones, a diabetic in renal failure, has not been discharged from the hospital yet. Dictated to by medically ignorant administrators, questioned about every prescription and procedure, reduced in status from physician to ``provider,'' these doctors want out.  
   Mr. President, that is a sorry commentary, and it is the truth.  
   One of my deepest interests is cancer. I cochair the Senate Cancer Coalition with the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Connie Mack. Let me quote from a report of the President's Cancer Panel: 
   Under the evolving managed care system, participating physicians are increasingly being asked to do more with less--to see a greater volume of patients and provide significantly more documentation of care with less assistance or staff. In addition, managed care has dictated a major shift to primary care gatekeepers who are under pressure to limit referrals to specialists and care provided in tertiary care facilities, and may be financially rewarded for their success in doing so.  
   Nancy Ledbetter, an oncology nurse and clinical research nurse coordinator for Kaiser Permanente said, ``......necessary care is being withheld in order to contain costs.'' This is from the June 16, 1999 Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
   A breast cancer surgeon wrote me:  
   Severe limitations are being placed upon surgeons in giving these women [with breast cancer] total care.......Patients feel that their care is reduced to the mechanics of surgery alone, ignoring the whole patient's medical, emotional, and psychological needs.  
   Surely, one of the oldest axioms of medicine, and the way my father used to practice medicine, is that you can't just treat the wound, you have to treat the whole patient as an individual, as a human being. 
   In my State, again, over 80 percent of people who have insurance are in managed care. Forty percent of California's Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care. Some say Californians have been pioneers for managed care. Some even say Californians have been the Nation's ``guinea pigs.'' 
   The complaints don't abate: delaying diagnoses and treatments as tumors grow; trying the cheapest therapies first, instead of the most effective; refusing needed hospital admissions; refusing to refer patients to specialists who can accurately diagnose conditions and provide effective treatments; 
     we hear complaints about shoving patients out of the hospitals prematurely, against doctor's wishes. We hear complaints about misclassifying medically necessary treatments as ``cosmetic.'' 
   We hear about plans demanding that doctors justify their care and second-guessing doctors' medical judgments. 
   We have had heard about doctors exaggerating the patient's condition to be able to give them a certain drug, or keep them in a hospital beyond a certain length of time, to get plans to pay for care. 
   I hope this amendment can restore some balance to the system by empowering patients and the medical profession to provide the kind of quality medical care that people not only pay for but that they deserve. 
   That is why I feel so strongly about this amendment. 
   Again, I harken back to the day when I had the first example in 1997 of a woman in a major managed care plan undergoing an outpatient radical mastectomy--7:30 in the morning, surgery; 4:30, out on the street with drains hanging from her chest, and unable to know where she was going. 
   That is not good medicine. 
   I can only end my comments on this amendment by saying that the amendment is sincerely presented. 
   The amendment is the heart of a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The amendment should not increase premium costs. 
   The amendment is what the American people expect. 
   And the amendment simply says that an insurance company cannot arbitrarily interfere with the doctor's decision with respect to treatment or hospitalization. 
   I don't think that is too much to ask this body to legislate and to state unequivocally, and I think every single person in my State, as well as every State, will be much better off once this is accomplished. 
   Let me end by saying that I believe that Senator DASCHLE is willing to work out an agreement which allows a number of amendments to come to the floor and be debated, provided that these amendments can be voted up or down. 
   I suspect that what we are going to really end up with is a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights. I suspect that if we can get this unanimous consent agreement, we will find that there will be many on the other side of the aisle who will vote for this amendment, and there will be some of us who will vote for some of the amendments on the other side as well. 
   It seems to me that when you have a situation whereby the physicians in America have reached the point where they have decided to unionize and collectively bargain that this should be a very loud call that all is not well with the practice of medicine in the United States of America. 
   It should be a very loud call for a unanimous consent agreement which will allow us, on the floor of the Senate, to work out a series of amendments which can provide the kind of quality care that the people of the United States are entitled to, and that certainly 20 million Californians in managed care are. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, when we return to the bill, it will be my intention to offer an amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill. I think that my amendment will deal with one of the most fundamental concerns in health care today; that is, the restoration to the physician of the basic right of patient care, patient treatment, and to be the determinator of patient care and the length of hospital stay. 
   I think one of the things we have seen emerge in health care throughout the United States in the past 2 to 3 years is the development of the so-called green eyeshade of an HMO determining what is appropriate patient care, regardless of the physical condition of an individual patient. 
   The amendment I will offer essentially says that a group health plan or a health insurance issuer, in connection with health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services are delivered, if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnosis to the extent that such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit. In other words, if you have coverage for a treatment in your plan, the physician determines that treatment based on you, based on your needs, based on your illness--not based on the calculation of a green eyeshade in a health insurance plan. 
   My father was a surgeon. He was chief of surgery at the University of California. My husband, Bert Feinstein, was a neurosurgeon. I grew up and lived a good deal of my life in a medical family. In all of that time, the doctors determined the appropriateness of care, the doctors determined the length of hospitalization, the doctors determined whether a particular treatment was suitable for an individual--not an arbitrary HMO, not physicians out of context of an individual physician and patient. 
   Every person sitting in this gallery today is different, one from the other. They are different in how they react to drugs. They are different in how they react to radiation--

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am on the floor because I anticipated that at 2 o'clock we would be returning to the agriculture appropriations bill. I indicated this morning that I would be proposing an amendment to that bill that has to do with giving the physician the right to provide medically necessary services in a setting which that physician believes is best for the patient. I now see that this has been postponed an hour, so I would like to speak to the amendment now and then introduce it at 3 o'clock. I hope there will be no objection to that. 
   Let me begin by saying, once again, what this amendment does. Essentially, the amendment says that a group health plan or a health insurance issuer, in connection with health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or the setting in which particular services are delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnosis, to the extent that such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit. 
   I read that specific language because it is important to understand that because most people buying a health insurance plan believe that their doctor is, in fact, going to be prescribing the treatment that is best for them, not the treatment that is the least cost effective, not the treatment that might run a risk to the patient but be good for somebody else, but the treatment or the procedure, in an appropriate setting, that is right for that patient. What is right for a patient who is 18 years old may not be right for a patient who is 75 years old, and so on. I will read from the legislation the definition of ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriateness'':  
   The term ``medical necessity'' or ``appropriate'' means, ``with respect to a service or a benefit, a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.''  
   That is something that everyone expects, that everyone is accustomed to in this Nation, and I believe that is the way medicine should, in fact, be practiced. I am very pleased to say the language of this amendment, from the  larger Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 6) is supported by some 200 organizations all across the United States, including the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; the American Academy of Neurology; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Association of University Women; American Cancer Society; American College of Physicians; American Heart Association; American Lung Association, and the American Medical Association, which is the largest association of practicing physicians in the country. 
   Then there is the American Psychological Association; the American Public Health Association; the American Society of Clinical Oncology; virtually every breast cancer organization; the Consumer Federation of America; the Epilepsy Foundation; the Leukemia Society; the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations; the National Association of Children's Hospitals; the National Association of People with AIDS; the National Council of Senior Citizens; the National Black Women's Health Project; the National Breast Cancer Coalition; the Older Women's League; the Paralyzed Veterans of America--on and on and on. 
   This is a widely accepted amendment that virtually has the support of every professional and patient organization that deals with health care anywhere in the United States. 
   Let me read a statement from the American College of Surgeons, certainly the most prestigious body for surgeons, and one to which my husband, Bert Feinstein, belonged:  
   We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and patient from the medical decisionmaking process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well-being. 
   Similarly, the American Medical Association has said, ``Medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators.''  
   I have worked on this now for 3 years. In the last Congress, I introduced legislation to allow doctors to decide when to discharge a woman from the hospital after a mastectomy. I did this with Senator D'Amato in the last Congress and with Senator SNOWE in this Congress. And I introduced a bill that would allow doctors to decide when to discharge a person from the hospital after any procedure or treatment, with Senators D'Amato and SNOWE. 
   Why do we need these bills? Senator MIKULSKI from Maryland this morning made a very impassioned case about mastectomies. And we learned in 1997 that women were being pushed out of the hospital on the same day after a mastectomy. 
   I was amazed to hear from a woman named Nancy Couchot of Newark, CA, who wrote me in 1997 that she had a modified radical mastectomy at 11:30 in the morning and was released from the hospital by 4:30 that afternoon. She could not walk to the bathroom without help. She said in her letter:  
   Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt for overnight stay to receive professional help and strong pain relief.  
   Victoria Berck of Los Angeles wrote that she went in at 7:30 a.m. and was released at 2:30 p.m. with drains attached to her body. She said, ``No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.'' 
   It was a very large health care network in California that was doing these ``drive-through'' mastectomies on the same day. 
   I believe ``drive-through'' mastectomies have been largely stopped, but patients had to rise up, and patients had to say you can't do this to me. You can't push me out a few hours after an anesthetic with drains in my body, having had a radical mastectomy and not being able to take care of myself. 
   What if the woman is 75 instead of 25? It makes no sense. 
   We also learned that insurance plans were insisting one-night hospital stays if you had a child. 
   We learned that babies--infants--were going home with jaundice, and they had to come back to the hospital for treatment once, twice, or three times. There was a lot of ``tsk-tsking.'' What a terrible procedure. How could they do this? Now it has changed because Congress acted, requiring a minimum of two days for childbirth, for a normal delivery. What if you need 5 days for care, or 6 days for care? 
   The point is that it should be a decision made by the physician. It should not be countermanded by someone unqualified to make that decision.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the cloture motion to proceed to H.R. 975, the Steel Import bill. I do so for three reasons. First, I think that this legislation is protectionist and invites retaliation under the World Trade Organization; second, I believe that it may endanger the health and stability of the international economy; and, third, I believe that it may endanger the health and stability of the U.S. economy, including the steel industry it is intended to protect. 
   I understand the appeal of this legislation for those who support it, and believe that they are well intentioned in wishing to see legislation passed which protects the U.S. steel industry. 
   As supporters of this legislation have pointed out, there was an undeniable surge in steel imports into the United States last year. Over the past three years, economic instability in East Asia, Russia, and Latin America have resulted in a weakening of the world steel market. According to the Congressional Research Service, between August 1997 and August 1998, imports surged almost 80%. 
   But today, it is important to note, steel imports have returned to their pre-crisis levels, down roughly 44% in April 1999 since last August's peak, according to the office of the United States Trade Representative. 
   Where I disagree with supporters of this legislation, then, is that although I too believe that some complaints about unfair competition and unfair trade practices are, of course, warranted, the solution to those complaints found in this bill--the imposition of unyielding import quotas--is an approach which I believe to be counterproductive and even potentially harmful to the health of the U.S. economy. 
   First, the protectionism sought by this bill would put the United States in violation of world trade rules, and would invite retaliation against U.S. producers of a range of goods in overseas markets, jeopardizing jobs at home. 
   The World Trade Organization permits the application of ``safeguard measures'' such as quotas only in very specific circumstances, and never unilaterally. In the absence of a determination that the product in question is being imported in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, unilateral measures such as those included in this bill are not permitted. And if a nation takes such a unilateral measure, the countries affected are allowed to take retaliatory measures. 
   Thus, if this legislation is enacted, the United States would face the real possibility of retaliation by the world's steel exporting countries. Under the WTO rules, other countries will have the right to retaliate against our exports. They could put at risk our most competitive sectors--such as agriculture, high-tech, or pharmaceuticals. 
   In fact, a June 18 letter signed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the International Dairy Foods Association, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, among others, states that:  
   At a time when U.S. farmers are facing severe financial hardships, continued access to global markets Is critical to preserve farm income ..... since growth for the U.S. agricultural sector hinges on access to world markets, passing legislation that violates the WTO threatens economic growth in the farm sector.  
   In addition, there could also be retaliation against U.S. products that use steel, such as automobiles, heavy machinery, or construction. For example, according to a letter I received from Boeing:  
   In 1999 we expect to deliver approximately $18 billion in airplanes to international customers, many of whom are struggling to purchase these planes as a result of the Asian financial crisis. A number of these airplane deliveries could be at risk if new limits on imported steel are imposed.  
   The unilateral protectionism embodied in this bill would undermine the international trading system and the institutions, rules, and regulations to safeguard the international economy that the United States has worked so hard to put into place over the past fifty years. As we have seen in numerous cases, these institutions and rules have helped the U.S. gain market access when other nations sought to prevent it, and have helped the U.S. economy to grow and created numerous jobs here in the United States. 
   As the world's largest trading nation, U.S. interests are best served by supporting--not undermining--the rules-based international economic and trading system. 
   This leads me to my second point, and the second reason I am opposed to this legislation: I believe that this legislation threatens to undermine the health and stability of the international economy, and with it the base  for much of America's current economic prosperity. Free trade has been a prime ingredient in the eight year U.S. economic boom. 
   Moreover, in the past year we have begun to turn the corner on a global economic crisis. Maintaining open world markets is vital to global recovery in Asia, Russia, Brazil, and elsewhere. These countries have not closed their markets to U.S. products despite the economic pressures they have faced in the past several years. If the U.S. takes a significant step towards protectionism, it will set off a global chain-reaction. 
   Indeed, according to a May 25 letter I received from Raymond Chretien, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, passage of this legislation:  
   ......would set a protectionist precedent that would encourage other industries, in the U.S. and other countries, to seek unilateral relief outside of legitimate, established, trade remedies. The world economy, and workers in affected countries, can ill afford the turmoil that could ensure in international commerce. 
   According to Brookings Analyst Robert Crandall, HR 975 is ``one of the most blatantly projectionist pieces of legislation since the 1930s''. I do not believe that a single member of this body wants the United States, or the international economy, to risk a return to those days of global depression. 
   Finally, although the quotas might have some marginal palliative effect for some of the old-line steel factories, they would have a far larger effect on the overall health and well-being of the U.S. economy, and threaten to harm countless other U.S. workers and consumers. 
   This is the third reason I oppose this bill: I believe that it is bad for the U.S. economy, including the steel industry. 
   To take one example, steel import quotas would increase the price of steel used by the automobile industry, harming the auto industry and auto workers, and would in turn show up in higher auto sticker prices, harming U.S. consumers hoping to be able to purchase reasonably priced cars. 
   In short, steel import quotas will undermine U.S. manufacturing competitiveness in a range of industries and business that rely on steel, from metal fabrication to transport to industrial machinery to construction; industries that in toto employ over 8 million workers. 
   For example, I received a letter from the Aggressive Engineering Corporation, a small California company that serves military and commercial industry in their metal stamping needs. According to this letter:  
   Our company relies on steel from domestic producers. However, U.S. steel producers are able to supply only about 75% of the demand for steel, leaving a yearly shortfall of 30 million tons. In order to maintain our operations in the United States, we depend on foreign steel.....While we all agree that it is important to maintain U.S. jobs and job growth, steel is no less important than other sectors. Please remember that steel-using industries employ more than 40 American workers for every worker in the steel industry. Quotas do not work. They will harm consumers and steel-consuming industries to a much greater extent than they could ever help steel producers or steelworkers.  
   It is also important to keep in mind that although many of the old-line steel mills face serious difficulties, that is not the same as saying that overall the U.S. steel industry is in trouble. In fact, many of the problems faced by old-line steel mills stem less from import problems than from decades-old mills that are unable to compete with the efficient new mini-mills located right here in the United States. Even as the U.S. faced the ``import surge'' last year, U.S. mills rolled out 102 million tons of steel in 1998, the second highest total in the past two decades. 
   In addition, The Wall Street Journal has reported that 25% of the steel entering the United States last year was bought by American steelmakers, who otherwise could not have met the demands of their customers. 
   In other words, while seeking to protect the steel industry, this legislation could in fact harm the industry by protecting the least efficient producers at the expense of the more efficient, and by preventing American steelmakers from getting access to the steel they need to meet customer demand. 
   In response to this surge in imports last year, earlier this year the Administration put in place an aggressive Steel Action Plan to strictly enforce the trade laws already on the books; enter into new bilateral agreements with Japan, Russia, and Korea regarding their steel imports to the United States; create new sources of early import data and an active monitoring of safeguards; and lend support for the Section 201 safeguard law. 
   In addition, the Department of Commerce determination on the import surge this February, recently supported by a finding of the International Trade Commission, has paved the way for the Administration to slap duties on Japanese and Brazilian steel and forced Russia to restrict its imports. 
   I believe that the Administration's response has been tough but fair. And I believe that the proof of the effectiveness of this response is in the pudding: By all accounts the steel import crisis is over, with imports having receded back to pre-crisis levels. 
   Under these circumstances--passing potentially harmful quota legislation after the crisis has passed--is the wrong way to approach this issue, and I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the cloture motion to proceed to this bill.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my amendment calls upon the Department of State to provide Congress with a report on the global proliferation of small arms and light weapons, and State Department activities to address this issue. 
   For fifty years we have been used to thinking about arms control in terms of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. But, to my mind, the widespread proliferation of small arms and light weapons has now emerged as an equally pressing issue on the international arms control agenda. 
   Let me try to sketch out the scope and dimension of this problem, and why I think it is critical that this issue be included in the first-rank of U.S. arms control and security policy: 
   An estimated 500 million illicit small arms and light weapons are in circulation around the globe. 
   In the past decade, an estimated 4 million people have been killed in civil war and bloody fighting. Nine out of ten of these deaths are attributed to small arms and light weapons, and, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, more than 50% of those killed are believed to be civilians. 
   The sheer volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, among others, as well as the sort of violence endemic to narco-trafficking in Colombia and Mexico. 
   According to a report last year by ABC News, at least seven million illicit small arms and light weapons are in circulation in West Africa. 
   According to Human Rights Watch, a variety of small arms and light weapons were readily available on the black market in Rwanda prior to the civil war and genocide in that country: 
   In 1994 an AK-47 could be purchased in Rwanda for $250; 
   a grenade for $20; and, 
   a 60mm Mortar Bomb for $85. 
   More than 50 million AK-47s have been manufactured in the last 40 years, far more than are accounted for in government stockpiles or registries. During the past decade it is estimated that more than 1 million Uzis and 10 million Uzi copies have gone into circulation. 
   According to the South African Institute for Security Studies, an estimated 30,000 stolen firearms enter the illegal marketplace annually in South Africa. Mozambique, a country whose total population is 15 million, has more than 10 million small arms in circulation. 
   Although there are no reliable statistics available, numerous analysts and press reports have noted that in recent years various actors in the Russian military, government, and mafia have been active in selling large quantities of Russian military equipment on the black market. 
   The United Nations and the Red Cross estimate that there are that more than 10 million small arms are in circulation 
   in Afghanistan, where the terrorist organization of Osama Bin Laden is based. 
   Over 1 million small arms--ranging from pistols to AK-47s to hand grenades--are readily available in arms bazaars on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border. Many of these weapons are believed to flow to the Kashmir, where they contribute to the instability and tension between India and Pakistan, who both now posses nuclear weapons. 
   The United Nations estimated that over 650,000 weapons disappeared from government depots in Albania in the three years leading up to the outbreak of violence in the Balkans, including 20,000 tons of explosives. The NATO peacekeepers who are now moving into Kosovo may be under threat and danger from these weapons. 
   In fact, the increased access by terrorists, guerilla groups, criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a real threat to U.S. participants in peacekeeping operations and U.S. forces based overseas. 
   Although it is my belief that the United States is not the biggest contributor to the problem of the global proliferation of small arms and light weapons--the United Nations has found that almost 300 companies in 50 countries now manufacture small arms and related equipment, a 25% increase in production since 1984--in 1996 the U.S. licensed for export more than $527 million in light military weapons. With the average price of $100-300 per weapon, this represents a huge volume of weapons. 
   Most troubling, there is increased incidence of U.S. manufactured weapons flowing in the international black market. In 1998, at the request of foreign governments, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms conducted 15,199 traces of weapons used in crimes. 
   In 1994, Mexico reported 3,376 illegally acquired U.S.-origin firearms. Many of these weapons were originally sold legally to legitimate buyers but then transferred illegally, many to the Mexican drug cartels, once they left the United States: Between 1989 and 1993, the State Department approved 108 licenses for the export of $34 million in small arms to Mexico, but it performed only three follow-up inspections to ensure that the weapons were delivered to and stayed in the hands of the intended users. 
   Other countries have equally porous arms sales and licensing regulations: In the United Kingdom, only 24 of 2,181 arms export licenses to 35 countries were refused last year. 
   Clearly this is a huge problem, with profound implications for U.S. security interests. As Secretary Albright noted in her speech to the International Rescue Committee last year: ``The world is awash in small arms and light weapons.'' 
   The purpose of this amendment is very simple. It calls for a Report by the Department of State to provide Congress with an assessment of the dimension of the problem, the threats posed by these weapons to U.S. interests, and the activities of the Department regarding the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.  
   It is my hope that this information will provide policymakers with a better understanding of this issue, whether sufficient resources are being devoted to addressing the threats posed to U.S. interests, and if additional resources will need to be directed towards this issue in the future. 
   I understand that the Managers have cleared and will accept this Amendment for inclusion in the State Department Authorization bill. As a former member of the Foreign Relations Committee it was a pleasure to be able to work again with my former Chairman and Ranking Member, and I would like to thank them for working with me on this Amendment. I look forward to the opportunity to continue to work with them on this important issue.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator BENNETT, and commend him for the fair and responsible bill that has been put together. This is my first year as the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, and I have found Senator BENNETT to be very open and willing to discuss issues. His leadership on our subcommittee is carried out in the best bipartisan spirit.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator BENNETT, just outlined for the Senate, the fiscal year 2000 legislative branch appropriation bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on Thursday, June 10, 1999, by a vote of 28-0. As reported by the committee, the bill, which totals $1,679,010,000 in budget authority, exclusive of House items, is $113,962,000, or 6.4 percent, below last year's enacted level and $104,529,000, or 5.9 percent, below the President's request. For Senate items only, the subcommittee recommends a total of $489,406,000--a reduction of $28,187,000, or 5.4 percent, from the President's request. 
   For the Capitol Police, the subcommittee recommends a total of $88.7 million for salaries and general expenses. This is an increase of $5.8 million, or 6.8 percent, over last year's enacted level. I commend the agency for soliciting a management review which was conducted by an outside consulting firm. Since that time, the Capitol Police has been very aggressive in addressing the management deficiencies outlined in that report. First, they provided the subcommittee with a departmental response which addressed the findings of the review, and they are currently in the process of developing a strategic planning process which will provide for a systematic approach to organizational enhancements and professional growth for the future. In this regard, this bill contains the funding required for improvements to information technology and transfers this responsibilities from the Senate Sergeant at Arms to the Capitol Police. This action was recommended in the management review report. The bill also provides for cost-of-living and comparability increases for the men and women of the United States Capitol Police. 
   For the General Accounting Office, the subcommittee recommends a funding level of $382.3 million, which is $4.8 million below the budget request, but is almost $10 million above what the House is proposing. The level proposed by the subcommittee will permit the GAO to maintain the current level of 3,275 FTEs, which is what the Comptroller requested for Fiscal Year 2000 and it will also provide adequate funds for them to meet their mandatory requirements. 
   Mr. President, I also want to take a minute, as I did during our full committee markup, to talk about the Senate Employees Child Care Center. As Members may be aware, the groundbreaking for the child care center began in the fall of 1996, and the center was to be completed in the fall of 1997. Here we are in June of 1999, and the center remains incomplete. I have encouraged the Architect of the Capital to raise the priority of this project and bring this problem-plagued project to completion by the current targeted date of September 1, 1999. This new center will expand the quality of child care services available to the staff who help us. 
   Again, Mr. President, I want to personally thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator BENNETT, for the courtesies he has extended to me. He is, indeed, a most thoughtful and gracious chairman--a real gentleman--who has made my first year on the subcommittee a most pleasant one. 
   If I may, Mr. President, I extend my very sincere thanks to Mary Dewald and Christine Ciccone of the staff for their excellent work on this bill. It has been very special, and we are blessed with wonderful staff.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the fact that last week the Senate voted to provide an additional $300 million for medical research in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. I joined with several of my colleagues in urging that critical funding for cancer research be included in the bill. 
   Included in this account are $175 million for breast cancer research, $75 million for prostate cancer research, and $50 million for other medical research including ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and childhood asthma. 
   In recent years, the DOD's Department for Health Affairs has made great strides in innovative medical research. The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program is an excellent example of these advancements. During its six years in existence, the program has grown from a small isolated project to a well-funded, efficient, and effective part of the cancer research community. 
   As was recommended by the Institute of Medicine, the program is overseen by a group of scientists and patient activists, which helps the program keep up with advancements of the scientific community. This structure has fostered a program praised for its innovation, flexibility, and efficiency. 
   Approximately 90 percent of the program's funds are devoted to research grants. The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program grants have encouraged scientific research to extend beyond traditional research. Specifically, Innovative Developmental and Exploratory Awards (IDEA) grants are targeted for innovative research efforts that explore new approaches in areas that offer the greatest potential. 
   The program also incorporates consumer and community needs in its research priorities. By including consumer advocates in decision-making and by bringing clinical trials into the community, the program has integrated the goals of advocates, scientists, and patients. This unique approach has proven successful both in the research the Program has produced and the future research it has inspired. 
   Similar to the Breast Cancer Research Program, the DOD Prostate Cancer Research Program is conducted according to the model established by the Breast Cancer Program. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 179,300 American men will develop prostate cancer this year, and about 37,000 will die of this disease. Though I am encouraged by the news that the survival rate for this type of cancer has increased from 50% to 85%, we clearly can and must do more. 
   Replicating the much-praised Breast Cancer Program mission and structure, prostate research encourages innovation while creating a partnership between advocates and scientists. Research grants are designed to stimulate innovative research and to bolster the national effort against prostate cancer. 
   As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I am very familiar with current cancer research efforts. The DOD cancer research programs are some of the most innovative and effective public-private partnerships that our country has in the battle against cancer. I am confident that commitment to this program will strengthen our nation's cancer research program and help to stop the spread of this dread disease. 
   The additional funding in the DOD appropriation bill is compatible with other progressive funding sources that have been explored in recent years. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp, which I sponsored in the Senate, has raised $6.6 million for breast cancer research. Thirty percent of these funds go to the DOD program. 
   With the work of research programs across the country, we have made some progress in the war on cancer: new cancer cases and deaths in the United States fell between 1990 and 1996; survival time has been extended dramatically for some cancers; we have improved therapies with fewer adverse side effects; and there is increased cancer screening and detection. 
   And yet, sadly, we have a long way to go. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 1.2 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 1999 and about one half million Americans are expected to die of cancer this year alone. 
   But we must look at these disturbing statistics as an opportunity. What these statistics tell us is that we need to multiply, accelerate, and intensify our war on cancer. The additional $300 million for medical research in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill sends a strong signal that we are committed to combating this destructive disease. The Senate should be proud of sending this powerful message.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying McCain-Dodd-Wyden-Lieberman-Feinstein bill, because I believe this bill is a once in a millennium, 3-year law. Without it, I believe we could see the destruction or dismemberment of America's cutting-edge lead in technology. We all know that the year 2000 is rapidly approaching and with it there comes a wide variety of possible disruptions relating to the so-called Y2K problem. 
   It is true, though, that no one really knows how big the problem will be or how small it will be, so government organizations, businesses large and small, and private individuals are all scrutinizing the area from their own particular perspective. The area that has received the most attention is concern over a possible flood of lawsuits that could clog courts and distract businesses from solving these problems early in the next millennium. Several well-known consultants and firms, including the Gartner Group, have established that Y2K litigation could quickly reach as high as $1 trillion. So concerned Members of Congress, including Senators MCCAIN, HATCH, DODD, and others, have been working for many months in an attempt to craft a solution to what has recently been described as this trillion-dollar headache. 
   The genesis of the bill now pending on the floor was a request by literally dozens of companies and more than 80 industry groups--including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, the Information Technology Association--to develop legislation to prevent frivolous and baseless lawsuits that could jeopardize companies moving to quickly solve Y2K problems. The trick was not at the same time to prevent the suit with merit. 
   I began working on a similar bill with Senator HATCH almost 6 months ago, because I became convinced that the Congress did need to intervene in order to ensure that Y2K problems are quickly and efficiently solved. Now, after several months of negotiating and a combined effort among a number of different Senators, I believe we have reached a fair compromise. This bill is especially important to California where over 20 percent of the Nation's high-tech jobs are located. The problem actually extends even beyond high-tech companies to the lives of employees, stockholders, and customers in a wide range of American businesses. 
   One of the first indications I had of the depth of the concern was when groups of consultants began to come to us saying they refused to become involved in helping companies solve Y2K problems for fear that they would open themselves up to being sued later on. Instead, they would rather just not get involved. One such group was the American Association of Computer Consulting Businesses that represent 400 companies and more than 15,000 consultants. They told me personally that they were going to refuse to enter into any Y2K consulting contract until they had some kind of additional protection. So it became very clear to me that, indeed, we do have a real problem. I believe the underlying bill crafts a real solution. 
   I think it is important to say, and say again and again, that nothing in this bill is permanent. It is simply a 3-year bill, limited to specific cases. The bill applies only to Y2K failures and only to those failures that occur before January 1, 
   2003. Let me quickly go over the provisions as I see them. 
   The 90-day cooling off period during which time no suit may be filed enables businesses to concentrate on solving Y2K problems rather than on fending off lawsuits. 
   The bill provides for proportionate liability in many cases, so that defendants are punished according to their fault and not according to their deep pockets. I am not an attorney and I have always felt this was the most fair way to go, except in certain situations, and the bill does provide for those certain situations. I would like to go into this in greater detail. 
   The bill also encourages parties to request and use alternative dispute resolution at any time during this 90-day cooling off period. For Y2K class actions, the bill requires, in order to qualify, that a majority of plaintiffs must have suffered some minimal injury. That would avoid cases in which thousands of unknowing plaintiffs are lumped together in an attempt to force a quick settlement. 
   For small businesses, the bill limits punitive damages to $250,000, or three times compensatory damages, so as to deter frivolous suits. It prevents the ``tortification'' of contracts with several provisions that require businesses to live up to their agreements rather than turning to the courts in the hopes of avoiding their responsibilities. 
   These are not the only provisions in the legislation, but these provisions represent the basic premise of a bill that does not seek to prevent the truly injured from recovering damages, but will hopefully prevent the frivolous lawsuit and keep companies from solving problems without delay. 
   There is much that is not in this bill, and there have been many changes made in the bill, certainly since I became involved in it. I would like to just indicate a few of them. 
   All caps on attorney's fees have been removed. Punitive damage caps for large businesses have been eliminated. Punitive damage caps for small businesses have been increased from three times actual damages to three times compensatory damages. All government regulatory or enforcement actions have been exempted from the bill, and three exceptions to the elimination of joint and several liability are provided in order to protect smaller plaintiffs and those who cannot recover from every defendant. The caps on liability for officers and directors have been removed, and the bill has been changed to provide that per suit there is only one 90-day cooling off period. 
   I think the cooling off period is probably very well known and probably very well accepted, so let me dispense with any further explanation on that point. But let's go to one of the more controversial parts, proportionate liability. 
   One of the reasons this bill is important to the affected companies is that it prevents plaintiffs from forcing quick settlements from innocent defendants who should be trying to solve Y2K problems. Additionally, under the system of joint and several liability, a defendant found to be only 20, 10, or even 1 percent at fault can nonetheless be forced to pay 100 percent of the damages. This system, as we all know, encourages plaintiffs to go after deep-pocket defendants first in order to force that quick settlement. It is my basic belief that this is fundamentally unfair, and the bill eliminates joint and several liability in some Y2K cases. 
   Under the new system, for this brief 3-year period, defendants will be responsible only for that portion of damage that can be attributed to them. The bill does have, as I have said, three specific exceptions to the elimination of joint and several liability, and those  were taken from the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act recently passed overwhelmingly by the Congress and signed into the law by the President. 
   First, any plaintiff worth less than $200,000 and suffering harm of more than 10 percent of that net worth may recover against all defendants jointly and severally. This exception in the bill protects those plaintiffs with a low net worth but will not unduly injure defendants, because the damages recovered will not be that great. 
   Second, any defendant who acts with an intent to injure or defraud a plaintiff loses the protections under this bill and is again subject to joint and several liability. The bill does not protect those acting with an intent to harm. 
   Finally, the bill provides a compromise for those cases in which defendants are judgment-proof. In cases where a plaintiff cannot recover from certain defendants, the other defendants in the case are each liable for an additional portion of the damages. However, in no case can a defendant be forced to pay more than 150 percent of its level of fault. 
   These proportionate liability provisions offer a more fair and, I truly believe, rational approach to the system of damages in Y2K cases. Without this more balanced system, a few large companies will soon be forced to bear the entire brunt of Y2K litigation regardless of fault, and that is the problem. That is what will destroy the cutting edge of American prominence in this area, and that will result in jobs being lost. 
   Under the system of proportionate liability, this bill holds defendants responsible for the extent of their fault and no more, with the exceptions I have just mentioned. 
   Another area that I think deserves a little bit of clarification is the class action area. Under the class action section of this bill, a year 2000 class action suit cannot proceed unless the defect upon which the action is based is material to a majority of class members. This section is very important. Essentially, this clause prevents the type of ``strike suits'' we saw in the securities litigation area. 
   In the Y2K context, this provision will stop overly aggressive plaintiffs from searching out small defects in computer programs, gathering together thousands of software users who do not even know they have been injured, and trying to force a quick settlement out of the software manufacturer. 
   Once this bill passes, if a class action suit alleges that software does not function properly, the action can proceed only if the alleged defect affects a majority of the class members in some significant way. Trivial defects that would not even be noticed by most class members would not be cause for a class action. Again, plaintiffs with good cause may still proceed, but frivolous suits would be stopped. That is the purpose of the provision and the purpose of the bill. 
   There has been a lot of discussion in this Chamber about punitive damage caps. The Dodd-McCain compromise caps punitive damages, for small businesses only, at the lesser of $250,000 or three times compensatory damages. 
   The idea of capping punitive damages is one of the most controversial issues in this or any other bill dealing with changes to our system of civil justice. In this case, I believe reasonable and carefully drafted caps on punitive damages can deter frivolous suits. Additionally, capping punitive damages reduces the incentive to settle meritless suits because companies will not be at risk for huge, unwarranted verdicts. 
   I recognize that this is a controversial issue and that intelligent, well-meaning people may disagree over whether this is the time or the place to address punitive damages. But I 
   have continually emphasized that this bill is not about punitive damages, and the compromise dramatically limits the punitive damage caps compared to earlier versions. 
   In summary, this $1 trillion litigation headache is approaching. This Congress can provide thoughtful, preventive medicine and some anticipatory pain relief in the form of reasoned, fair, and thoughtful compromise. I think the bill sets forward clear rules to be followed in all Y2K cases. I believe it levels the playing field for all parties who will be involved in these suits. Companies and individuals alike will know the rules and will know what they have to do. Most important, there is an element of stability that can come from this bill which will allow companies to prevent Y2K problems when possible, fix Y2K defects when necessary, and proceed to remediate damages in an orderly and fair manner. 
   It is true that some plaintiffs may have to wait a little bit longer to file a suit for damages, but their rights will not be curtailed and recovery will not be prevented. In fact, the waiting period in the bill will make it far more likely that problems will be solved quickly, allowing potential plaintiffs to get on with the activities that were disrupted by the Y2K problem at issue. 
   This bill has been through a tortuous legislative drafting process with criticisms, suggestions, and changes made from every side and by every sector of our society. I hope we can pass this bill and send it to the President, and let us show the Nation that the Y2K crisis will not cripple our courts, will not disrupt our economy, and will not slow our progress toward a 21st century world. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking Senator HARRY REID who has worked so hard with me on the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues Senator BARBARA BOXER and Senator DICK BRYAN for cosponsoring this important legislation. 
   This legislation really comes directly out of the Tahoe Summit. I am one that spent her childhood at lake Tahoe, but I had not been back for a number of years. When I went there for the Tahoe Summit in 1997 with the President, I saw things I had never seen before at Lake Tahoe. 
   I saw the penetration of MTBE in the water. I saw the gasoline spread over the water surface. I saw that in fact 30 percent of the South Lake Tahoe water supply has been eliminated by MTBE. I saw 25 percent of the magnificent forest that surrounds the lake dead or dying. I saw land erosion problems on a major level that were bringing all kinds of sediment into the lake and which had effectively cut its clarity by thirty feet since the last time I had visited. And then I learned that the experts believe that in ten years the clouding of the amazing crystal water clarity would be impossible to reverse and in thirty years it would be lost forever. 
   For me, that was a call to action, and today I am proud to introduce the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. This legislation will designate federal lands in the Lake Tahoe Basin as a National Scenic Forest and Recreation area and will authorize $300 million of Federal monies on a matching basis over ten years for environmental restoration projects to preserve the region's water quality and forest health. 
   Lake Tahoe is the crown jewel of the Sierra Nevada and its clear, blue water is simply remarkable. Some people may not know that Lake Tahoe contributes $1.6 billion dollars every year  to the economy from tourism alone. However, one in every seven trees in the forest surrounding Emerald Bay is either dead or dying. Insect infestations and drought have killed over 25 percent of the trees in the forests surrounding Lake Tahoe, creating a severe risk of wildfire. 
   The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that restoring the lake and its surrounding forests will cost $900 million dollars over the next ten years. This is not a cursory evaluation but a careful evaluation made by this agency over several years. 
   Local governments and businesses in Lake Tahoe have agreed to raise $300 million locally in the next ten years for this effort. The Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a coalition of 18 businesses and environmental groups, including Placer County, El Dorado County, the City of South Lake Tahoe, Douglass County in Nevada and Washoe County in Nevada have all agreed. This is an extraordinary commitment for a region with only 50,000 year round residents. 
   The Governors of California and Nevada have pledged to provide another $300 million, but only if the Federal government will step up and provide $300 million of its own because we must remember that 77 percent of the forest is owned by the Federal Government. 
   President Clinton took an important first step in 1997 when he held an environmental summit at Lake Tahoe and promised $50 million over two years for restoration activities around the lake. These commitments included: $4.5 million to reduce fire risk at the lake; $3.5 million for public transportation; $4 million for acquisition of environmentally sensitive land; $1.3 million dollars to decommission old, unused logging roads that are a major source of sediment into Lake Tahoe; $7.5 million to replace an aging waste water pipeline that threatens to leak sewage into the lake; and $3 million for scientific research. 
   Unfortunately, the President's commitments lasted for only two years, so important areas like land acquisition and road decommissioning were not funded at the levels the President tried to accomplish. So what is needed is a more sustained, long-term effort, and one that will meet the federal government's $300 million dollar responsibility to save the environment at Lake Tahoe. 
   The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will build upon the President's commitment to Lake Tahoe and authorize full funding for a new environmental restoration program at the lake. 
   The bill designates U.S. Forest Service lands in the Lake Tahoe basin as the Lake Tahoe National Scenic Forest and Recreation Area. This designation, which is unique to Lake Tahoe, is strongly supported by local business, environmental, and community leaders. The designation will recognize Lake Tahoe as a priceless scenic and recreational resource. 
   The legislation explicitly says that nothing in the bill gives the U.S. Forest Service regulatory authority over private or non-federal land. The bill also requires the Forest Service to develop an annual priority list of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $200 million over ten years to the forest service to implement these projects on federal lands. The list must include projects that will improve water quality, forest health, soil conservation, air quality, and fish and wildlife habitat around the lake. 
   In developing the environmental restoration priority list, the Forest Service must rely on the best available science, and consider projects that local governments, businesses, and environmental groups have targeted as top priorities. The Forest Service also must consult with local community leaders. 
   The bill requires the Forest Service to give special attention on its priority list to four key activities: acquisition of environmentally sensitive land from willing sellers, erosion and sediment control, fire risk reduction, and traffic and parking management, including promotion of public transportation. 
   The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act also requires that $100 million of the $300 million over ten years be in payments to local governments for erosion control activities on non-federal lands. These payments will help local governments conduct soil conservation and erosion mitigation projects, restore wetlands and stream environmental zones, and plant native vegetation to filter out sediment and debris. 
   I have been working on the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act for over a year, in conjunction with Senator REID and over a dozen community groups at Lake Tahoe. The Lake Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a local consensus group of 18 businesses and environmental groups, has worked extremely hard on this bill, and I am grateful for their input and support. 
   Thanks in large part to their work, the bill has strong, bi-partisan support from nearly every major group in the Tahoe Basin. The bill is supported by the League to Save Lake Tahoe, the South Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce, and the Lake Tahoe Gaming Alliance, to name just a few. Major environmental groups also support the bill, including the Sierra Club, Wilderness Society, and California League of Conservation Voters. 
   The bottom line is that time is running out for Lake Tahoe. We have ten years to do something major or the water quality deterioration is irreversible. 
   We have a limited period of time, or the 25 percent of the dead and dying trees and the combustible masses that it produced are sure to catch fire, and a major forest fire will result. 
   Mr. President, this crown jewel deserves the attention, and the fact that the federal government owns 77 percent of that troubled area makes the responsibility all so clear. 
   I am hopeful that the United States Senate will move quickly to consider the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in preserving this national treasure for generations to come.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Marine Corps has an unfunded requirement for one additional sealift ship to complete their Maritime Prepositioning Force Enhancement [MPF (E)] program. In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lieutenant General Martin Steele concluded that ``obtaining a 20th Large, Medium Speed Roll-on/Roll-off vessel (LMSR) and converting an LMSR to meet all MPF (E) requirements is the best solution to our third ship requirement.'' General Steele also notes that the situation in Kosovo has highlighted the need for the additional ship. In light of these comments, I believe that it is essential that Congress fund the procurement of the 20th LMSR.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree. Funding the vessel will be a win, win, win proposition for the military. The Marine Corps will get their third MPF (E) in a timely manner and at minimal cost, the Army could reach an end state with all eight ships for prepositioning being identical, and the new ship would fill a current sealift shortage of 70,000 square feet of RO/RO in surge sealift. The previous LMSRs have been delivered ahead of schedule and under budget. Funding the 20th ship at this time will save taxpayer dollars in the long run, by keeping the production lien open.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help teachers use technology in their teaching, the Teacher Technology Training Act of 1999. 
   This bill has three major provisions: 
   It authorizes $500 million for state education departments to award grants to local public school districts on the basis of need to train teachers in how to use technology in the classroom. 
   It specifies that grants may be used to strengthen instruction and learning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of teacher training in using technology in the classroom. 
   It requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate the technology training programs for teachers developed by school districts within three years. 
   I am introducing this bill because teachers say they need to learn how to use computers and other technology in their teaching. In a 1998 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, only 20 percent of teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' to integrate educational technology into instruction. 
   Furthermore, the training that does exist for these teachers is inadequate. In the same Department of Education survey, among full-time, public school teachers, 78 percent said they had participated in professional development programs on using educational technology in their instruction, but only 23 percent of those teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' in this area. Of the teachers who report having received some training, 40 percent felt that it had improved their classroom teaching only ``somewhat'' or ``not at all.'' This is unacceptable. What we see now is that in many schools the students know more about how to use computers than the teachers do. In one Kentucky school profiled by Inside Technology Training magazine, the students run the school's computer systems. The article quoted the school district's technology coordinator as saying 
   that the students had ``long surpassed'' what the teachers could do and  reported that one student had recently trained twenty teachers on software for Web page construction (``Fast Times at Kentucky High,'' Inside Technology Training, June 1998). 
   I see this problem in my own state. A report by the Los Angeles County Office of Education in 1996 found that in Los Angeles County, nearly half of the teachers had no experience with computers or had only limited familiarity with word processing software. According to a 1998 report by the California Teachers Association, teachers in California rank training in the use of new technology fourth among eighteen changes they believe could most improve public education. Forty-five percent of the teachers surveyed said more technology training would greatly improve conditions for teaching and learning (CTA for the Next Century, 1998). 
   It is crucial that we given students the opportunity to become familiar with technology in their classrooms because post-high school education and most good jobs require experience using computers. U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has said, ``Opportunities are now dependent upon a person's ability to use computers and engage in using the Internet'' (CQ Weekly, ``Digital Haves and Have Nots,'' April 17, 1999). In my state, a 1997 Rand report found that there is currently a shift in the state's economy away from manufacturing and toward higher-skill service and technology industries, and employers are placing a higher premium on the computer skills necessary for these positions (Immigration in a Changing Economy, Rand, 1997). Students are better educated when their teachers are well trained. We cannot prepare students for the increasingly technological workplace without trained teachers. 
   We have made great efforts to make technology available to students in their classrooms, and now we have a national student to computer ratio of 10 to 1. Seventy-eight percent of our nation's schools have Internet access. These are good first steps. 
   But also essential is having teachers and students use all this technology in their day-to-day classroom activities when it can enhance learning. This will not happen until teachers are trained in how to include technology in their instruciton. 
   One teacher expressed her frustration in an article in the National School Boards Association's Electronic School magazine:  
   Most teachers have no model to show them the advantages of hooking up to the projects available on the Internet. And shrinking school budgets don't provide nearly enough money to train teachers in new or visionary techniques. Meanwhile, we can't escape the magazine and newspaper articles touting the Information Superhighway and heralding new ways of responding to, using, and learning information in our society. Well, who most needs to learn to traverse this road successfully? Society future leaders--and their teachers (Electronic School, ``Going Global,'' February 1995).  
   I agree. 
   Our teachers are not prepared to use technology in their classrooms. Students need to learn to use modern technology and it can help them learn. If we are expecting teachers to use up-to-date methods and tools, we must train them to do so. This bill will provide some of the funds needed to do that. 
   By introducing this bill I am not suggesting that technology is a cure-all for the problems in our schools. Technology is one of many teaching and learning tools. It can bring some efficiencies to learning, for example, providing a new way to do math and spelling drills or keeping students engaged in learning while a teacher works with other students who need extra help. It can also be an important research tool by providing easy access to information that, without a computer, is not easily available. 
   We expect a great deal from our teachers and students. We must give them the resources they need. This bill is one step.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill regarding Russian nonproliferation and U.S.-Russian cooperation on commercial space launch service. 
   This amendment is very simple: It states that a sustained Russian commitment to cooperation with the United States in preventing the proliferation of ballistic missile technology to Iran can provide the basis for an increase in the current quota limit on commercial space launches. Lifting the launch quota is an important incentive for Russia to cooperate with the U.S. on this issue. 
   This amendment also demands continued Russian cooperation on non-proliferation, and calls on the United  States to take every appropriate measure to encourage the Russian government to seek out and prevent the illegal transfer of fissile material or missile equipment or any other technology necessary for the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles. 
   I offer this amendment because I believe that there may be no greater long term threat to peace and stability in the Middle East than an Iran actively seeking ballistic missile and nuclear weapons. 
   Preventing the transfer of illegal nuclear and missile technology from Russia to Iran must be at the top of the U.S. policy agenda. 
   There have been numerous reports over the past several years of Russian missile technology reaching Iran, sometimes with a semi-official wink from government authorities in Moscow, sometimes by rogue operators. 
   Either way, the Russian Government must put a stop to these transfers. 
   As much as we want good relations with Russia, cooperation in this area is crucial. In some ways, I believe it is a litmus test of what sort of player Russia wants to be in the post-cold war international system. 
   There is ample reason for concern. According to a Congressional Research Service report: 
   Despite pledges by Soviet leaders in 1990 and by various Russian leaders since then to ban missile exports, President Yeltsin's 1994 agreement to refrain from new arms sales to Iran, and Russia's entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime in October 1995, there are recurring reports that Russian companies are selling missile technology to Iran and other countries. 
   On February 6, 1997, Vice President Gore issued a diplomatic warning to then-Premier Chernomyrdin regarding Russian transfers to Iran of parts and technology associated with SS-4 medium-range ballistic missiles. Over the next several months, press reports indicated that Russian enterprises provided Iran specialty steels and alloys, tungsten coated graphite, wind tunnel facilities, gyroscopes and other guidance technology, rocket engine and fuel technology, laser equipment, machine tools, and maintenance manuals. 
   Russian assistance has apparently helped Iran overcome a number of obstacles and advance its missile development program faster than expected. The Rumsfeld Commission said, ``The ballistic missile infrastructure in Iran is now more sophisticated than that of North Korea and has benefitted from broad, essential assistance from Russia. *.*.*'' 
   In February 1998, the Washington Times reported that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB, a successor to the KGB) was still working with Iran's intelligence service to pass technology through a joint research center, Persepolis, with facilities in St. Petersburg and Tehran. 
   In March 1998, the State Department listed (but did not make public) 20 Russian entities suspected of transferring missile technology to Iran. 
   Lastly, there are still unanswered questions about Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation raised by the January, 1995 contract signed by the Russian nuclear agency MINATOM to finish one unit of the Bushehr nuclear power project. Although the Bushehr plant itself is not considered a source of weapons material, the project is viewed as a proliferation risk because it entails massive involvement of Iranian personnel in nuclear technology, and extensive training and technological support from Russian nuclear experts. 
   Last year, the American Jewish Committee released a report, ``The Russian Connection: Russia, Iran, and the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction'' which provides an excellent overview of Russia's record in this area, as well as U.S.-Russian cooperation. 
   In addition to the troubling questions raised by some of Russia's past actions, however, there are also indications that the Russian government is making efforts to control the proliferation of missile and nuclear technology to Iran. 
   Although initially Moscow denied that its missiles or missile technology had been transferred to Iran, in September 1997, Russian officials reportedly stated that such transfers were being made without the consent of the government. 
   In January 1998, in response to concerns raised by numerous U.S. officials, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, said of 13 cases raised by the U.S. Government, 11 had no connection to technology transfers related to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, or chemical) that were banned under a 1996 agreement. 
   On July 15, 1998, Russian authorities announced that nine Russian entities were being investigated for suspected violation of laws governing export of dual-use technologies. The nine include the Inor NPO, Polyus Research Institute, and Baltic State Technical University cited earlier, plus the Grafit Research Institute, Tikhomirov Institute, the MOSO Company, the Komintern plant (Novosibirsk), Europalace 2000, and Glavcosmos. 
   Also last year, Russia announced the cancellation of a 1997 contract between a Russian entity, NPO Trud, and Iran in which rocket engine components were to have been shipped under the guise of gas pipeline compressors.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague from Iowa, to introduce the Tax Relief for Working Americans Act--what I consider to be a ``fair share'' tax plan. This bill, while protecting our Social Security and Medicare needs, will also allow all Americans to benefit from our economic prosperity. 
   The American people are responsible for the more than $4 trillion in budget surpluses over the next 15 years, so it makes sense to give them some needed and deserved tax relief. 
   The Tax Relief for Working Americans Act is a sensible and moderate bill that provides needed tax relief for working families. It does so, moreover, in a fiscally responsible manner which protects Social Security and Medicare. This tax plan is estimated to provide tax relief of $271 billion over ten years, fitting within the budget framework set out by the President to protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   The legislation will provide relief to 21 million working couples who incur the marriage penalty by increasing the standard deduction to put them on equal footing with unmarried couples. A married couple in the 28% bracket, for example, will save $392. 
   It includes tax incentives for the over 30 million Americans who purchase their own health insurance or who pay more than 50% of their employer provided health care insurance. This means a family that earns $60,000 and pays $4,000 a 
   year for health insurance will receive a tax credit of $2,400. 
   And it will raise the Social Security Earnings test to $30,000, so that the 1.1 million seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 who earn more than $15,500 would be able to keep more of their hard earned dollars. For a 67 year old secretary who earns $30,000 a year this would mean she will save nearly $5,000. 
   Under this legislation, millions of Americans who struggle to afford decent child care, will receive increased benefits from the Dependent Care Tax Credit. The credit will increase from 30% to 50% by 2004 and millions more will qualify for the maximum credit. When fully in effect, a family which earns $30,000 and spends $5,000 a year on child care for their two children will receive a $2,400 tax credit which should eliminate any federal tax liability. 
   This legislation will also help to expand our economy by making permanent the Research and Development tax credit. Research and development  is the backbone of our new technology driven economy. It is creating millions of high wage, high skilled jobs. The R&D credit has been extended 9 times since 1981, but it has been allowed to expire 4 times during that period. Now is the time to make it permanent. 
   There are also other important provisions in this legislation to promote long-term care, create more affordable housing, make education more affordable, and to help our farmers. 
   I believe that this tax plan is one which can, and will, receive broad bipartisan support. It is a tax plan which Congress can pass and the President can sign. I urge my colleagues to work with the Senator from Iowa and myself, and to pass the Tax Relief for Working Americans Act.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor with Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, PETE DOMENICI and CONNIE MACK a resolution commending the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Komen National Race for the Cure for their commitment to eradicating breast cancer. June 5 will be the Komen National Race for the Cure Day and this resolution urges the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe the day with appropriate activities. 
   Washington, D.C., will host the Race and there will be 98 races across the country will over 700,000 people participating. 
   There are 2.6 million women in this country living with breast cancer and more than 178,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Over 43,000 will die. 
   Diagnostic tools for breast cancer are very limited. Treatments for breast cancer are at best imperfect. We don't know how to prevent it. We don't know how to cure it. We need to redouble our effort to stop breast cancer now. 
   Congress is taking some steps. During the FY 2000 appropriations process, I hope we can increase researching funding for all cancers. We must pass legislation, such as S. 784 which I have sponsored, to require Medicare coverage of routine costs of clinical research trials and S. 6, to require private insurance coverage of the routine costs of clinical research trials. We should enact legislation assuring access to specialists and coverage of second opinions. We should pass Medicaid coverage for women who are screened by CDC's breast and cervical cancer program but have no way to pay for treatment when they learn they have cancer. 
   I call on my colleagues to join us in supporting the 10th anniversary Race by supporting this resolution and sending it to the President. As new understandings of cancer emerge almost weekly, we must do all we can to support increased research and access to services to end this scourge.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN authorizing a new round of base closures. As the senior Senator from the state that has suffered the greatest impact from the previous rounds, I believe that the base closure process is deeply flawed and fundamentally unfair. 
   The first four rounds of base closure occurred too rapidly and too little effort was made to protect local communities from devastating lob loss and economic hardship. For those who say that adverse local impact is a necessary consequence of reducing military infrastructure, I would like to describe how this process has effected California where since the first BRAC round in 1988, 29 bases in California have been scheduled for closure or realignment. 
   Some claim that the process has been streamlined and every effort has been made to expedite the transfer of bases to the local community. I have also heard claims that base closure can be a boon to the community by bringing new opportunities for job creation and economic development. 
   Now let's look at the facts. The California Trade and Commerce Agency estimates that the four rounds of BRAC cost 97,337 military and civilian jobs. How many have been created? Less than 17,000. That is a net job loss of more than 80,000 jobs. 
   The reason we are not seeing job creation or economic growth is because the land is simply not being transferred to the local communities as was originally planned. The process is so slow and bureaucratic that years go by before any development can be done on the closed bases. 
   Again, the numbers prove this. The 29 closed bases represents 77,269 acres of land. The Federal Government has retained almost 25,000 for itself and 30,000 acres have yet to be transferred. That means that local communities have had access to less than 30 percent of the property that should have been made available to them. It is difficult to create jobs or stimulate economic growth without the land to do it. 
   That is the big picture of how the State of California has been impacted by the base closure process. Here is the impact at the local level. 
   Every member of this body who has had a major base close in his or her state can tell a base closure horror story, but I believe the magnitude of the loss that the city of Long Beach has faced makes it unique. In fact, if Long Beach were a state, it would rank in the top five in terms of the number of jobs lost due to base closure. 
   The Long Beach Naval Station was closed as part of BRAC 1991. This resulted in the loss of more than 8,500 military and civilian jobs. The direct loss of wage and contract was $400 million with an estimated economic loss of another $1 billion annually. 
   As the city struggled to deal with this devastating blow, the federal government dealt it another. In 1995, the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was scheduled for closure. The job loss from this action has been more than 4,000 and it has caused another $1 billion in total economic loss. 
   The city's woes continued during negotiations with the Navy on the terms of the conveyance of the Naval Hospital. In 1964, the city had sold the property to the Navy for $10. Long Beach had a growing naval community and the Navy had, in large part, been a good neighbor. In recent years, that has proven not to be the case. The Navy demanded $8.5 million for the property. The same piece of property that the city gave to them for $10. In an effort to get the conveyance process moving, the city reluctantly agreed to the price. 
   Now, at a time when the Clinton administration is proposing that all current and future economic development conveyances be done at no cost, the Department of Defense has thus far refused to renegotiate the deal. It appears that the Pentagon, with a budget in excess of $250 billion, has a greater need for the $8.5 million than Long Beach with a budget of just $330 million. 
   This is only one example of the multitude of problems with base closure. It is an inefficient, bureaucratic, and ineffective process. I believe this is the wrong time to authorize a new round of closure. All we would be doing is following one flawed procedure with another. 
   As California's example shows, local communities have not been given the opportunity to recover from the four previous rounds. Delays caused by lack of funding and red tape have prevented the completion of land transfers and the beginning of reuse. 
   I believe it is essential that we allow enough time for the base closures of the 1990's to run their course before we deal them the challenges of the 21st century closures. If nothing else, we owe that to our local governments. I urge the defeat of this amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation sponsored by Senator SCHUMER to phase out the antiquated sugar subsidy. The sugar program is nothing than a system of import restrictions, subsidized loans, and price supports that benefit a limited number of sugar growers. 
   I find it incredible that the federal government continues to support a subsidy program that is driving the domestic refinery industry out of existence and costing thousands of good jobs. The US Department of Agriculture restricts the amount of sugar available to domestic refineries. Without sugar, a sugar refinery cannot operate and that is the result of this misguided program. 
   It is clear that the U.S. sugar policy has served to strangle this country's sugar refining industry. By limiting the amount of raw cane sugar available for production, there has been a 40 percent decline in jobs in the sugar-cane refining industry. Since 1982, nine out of twenty one cane sugar refineries in the U.S. have been forced out of business. Those that have remained open are struggling to survive under onerous import restrictions. 
   I first became involved with this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, the President and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, informed me that his refinery was forced to temporarily cease operations because it had no sugar. 
   This 93 year old refinery is the Nation's largest refinery and the only such facility on the West Coast. C&H refines about 15 percent of the total cane sugar consumed in the U.S. 
   C&H is capable of producing and selling 700,000 tons of refined sugar annually. Therefore, the company requires in excess of 700,000 tons of raw cane sugar to meet its sales demand. 
   Hawaii is C&H's sole source for its domestic raw cane sugar needs, but Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for over 10 years. This has meant that C&H is forced to cover over half its annual consumption through imports from other countries. 
   The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C&H to pay an inflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. Even more devastating, however, the quota system limits the amount of sugar available to the refinery. Simply put, C&H has been unable to get enough sugar to refine and it has been forced to close it doors on several occasions.  
   The reduced production capacity has resulted in a severe downsizing of the workforce. As recently as 1987, C&H employed over 1,400 people. These are not minimum wage jobs we are talking about: the average employee in the cane refining industry earns nearly $43,000 a year. In 1995, C&H had to eliminate 30 percent of its workforce just to remain viable under the quota system mandated by the sugar program. 
   C&H now employees just over 500 people. These jobs and many others around the nation are at risk if reforms are not made to the sugar program. 
   The overly restrictive manner that the USDA administers the sugar program has a number of other flaws. The sugar program's existing quota system was put in place in 1982, using trading patterns dating as far back as 1975. The system has remained largely unchanged over the past 17 years despite major alterations in the international sugar market. As a result, the current import quota system assigns export rights to countries that don't grow enough sugar to export or, in some cases, are net importers themselves. 
   For example, the Philippines are granted one of the largest export privileges under the sugar import quota system. It, however, does not even grow enough sugar to meet it own domestics needs. What this means is that the Philippines sell their homegrown sugar crop to the United States at about 22 cents a pound. It then buys raw sugar on the world market at around 5 cents a pound. This is ridiculous. We are in effect giving money to foreign countries and forcing domestic consumers to pay the price. 
   Beginning in September of 1994, I have asked the Administration on eight separate occasions to reform the sugar program. Simply increasing the amount of sugar available through the import program would provide immediate relief to C&H and the other domestic refineries. To date, no such permanent reform of the program has been made. 
   In addition to choking off the refineries' access to sugar, the US sugar policy also has an adverse impact on US consumers. The General Accounting Office has found that the program costs sugar users an average of $1.4 billion annually. That equates to $3.8 million a day in hidden sugar taxes. 
   The report found that ``Although the sugar program is considered a no-net-cost program because the government does not make payments directly to producers, it places the cost of the price supports on sweetener users--consumers and manufacturers of sweetener-containing products--who pay higher sugar and sweetener prices.'' 
   What this means is that unlike traditional subsidy programs, the funds do not come directly from the Treasury. Instead, the sugar program places the cost consumers by restricting the supply of available sugar which causes higher domestic market prices. 
   The legislation we are introducing will eliminate the sugar subsidy program by 2002. This is a simple, straight-forward, and fair way to end a program that has not worked for U.S. consumers or workers. 
   Congress has had opportunities in the past to kill this program and we have not taken them. As a result, workers have lost jobs and consumers have lost money. I am pleased to join my colleagues in saying that enough is enough. It is time to end the sugar subsidy program once and for all.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments today about a bill that many Senators, some 70 of us, believe will improve the lives of millions of disabled Americans. The Work Incentives Improvement Act would allow disabled adults to enter the workforce without placing their Medicaid or Medicare benefits at risk. I particularly thank Senators KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, MOYNIHAN, and ROTH for their outstanding leadership in crafting this legislation. I am very proud to be a cosponsor. 
   Today, more than 8 million working-age adults receive disability payments from the Federal Government for conditions that range from paralysis to multiple sclerosis. A recent Harris poll showed that 72 percent of these disabled people would really like to work, but disabled Americans face a terrible Catch-22. The Federal Medicaid program won't cover people who continue to work and remain disabled. So if a disabled adult earns more than $500 a month, he or she loses their Medicaid. 
   That is the rub. 
   The eligibility criteria for Medicaid benefits have had a devastating effect on disabled Americans. The Medicaid program equates having a disability with being poor and unable to work, furthering inaccurate stereotypes about disability. To make things worse, the Medicaid program ensures that disabled people who do work end up having to shoulder the cost of their care by themselves. 
   For all but the best-off disabled Americans, these costs are prohibitive. People with serious medical conditions can't pay the out-of-pocket costs of their medical treatment. These costs can run into the tens of thousands of dollars each year. In other words, if a disabled American does have a job, the minute that disabled American earns more than $500 a month, they fall off a cliff and they lose their Medicaid or  their Medicare. So millions of disabled Americans remain dependent on cash assistance from the Federal Government simply because they can't work and keep Medicaid at the same time. 
   Last year, I wrote to President Clinton urging a remedy to the situation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Work Incentives Improvement Act. This bill allows Americans with disabilities to enter the workforce without losing their health coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. Even if disabled people are working in full-time jobs with health benefits, they will be able to buy their Medicaid coverage for medical expenses that their regular insurance does not cover. 
   In addition, the Work Incentives Improvement Act sets up a new system called Ticket to Work, to provide better job training and placement services for the disabled. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will enable disabled Americans to pursue self-sufficiency, to achieve independence, and to contribute in meaningful ways to our economy. It is certainly an idea whose time has come. That is why over 70 Senators have signed on as cosponsors. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has not had the chance to vote on this important legislation. The reason I am on the floor today, as well as others who I hope will be coming to the floor, is to urge Senate Majority Leader TRENT LOTT to bring the Work Incentives Improvement Act to the Senate floor for a vote soon. No one should have to choose between a job and their health. By preserving Federal health benefits for disabled workers, we can avoid the Catch-22 and, most importantly, we can help the disabled to live full and healthy lives. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the amendment offered by my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Louisiana expressing the sense of Congress regarding the need for vigorous prosecution of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   This amendment expresses the Sense of Congress that: 
   The United States should provide sufficient resources for an expeditious investigation of the allegations of war crimes committed in Kosovo; 
   The United States should provide all possible cooperation to the Tribunal in the gathering of evidence; 
   Where evidence warrants, indictments should be issued for war crimes and that the United States and all nations have an obligation to honor arrest warrants; and, 
   NATO should not accept a settlement in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals. 
   During the past two months, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and bloodshed unseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the culmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the Balkans engineered by Mr. Milosevic. 
   Over 1.2 million Kosovar Albanians are now displaced, having been forced to flee their homes. Over 700,000 Kosovars are now refugees, most in Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro. Others have been forced to hide in the forests and mountains. 
   The United States now has hard evidence that war crimes have been committed. A report issued by the State Department earlier this month entitled ``Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo'' argued that: ``At this writing, the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic continue to burn, loot, rape, shell, and de-populate Kosovo, and thousands of refugees continue to flee into neighboring Albania and Macedonia. The refugees coming out of Kosovo are only now beginning to tell their stories. Yet even these fragmented accounts portray a systematic policy of ethnic cleansing.'' 
   This report alleges that: 
   Serbian forces have made Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, a ghost town. Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces expelled between 100,000 to 120,000 persons from Pristina in only four days. Kosovars in Macedonia indicate that only 100 ethnic Albanians remain in Pristina. Serbian forces are stealing and ``confiscating'' furniture from abandoned homes. 
   In Pec, Serbian forces herded young Albanian women to the Hotel Karagac [Kara-jack], and raped them repeatedly. The commander of the local base used a roster of soldiers' names to allow his troops to visit the hotel on a rotating basis. 
   Violence in western Kosovo is stronger than in any other region of the province. Pec was emptied of ethnic Albanians in 24 hours. In Djakovica's [Jack-o-vika] old city, Serbian forces burned 200 to 600 homes the day after NATO airstrikes began. By the next day, the rest of the old city had been torched.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member. I appreciate his comments about my State. I also compliment both the ranking member and the chairman of the committee for their drive, for their motivation, and for their staying power to get this conference report done. 
   Mr. President, the room was crowded. The hours were long. The views were sometimes cantankerous. But both the chairman and the ranking member, I think, were steadfast in the desire to produce a conference report which could, in fact, be approved by both bodies. 
   I also pay tribute to the chairman from the House, Mr. YOUNG.  I had never seen him preside before. What I observed, which I think is well worth noting, was his fairness, his equanimity, and really his ability to move the process along which, without rankling, can be a very diverse membership. I say the same for Mr. OBEY, who really was steadfast in pursuing his own views. 
   I support this report. It contains the $12 billion for Kosovo. I am especially pleased to note that the supplemental contains funding for the documentation of war crimes, including rapes that appear to have been committed as part of Serbia's brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing. 
   As the ranking member and the chairman have pointed out, it contains the much-needed disaster assistance and the $574 million in agricultural funding to provide a measure of assistance to very hard-pressed farmers throughout this great country. 
   I do want to speak about one small item. As we debate the conference report on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, I want to express my concerns about the inclusion of a ``hold harmless'' provision for what are called concentration grants authorized by Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   In chapter 5, on page 91 of the conference report (Report 106-143), the conferees included $56.4 million for Title I concentration grants ``to direct the Department of Education to hold harmless all school districts that received Title I concentration grants in fiscal year 1998.*.*.*'' The report goes on to say, ``Neither the House nor the Senate bills contained these provisions.'' 
   This provision is very disturbing for several reasons. 
   First, it was not included in either the House or Senate bills. Therefore, it has not been considered by the authorizing committees of either house. It has not been considered by the appropriations committees of either house. There have been no hearings. It has not gone through the normal deliberative process under which we hear from experts, weigh the pros and cons and cast votes. Quite frankly, this provision appeared ``in the dark of night.'' 
   Second, the hold harmless provision contravenes an important provision of the law, known as the census update, a requirement in law that the U.S. Department of Education must allocate Title I funds based on the newest child poverty figures, figures that are updated every two years. Congress adopted the census update requirement in 1994 so that Title I funds--which the law says are to help disadvantaged children--truly follow the child, that dollars be determined generally by the number of children who are eligible. The holdharmless provision in this bill before us, guaranteeing that school districts that got funds in 1998 will get funds in 1999, even if their number of poor children has declined, violates the requirement that funds be allocated based on the most recent child poverty data available. The provision in this bill effectively rewards ``incumbents,'' despite their number of poor children, despite merit or need. 
   Third, this provision disregards Title I's eligibility requirements. Title I concentration grants are supposed to be especially targeted to concentrations of poor children, under the law. Districts that have poor children exceeding 6,500 or 15% of their total school-aged children are eligible for these grants, which are in addition to the ``regular,'' basic Title I grants. Guaranteeing funds to districts, no matter what the number or percent of poor children in those districts, spreads limited funds to districts that are not eligible because they do not have concentrations of poverty. It effectively takes away funds from districts that do have high concentrations of poor children. It overrides the eligibility requirements we have set and agreed on in law. 
   In my state, some school districts could benefit from this ``hold harmless'' provision because the number of poor children changed; it went below the eligibility threshold of the Title I concentration grants program. Like most Senators, I do not want any school district in my state to lose education funds. 
   But we either have rules or we don't. We have eligibility criteria or we don't.  If the current eligibility rules are wrong or are not working, we should change them in the authorizing process, a review which the Health and Education Committee is currently undertaking. We should not set up eligibility rules and then flagrantly ignore them, override them or ``freeze'' in place funds to districts that do not meet the requirements. We should not rewrite the rules in the ``dark of night'' outside the normal legislative process. 
   Fourth, this provision violates the principle that funds should follow the child. Title I was created for poor, disadvantaged children. That is its fundamental purpose and funding to states is determined largely by the number of poor children, children that all agree have great educational needs. This amendment sends funds to districts merely because they got funds in the previous year, not because the districts have needy children and not in proportion to the number of poor children they have. 
   Finally, this provision is very unfair to states like mine that have a very high growth rate in the number of poor children. In California, the number of poor children grew by 52 percent from 1990 to 1995. In Arizona, poor children grew 38 percent from 1990 to 1995. In Georgia, 35 percent. In Nevada, 56 percent. That is why Congress included a requirement for a child poverty update. This amendment is very unfair to those children. This amendment takes the funds away from the poor children for which the funds were intended.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   Even though it ``freezes in'' funding to districts--including some in my state--that got funds last year, even though they do not qualify, it makes a mockery of the basic purpose of the Title I program, its eligibility rules and the requirement to use recent poverty data. If Congress continues to override these basic rules of the authorizing law, we are effectively operating with no rules, or at least, constantly changing rules. Districts will not know whether they are eligible or what they can or cannot count on. This is just plain wrong. In my state, even though 39 districts would have their funding ``frozen in'' by this provision, next year, California will have 166 new school districts that will become eligible. If these ``hold harmlesses'' keep appearing in the dark of night, these eligible districts, with concentrations of poor children, could be deprived of funds to which they are entitled. 
   Because this is a conference report, under our procedures, I am not allowed to offer an amendment to delete this provision. 
   But let me put my colleagues on notice that I find this provision and this procedure very objectionable. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in ending this practice so that our children can get the education Congress intended in creating the Title I program in the first place. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank the ranking member. 
   Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished managers of this bill, Senators LEAHY and HATCH, for including the Feinstein-Chafee amendment regarding separation of juveniles from adults in custody in the managers' ``technical amendment.'' I also wish to thank Senators AKAKA, FEINGOLD, KOHL, and JEFFORDS, who agreed to co-sponsor our amendment, for their support. 
   This amendment resolves a major concern that many, many people had with this bill, and will help speed the way to its final passage. 
   Our amendment is designed to strengthen the bill's requirements for separating juveniles in custody from adult criminals. We should not be counter-productive by allowing juvenile detention to be a school for crime, nor should we be cruel in permitting the victimization of youths by hardened adult criminals. 
   Under current law, juveniles cannot have any contact with adult inmates. None whatsoever. When a juvenile is in an adult facility, that juvenile cannot be within ``sight or sound'' of any adult--ever!  
   Why is that one of the four so-called ``core'' requirements? 
   Because I remind my colleagues that we are talking about children. 
   Children who may or may not have committed a violent offense. 
   Children who may have been arrested for the first time. 
   Children who perhaps are on the wrong path but most likely never commit another offense ever: statistically, over two-thirds of juveniles arrested never commit another crime. 
   In the early 1970s, before there were protections for children who came into contact with our court system, a number of studies found that children in adult jails were subject to rape, assault, sodomy, murder, and other acts which sometimes, frankly too often, led to suicide. 
   The Judiciary Committee at the time learned of numerous tragedies and outright atrocities, including a report on practices in Philadelphia which estimated that 2,000 sexual assaults occurred inside adult jails or ``sheriff's vans'' used to transport juvenile and adults to court over a 26-month period. One juvenile was raped five times while inside such a van. 
   The numbers tell the story. Children in adult jails are 8 times more likely to commit suicide; 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted; 
   twice as likely to be assaulted by staff; and 50 percent more likely to be attacked with a weapon than are children in juvenile facilities, according to studies by the Justice Department and others. 
   In my state of California, we passed our laws to keep juveniles out of adult jails in the mid-1980s in the wake of tragedies such as the case of Kathy Robbins, a 15-year-old girl who hung herself when she was placed in an adult jail in Glenn County for violating a juvenile curfew. 
   After those reports were released, Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act and subsequent renewals of the law to ensure that children would be treated fairly by the juvenile justice system and be kept safely away from adults in jail. 
   Kentucky chose to forgo Federal money and continue placing juveniles in adult jails. This chart shows the result: four suicides, one attempted suicide, two physical assaults by other inmates, two sexual assaults by other inmates, and one rape by a deputy county jailer. 
   Let me give you some of the names behind the numbers: 
   In Oldham County, 15-year-old Robert Lee Horn, Jr. was put in jail for truancy and beyond parental control. He was paraded through the jail in front of adult inmates who called out to him for sex. He hung himself. 
   In McCracken County, a 16-year-old Todd Selke was put in adult jail for being a runaway and disorderly conduct. He committed suicide. 
   In Franklin County, a 16-year-old runaway was raped by a deputy county jailer. 
   The core protections help to prevent these tragedies elsewhere around the country. 
   Yet, this bill as introduced would have weakened the core protections for children. I was puzzled by why the authors felt the need to weaken the current standard. According to the latest figures from the Justice Department, 48 of the 50 states are in compliance with the current standard for separating children from adults, including such large, rural states as Alaska and Montana. 
   And yet this bill would have allowed for juveniles to be in close proximity to adult inmates. While it generally prohibits physical contact between juveniles and adults in custody, there is an exclusion. And the exclusion to the definition of prohibited physical contact said that the term ``does not include supervised proximity between a juvenile and an adult inmate that is brief and incidental or accidental.'' 
   In other words, it permitted regular contact, planned contact, between delinquent juveniles and adult criminals, as long as it is deemed to be ``brief and incidental.'' 
   Senator CHAFEE and I were concerned that this standard would have allowed juveniles to be paraded in front of adult inmates as they are being transported from one area of a facility to another. That means that every day the same youth could be required to walk by the adult cell block. 
   Adult inmates would have a chance to tease, taunt, harass, use suggestive body language, expose areas of their private parts, spit, and otherwise scare juveniles as they are being transported through the facility. 
   Now some might think that's OK. That to scare a child by exposing them to adults may reduce the likelihood of the child committing another crime. 
   But, actually, these young children who might be tough on the outside, but not so tough on the inside, could be scared to death--meaning scared enough to commit suicide--just as Robbie Horn was in Oldham County, Kentucky. 
   Older gang members, or veteranos, could pass messages on to younger gang members to coordinate criminal activities, or to intimidate them from turning state's evidence. 
   The amendment which we have agreed upon remedied this. In fact, it is even better than what Senator CHAFEE and I originally proposed. It makes two changes, which bring the bill into line with the current Justice Department regulations: 
   1. It eliminates any planned or regular contact between juvenile delinquents and adult criminals by changing the exception to ``brief and inadvertent, or accidental,'' contact. The minority report to last Congress' juvenile crime bill, S. 10, erroneously stated that the Justice Department's regulations, like the bill, excepted ``brief and incidental'' contact. However, there is a world of difference between ``incidental'' and ``inadvertent.'' Changing this exception to the Justice Department standard has the same effect as the amendment which Senator CHAFEE and I originally proposed, and will provide much greater protection for juveniles in custody. 
   2. The amendment passed in the manager's package then goes even further, limiting even this exception to nonresidential areas only. In other words, there is no exception at all in residential areas to the prohibition on physical contact between juveniles and adults. Specifically, the amendment provides that the inadvertent/accidental exception applies only ``in secure areas of a facility that are not dedicated to use by juvenile offenders and that are nonresidential, which may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways.'' This language is taken almost verbatim from the Justice Department regulations. 
   This amendment ensures that a juvenile cannot be in close proximity such as supervised ``brief and incidental'' parades by adult cells or other planned or spontaneous actions by adults to transport children from one area of a jail to another. 
   Our amendment was endorsed by: The Department of Justice; the Children's Defense Fund; the National Network for Youth; and the National Collaboration for Youth, an alliance of 28 youth service groups, including Boy Scouts, 4-H, Girl Scouts, American Red Cross, National Urban League, United Way and YMCA. 
   A coalition of 22 other organizations wrote to the Majority Leader, asking that the standard for separating delinquent juveniles and adult criminals be strengthened, including: Minorities in Law Enforcement, National Association for School Psychologists, National Council of Churches of Christ-Washington Office, the Alliance for Children and Families, Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy, and Covenant House. 
   With the passage of this amendment, we have provided this protection, and substantially improved this bill. Coupled with the passage of other amendments that I offered, including banning imports of large-capacity ammunition magazines, the Federal Gang Violence Act, the James Guelff Body Armor Act, and anti-bombmaking legislation, this bill now represents a great step forward in the effort to reduce juvenile and violent crime. I ask that I be added as a co-sponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to pay special tribute to an outstanding citizen and participant of the distinguished White House Fellowship Program--Jeffrey Glueck from Newport Beach, CA. 
   Mr. Glueck, a management consultant with Monitor Co. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard University with honors, receiving his BA in social studies. He went on to earn an MA in international relations from Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship, where he and a partner won the annual Oxford Debating Championship. Mr. Glueck has advised the Peruvian and Bolivian governments on economic competitiveness and from 1995-98, directed a national competitiveness project for the Venezuelan government and private sector. He was also a pro bono advisor to the Center of Middle East Competitive Strategy, an economic development and regional cooperation project for the signatory governments of the Middle East peace process. Mr. Glueck has maintained his long-standing commitment to public service with his involvement in many community-based organizations. He tutored at a housing project as a student in Boston, was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Political Review, was a founding participant of the Harvard Communications Project--an inter-ethnic discussion group--and started a recycling program at the Oxford University dorms. 
   Since 1965, the White House Fellowship Program has offered outstanding citizens across the United States the opportunity to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Fellows work closely with influential leaders in government and see U.S. policy in action. The nearly 500 alumni of the program have gone on to become leaders in all fields of endeavor, fulfilling the Fellowship's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. This program is extremely competitive, choosing individuals that have demonstrated excellence in community service, leadership, and professional and academic achievement. It is the nation's most prestigious fellowship for public service and leadership development. 
   Mr. Glueck had been assigned to the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. during his White House Fellowship. In this capacity, he works on ways to reconcile free trade with environmental protection around the world. He has helped coordinate a campaign for environmental standards of all OECD governments that would withhold public financing for projects in developing countries that damage the environment. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Glueck works to counter unfair trade practices by foreign governments in emerging governments and to promote sales by U.S. companies with environmentally-beneficial products to places in Asia and Latin America that can benefit from American know-how. 
   Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Jeffrey Glueck for his accomplishments, and especially for being a distinguished recipient of the White House Fellowship. It is an honor to represent Mr. Glueck in the U.S. Senate.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion of public service: Clara Shin of Orange, CA. Ms. Shin is a former AmeriCorps program officer and is currently a distinguished White House Fellow. 
   One of the greatest gifts that Clara Shin has been endowed with is an appreciation and a passion for public service. Her background is filled with notable accomplishments that have provided her with a sense of community and an unfailing commitment to helping others. 
   Ms. Shin received her bachelor's degrees in physiobiopolitics and government from Smith College and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. As a law student, she worked at the U.S. Agency for International Development, serving as a legal intern to the Regional Legal Advisor for Southern Africa. She later joined AmeriCorps as its youngest program officer and was responsible for developing the first national grant applications for local programs seeking funding. She then managed a $25 million grant portfolio for the program and coordinated a service network spanning the Southwest. Ms. Shin also co-designed the $100 million community service component of a Housing and Urban Development initiative to revitalize severely distressed public housing developments. She founded KOSOMOSE Women's Journal, a magazine for Asian American women, and helped start the Tahoe-Baikal Institute, a bi-national environmental institute in California and Siberia that trains environmentalists in land and water issues. 
   As one of 17 White House Fellows, Ms. Shin has achieved the nation's most prestigious fellowship for leadership development and public service. Her assignment to the White House Office of the Chief of Staff allows her to work hand-in-hand with leaders in government on immigration, race, and science and technology issues, where she coordinates working group meetings, tracks and manages issues, and meets with advocacy groups. For more than thirty years, White House Fellows have carried out the program's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. Ms. Shin is an individual who exemplifies this notion. Her efforts to serve those around her are an inspiration to us all. 
   Mr. President, it is with great honor that I pay tribute to Clara Shin for her accomplishment and dedication to public service. Her enthusiasm for social and environmental causes is both uplifting and encouraging. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Clara Shin many more years of success.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to salute the work and dedication of Major John Tien, a distinguished White House Fellow from Long Beach, CA. 
   Major Tien was chosen as one of the selected few to participate in the distinguished 1998-99 White House Fellowship Program. Since 1965, the program has offered outstanding individuals, like Major Tien, the opportunity to apply their considerable talents to public service. Past U.S. Army White House Fellow alumni, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin L. Powell, have emerged as great military leaders, and I have no doubt that Major Tien will be successful in his future endeavors. 
   As a White House Fellow, Major Tien has been assigned to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. He conducts research on consumer, labor, and environmental groups in an effort to educate the American public about the benefits of international trade. Other responsibilities include coordinating partnerships with important business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Round Table, and the President's Export Council, to develop trade education ideas and advance a free trade agenda. He is a member of the lead team for planning the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Washington. He is also a member of the steel import crisis response team, where he is responsible for drafting reports for the Congressional Steel Caucus. Major Tien is the special assistant to the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative on all WTO matters. 
   Major Tien was an assistant professor in the Department of Social Sciences at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He received his bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from West Point, where he was the top-ranked military cadet in his class. He later attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. As a veteran of Operation Desert Storm, he was among the first soldiers to cross the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. He has commanded an M1A1 main battle tank company and a headquarters company, and has served as the chief logistics officer for a thousand-soldier brigade. Additionally, Major Tien has successfully balanced several extracurricular activities with his military commitments. For example, he has served as a volunteer tutor for inner-city elementary and high school youth, as a co-organizer of the New York, Orange County Special Olympics and as a youth league soccer and baseball coach. 
   Mr. President, the importance of the public service should be recognized, and Major Tien stands as an especially admirable role model in this regard. For his efforts, and in recognition of the well-deserved honor of serving as a White House Fellow, I am privileged to commend and pay tribute to Major John Tien.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Andrew Ramirez who has served his country with bravery and valor. For Sergeant Ramirez, a resident of East Los Angeles, public service runs in the family--his brother is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. 
   On March 31, 1999, Sergeant Ramirez was taken as a prison of war by the Yugoslavia Army while he was serving as part of a U.S. Army detachment assigned to a U.N. monitoring force patrolling Yugoslavia's southern border. Sergeant Ramirez was part of the 4th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division based in Wurzburg, Germany. He had arrived in Macedonia in early March to relieve another contingent. 
   I cannot begin to imagine the terror experienced by Sergeant Ramirez and his fellow soldiers, Christopher J. Stone and Steven M. Gonzales, when they were surrounded, and under heavy fire, taken as prisoners of war. 
   Just a few days later, the soldiers were shown on Serbian television, battered and bruised. It is a picture that every mother hopes she will never see. It is a picture that every American hoped was not true. But, it was true, and these three men paid a dear price of over a month in captivity. They did not know what fate would befall them and if they were ever going to see their families again. 
   During the past weeks, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and bloodshed unseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the culmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the Balkans--and it has created a refugee crisis unparalleled in recent years. 
   Sergeant Ramirez was in Yugoslavia because his country asked him to go. He was there to protect our promise that the civilized world will never again do nothing in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and rampant violence to thousands of innocent people. If the most powerful alliance in the world fails to stop ethnic cleansing, it will send a green light to every tyrant and dictator with similar intentions that they can do the same, and that the world community will be unable or unwilling to muster the resolve to stop it. 
   None of these words would mean anything without individuals like Sergeant Anthony Ramirez. He is the truest of patriots--the bravest of the brave. Our country is forever indebted to him, and there are not words nor deeds that could every repay his dedicated service--or that of his family. He is a testament to the human spirit that keeps the light of peace and human freedoms alive. 
   Sergeant Ramirez, we thank you, we honor you, and we are so very, very glad that you are home.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have risen today to talk about the remarkable service given this body, and our nation, by Admiral James W. Nance, majority staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Although I am no longer on the Committee, I had the honor and pleasure of serving as a member of that Committee in the 105th Congress, and to come to know and admire ``The Admiral.'' 
   In many ways, Admiral Nance was the living embodiment of what Tom Brokaw, in his recent book, has called ``The Greatest Generation.'' He had a distinguished career in the Navy, serving in combat in World War II, as a test pilot, and later as commander of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal. 
   Following his Naval career, he served as deputy assistant to the President for National Security Affairs in the Reagan administration, and then joined his boyhood friend, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, in offering his service, and his expertise, to the U.S. Senate as staff director for the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   His kindness to me--as a junior member of the minority party--in getting to know the ins and outs of the Committee was always appreciated, and his sage council and advice were always a welcome addition to the Committee's consideration of a range of pressing national security issues. 
   The Admiral will be sorely missed--but I join my colleagues in celebrating his life of service to the United States.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I want him to know it has been a great pleasure for me to be able to work with him on these three issues, and now on the gang bill, for the past 3 years. 
   Mr. President, I think the chairman has very accurately and adequately stated what these amendments do. I would like to just provide a little bit of filler material with respect to the need. There are over 23,000 youth gangs in all 50 States in the United States. I think it will come as no surprise for people to learn that California is the No. 1 gang State, with almost 5,000 different gangs, more than three times as  many as the next State. Overall, there are over 600,000 members of gangs. And they have increased tenfold since 1975. 
   This legislation is a direct result of the importuning of many in local law enforcement who have come to me and others in this body and said: Could the Federal Government give us a hand in fighting gangs? 
   In Los Angeles alone, over the past 16 years, 7,300 people were murdered from gang warfare--more people than have been killed in all the terrorist fighting in Northern Ireland. 
   Today, modern gangs are organized. Take, for one, the Bloods and Crips, which began in Los Angeles. They now have a presence in 119 American cities, as you can see on this chart. Take, for instance, Chicago's Gangster Disciples, which have expanded into 34 Midwest and Southern cities, with a board of directors inside prison and a board of directors outside prison. 
   These gangs operate very often as modern Mafia-type enterprises. They move across State lines. They move drugs. They practice a whole series of crimes. And they do so in a very organized way. 
   In Los Angeles alone, the 18th Street Gang now deals directly with Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. They have expanded their operations to Oregon, Utah, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico. And it goes on and on and on; virtually every ethnic and racial group has some gang that is operating in the United States. 
   The chairman has accurately stated what this amendment would do. It increases sentences for gang members who commit Federal crimes. It enhances the ability of Federal prosecutors to prosecute gangs. It amends the Travel Act to include some offenses which gangs perpetrate. It adds serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal Act. And it provides a 3-year mandatory minimum sentence to knowingly transferring a firearm for use in a violent crime or drug trafficking crime where the gun is transferred to a minor. 
   Let me move now to the second part of it. This has to do with bomb making on the Internet. In the Judiciary Committee not too long ago, I remember somebody presenting a manual called ``The Terrorist Handbook'' that could be pulled up on the Internet. I went back and we downloaded it from the Internet. 
   What I saw really chilled me, because what I saw was accurate information on how to steal chemicals, how to break into chemistry labs, what to buy in stores, and how to go home and make pipe bombs, telephone bombs, letter bombs, and mailbox 
   bombs. Virtually every use in the manual is illegal. And you have to ask, Why? 
   The youngsters in Colorado who perpetrated the crime indicated they got the formula for the pipe bombs directly from the Internet. It well could have been from this very volume I hold up today. 
   Since Littleton, CO, there has been a rash of these. Police arrested five students in Brooklyn for possessing this manual that they found on the Internet.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will ask to print in the RECORD a list of counties and cities where we have had incidents directly following Littleton: Salt Lake; Cobb County in Georgia; Port Aransas, TX; Wichita Falls; Wimberley, TX. More than 50 threats of bombs and other acts of violence have occurred in the last few weeks since Littleton, CO. 
   This amendment essentially says it will become a Federal crime to teach or distribute information on how to make a bomb or other weapon of mass destruction if the individual intends the information be used to commit a Federal violent crime or knows that the recipient of the information intends to use it to commit a Federal violent crime. 
   The Justice Department has reviewed the legislation. We believe that it is constitutional. The Fourth Circuit has heard a case and has effectively declared the methodology herein as constitutional. 
   The final part of this bill is the James Guelff Body Armor Act. It speeds body armor of 10,000 surplus pieces from the FBI and the DEA to local and State governments. It makes body armor more difficult to obtain by felons. And we are very hopeful this will be included. 
   So we have the gang amendments, we have the lawmaking amendment, and the body armor. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the ranking member for his comments. My views parallel his. I think the Byrd method is very well intentioned. I happened to be on the floor when the Senator presented it. However, I must say I believe it is overly broad. It would essentially permit States to deputize the Federal courts which exist to enforce Federal laws, not State laws. I believe it would have the unintended consequence of dramatically expanding the power of any one State in a matter which would diminish consumer choice and really harm legitimate businesses. 
   This is more or less an intra-industry fight. California is home to 90 percent of the domestic wine industry. The vast majority of these wineries are small family farms. The wine industry is certainly vital. Many of these small wineries essentially have wine tastings. Individuals come in, taste the wine. They do not have shelf space. The wine is expensive, and they will use the Internet to be able to ship this wine. 
   The problem which has been presented for remedy is children obtaining this kind of alcoholic beverage through the Internet. I happen to doubt that children would buy $90 bottles of wine, but, nonetheless, the second amendment I will present in essence tackles the question at hand by saying that any of these shipments must be clearly labeled, and they must be received by someone who has the qualification to receive them, identification showing that that individual is entitled to receive them and is in fact an adult. 
   Therefore, I do not believe this throwing of State alcohol law into the Federal courts is necessary to solve the problem at hand. 
   I urge a no vote on the Byrd amendment and an aye vote on the Feinstein amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the modification I have sent to the desk changes the penalty, and I will explain that in a moment. 
   The amendment, as I have just described it, would require persons who ship alcoholic beverages across State lines to: First, clearly and prominently label the contents as alcoholic beverages; second, state the full name of the person causing the package to be shipped; i.e., the seller; and third, state that an adult's signature is required. It would require the shippers--for example, Federal Express--to not deliver a package so labeled unless they can: One, verify that the person receiving the delivery is of legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages; and, two, obtain that person's signature. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I sent to the desk to modify would simply provide that existing penalties would apply to this bill. Those are criminal penalties of up to 1 year imprisonment and fines of up to $200,000 for organizations or $100,000 for individuals. A seller who violates this requirement on three or more occasions may have their ATF basic permit revoked. That is the effect of the law today, and we would repeat that penalty in this particular instance. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, I say to the Senator. And thank you, Mr. President. 
   This amendment essentially has four parts. One relates to gangs that move across interstate lines practicing criminal enterprise, the second is body armor, the third is bombmaking, and the fourth is animal terrorism. 
   Essentially, with respect to gangs, this bill will increase sentences for gang members who commit Federal crimes. It will enhance the ability of Federal prosecutors to prosecute gangs for this crime. And it will add serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal Act. 
   With respect to body armor, there are about 10,000 surplus pieces of body armor that the FBI and DEA have.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. The amendment really is developed because of problems with alcohol being shipped to minors, and the amendment has major concern to the California wine industry. We believe it opens the Federal courts to State law. It does not focus on underage drinking, it is not supported by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and it is opposed by the largest Internet trade group and by the wine industry. 
   Rather, my amendment would focus directly on underage drinking by requiring that any shipment be clearly marked with a label as to what the contents are and require that the recipient be qualified to receive it--in other words, be able to present identification that that person is, in fact, an adult.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today in support of the Hatch-Feinstein amendment, a comprehensive package which contains no less than three different bills which I have introduced, which all seek to stem the steady tide of criminal violence in this country. 
   Specifically, it includes the following bills which I have introduced: 
   The Federal Gang Violence Act, a comprehensive package of measures which were recommended by law enforcement to increase their ability to combat the increasingly-violent criminal gangs which are spreading across the country. Senator HATCH and I introduced this legislation in the past two congresses, and some of its provisions have already been included in the  bill before us today, as Title II of the bill. 
   The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999, which is designed to increase police and public safety by taking body armor out of the hands of criminals and putting it in the hands of police. I introduced this earlier this year as S. 783, and it has been co-sponsored by Senators SESSIONS, BOXER, REID, BRYAN, and KERRY. We also have incorporated S. 726, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999, which was introduced by Senators CAMPBELL and TORRICELLI. 
   Anti-bombmaking legislation, which is designed to do everything possible under the Constitution to take information about how to make a bomb off the Internet by criminalizing the distribution of such information for a criminal purpose. I have introduced it in the past as an amendment to other bills, with the support of Senator BIDEN, and introduced it earlier this year as part of S. 606, with Senators NICKLES, HATCH, and MACK. 
   This amendment also includes provisions drafted by Senator HATCH to address animal enterprise terrorism, which he introduced earlier this year as part of his omnibus crime bill, S. 899. 
   I want to express my great thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for working with me to put this package together, which is obviously of the highest priority to me. 
   Let me now describe what it does, in more detail: 
   GANGS
   Gangs are no longer a local problem involving small groups of wayward youths. Rather, gang violence has truly become a problem of national scope.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, what I believe we are in, to some extent, is a kind of interindustry beef, if I might use that vernacular. And it all deals with the shipment of alcohol or alcoholic beverages across State lines. 
   The amendment just submitted by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is of major concern to the California wine industry. It is of major concern to the California wine industry, which makes 90 percent of the wine of this country, because small boutique wineries, which have wine tastings and then offer for sale a bottle of rather expensive wine over the Internet, are essentially affected by this amendment, which takes all State laws and essentially provides a Federal court venue. 
   We have had discussions in the Judiciary Committee; we had a full hearing in the the Judiciary Committee. The California Wine Institute testified as well as a vintner from Santa Cruz, CA. I thought there was going to be a delay. Senator HATCH had this amendment. He decided to let it sit for awhile so that we could put together some agreement. 
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving has been an original supporter of what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia proposes. However, at this time I will read from the text of a letter, dated May 13, from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, signed by Karolyn Nannalee, the national president.  
   At the time MADD provided testimony no legislation had been drafted on the subject. The text of S. 577 has implications far beyond our concerns and is, in fact, a battle between various elements within the alcoholic beverages industry. It does not surprise us that the competing parties would like to have the support of the victims of drunk driving. It does, however, dismay us that they would go to such lengths to misrepresent our views on the subject.  
   I only say this because Mothers Against Drunk Driving does not, in fact support the legislation that has just been presented. 
   The allegation is, of course, that this legislation is directed against the wine industry, which is having increasing success in the United States as more and more Americans consume wine as opposed to other alcoholic beverages. For the small winery that may not have shelf space in a supermarket, the Internet has emerged as a source of sales of their products. 
   Now, let's address the question of teenage drinking. In this respect, I agree entirely, 100 percent, with what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said. We ought to do everything we can to discourage teenage drinking. I do not have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is throwing all complicated laws with respect to alcoholic beverages into the Federal courts. I think that is unnecessary, and I think it is unwanted by many of us at least. 
   The amendment I have submitted--actually as an alternative, although it is a first-degree amendment--as an alternative to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I believe, would solve the problem, because it would require that any package containing an alcoholic beverage that is shipped across State lines must be labeled clearly and its contents must be identified as alcoholic beverages. 
   Second, it would require that upon delivery the recipient must be of an age to lawfully purchase the beverage and must sign and identify himself or herself as such. It would require the invoice to state that an adult signature is required for delivery. It would require the deliverer not to deliver unless an adult signature is attached. It provides criminal penalties for violation, and with three violations the BATF, on a mandatory basis, must revoke the basic permit of any person who has been convicted of three or more violations of this section. 
   I think this gets at the basic problem by setting up safeguards so that particularly wine can be shipped across State lines by the purchaser. 
   This is complicated but is something that has arisen and has become a kind of folk art, if you will, and that is the wine tasting where people go to wine areas, where they go directly to the winery where there is a wine tasting, where they see a new bottle of wine, sometimes very limited supply, and they say: Oh, how can I buy it? And the vendor will say: You can buy it through my web site, and it is $90, $80, $70 a bottle. That is how this is done. 
   I believe my amendment, without throwing all of this into Federal court, essentially skins the cat without killing it. I would be hopeful that the Senate would see it as worthy. 
   I very much thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I would like to thank the ranking member and those who made it possible for me to offer this amendment at this time. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the amendment the Senator has just submitted before the body. I believe directly following this amendment, I will be introducing an amendment. Last week, I announced I would be introducing an amendment which had essentially all the parts that Senator ASHCROFT has just introduced, plus one additional part. Let me comment on how his amendment differs from mine in the sense of the parts he has just talked about. 
   He has added exceptions relating to employment, ranching, farming, hunting, inheritance, target practice, and training. The exceptions in my amendment are military and law enforcement. 
   He also creates a new penalty of up to 20 years for a juvenile who uses these weapons with the intent to commit a violent felony. I think that is a very positive addition. 
   He does not make any transfer a felony, so the penalty would still be only up to 1 year. That is, if you transfer an assault weapon to a juvenile, the penalty is only up to 1 year. That is part of the problem. The penalty is so low, it is difficult to sustain or even make prosecutions. But I am very pleased he has seen fit to offer this amendment. 
   I want for a moment to talk about what is missing from the amendment, which I will talk about more deeply on my own time. What is missing from the amendment is plugging a major loophole in the assault weapons legislation which I presented to this body in 1993 as an amendment to the crime bill and which is now law. 
   When the amendment came before the body and we were standing down in the well, another Senator approached me and said: Would you mind if there were an amendment which would permit the continued grandfathering of big clips into this country, particularly for those that have bills of lading on them already and are in transit? I said no. The amendment went in and got broadened in the course of what turned out to be a rather cantankerous debate on the subject, back and forth between the two Houses. 
   This is significant because the failsafe in the assault weapons legislation has to do with clips, in that the domestic manufacture of clips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets is prohibited in the United States subsequent to enactment of the assault weapons legislation. That is now the law. The loophole is that these clips are coming in from all around the world. 
   Let me give a few examples. Between March of 1998 and July of 1998, BATF approved permits for over 8 million of these clips. They came in from countries all over--from Austria to Zimbabwe. 
   Let me tell you some of the things that come in from Great Britain: 826,000 clips, drums or strips, 250-round magazines, 177-round magazines, 71-round magazines, 50-round magazines; from Germany, 426,300; from Italy, 5,900,000, and on and on. 
   What is the significance of this? What gives an assault weapon the firepower is, first, you can hold it at your hip with two hands and spray fire; secondly, most of them are capable of having a very light trigger which you can pull very rapidly, and being semiautomatic, each time you pull it, it dispenses a bullet; and the clips are very big. The bigger the clip, the less the opportunity somebody has to disarm you. 
   Hence, they have become the weapon of choice of grievance killers, of drive-by shooters, of gangs, and of drug dealers. None of these big clips are necessary for hunting. 
   It always puzzles me why there is an exception. As a matter of fact, overwhelmingly, the great bulk of States prohibit more than seven bullets in a clip for hunting. Therefore, why you need to make an exception for hunting--I used to use a bow and arrow. I was pretty good at it. At least there was some sport in it. If you come along with a spray-fire assault weapon and you are hunting some poor deer, my goodness, I am rooting for the deer, that's for sure. 
   I really question why we cannot plug this loophole. I tried last year. We received 44 votes. I was told some people did not like the timing of it and, therefore, I am trying at a time now when the juvenile justice bill is before this body. 
   Unless we close this loophole, we will continue to build a nation that is awash with the kind of equipment that wreaks the devastation that is occurring all over this country. 
   What the Senator has done is commendable. He has put forward certainly some improvements. I have done the same thing with not as many exceptions and added one other item. 
   I will probably vote for that amendment. I will also, though, press my amendment because, as one who has lived this assault weapons issue now for the past 6 years, unless we close some of these loopholes, the point of the legislation, which is to dry up the huge supply of assault weapons as well as these big clips, essentially will not happen. This is an important loophole to be closed. That is essentially the difference between our two amendments. 
   How much time remains on our side, Mr. President?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take this time, if I may, to do something I have never done before, certainly on the floor of the Senate, and share with you my personal experience with guns and why I feel as strongly as I do with what is happening in this Nation with respect to them. 
   In 1976, I was president of the board of supervisors in San Francisco. There was a terrorist group by the name of  the New World Liberation Front that was operating in the far west. They had blown up power stations throughout the West. They targeted me and placed a bomb in a flower box outside my house. The bomb had a construction-grade explosive which does not detonate below freezing. It never drops below freezing in San Francisco. It was set to detonate at 1:30 in the morning. 
   It did detonate, but the explosive washed up the side of the building and it did not explode. The timer went out in the street, and the next morning, we found the explosive on the side of the house. It was a very sobering thing because it was right below my daughter's window. Then this same group shot out about 15 
   windows in a beach house my husband and I owned. 
   I went to the police department and asked for protection, and I asked if I could learn to carry a weapon. So I received, in 1976, a concealed weapon permit to carry a weapon. I was trained at the police range. The weapon I carried was a chief's special 38, five shots. I practiced regularly. 
   My husband was going through cancer surgery at this time, and I remember walking back and forth to the hospital feeling safer because I had this small gun in my purse. A year later, arrests were made, and I returned the gun and, as a matter of fact, it was melted down with about eight others into a cross which I was able to present to the Holy Father in Rome in the early 1980s. 
   Subsequent to that time, a direct contradictory incident changed my life dramatically, when a colleague of mine on the board of supervisors smuggled a gun in, a former police officer, and shot and killed the mayor and shot and killed a colleague. 
   I spoke about this very briefly on the floor once before, but I was the one who found my colleague's body and put a finger through a bullet hole trying to get a pulse. I became mayor as a product of assassination in a most difficult time in my city's history. 
   Between those two incidents, I have seen the reassurance, albeit false, that a weapon can give someone under siege. With a terrorist group, one does not know when they will strike. I was very frightened. I decided I would try to fight back, if I could, and did the legal things to be able to do it. So I understand that reassurance. 
   On the other hand, I have seen the criminal use of weapons. Then I began to see very clearly, between the late seventies and today, the evolution of the gun on the streets of America and seeing these very high-powered weapons striking hard and killing innocent people. I actually walked a block in Los Angeles where, in 6 months, 30 people were mowed down by drive-by shooters carrying these weapons. 
   I went to 101 California Street and saw the devastation that an aggrieved man brought about when he walked in with assault weapons and mowed down innocent people. 
   Let me tell you a couple of the characteristics of some of these weapons. I will begin with the weapon that was used in Littleton. 
   The Intratech TEC-9, TEC-DC9, TEC-22 is a favorite weapon of drug dealers, according to BATF gun data. One out of every five assault weapons traced from a crime is a TEC-9, according to BATF. It comes standard with a 30- to 36-round ammunition magazine capable of being fired as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. It is one of the most inexpensive semiautomatic assault weapons available. The original pistol version, called KG-9, was so easily converted to fully automatic it was reclassified by the BATF in 1982 as a machine gun. 
   The TEC-22 is very similar to the TEC-9 and TEC-DC9 and fires .22 caliber ammunition, manufactured in the United States. 
   The other one widely used is the AK-47. It is the most widely used assault weapon in the world, now manufactured in many countries. An estimated 20 to 50 million have been produced. It comes standard with a 30-round ammunition magazine capable of being fired as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. Some models are available with collapsible stock to facilitate accountability, developed in 1947 in the Soviet Union. 
   These are two of the weapons most used--banned by the assault weapons legislation. 
   What is the problem? The problem is the gun manufacturers are so craven that whatever you write, they find a way to get around it, to produce a thumb-hole stock or some other device, but to continue the basics of the weapon--that it can be held in two hands, that it can be spray fired. And what enables it to be so lethal and used in grievance killings and used by drive-by shooters and used by gangs is the big clips. No one can get to you to disarm you if you have a 70-round clip, a 90-round clip, or two 30-round clips strapped together. 
   So the purpose of the assault weapons legislation was to dry up that supply, not to take one away from anybody but over time dry up the supply. Today, no one in this country can manufacture a clip, drum, or strip of more than 10 bullets. No one can sell it legally. No one can possess it legally if it is made postban. The loophole is that they are pouring in from 20 different nations. 
   I went to the President, and I said: Can you use your executive authority to stop it? Just as he did with the foreign importation of assault weapons. What I was told by Justice was, no, we need legislation to close the loophole. 
   So I say to the Senator, where my legislation differs from yours is in exceptions and plugging this loophole. I very much hope we can plug the loophole. I very much hope the intent of your legislation isn't to submarine my legislation, isn't to prevent the closure of this loophole, which, as submitted to me right down there--I will never forget where it happened--was simply a grandfather clause to permit those weapons that had bills of lading on them in transport coming into this country. And I believe it should be closed. I believe the supply should be dried up. 
   Let me talk about the school killings and how these clips come into it for a moment. 
   I sent my staff to buy some of these clips. Let's see if it is easy; let's see if it is hard. 
   On the Internet, no questions asked. It is $8, $10 for a clip; no questions asked. Give your mother's credit card and you get it in the mail within a couple of days. We bought a 75-round magazine for an AK-47. And we bought several 30-round clips for $7.99, $8. And then if it slips into the weapon, you have a gun that can kill 30 people before you can be disarmed. That is why I so desperately want to plug this loophole. 
   As I believe the time is up, I yield the floor and will continue this on my own time. I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is designed to close several loopholes in laws that allow juveniles to obtain big guns. The amendment will ban juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. It will ban juvenile possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines. It will ban future importation of large-capacity ammunition magazines, and it makes the transfer of a handgun, semiautomatic assault weapon or high-capacity clip to a juvenile a felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. 
   It increases the maximum penalty for transferring a handgun to a juvenile, with knowledge that it will be used to commit a crime, from 10 to 20 years. It does that same thing for transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon to a juvenile. 
   I think we have had a good discussion on the first part of the amendment with Senator ASHCROFT's legislation; that is, the amendment banning juvenile possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon. Current law already prohibits any person under the age of 18 from owning or possessing a handgun, with certain very limited exceptions. Yet, the law does nothing to prevent a juvenile from possessing the deadliest of assault weapons, those banned by our legislation of 1994. This would close that loophole. 
   Secondly, the amendment bans juvenile possession of large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices. 
   Now, what is a large-capacity ammunition-feeding device? It is something like this, where 30 rounds go into this clip. The clip goes up into the weapon, and you can use the weapon and spray fire, having a large number of bullets. Most assault weapons come standard with 20- or 30-round clips. These big drums or clips are the tools that allow a person to rapidly fire shot after shot after shot with no opportunity to be disarmed. 
   As I said earlier, they have no sporting purpose. Anybody who sees somebody deer hunting with one of these, root for the deer because you don't have much of a hunter if it takes 30 bullets in an assault weapon to take down a deer. 
   For both of these two provisions, the ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high-capacity clips, there are two exceptions. A juvenile may still use or possess a handgun, assault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition magazine if he or she is a member of the Armed Forces or the National Guard, and the use of such items is in the line of duty. Secondly, a juvenile may still use or possess a handgun, assault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition if these items are temporarily being used to defend a home. So, in other words, if there is one in the home and the home is invaded by a number of masked gunmen, the youth can certainly legally pick up that weapon to defend himself or herself. Throughout my amendment, a juvenile is defined as a person under the age of 18. 
   The third provision I have offered would finally stop the importation of large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices, and that is what the other side of the aisle wants to permit to continue to happen. As I mentioned earlier when we passed the legislation in 1994, a grandfather clause was in it to permit those shipments that have bills of lading on them to come into the country. What a mistake I made at that time. I should have fought it tooth and nail. It was then expanded, and you have the loophole that exists today. It has now been more than 4 years, and I believe anybody who has made pre-1994 assault weapons and clips has had an opportunity to import them into this Nation. My goodness, BATF, in 6 months, approves permits for 8.6 million of them. Now, look at the number of years that have gone by already. If you multiply every 6 months by 8.6 million, you will get a sense of the number that are coming in. 
   Let me say, once again, it is illegal to manufacture them domestically, sell them domestically, and possess them domestically, if they were made after the ban. The problem is, BATF has no way of knowing whether the clip, once it is in, was made before or after the ban because BATF can't go to Austria, or Great Britain, or Italy, or Zimbabwe, or Czechoslovakia, or East Germany, or any of these other places where these big clips are made and brought into this country. 
   Last year, the President stopped the importation of most copycat assault weapons into this country with an executive order. The Justice Department has advised that the President doesn't have the authority to ban the big clips and close the loophole. That is why the legislation is before us today.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Once again, this describes the countries--Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Zimbabwe--where during this 6-month period these big clips received permits. 
   The final provision in this amendment will increase penalties on any person who sells or transfers a handgun, assault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition magazine to a juvenile. Any transfer of a handgun, assault weapon, or one of these clips to a juvenile, under my legislation, would become a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. And any person who transfers to a juvenile, knowing that it is going to be used to commit a crime, is subject to a maximum penalty of 20 years. As I said earlier, the legislation applies the handgun prohibition to assault weapons as well. 
   Now, let me just speak for a moment about what we have seen happen in the last 3 years. Since I became, I might say, gun-sensitive in 1976, I have watched incidents develop in the United States. It is not hard for any of us to see that what has happened is a combination of things. In the first place, there are parents that, apparently, don't teach their youngsters values; schools that are too big; counselors that are too rare; the burgeoning group of youngsters who feel aggrieved or not accepted or not ``one of them,'' or is jealous, is going to essentially have the last laugh by going in and really taking out a large number of students. We saw it in Moses Lake, WA; Bethel, AK; Pearl, MS; West Paducah, KY; Jonesboro, AR, which involved 2 killers, one of them just 11 years old; Edinboro, PA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; and now Littleton, CO. All of these took place not in Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, or San Francisco, but in small suburban communities, many of them deeply religious, most of them middle to upper-class socioeconomically. 
   So what has happened? I believe that what happened is we have seen the fomenting of a culture of violence surrounding youngsters. I have used this before and I will use it again. I would like to read directly from the Washington Post article dated Monday, May 11:  
   Angry 5-year-old Took Gun to School. Memphis. Five-year-old kindergartner was arrested after bringing a loaded pistol to school because he wanted to kill his teacher for punishing him with a ``time out,'' according to police records. The .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol in the child's backpack was confiscated by teacher Maggie Foster on Friday after another pupil brought her a bullet. ``He said he wanted to shoot and kill several pupils as well as a teacher,'' the arrest ticket said. He stated he was going to shoot Ms. Foster for putting him in ``time out,'' a form of discipline for young children. 
   The boy was charged with carrying a weapon. It was unclear if he would be prosecuted. ``A five-year-old is not capable of forming criminal intent,'' juvenile court Judge Kenneth Turner said. ``The boy got the gun from atop his grandfather's bedroom dresser,'' said Jerry Manassass, juvenile director of court services. The boy and his mother live with the grandfather. ``The State's Department of Children Services will investigate the boy's home situation,'' officials said.  
   And that's that. 
   Doesn't that frighten you? Doesn't it make you think that this Nation is so awash with guns that it has even trickled down to a five-year-old who knows enough to pick up a gun and take it to school? It frightens me, and I believe it concerns the dominant majority of American people. We have a chance to do something about it. 
   We can't entirely change the culture. We can pass, as we have, certain pieces of legislation. We can use the bully pulpit. We can talk about parents keeping their guns safe. We can use trigger locks. We can make parents responsible--all of which I think we should do. But the one thing we can and we must do is keep large firepower out of the hands of juveniles. The more you proliferate these weapons and make it easy for youngsters to obtain the ammunition feeding devices, just by using their computer, just by punching in their family's credit card, we create the situation where more lives can be taken. 
   Almost 1 in 12 high school students report having carried a gun in the last 30 days. This is despite Senator DORGAN and my gun-free schools bill. In 1996, 2,866 children and teenagers were murdered with guns, 1,309 committed suicide with guns, and 468 died in unintentional shootings. Gunshot wounds are now the second leading cause of death among people aged 10 to 34. What a commentary on this Nation. The firearm epidemic in this country is now 10 times larger than the polio epidemic of earlier this century. 
   In the 1996-1997 school year alone, more than 6,000 students across this Nation were caught with firearms in school. Is there a Member of this body who saw guns in their classrooms as they were growing up? I don't think so. I sure didn't. But I will tell you this: I addressed the fourth grade class in Hollywood and I said: What is your greatest fear? And that fourth grade said being shot. I said: How many of you have heard shots? And every single hand in the class went up in Hollywood, CA, as having heard shots. What kind of a nation are we becoming when  our youngsters have to be reared in this kind of environment? 
   I notice the distinguished Senator, my cosponsor of this amendment, Senator CHAFEE of Rhode Island, is on the floor. If I might, I would like to yield time to him, as much time as he requires.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me once again state what is the fundamental difference between the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Missouri and my amendment. My amendment has one thing that his does not. It closes the loophole in the 1994 assault weapons legislation. 
   Today, it is illegal for anyone, domestically, to manufacture these big clips. It is illegal for them to sell them. It is illegal for people to possess them. But it is not illegal to bring them in from abroad. So why wouldn't we straighten this out? Why would we disadvantage our domestic manufacturers and allow all of this stuff, these big clips, up to 250 rounds, to come in from abroad? It makes no sense. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. In a simple equity argument, we have closed the supply off domestically. Why permit these clips to come in from foreign countries? 
   Mr. President, I believe as soon as Senator SCHUMER comes he would like some time on this amendment as well. But I think we have an opportunity today for both parties to come together and do something important for our Nation. I deeply believe this legislation is supported by 80 percent to 90 percent of the American people. Why would we not enact it? Both of us want the same thing. We want to keep these weapons out of the hands of juveniles and we want to keep these big clips out of the hands of juveniles. 
   Does it make sense, then, to continue to increase the supply? I do not believe it does. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may then discuss what is in the division of the question. When we passed the assault weapons legislation in 1994, there was a grandfather clause which permitted the continued importation of shipments of clips, drums and strips of large size, large size being defined here by more than 10 bullets. 
   In the legislation passed in 1994, the domestic manufacture of these same clips and the sale of these same clips and the possession of these same clips was made illegal. The loophole is permitting the importation of foreign clips while we close off the manufacture of them domestically, the sale of the domestic clip. These new clips, manufactured after the ban, the fact of the matter is, are coming in. 
   I submitted for the record BATF statistics that in 6 months 8.6 million clips are approved for entry from 20 different countries, many of them as big as 250 rounds, 90 rounds, 70 rounds, 50 rounds, by the hundreds of thousands. We are trying to cut off that loophole.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act. This important legislation will remedy a flaw in federal child support laws that could cost California $4 billion annually. 
   On April 30, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intent to reject the State of California's plan for child and spousal support because California does not have a centralized ``State Disbursement Unit'' that distributes child support collections to families. The mandatory penalty for this failure is loss of all federal child support administrative funding, which amounts to $300 million a year. 
   In addition, because the 1996 welfare reform law requires states to have an approved child support plan in order to receive the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant, California could lose its entire TANF block grant of $3.7 billion a year. 
   In other words, California faces a $4 billion annual penalty for its failure to operate a State Disbursement Unit. 
   This so-called ``nuclear penalty'' is completely unjust and out of proportion. It will devastate the State of California's ability to serve low-income children and families--both families on welfare, and families who need child support so that they can stay off welfare. The penalty also will cripple the State's budget, seriously harming the largest economy in this nation. 
   I am not questioning the value of a State Disbursement Unit, or California's need to develop one. On the contrary, I am urging Governor Davis and the State legislature to come up with a plan to develop a State Disbursement Unit as quickly as possible. But I do not believe that poor families should be severely punished because the State has not gotten its act together. 
   Moreover, California's failure to develop a State Disbursement Unit is a direct result of its failure to develop a statewide computer system that tracks child support cases--and California is already paying a penalty for the computer failure. 
   The computer system penalty, which Congress established just last year, is fair and proportionate. More importantly, it rises over time, giving California a powerful incentive to get a computer system up and running. If California does not have a computer system in place by 2002, it will lose over $109 million annually in federal funds. 
   It is simply unfair to levy a $4 billion penalty against California for not having a State Disbursement Unit, when the State's failure to establish the unit is a direct result of a computer failure for which the State is already being penalized. 
   The Child Support Penalty Fairness Act would provide that States could not be penalized for failure to develop centralized disbursement units, if they are already paying a penalty for computer-related problems. 
   Under this bill, California would still have to pay a significant penalty for its computer-related troubles. Moreover, if California gets a statewide computer system in place, but still fails to operate a centralized disbursement unit, the State would be subject to additional severe penalties. This provides powerful incentive for the State to develop both a computer system, and a central disbursement unit, quickly. 
   I believe that this bill is proportionate and fair. It will prompt the State of California to develop a State Disbursement Unit in a timely fashion, without placing aid to low income children and families at risk. It is simply the right thing to do. I hope that my colleagues will take up and pass the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act as quickly as possible.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for 7 years now as a member of the Senate Judiciary committee I have watched the situation in this nation going from bad to worse to terrible with respect to violence and its glorification in the media. 
   I am voting for this amendment because I believe it gives the various industries what they need to be able to establish voluntary guidelines through a voluntary ``code of conduct'' to limit the depictions of violence in music, films, video games or television. 
   This amendment provides the entertainment industry with an exemption from antitrust laws in order to develop and disseminate voluntary codes of conduct with respect to violence, similar to the National Association of Broadcasters television code prior to 1983, when a court helt the code violated antitrust laws. 
   Additionally, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission will be directed to conduct a joint investigation of the marketing practices used by the makers of video games, music and motion pictures to determine whether they engage in deceptive marketing practices, including directly targeting material to minors, which is unsuitable for minors. 
   Furthermore, the National Institutes of Health will be directed to conduct a study of the effects of violent video games and music on child development and youth violence, examining whether and to what extent such violence affects the emotional and psychological development of juveniles and whether it contributes to juvenile delinquency and youth violence. 
   The glorification of violence in the media has reached such an extent that a manufacturer of interactive computer games to young people advertises: ``Kill your friends, guilt free.'' 
   With such messages of death and degradation delivered through the media, and with our nation awash with guns easily accessible to young people, is it any surprise that troubled youths are now taking up these weapons and going on rampages, killing their classmates and teachers? 
   The latest of these tragedies occurred in Littleton, Colorado, where Eric Harris spent hours and hours playing violent computer games like Doom and Quake, featuring the wholesale slaughter of digital enemies before joining his friend Dylan Klebold in killing 12 other students and a teacher. 
   Isn't it time, at the very least, that the manufacturers of video games, television programs, motion pictures and music acknowledge the impact on young people of the carnage they promulgate and demonstrate through a voluntary code of conduct some willingness to limit the violence? 
   Isn't it time that the entertainment industry does its best to discourage the production and promotion of gratuitous, simulated death and destruction that all too often triggers real and terrifying acts of violence by our young people? 
   Isn't it time that we in Congress direct the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether deceptive marketing practices are being employed to target minors? 
   Isn't it time that we in Congress direct the National Institutes of Health to study the effect of these violent video games and music on our young people? 
   Isn't it time that we do everything we can to stop tragedies like Littleton from happening again?

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the week of May 9, 1999 is National Hospital Week, when communities across the country celebrate the people that make hospitals the special places they are. This year's theme sums it up nicely: ``People Care, Miracles Happen.'' It recognizes the health care workers, volunteers and other health professionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, curing and caring for their neighbors who need them. 
   An example of this dedication is the Sexual Assault Response of Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California. The program won the American Hospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer Excellence for 1999, which highlights special contributions of hospital volunteers. 
   The Sexual Assault Response Service is a team of hospital volunteers that offers specialized assistance to sexual assault victims, families, hospital personnel and law enforcement agencies. To meet the program's high standards, volunteers get more than 60 hours of training. 
   Responding to a call from any area hospital emergency department, they provide support to victims while helping to solicit histories, preparing evidence collection kits, assisting with medical and legal examinations, and overseeing the completion of state forms. Volunteers work with the district attorney's office throughout the court process and offer one-on-one counseling, a referral service, a lending library and community education. 
   Mr. President, I want to congratulate Antelope Valley Hospital for this award-winning effort and for their generous contributions to their community.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Colorado is on the floor. I really want to extend to him and to all of the people of Colorado my deepest sympathy and sorrow for the events yesterday. After I finish a brief global warming statement, I would like to make a more inclusive statement about the events that took place in Colorado, but I want him to know that my heart and thoughts are with him and the people of Colorado today. 
   Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate Earth Day tomorrow, I wanted to speak for a few minutes about what I consider to be the single greatest environmental threat facing our planet: the threat of global warming. 
   The phenomenon of global climate change really hit home for me in January of 1997. That year, devastating floods killed seven people and caused nearly $2 billion in damage in California. California is famous for its weather extremes, but the 1997 floods were unusual in terms of their ferocity, the loss of life they caused, and the tremendous property damage that occurred. 
   Even more striking, the 1997 flood was only one of four 100-year floods that occurred in California in the 1990s. Therefore, it certainly got my attention when I read that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency believes that major changes in the El Nino and La Nina ocean currents, which brought so much rain to California, may be linked to changes in the ocean's temperature. 
   Last fall, I received an in-depth briefing from Dr. John Holdren, the Teresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy and Director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at Harvard University. Dr. Holdren presented clear and compelling evidence to me that global warming is real. It is happening, and it will have significant impacts on human health, our environment, and our economy. 
   Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, however, literally every week my office receives bulletins from groups that continue to dispute the reality of global warming. Today I would like to lay out the evidence that global warming is indeed occurring. 
   There is overwhelming scientific consensus about the following facts: The natural greenhouse effect (which is primarily a product of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane) makes the earth habitable, keeping the average surface temperature about 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it would otherwise be. 
   Large increases in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities produce significant further global warming, accompanied by other changes in climatic patterns. 
   Today's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is about 30 percent higher than pre-industrial levels. The methane concentration is over 100 percent higher. These levels are higher than at any time in the last 160,000 years. 
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an assembly of 2,000 of the world's leading experts on climate and related disciplines, has found that human activities are increasing the greenhouse effect, and therefore raising the temperature of the planet. It is important to note that the IPCC includes scientists from all member states of the World Meteorological Association and the United Nations. 
   To quote the IPCC:  
   The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, and among them, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have grown significantly since pre-industrial times ..... These trends can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly fossil fuel use, land-use change and agriculture. Concentrations of other anthropogenic greenhouse gases have also increased. An increase of greenhouse gas concentrations leads on average to an additional warming of the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere--and affect climate--for a long time.  
   The IPCC estimates that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen from 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution, to 360 parts per million today. By the end of the next century, the carbon dioxide level will be somewhere between 480 and 800 parts per million. 
   According to the IPCC, this change is ``unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. The balance of evidence, from changes in global mean surface air temperature and from changes in geographical, seasonal, and vertical patterns of atmospheric temperature, suggest a discernible human influence on global climate.'' 
   Already, these increased greenhouse gas emissions are changing the earth's climate. Here are the facts: 
   The average temperature of the earth has risen 1.3 degrees in the last 100 years. 
   Ten of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last 12 years. 1998 was the hottest year on record. 
   The last 50 years appear to have been the warmest half century in 6,000 years, according to evidence from ice core samples. 
   Scientific evidence convincingly shows increased rates of evaporation and rainfall, glacier retreat, sea ice shrinkage, and rising sea levels. 
   The IPCC estimates that by 2100, the earth's temperature will have risen by two to six degrees. This rate of warming, if it were to occur, would be the fastest warming rate in the last 10,000 years. 
   Even if an overwhelming body of scientific evidence regarding global warming did not exist, the weather map alone would tell us something is wrong. According to the National Climatic Data Center, weather extremes are becoming more and more frequent: hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, flooding, droughts. So far this century, extreme weather events have increased by 20 percent. Annual precipitation is up 6 percent since 1900, and total winter precipitation is up 8 percent. 
   Just look at the period from November 1997 through July 1998, when a series of extreme weather events hit this nation. Northern California had its wettest May ever in 1998, with precipitation in at least one area hitting 800 percent of normal. Meanwhile, Texas suffered under a devastating drought, with San Antonio getting only 8 percent of its normal rainfall in May. In Florida last summer, the U.S. Forest Service estimated that 80 percent of the State was at a drought level equivalent to a desert. Ohio, the Upper 
   Midwest, and New England had no shortage of rain, however; floods in those areas claimed 13 lives. 
   While individually none of these events can be linked directly to global warming, collectively they show a troubling pattern consistent with what the best science tells us global warming will look like. 
   Things could get worse. According to the IPCC, one third to one half of all mountain glacier mass could disappear in the next century. Melting glaciers, combined with melting of the antarctic ice shelves, could raise sea level by as much as three feet in the next 100 years. This could cause severe flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area, New Orleans, the Everglades, and the Chesapeake Bay. 
   The weather changes caused by global warming also could wreak havoc upon the environment and human health. The University of California estimates that global warming could render 20 to 50 percent of the State's natural areas unsuitable for the current species who live there. Major vegetation changes are occurring over one-eighth of the planet. The effects of global warming on human health, including outbreaks of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever, are so significant that I plan to discuss those separately in a floor statement soon. 
   Global warming is not a problem that we can afford to ignore or dismiss. The scientific evidence is overwhelming and persuasive, and we need to take steps now to reduce global warming. That is why I am circulating a letter, along with Senators GORTON and BRYAN, that encourages the President to work with Congress to implement improved Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standards. Cars and light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, are responsible for 20 percent of all carbon emissions in the United States, and emit more carbon than all sources in Great Britain combined. 
   By raising fuel efficiency standards, we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 240 million tons per year. This  will help curb global warming, improve air quality, save consumers at the gas pump, and reduce our reliance on imported oil. 
   Stronger fuel efficiency standards alone will not solve the global warming problem, but they are a very good place to start. I am pleased to say that a bi-partisan group of 22 Senators have already signed the letter to the President, and I am hopeful that more will sign soon. 
   I also urge all of my colleagues--especially those who may remain skeptical about the existence of global warming--to attend a briefing that I am hosting on May 11 with scientists from the University of California, including Nobel Laureate Sherwood Rowland. These scientists will discuss recent satellite measurements concerning global climate change; disturbing new evidence that climate change may be occurring more abruptly than scientists had earlier forecast; and possible solutions to the problem. 
   Global warming is an extremely complicated issue, and I understand that a number of policy alternatives are currently on the table--from the Kyoto Protocol supported by President Clinton, to the ``Credit for Early Action'' bill sponsored by Senator CHAFEE, to the bill currently being drafted by Senator MURKOWSKI. I do not presume to stand here today with a master plan for how to stop global warming. 
   But I do feel strongly that global warming's existence cannot be disputed. It is real. It could cause the greatest environmental crisis of our time. I hope that we can at least recognize the threat, and begin working together to address it.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the tragedy in Colorado. I want to express my sincere sympathies for the families and victims of yesterday's events. 
   Once again, we have witnessed a deadly school shooting in America's heartland. Yesterday's events, although greater in magnitude than other shootings in recent years, have, it seems, become part of a growing trend in this country, and particularly among young people, and that is to solve everyday problems with deadly violence. 
   Now, some of us have heard firsthand the gruesome effects of gun violence. But we can't imagine what the classmates and families of those Colorado children must be going through today. The senseless loss, the graphic memories, the fear of violence, the lack of explanation. 
   Who among us can imagine how we would feel if two dozen of our friends and classmates were gunned down in a matter of minutes? Who among us knows what we would say to our own children if something like this happened at their school? And who among us wants to imagine what it would be like to receive that phone call telling us that our child is no more. 
   Mr. President, this is a time for grieving, but it is also a time for sincere reflection on the direction of this country and the nature of child on child violence. Sadly, this nation has experienced an ever increasing number of these incidents in the last two years. We saw it happen in Pearl, Mississippi where two students were killed. We saw it happen in West Paducah, Kentucky where three students were killed. We saw it in Jonesboro, Arkansas where five were killed and in Springfield, Oregon where two were killed. 
   We saw a five-year-old Memphis, Tennessee kindergartner last year bring a gun to school because the teacher had given him ``timeout'' the day before. Now Littleton, Colorado joins that tragic list. 
   We are still learning the specifics of this latest tragedy. But while this most recent incident may have been executed with more deadly results, it is all too familiar. We must struggle to learn why these incidents are happening with ever increasing frequency. Are children more troubled than they have been in the past? Do parents need to pay more attention to danger signals within their own homes? Do parents even have the ability to recognize danger signs? And do they know what to do when they see the signs of trouble? 
   I am certain that we will all continue to ask these questions in the coming days and weeks. I hope we don't stop asking until we find some answers. 
   One area in which I have been working for many years is the problem of gun access. I realize that bringing up gun control at this time might be viewed by some as trying to capitalize on yesterday's tragedy. I am sure the NRA will criticize those of us who connect this violence with the easy access of guns in America. But sadly, times of tragedy like this are often the only times people pay attention to the problems plaguing our society. If we do not speak up now, we may not prevent future Littletons from occurring. 
   Children have easy access to guns of every sort and every caliber--including assault weapons and high capacity clips that make it all too simple to strike fellow students down in mere seconds. Whereas in the past a grievance might be settled in a brief fist-fight, today our children often turn to firearms. 
   Yesterday, two masked gunmen killed as many as 25 people with semiautomatic gunfire and explosive devices. Other students hid under desks and in rooms throughout the school, watching the gruesome scene develop on televisions within the classrooms, and in some cases calling the media to report crying, gunfire, and the sound of running feet from within the school walls. One student reported to police that he saw two of his classmates carrying shotguns, automatic weapons, and pipe bombs. 
   We may never be able to stop children from feeling alone and wanting to strike out. But we can certainly stop them from gaining the use of high capacity weapons with which to strike. And we should. 
   In 1994, we passed a ban on assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips, with the intent to get these guns off the streets, out of the hands of criminals, and away from our kids. But because of strong NRA opposition, we were forced to allow pre-existing guns and clips to remain on the shelves of stores across this country. And although the President has stopped the importation of most assault weapons to this country, millions of high capacity ammunition magazines continue to flow onto our shores and into the hands of criminals and, indeed, our children. 
   In fact, between March and August of last year alone, BATF approved more than 8 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. The clips approved during this one short period accounted for almost 128 million rounds of ammunition--and every round represents the potential for taking one human life. 
   Mr. President, 75, 90, and even 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing of other men, women and children. 
   I have introduced legislation, supported by the President, that will stop the flow of these clips into this country. I know that we cannot eliminate these clips from existence. But we must--we must--do our best to make it harder and harder for children to find these clips and to use these guns. 
   It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often used for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling. It is time to plug this loophole and close our borders to these tools of death and destruction. Our domestic manufacturers are complying with the law, and we must now force foreign manufacturers to comply as well. 
   In closing our borders to these high capacity clips, we will not put an end to all incidents of gun violence. But we will limit the destructive power of that violence. We will not stop every troubled child who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we can limit the tools that a child can find to carry out that act. 
   Each of us has been touched in some way by the devastating effects of gun violence. Each of our states has faced unnecessary tragedy and senseless destruction as a result of the high-powered, high-capacity weapons falling into the hands of gangs, drive-by shooters, cop killers, grievance killers, and yes, even children. My own state of California has too often been the subject of national attention due to incidents of gun violence. 
   We must work to console the victims of this crime and the families of those who have been injured. My thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been affected by yesterday's events. We must now rededicate our efforts to prevent future tragedies from developing. I for one want to stop the easy access juveniles have to weapons of war, reduce this violence we see every night on TV, and help strengthen and nurture a new family ethic that says ``enough'' to this kind of violence.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1999. This bill would designate an 18,500 acre portion of the Otay Mountain region in Southern California as wilderness. The bill passed the House last week on a voice vote, with broad bi-partisan support. 
   Otay Mountain, which is located near the U.S.-Mexico border in eastern San Diego County, is one of California's most special wild places. The mountain is a unique ecosystem, home to 20 sensitive plant and animal species. The endangered quino checkerspot butterfly calls Otay Mountain home, and the only known stand of Tecate cypress, as well as the only known population of the Mexican flannel bush, also thrive on the mountain. For these reasons, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management first recommended Otay Mountain for wilderness designation in the 1980s. 
   In addition, Otay Mountain is key to San Diego County's habitat conservation planning efforts. The County has identified the region as a core reserve in the multi-species habitat conservation plan that it is currently developing. 
   Otay Mountain is scenic, rugged, and beautiful. The area is well worth preserving as wilderness for generations to come. This bill will ensure that San Diegans, and indeed all Americans, will be able to experience and enjoy Otay Mountain in all its unique splendor. 
   Unfortunately, in recent years Otay Mountain's sensitive habitat has been damaged by illegal immigration and narcotics activity in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has worked closely with the U.S. Border Patrol to bring these problems under control, and they have experienced great success. This legislation would specifically allow Border Patrol and firefighting activities to continue in the new wilderness area, so long as they remain in accordance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. This provision in the legislation is specific to Otay Mountain and will not apply to any other wilderness area. 
   I want to thank Congressman BRIAN BILBRAY for his leadership in introducing the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and guiding it through the House of Representatives. I also want to thank Congressman FILNER, who has been a steadfast supporter of the legislation, along with the Clinton Administration. The California Departments of Fish and Game and Fire and Forestry Protection support the bill, as do the Endangered Habitats League and other environmental groups. Finally, the bill has strong support from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and the San Diego Association of Governments. 
   Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to approve the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and send the bill to the President for signature.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide funds to build new schools. It is the Excellence in Education Act of 1999. 
   The purpose of this bill is to (1) reduce the size of schools and (2) reduce the size of classes. The bill would create a 50-50 matching grant program to build new schools to meet the following size requirements: 
   School size requirement: 
   for kindergarten through 5th grade, not more than 500 students; 
   for grades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students; and 
   for grades 9 through 12, not more than 1,500 students. 
   Class size requirement: 
   for kindergarten through grade 6, not more than 20 students per teacher; 
   for grades 7 through 12, not more than 28 students per teacher. 
   The bill authorizes $5 billion each year for the next five years for the U.S. Department of Education to award grants to local school districts. School districts would have to match federal funds with an equal amount. In addition to making the above reductions, school districts would be required to terminate social promotion, provide remedial education and require that students be subject to state achievement standards in the core academic curriculum. 
   Why do we need this bill? 
   First, many of our schools are just too big, especially in urban areas. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. ``It's not unusual to find high schools of 2,000, 3,000, or even 4,000 students and junior high schools of 1,500 or more, especially in urban school systems,'' writes Thomas Toch in the Washington Post. In these monstrous schools, the principal is just a disembodied voice over the public address system. 
   Equally serious is the fact that our classes are too big. Even though we have begun to reduce class sizes in my state, California still has some of the largest class sizes in the U.S. The National Center for Education Statistics says California's classrooms have the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the nation. 
   This bill will provide a new funding source for school districts or states to match to build new schools and reduce both school size and class size. There is no good estimate of how many schools would be needed to reduce schools and classes to the levels specified in the amendment, but we all know that there are many large schools and large classes in public education today.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to end the practice of social promotion in our public schools and to provide remedial education to help students meet academic achievement standards. The Student Achievement Act of 1999 authorizes $500 million for five years for local school districts to provide extended learning time so that K-12 students can achieve. 
   Social promotion is the formal or informal practice of promoting a student from grade to grade even when the student fails to achieve a level of achievement and proficiency in the core curriculum. 
   To receive funds, schools would have to: 
   Adopt a policy prohibiting social promotion; 
   Require that students be subject to academic achievement standards in the core curriculum, defined as subjects such as reading, writing, language arts, mathematics, social sciences and science; 
   Test student achievement in meeting standards at certain benchmarks, to be determined by the states; 
   Provide remedial education; and 
   Have substantial numbers of low-performing students. 
   I am introducing this bill because I believe that the linchpin to educational reform is the elimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are failing are simply promoted to the next grade in hopes that they will learn. The product of this practice of simply promoting youngsters when they are failing to adequately learn has produced a generation of young people who are below standard and high school graduates that cannot read or write, count change in their pockets or fill out an employment application. It is that bad. 
   And my state is just about the worst. There's a steady stream of bad news. On March 5, we learned, yet again that California ranks second to last among 39 states in fourth-grade reading skills. Eighty percent of my state's fourth graders are not proficient readers. For eighth graders, California is 33rd out of 36 states and only 22 percent of California's eighth graders are proficient readers. 
   On March 24, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the state received a grade of D+ from the American Electronics Association for the quality and availability of an educated workforce. This conclusion is in the state that is the home of Silicon Valley, the premier high-tech area of the country, in a state that received an A for electronic commerce and is number one in high tech employment. But California does not have a school system that trains students well enough to work in the high-paying, skilled jobs available. 
   These numbers are a stunning indictment of a failing system. 
   It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our students, their parents and the public. As long as social promotion exists and is widespread, youth who cannot read or write and who won't be able to find jobs in the future will continue to graduate from high school. 
   I agree with the conclusion of the September 1997 study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers:  
   ``Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count; for teachers who must face students who know that teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the business community and colleges that must spend millions of dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the nation.''  
   There is no hard data on the extent of social promotion in our public schools, but most authorities, in the schools and out, know that it is happening--and in fact, in some districts it is standard operating procedure. 
   The September AFT study surveyed 85 of the nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 states, representing one-third of the nation's public school enrollment, about their promotion policies. 
   Saying that social promotion is ``rampant,'' AFT leaders found that school districts' criteria for passing and retaining students is vague. Only 17 states have standards in the four core disciplines (English, math, social studies and science) that are well grounded in content and that are clear enough to be used.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with some degree of regret that I rise to oppose this budget resolution conference report. 
   Thanks to continued economic growth and the tough choices we made on the budget in 1993, this year, for the first time in a generation, we have been given the opportunity to structure a budget which is balanced, fiscally responsible, and makes important investment in America's domestic priorities. 
   When I first came to the Senate some 6 years ago, we faced $200 billion annual deficits as far as the eye could see. Now, thanks to the tough choices we made in 1993, then fiscal discipline we imposed on the budget, and a vibrant economy, we are able to reap the benefits of the difficult choices. Now we are running surpluses--projected to be as much as $4.7 trillion over the next 15 years by the Office of Management and Budget. 
   Thanks to these surpluses we have an unparalleled opportunity to set our budgetary house in order and meet the challenges of the future. 
   We have the opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare. To invest in education, environment, and health care. To provide for a strong national defense. 
   And I also believe that we have an important opportunity to provide responsible tax relief for working families--and I intend to introduce legislation to provide just such a tax cut with my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. 
   But this conference report ignores these opportunities. It fails to meet the test of saving Medicare. It fails to make the important investments in health care, education, and child care. And it endangers other programs vital for law enforcement, environment, and continued economic growth. 
   This conference report does not do anything to meet Medicare's solvency crisis or extend the life of this vital program beyond the projected 2015 bankruptcy. I agree with those who say that we must reform Medicare, but we also must provide it with the additional funds it needs. The President has proposed allocating 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare to add 12 years to life of program. This budget rejects that initiative, creates some vague ``reserve'' which may or may not help Medicare, but really uses the money that should go to Medicare for tax cuts instead. 
   This budget does not do enough to extend Social Security. Again, I would agree with those who say we need to adopt Social Security reform to strengthen the Social Security system and assure it is on sound footing. But this budget allows some of the Social Security surpluses to be used for purposes other than Social Security, and, frankly, I do not think that that is wise. 
   Yesterday, the Senate voted by 98-0 to instruct our conferees to use all Social Security surplus funds for Social Security. This conference report, however, creates a ``lockbox'' for Social Security, but then proceeds to remove the lock by allowing any legislation that ``enhances retirement security'' to raid Social Security surplus funds.. 
   Finally, although this conference report protects some important domestic priorities, such as transportation, it cuts other essential but ``unprotected'' programs, such as the border patrol, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, job training programs, child care assistance, head start, and on and on. The strictures of this budget--driven by an overlarge tax cut--may necessitate cuts of 11 percent in many of these important programs. 
   Mr. President, I think our current economic strength has presented us with a unique opportunity--we can save Social Security and Medicare, make important investments in domestic priorities, provide for a strong national defense, and also provide the American people with tax relief. 
   Unfortunately, this conference report, by adopting unrealistic tax cuts, puts at risk all these goals, and may well set us down a path of fiscal irresponsibility that will endanger all our gains of the past few years. I urge my colleague to oppose this conference report.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a representative of the great state of California, it is always a pleasure to learn about and recognize the great achievements made by members of the Law Enforcement community. 
   Today, I am delighted to commend Judge Barry Russell, for selflessly dedicating his personal time, energy, and money to coordinating the Federal Bar Association's Federal Law Enforcement Medal of Valor and Distinguished Service Award Luncheon. 
   Judge Russell has chaired this program for the past ten years, without expecting anything in return. He makes this special effort to ensure that members of the Los Angeles area Federal Law Enforcement community are honored for their selfless acts of valor and exemplary investigative achievements. 
   On behalf of the United States Senate, and all who have benefitted from your inspirational service, I commend you and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the ``Telephone Privacy Act of 1999.'' This legislation would prohibit the recording of a telephone call unless all the parties on the call have given their consent. 
   I am introducing this bill because our nation's telephone privacy laws are confused and in conflict. We need a national law governing telephone privacy so that telephone users have a uniform standard to rely on. 
   Currently, thirty-seven states require only the consent of one party to record a phone call. Fifteen states require the consent of all parties to be taped. This jumbled collection of telephone privacy laws leaves most consumers confused about their rights to protect their phone calls from surreptitious taping. 
   Today, consumers who seek to block surreptitious taping of their phone calls face an incredible burden. The problem is especially acute during interstate calls because the legality of surreptitiously recording a phone call depends on the state where the call is recorded. Thus, when a party makes an interstate call, one's rights may depend on the laws governing taping in other states. 
   The recent well-publicized taping of Monica Lewinsky's phone conversations by Linda Tripp illustrates this problem. Maryland, where Linda Tripp recorded the conversations, is a state that requires the consent of all parties. However, Washington D.C., where Monica Lewinsky lived at the time, requires only one-party consent. Two people living within a half-hours drive from each other should have the same laws apply to them. 
   In practice, any person who wants to protect herself against surreptitious recording must know the telephone privacy laws of other states. Our laws cannot reasonably expect a consumer to have this knowledge. People who make lots of interstate calls might be forced into the position of knowing the telephone privacy laws of all 50 states. 
   Not only will the Telephone Privacy Act of 1999 promote uniformity of laws, it will also create a standard that better protects privacy. The Telephone Privacy Act would require an all-party consent standard for taping phone calls no matter where one lived in the United States. It would end the practice of one-party consent that exists under Federal law and in a number of states. 
   While surreptitious taping has legitimate uses, such as lawful surveillance by the police, our laws should not reward the practice of surreptitious taping. This practice violates individual privacy and offends common decency. 
   Phone calls remain one of the few avenues of communication where people still feel safe enough to have intimate conversations. We should protect this expectation of privacy. If a telephone user intends to tape a phone call, the other party on the line ought to be informed. 
   Moreover, the one-party consent standard is an anachronism. It is inconsistent with other more privacy-respecting provisions of our communication laws. Federal law makes it a felony, for example, for a third party to tap or record a telephone conversation between others. It is also a felony to surreptitiously tape a cellular telephone call. 
   The bill has been carefully drafted so that it does not affect the rights of law enforcement officials to tape or monitor conversations as they are carrying out their duties. 
   Nor does it affect the practice of businesses taping customer calls, as long as the customer is notified at the outset that the call is being taped. It also does not affect the right of people to surreptitiously tape threatening or harassing phone calls.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to protect the medical privacy rights of patients when they talk to their health care insurers or providers. The bill requires health care insurers and providers to obtain patients' ``express consent'' before tape-recording or monitoring conversations. 
   Today, the health insurance industry routinely tape-records and monitors incoming telephone calls of patients with questions about their health insurance coverage. This bill halts that common practice with two simple rules. 
   First, health insurance companies and health care providers must obtain the patient's ``express consent'' before tape-recording or monitoring a conversation. Second, health insurance companies and health care providers must give patients the option not to be tape-recorded or monitored.  
   The bill puts control of medical privacy back where it belongs--in the hands of patients who have no choice but to share personal information with their health insurance and health care providers. 
   The bill protects all patients-- 
   Whether covered by private or public health plans, 
   Whether covered by group, individual, or self-insured health plans, 
   Whether covered by Medicare or Medicaid, 
   Whether covered by Federal health plans, or 
   Whether covered by the Children's Health Insurance Plan. 
   Let me emphasize again who would be subject to the bill--the health insurance and health care industry--a huge industry that necessarily affects all of us. First, the bill would cover communications between patients and health insurers. Second, the bill would cover communications between patients and ``health care providers,'' which includes physicians and other health care professionals. 
   Federal law now requires that only one party must consent to the tape-recording or monitoring of a telephone conversation. In California, state law provides that all parties must consent before a telephone conversation may be tape-recorded. Nearly a dozen other states have adopted similar two-party consent laws. They include Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington. 
   Even two-party consent laws, however, do not adequately address this problem. Health insurance companies tape-record or monitor patients' calls based on the patient's implied consent. Implied consent arises from the patient talking after hearing the health insurer's recording that the call may be tape-recorded or monitored. In this case, courts have held that consent is given implicitly. 
   Consequently, merely changing federal law to a two-party consent rule would not solve the problem. The key requirement must be that the health insurer or health care provider obtains the patient's express consent. Only this change will protect individuals when they call their health insurance provider with questions about their health care coverage. When my office contacted the top 100 health insurance providers in this country, we learned from nearly all who responded that they routinely monitor or tape-record calls received from patients. 
   Let me share with my colleagues some responses that we received. Kaiser Permanente operates in nineteen states and the District of Columbia, and provides care to more than nine million members. Their practice varies from state to state, depending on applicable state laws. 
   Kaiser Permanente may: Monitor randomly selected calls, in which case it may, or may not, notify patients in advance; or tape-record all or randomly selected calls, in which case it may, or may not, notify patients in advance. 
   United HealthCare wrote to me that they did not believe that tape-recording or monitoring calls even presents a privacy issue. Their rationale was that they only randomly tape-record calls and only after advising the caller that they may record the call. 
   Great-West responded that a patient has the option of communicating in writing if the patient does not want a telephone call to be tape-recorded. Let me say simply--that is not good enough for me. Imagine the undue burden the task of writing a letter may place on elderly or seriously ill patients. 
   Despite the two-party consent rule in California, New York Life Care Health Plans, Inc., asserted that no violation of California law occurs without a ``confidential communication.'' Under California state law, the definition of a ``confidential communication'' does not include communications where the parties may expect that the 
   may be recorded. New York Life asserted that, since they told patients that their calls could be monitored, their calls were not confidential calls. 
   New York Life's display of legal bootstrapping shows little, if any, regard for medical privacy rights. Their interpretation of the word ``confidential'' turns its commonly understood meaning on its head! In the minds of most people, what could be more confidential than matters about one's personal health problems? Surely little, if anything. How many of my colleagues in the Senate would say that communications about their health problems with health insurance or health care providers are not confidential? 
   Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area does not give patients any notice that their calls may be monitored. Their Associate General Counsel responded that, in both Maryland and the District of Columbia, telephone communications in the normal course of business do not meet the definition of an ``interception.'' Thus, consent is not required. Although Virginia law considers a telephone to be an ``intercepting device,'' Virginia follows the one-party consent rule. 
   Finger Lakes Blue Cross Blue Shield randomly tape-records calls from patients and only now is setting up a front-end recording to inform patients of that practice. New York requires only one party to consent. 
   None of the health insurance providers who responded to my office gave me a valid reason for tape-recording or monitoring patients' calls. The standard response from health insurers was that they tape-record or monitor patients' calls for so-called ``quality control,'' an ambiguous term at best. Indeed, no one explained what that term means, how tape-recording calls benefits patients, or why tape-recording calls was necessary. 
   Of course, health insurance providers are not the only business entities that tape-record telephone conversations. How many of us realize that when we call for airline tickets, bank account information, mutual fund transfers, or any myriad of other daily concerns, the other party on the telephone line will be tape-recording the conversation? Yet, personal health information is far more personal in nature and, accordingly, entitled to greater protection. It stands alone as uniquely different from other commercial transactions. 
   This bill does not attempt to change the consent rule for other business entities. It would apply only to health insurance and health care providers. Most patients today have almost no choice about their health insurer provider or, increasingly, about their health care provider. In turn, the health insurer may give the patient no option except to submit to tape-recording the conversation. An elderly, or seriously ill patient, is simply not going to object. 
   Admittedly, much disclosure of medical information occurs both with patient consent and for valid medical reasons. For instance, insurance companies receive information from physicians based upon a written consent form signed by the patient at the physician's request. Yet, increasingly, threats to medical health privacy have become less visible and, in that sense, more alarming. Many individuals are left with a false sense of privacy. The potential for misuse of personal health information is real and growing. 
   A fundamental right to medical privacy is embedded in American society. Most Americans presume that telephone conversations about their health problems are confidential. Sadly, they are wrong. 
   Conversations with our health insurance and health care providers often contain deeply personal information, including prescription drugs, psychiatric care, alcohol dependency--the list goes on and on. Surely they deserve protection. Traditionally, Americans have relied upon a confidential relationship with their doctors. 
   Let's restore at least some measure of protection to telephone conversations about our personal health problems. This bill allows health insurance and health care providers to continue their routine practice of tape-recording or monitoring patients' calls--but only with the patient's express consent.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999. 
   Currently, Federal law does not limit access to body armor for individuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence. However, it is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions are more dangerous when they are wearing body armor. 
   Many will recall the violent and horrific shootout in North Hollywood, California, just two years ago. In that incident, two suspects wearing body armor and armed to the teeth, terrorized a community. Police officers on the scene had to borrow rifles from a nearby gunshop to counteract the firepower and protective equipment of these suspects. 
   Another tragic incident involves San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff, for whom this act is named. On November 13, Officer Guelff responded to a distress call. Upon reaching the crime scene, he was fired upon by a heavily armed suspect who was shielded by a kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff died in the ensuing gun-fight. 
   Lee Guelff, James Gueff's brother, recently wrote a letter to me about the need to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:  
   It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in possession of superior firepower ..... But to have to confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to face the same set of deadly circumstances again.  
   I couldn't agree with Lee more. Our laws need to recognize that body armor in the possession of a criminal is an offensive weapon. We need to make sure that our police officers on the streets are adequately supplied with body armor, and that hardened-criminals are deterred from using body armor. 
   The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 has three key provisions to achieve these goals. First, it increases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines. Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor. Third, this bill enables Federal law enforcement agencies to 
   directly donate surplus body armor to local police. 
   I will address each of these three provisions. 
   Enhancing criminal penalties for individuals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime: Criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime should face enhanced penalties because they pose an enhanced threat to police and civilians alike. Assailants shielded by body armor can shoot at the police and civilians with less fear than individuals not so well protected. 
   In the North Hollywood shoot-out, for example, the gunmen were able to hold dozens of officers at bay because of their body armor. This provision will deter the criminal use of body armor, and thus deter the escalation of violence in our communities 
   Making it unlawful for violent felons to wear body armor: This bill makes it a crime for individuals with a violent criminal record to wear body armor. It is unconscionable that criminals can obtain and wear body armor without restriction when so many of our police lack comparable protection. 
   The bill recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where an individual with a brutal history legitimately needs body armor to protect himself or herself. Therefore, it provides a mechanism for violent felons to obtain specific permission from the Secretary of the Treasury to wear body armor. 
   This provision has already been codified into law in California. Several other states are also actively considering legislation to restrict violent felons access to body armor. 
   California police applied the law for the first time earlier this year. Police arrested an individual for wearing body armor who had a violent criminal record. Besides a conviction for second-degree assault in 1993, the suspect is independently facing charges for threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend. He also is facing trial for issuing death threats against security guards at a West Hollywood Nightclub. 
   Direct donation of body armor: The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 speeds up the procedures by which Federal agencies can donate surplus body armor to local police. 
   It is disturbing that so many of our local police officers do not have access to bullet-proof vests. The United States Department of Justice estimates that 25% of State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, approximately 150,000 officers, are not issued body armor. 
   Getting our officers more body armor will save lives. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, greater than 30% of the 1,182 officers 
   killed by guns in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest. 
   Last year, Congress made some inroads into this shortage of body armor by enacting the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998.'' This act established a $25 million annual fund to help local and State police purchase body armor. The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 will provide a further boost to the body armor resources of local and State police departments. 
   This legislation has attracted the support of a broad cross-section of the  law enforcement community. The Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brother of Police Officers, and the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, have all endorsed the legislation. 
   Richard J. Gallo, President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association notes:  
   In the past, FLEOA members have confronted individuals, with prior criminal convictions, wearing body armor and violently resisting arrest. Federal, state and local law enforcement officers, and the public, deserve protection from this, and at the very least, will now know theses felons will receive enhanced sentences for using body armor during the commission of a criminal act.  
   Robert Stewart, Executive Director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, writes:  
   There is a societal obligation to assure the men and women in blue are afforded all the protection they need to maintain public order. Very real fiscal constraints can, however, compromise the ability of local governments to accomplish that critical goal. Hence, NOBLE heartily endorses the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999.  
   I look forward to working with my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle in turning this bill into law.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate amendment to make room in the FY 2000 budget for remedial education funds for schools to end social promotion. 
   My amendment would assume enactment of legislation or competitive grants to school districts to help provide remedial education, after school and summer school courses for needy and low-performing students who are not making passing grades. 
   The purpose is to provide federal incentives and federal help to school districts that abolish and do not allow social promotion and provide interventions to help students meet state achievement standards in the core curriculum. 
   This amendment seeks the endorsement of the Senate for providing remedial education that help students meet achievement standards and help school systems end social promotion.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to sponsor the amendment to increase funding for health research by $2 billion. I do so because we must confront disease as seriously as we confront war. This means we must support our brightest minds, we must have a clear battle plan and we must find the resolve to win the war against disease. 
   This amendment comes on the heels of several previous efforts. First, in 1997, the Senate adopted the Mack-Feinstein amendment 98 to 0, urging Congress to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health over 5 years. Second, last year, Congress gave the National Institutes of Health an increase of 15 percent, funding NIH at $16 billion, the first step toward doubling. Third, on February 2, when we learned that the President's FY 2000 budget proposed only a 2 percent increase, not even enough to keep up with inflation, I wrote the President and urging instead that NIH funding be doubled by 2004. 
   It is a sad comment on our nation that the National Institutes of Health in FY 1999 can only fund 31 percent of grant applications. grants. The National Cancer Institute can only fund 31 percent. This is less than one-third of applications worthy of funding. This low funding rate leaves a vast wealth of knowledge unobtained, unexplored, diseases not cured and not treated. 
   There are many scientifically promising areas of research to which these funds could be devoted. They include gaining a clearer understanding of neural development; improving identification of inherited mutations which contribute to cancer risk; better understanding the interplay between genetics and environmental risk factors; uncovering the causes of over 5,000 known rare diseases affecting over 20 million Americans. 
   In cancer, a special interest of mine, the President requests only a 2 percent increase in FY 2000. NCI Director Dr. Richard Klausner has said that with this minimal increase, NCI would fund 10 percent fewer grants, according to the February 12 Cancer Letter. The National Cancer Advisory Board said this budget will ``seriously damage the National Cancer Program.'' 
   Last September, the Senate Cancer Coalition which I cochair, held a hearing for the Cancer March who said that cancer has reached epidemic proportions and if current rates continue, one quarter of our population will die from cancer. Because of the aging of the population, the incidence of cancer will reaching ``staggering proportions'' by 2010, with increase of 29 percent in incidence and 25 percent in deaths, at a cost of over $200 billion per year. They argued that these compelling statistics call for raising funding for cancer research to $10 billion by 2003, a 20 percent increase each year. 
   The National Cancer Institute has identified 5 promising areas of research in its FY 2000 ``bypass budget.'' They are as follows: (1) Cancer genetics, identify and characterize every major human gene predisposing to cancer. (2) Preclinical models of cancer, study genes and effects of alterations of them in animals ; (3) Diagnostic technologies, to improve the sensitivity of technologies to detect smaller numbers of tumor cells; (4) Better understanding the unique characteristics of cells and why it turns into a cancerous cell. 
   There are still many--too many--diseases for which we have no cure. This year, 1.2 million cases will be diagnosed this year and 563,100 Americans will die. But we spend one-tenth of one cent of every federal dollar on cancer research. The mortality rates for many cancers, like prostate, liver, skin and kidney, continue to increase. AIDS has surpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults; it is now the leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44. Diabetes and asthma are rising. 40,000 infants die each year from devastating diseases. Seven to 10 percent of children are learning disabled. Birth defects affecting function occur in 7% of deliveries or 250,000 of births. 
   The baby boom generation is getting older. Over the 30 years, the number of Americans over age 65 will double. As our population ages, we are seeing an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases like arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, 
   Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. For example, the 4 million people with Alzheimer's Disease today will more than triple, to 14 million, by the middle of the next century--unless we find a way to prevent or cure it. Health care costs will grow exponentially and we see that in part reflected in our budget debates over Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. The total annual cost of Alzheimer's today is $100 billion. By delaying the onset by 5 years, we can save $50 billion annually.  
   In January, we learned from the Institute of Medicine's study, The Unequal Burden of Cancer, that not all segments of our population benefit fully from our advances in understanding cancer. African-American males develop cancer 15 percent more frequently than white males. Stomach and liver cancers are more prevalent among Asian Americans. Cervical cancer strikes Hispanic and Vietnamese American women more than others. Many ethnic minorities experience poorer cancer survival rates than whites. American Indians have the lowest cancer survival rates of any U.S. ethnic group. This study reported that by 2050 there will be no majority population in the U.S. And our hearings of the Cancer Coalition have revealed that minorities are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. 
   Discoveries from health research can reduce health care costs. Cancer costs the economy $104 annually; heart disease, $128 billion; diabetes, $138 billion. Research can cuts costs.. A delay in the onset of stroke could save $15 billion and a delay in the onset of Parkinson's disease could save $3 billion annually. For every $1.00 spent on measles/mumps/rubella vaccine, $21.00 is saved. For the diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine, $29 is saved. Reducing hip fractures, the cause of one in five nursing home admissions can cut nursing home costs by $333 million in one year alone. Delaying the onset of hearing impairment by 5 years in the 30 percent of adults age 65 to 75 who have impairment, can save $15 billion annually. 
   The United States is the world's leader in developing sophisticated treatments for illnesses and diseases, in making important medical discoveries and in improving human life expectancy. Yet, we are spending only three cents of every health care dollar spent in this country on health research. NIH's budget is less than one percent of the federal budget. 
   Funding NIH like a yoyo discourages the medical community from pursuing research. It is like a damper on ideas, on promising lines of scientific pursuit, that get snuffed out while being born. The National Academy of Sciences has said that we are not producing enough research scientists. That is in part due to the lack of assurance that health research has the priority it deserves. 
   We can do better. 
   The public is with us. A 1998 Research America poll found that most Americans support doubling funding for medical research in 5 years and over 60 percent of people in 25 states said they are willing to contribute another $1.00 per week in taxes for health research. 
   Mr. President, when President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the new National Institutes of Health research facility on October 31, 1940 in the middle of World War II, he said, ``We cannot be a strong nation unless we are a healthy nation. And so we must recruit not only men and materials but also knowledge and science in the service of national strength . . . I dedicate [this Institute] to the underlying philosophy of public health; to the conservation of life; to the wise use of the vital resources of the nation.'' That challenge is no less important today as it was in 1940. 
   I believe the public wants us to launch a war on disease and that the public sees medical research as an important priority of their federal government. I urge passage of this amendment.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and Senators LEVIN and BRYAN that will offer consumers protection against unknowingly purchasing a vehicle that has been rebuilt after sustaining substantial damage in an accident. 
   The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has become a major national problem. According to the National Association of Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in accidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than a million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road. 
   In a report to the state Legislature, the California Department of Consumer Affairs found, with respect to California alone ``More than 700,000 structurally damaged and 150,000 salvaged vehicles are returned to streets and highways every year without a safety inspection, and they pose a potential hazard to all of California's twenty million unsuspecting motorists.'' 
   In many cases, ``totaled'' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to conceal prior damage, then resold to consumers without disclosure of the previous condition of the car. The structural integrity of these vehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious injury in an accident is greatly increased. 
   In one case, a teenage who purchased a rebuilt wreck was rendered quadriplegic after an accident in which her vehicle rolled 360 degrees at about five miles an hour. The vehicle had been in a previous accident. It had been badly repaired and then resold without disclosure of its previous condition. The vehicle's roof was replaced after the first accident, but in the subsequent accident, the roof collapsed when the substandard welds failed. 
   In another incident, a mother purchased a Honda Prelude for her daughter's high school graduation. Although only hail damage was reported at the time of sale, the car had actually been totaled in Texas and rebuilt in Arkansas. The repair shop acknowledged that they had spent only about $3,000 on repairs, despite an insurance company's estimate of over $10,000 worth of damage. The inadequate repair resulted in the collapse of the right front suspension inflicting a debilitating head injury on the driver. 
   In yet another case of fraud, Jimmy Dolan bought a used Toyota from a dealership in Clovis, California. The odometer had only 19,000 miles on it and he was told the car was like new and in original condition. In fact, that was untrue. The previous owner had been involved in a serious accident that required $8,700 in repairs. After a series of problems with the car, the original owner took it back to the dealership and traded it in. The dealership then resold the car to Jimmy Dolan for almost $14,000. 
   After only a minor accident, Mr. Dolan found out the truth about his car. He managed to trace the car back to the original owner who described the extent of the damage. Despite having full knowledge of the vehicle's history, the dealership refused to give Dolan a refund. Eventually, he had to file a civil lawsuit to recoup his losses. 
   These are just three cases in which serious physical and financial losses were inflicted on innocent victims who unknowingly purchased a vehicles that had sustained major damage. 
   The bill that I am introducing will address the problem of rebuilt wrecks by: providing nationwide written disclosure for every vehicle sale of previous salvage and major damage; providing widespread coverage for all vehicles including vehicles of any age or value, motor homes, pickups, and motorcycles; allowing states to maintain existing salvage laws; strengthening the Federal rebuilt vehicle database to promote instant access to vehicle accident histories for consumers, dealers, and law enforcement; requiring certification by a qualified repair facility of the proper repair of any salvage vehicle before it is returned to the road. 
   This bill has been endorsed by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, Iowa, and Michigan. In a letter of support, Attorneys General Blumenthal, Lockyer, and Miller state that this bill ``has strong disclosure requirements that will put consumers on notice before they agree to buy a car concerning any prior collision or flood damage.'' 
   They also state ``We especially appreciate that this bill tracks the Resolution adopted in 1994 by the National Association of Attorneys General. That Resolution calls for the strong national standards and remedies that are provided for in this bill.''

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, introduced by the Senators from Utah and Montana. This bill addresses what is in my opinion a long-standing oversight in the tax code, and will create a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. 
   Indeed, this legislation is necessary because, despite a remarkable record of spurring innovation and success--it is regarded by many in the business world as the single most effective tool government has to help business--the 18 year old research and experimentation tax credit inexplicably remains a temporary provision of the tax code. 
   Economists have linked the tax credit to steady economic growth and productivity. Industry leaders have credited it with spawning private enterprise investments. It is especially important to high tech and emerging growth industries that are driving our economy. And, because it creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and experimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back the benefit of the credit. 
   Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and experimentation tax credit has remained a temporary tax provision requiring regular renewal. The President's budget request for FY2000 has, once again, only requested a one year extension of the credit. 
   In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four instances the research credit had expired before being renewed retroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six months. 
   This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business investment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, computers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will provide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy. 
   Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California economy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because of the critical role played by innovative research and development efforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries. 
   Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-over $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. Much of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake long-rage and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies. 
   To give just one example: Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, California, has expanded from a start-up company in 1990 to a company with over $50 million in revenue and 175 employees by the end of last year. Pericom is ranked by Deloitte Touche as one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley. And, according to a letter I received from the Vice President of Finance and administration at Pericom, utilization of the research credit has been key to their success, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand their technology base. 
   I will enter into the RECORD letters I have received from several California companies regarding the benefits of the research and experimentation tax credit. 
   The new jobs created at companies like Pericom, Genetech, Intel, Lam, and Xylinx, along with a host of others, through utilization of the research and experimentation tax credit also create additional tax revenue, paying back the benefit of the tax credit. 
   Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology development, and if we want to replicate the success of companies like Pericom across the country it is crucial that we create a permanent research and experimentation tax credit. 
   According to a 1988 study conducted by the national accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP by nearly $58 billion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The productivity gains from a permanent extension will allow workers throughout the nation to earn higher wages. 
   Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or environmental design, research and development are critical ingredients for fueling the process of economic growth. 
   Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for U.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace. 
   Right now American biotechnology is the world leader in developing effective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical technologies for the twenty-first century. With other countries heavily-subsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. companies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to stay on top of breakthrough developments. 
   Most biotech research and development efforts are long term projects spanning five to ten years, sometimes more. The uncertainty created by the temporary and sporadic extensions is incompatible with the basic needs of biotech innovation--providing companies with a stable time frame to plan, launch, and conduct research activities. In the case of a promising but financially intensive research project, such unpredictability can make the difference as to whether the project is completed or abandoned. 
   Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in the past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how research and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, and even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from breakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to cleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax credit. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the research and experimentation tax credit has proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs, and in growing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled by remaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the uncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to create a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was troubled by a recent report in Roll Call which details a plan by House Republicans to devise a media campaign to support their efforts to shut down the government in order to restrict census sampling. I ask that this article be printed in the RECORD at the end of my statement. 
   Mr. President, the census is a critical issue for my State and for the nation. The census count determines how nearly 200 billion of federal funds are allocated. An inaccurate count means that these federal funds are misallocated. 
   According to a recent study by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, the 1990 census undercounted the United States population by about 4 million people--or approximately 1.6 percent of the entire population. 
   Many states had undercounts above the national average. California's undercount was 2.7 percent; New Mexico's was 3.1 percent; Texas' 2.8 percent; and Arizona's 2.4 percent, just to name a few. 
   According to the GAO, 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula. Those funds are used for our schools, health care facilities, and transit systems. California was the most harmed because of the 1990 census undercount, losing nearly 2.2 billion in federal funds, or 2,660 per person missed. 
   In 1998 alone, California lost 198 million in federal funds for Medicaid; 9.4 million for foster care; 3.2 million for Social Security; 1.9 million for child care and development; and 1.1 million for vocational training. Millions more in federal dollars for adoption assistance, prevention and treatment of substance abuse, 
   highway planning and construction, and other programs did not flow to California because of the inaccurate census. 
   Other states also suffer: Texas lost almost 1 billion because of the 1990 undercount, and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana each lost over $100 million. 
   Moreover, all areas and groups are not undercounted at the same rate, and some members of our society are more likely to be missed than others. According to the GAO, 5.7 percent of African Americans were not counted in the 1990 Census. Nor were 5 percent of Latinos and 4.5 percent of Native Americans. Of the 835,000 people undercounted in California, most were minorities. Nearly half the net undercount--47 percent--were Hispanic. Twenty-two percent were African-American and 8 percent were Asian. 
   Such differences in census coverage introduce inequities in political representation and in the distribution of federal funds. Because Hispanics, African-Americans, and other minority groups had a larger undercount than whites in the 1990 Census--as in prior censuses--minorities and the communities in which they live have been disadvantaged in government programs in which population is an important factor in fund allocation. 
   This is an issue of basic fairness. Every American should be counted. And unless we can provide the Census Bureau with our support for an accurate census, and do so without any political intervention, then we run the risk of doing a grave injustice to our citizens. 
   Since the failed 1990 population count, the Census Bureau has worked with experts to design a more accurate census for 2000. The National Academy of Sciences, in three separate reports, concluded that the key to improving accuracy in the census is the use of sound statistical methods to count those missed during the conventional ``head count.'' This involves detailed ``statistical sampling'' to determine the characteristics of those who are missed by the head count. 
   But for partisan reasons, some in Congress evidently prefer to ignore the expert advice and plan to shut down part of the government rather than see an accurate count. They argue that sampling is unnecessary. Unfortunately, during the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal the undercount was 6.5 percent for Sacramento, California; 3.1 percent for the Menominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin; and 9.1 percent for the entire state of South Carolina. 
   The magnitude of such undercounts and the implications for the 2000 Census that fails to correct the problem are particularly great for states with large and diverse populations, such as Florida, Texas, Arizona, New York, California and many others. 
   The Supreme Court has affirmed that sampling is required for purposes other than apportionment if `feasible'. 
   The census should not be about politics. And Mr. President, I will oppose any efforts to include any restrictions on the ability of the Bureau of the Census to conduct the most accurate census possible. Anything else would simply be unfair.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to enable the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate the additive, MTBE, from gasoline. The goal in this bill, as in my previous three bills (S. 266, S. 267 and S. 268) is to eliminate MTBE from drinking water. 
   Under this bill, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could waive the two percent reformulated gasoline oxygenate requirement of the Clean Air Act in any state if gasoline with less than two percent or with no oxygenates does not result in greater emissions than emissions from reformulated gasoline containing two percent oxygenates. 
   MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether is added to gasoline by some refiners in response to federal Clean Air Act requirements that areas with the most serious air pollution problems use reformulated or cleaner-burning gasoline. This federal law requires that this gasoline contain two percent by weight oxygenates. MTBE has been the oxygenate of choice by some refiners. 
   The Clean Air Act's reformulated gas requirements have no doubt helped reduce emissions throughout the United States, but the two percent oxygenate requirement has imposed limitations on the level of flexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to states and limited the flexibility of refiners in making clean gasoline. 
   I am very troubled to learn from a March 16 article in the Sacramento Bee that the gasoline refiners were aware  of MTBE's dangers long before it was approved for use in California. Researchers in Maine pointed out MTBE's harms in 1986. The Bee reporter, after studying industry research documents, quotes a 1992 industry scientific paper: ``MTBE plumes are expected to move faster and further than benzene plumes emanating from a gasoline spill. Moreover, the solubility of MTBE is nearly 25 times that of benzene and its concentration in gasoline will be approximately 10 times greater.'' 
   A spokesman for the Oxygenated Fuels Association is also quoted as saying that the chemical properties that make MTBE problematic in water ``were widely known'' in the 1980s. 
   Bob Reeb, of the Association of California Water Agencies, is quoted as saying, had they known of MTBE's adverse effects, ``We would have fought like hell to keep it out of gasoline. It appears to be a classic case of placing corporate profits above public health.'' 
   The Sacramento Bee article is appended to my statement. 
   A number of authorities have called attention to MTBE's harm and have called for prompt action. 
   The American Medical Association House of Delegates and the American Public Health Association approved resolutions calling for a moratorium on the use of MTBE in 1994--1994! 
   The University of California released a five-volume study in November 1998, and recommended phasing out MTBE. UC found that ``there are significant risks and costs associated with water contamination due to the use of MTBE.'' The University of California study says: ``If MTBE continues to be used at current levels and more sources become contaminated, the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially groundwater basins, will increase. Severity of water shortages during drought years will be exacerbated.'' 
   The UC study says that oil companies can make cleaner-burning gasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE and that they should be given the flexibility to do that. The UC study found that ``there is no significant additional air quality benefit to the use of oxygenates such as MTBE in reformulated gasoline, relative to'' California's reformulated gasoline formula. 
   The California Environmental Protection Agency on February 19, 23, 24 held two public hearings on the University of California report. A total of 109 people spoke at the hearings and 987 written comments (including mine) were submitted as of today, and the comment period is still open. Of the 109 speakers, 12 supported continued use of MTBE. Cal EPA is still reading the written comments.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the amendment before the body is a combination amendment with Senator DORGAN. It is remedial education and a report card amendment. He will speak on the report card provisions. My amendment is on social promotion and remedial education. I hope this is one area this body can agree on; that is, the practice, formal or informal, of promoting youngsters from grade to grade when they sometimes don't even attend school and often fail classes. That is not the way to educate young people in the United States of America. 
   Increasingly, States are doing away with the practice of social promotion and providing standards and enabling school districts to implement those standards in the basic core curriculum--reading, writing, math, and social sciences. 
   This amendment tries to provide Federal incentives and Federal help for the remedial education that is necessary to make the abolition of the policy of social promotion a realistic possibility. 
   So it would authorize $500 million to school districts for remedial education for afterschool, summer school, intensive intervention for students who are failing or at risk of failing. As a condition of receiving the funds, the school districts would have to adopt a policy that prohibits social promotion. District would have to require students to meet academic standards. And they would test students for achievement. 
   Now, I think the problem is clear. This course of least resistance, of simply promoting youngsters, has really led to declining test scores, failure, frustration, and certainly the inability of many to even fill out an employment application to be able to get a job after graduation.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. 
   So I feel very strongly that the linchpin of reform of the public education system is the elimination of social promotion. But if you eliminate it and you do not provide any help for failing students, it will not work. So this is a small authorization, $500 million to help those students and not just leave them languishing. I very much hope that both sides of the aisle will vote for it. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover medically necessary reconstructive surgery for congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease. 
   This bill is modeled on a new California law and responds to the growing incidence of denials of coverage by insurance, often managed care. Despite physicians' judgment that surgery is often medically necessary, too many plans are labeling it ``cosmetic surgery.'' The American Medical News calls the HMO's response that these surgeries are cosmetic as, ``a classic health plan word game. .....'' 
   Testifying before the California Assembly Committee on Insurance, Dr. Henry Kawamoto put it well. He said:  
   It used to be that if you were born with something deforming, or were in an accident and had bad scars, the surgery performed to fix the problem was considered reconstructive surgery. Now, insurers of many kinds are calling it cosmetic surgery and refusing to pay for it.  
   The Los Angeles Times reported on July 9, 1997, ``There has been a virtual wipeout of coverage to repair the appearance of children whose looks are affected by illness, congenital abnormalities or trauma.'' 
   Similarly, the New York University Physician reported in their spring 1998 issue:  
   Before the advent of managed care, repairing abnormalites was considered reconstructive surgery and insurance companies reimbursed for the medical, hospital and surgical costs of their rehabilitation. But in today's reconfigured medical reimbursement system, many insurance companies and managed care organizations will not pay for reconstruction of facial deformities because it is deemed a ``cosmetic'' and not a ``functional'' repair.  
   This bill is endorsed by the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the American College of Surgeons, the American Association of Pediatric Plastic Surgeons, the American Society of Craniofacial Surgery, the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction. 
   The children who face refusals to pay for surgery are the true evidence that this bill is needed. 
   Hanna Gremp, a 6-year old from my own state of California, was born with a congenital birth defect, called bilateral microtia, the absence of an inner ear. Once the first stage of the surgery was complete, the Gremp's HMO denied the next surgery for Hanna. They called the other surgeries ``cosmetic'' and not medically necessary. 
   Michael Hatfield, a 19-year old from Texas, who has gone through similar struggles. He was born with a congenital birth defect, that is known as a midline facial cleft. The self-insured plan his parents had only paid for a small portion of the surgery which reconstructed his nose. The HMO also refused to pay any part of the surgery that reconstructed his cheekbones and eye sockets. The HMO considered some of these surgeries to be ``cosmetic.'' 
   Cigna Health Care denied coverage for surgery to construct an ear for a little California girl born without an ear and only after adverse press coverage reversed its position saying that, ``It was determined that studies have show some functional improvement following surgery.'' 
   Qual-Med, another California HMO, denied coverage for reconstructive surgery for a little boy without an ear, a condition called microtia, and after only many appeals and two years delay, authorized it. 
   The bill uses medically-recognized terms to distinguish between medically necessary surgery and cosmetic surgery. It defines medically necessary reconstructive surgery as surgery ``performed to correct or repair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to (1) improve functions; or (2) give the patient a normal appearance, to the extent possible, in the judgment of the physician performing the surgery.'' The bill specifically excludes cosmetic surgery, defined as ``surgery that is performed to alter or reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve appearance.'' 
   Examples of conditions for which surgery might be medically necessary are the following: cleft lips and palates, burns, skull deformities, benign tumors, vascular lesions, missing pectoral muscles that cause chest deformities, Crouson's syndrome (failure of the mid-face to develop normally), and injuries from accidents. 
   The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has released a survey on reconstructive surgery, concluding that 53.5 percent of surgeons surveyed have had pediatric patients who in the last two years were denied coverage for reconstructive surgery. Of those same surgeons surveyed whose pediatric patients were totally or partially denied coverage, 74 percent had patients denied for initial procedures and 53 percent denied for subsequent procedures. 
   Another reason for this bill is that only 17 out of 50 states have state legislation which requires insurance coverage for children's deformities and congenital defects. My own state, California, passed legislation in 1998 requiring insurance plans to cover medically necessary reconstructive surgery, and on September 23, 1998 it was signed by former Governor Pete Wilson. This bill was enacted after many sad personal stories, and hours of testimony were presented to the state legislators. 
   This bill is an effort to address yet one more development in the health insurance industry that almost daily is creating new hassles when people try to get coverage for the plan they pay for every month. 
   We need our body parts to function and fortunately modern medicine today often make that happen. We can restore, repair and make whole parts which by fate, accident, genes, or whatever, do not perform as they should. I hope this bill can make that happen.

   Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will plug a gaping loophole in our gun laws and protect us all from the deadly, tragic violence of assault weapons. 
   This bill is not about gun control. This bill is not about politics. And this bill is not about partisanship. But this bill is about stopping foreign manufacturers from skirting the laws that already apply to companies within our borders. 
   The bill we introduce today will address, finally, the loophole in the law that allows foreign manufacturers to flood our shores with high capacity ammunition clips, while domestic manufacturers are prohibited from selling those very clips. 
   Our bill bans future importation of all ammunition clips with a capacity of greater than 10 rounds. 
   Mr. President, this legislation would not ban the sale or possession of clips already in circulation. And the domestic manufacture of these clips is already illegal for most purposes. Under current law, U.S. manufacturers are already prohibited from manufacturing large capacity clips for sale to the general public, but foreign companies continue to do so. 
   As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was not our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high capacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the importation of clips already on their way to this country. Instead, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has allowed millions of foreign clips into this country, with no true method of determining date of manufacture. 
   In fact, between March and August of last year alone, BATF approved more than 8 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. 
   Many of these clips were surely manufactured after 1994, but ATF has no way to determining whether or not this is true. As a result, they simply must take the word of the exporting company or country. 
   The clips come from at least 20 different countries, from Austria to Zimbabwe. 
   The clips approved during this one short period accounted for almost 128 million rounds of ammunition--and every round represents the potential for taking one human life. 
   These clips come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, 90, or even 250 rounds per clip. 
   Twenty thousand clips of 250-rounds came from England; 
   Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy; 
   Five thousand clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic. 
   And the list goes on, and on. 
   Mr. President, 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing of other men, women and children. 
   It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often used for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling. It is time to plug this loophole and close our borders to these tools of death and destruction. Our domestic manufacturers are complying with the law, and we must now force foreign manufacturers to comply as well. 
   In April of last year, President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Rubin closed one loophole in the 1994 ban on assault weapons by blocking further imports of modified semiautomatic assault weapons. However, the Department of Justice advises me that the President lacks the legal authority to take the same action regarding large-capacity clips. As a result, we must take legislative action to stop further imports of these killer clips. 
   In closing our borders to these high capacity clips, we will not put an end to all incidents of gun violence. But we will limit the destructive power of that violence. We will not stop every troubled child who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we can limit the tools that a child can find to carry out the act. 
   Each of us has been touched in some way by the devastating effects of gun violence. Each of our states has faced unnecessary tragedy and senseless destruction as a result of the high-powered, high-capacity weapons falling into the hands of gangs, drive-by shooters, cop killers, grievance killers, and yes, even children. My own state of California has too often been the subject of national attention due to incidents of gun violence. 
   Just a few short months ago in Oakland, California, officer James Williams became yet another example of what can happen when a troubled teenager gets hold of a high-capacity weapon. Soon after midnight on a Sunday early this New Year, Officer Williams and two colleagues found themselves searching the side of the road for a gun that had reportedly been thrown by suspects involved in a recent chase. Officer Williams had been out of the police academy for only eleven weeks, and was undoubtedly looking forward to getting home to see his three children. 
   But tragically, James Williams never made it home that night. While Williams searched for the lost gun, a 19-year-old man stood on the freeway overpass above and fired the shots 
   that would change Williams' family forever. Using a Hungarian made AK-47 with a Chinese made high-capacity ammunition clip, the teenager fired many shots--too many. 
   One Telfon-coated bullet from this high capacity clip fatally wounded officer Williams, tearing through his bulletproof vest and leaving his three children without a father. And that lone bullet tore through more than just James Williams' body armor. It tore through the very fabric of his entire family, and its damage cannot be repaired. 
   To many, Officer Williams has now become just another statistic in the fight against gun violence. But he is more than that to his family, and he must mean more than that to us, as well. We must fight to end the tragedies faced by so many families across this nation. We must fight to give meaning to the countless lives that have been extinguished before their time. 
   One phenomenon which has most tragically revealed the problems presented by these high capacity clips has been the use of these clips by youngsters to kill other youngsters. 
   In Springfield, Oregon, a 15-year-old boy used a 30-round clip to kill two of his fellow students and wound 22 others. 
   In Jonesboro, Arkansas, one of two boys carried a Universal carbine equipped with a 15-round killer clip. Firing every one of those 15 bullets, the boy helped his partner kill five people and wound 10 more. 
   And just last December in Los Angeles, 27 year old LAPD officer Bryan Brown was shot and killed by an assailant with a rifle and double magazine. Following the tragic shooting, Officer Brown's 7 year old son asked, ``Why did my daddy have to die?'' 
   Mr. President, Officer Brown and Officer Williams gave their lives to protect the lives of so many others, and their children have now been left without a father. We must do what we can to make the lives of our law enforcement officers more safe. 
   And we must also do what we can to bring foreign companies into compliance with the same laws we impose on companies here at home. The only way we can accomplish these goals is to pass this simple bill. 
   In 1994, we fired a first shot in the fight against assault weapons and killer clips by banning the assault weapons most commonly used in crime and to kill police officers. I am proud to have authored that legislation, and many of my colleagues who joined me in that fight remember how hard we worked to make a difference. Our opponents told  us our efforts would accomplish nothing--but they were wrong. They told us our efforts would infringe upon the rights of innocent gun owners--again, they were wrong. 
   In fact, recent statistics prove that the assault weapons ban is working to reduce crime and to save the lives of law enforcement officers and countless others. 
   A recent study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms showed that compared to other guns, the use of assault weapons in crimes is rapidly falling. In fact, while assault weapons accounted for more than 6% of the guns traced in crimes before the 1994 crime bill went into effect, these guns now account for less than 2.4% of those traces. 
   But it has now become apparent that the 1994 ban on assault weapons left open certain loopholes. Through those loopholes fall the lives of courageous police officers like Officer James Williams. 
   There is no convincing reason to allow foreign manufacturers to circumvent the ban on assault weapons while domestic manufacturers comply. And there is no convincing reason to keep an unlimited supply of these clips flowing onto our shores and into the hands of American criminals. 
   The ban on assault weapons is working to save lives and to keep us safe. But we must act to fix those loopholes which still remain. Last year we came close--we offered this bill as an amendment on short notice and lost by only a few votes. I am confident that once my colleagues understand what this bill does--and more importantly what it does not do--we will win our fight. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to voting on this issue in the near future.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which does two things. One of them is it deals with the practice, either formal or informal, of social promotion, and authorizes a remedial program of $500 million a year for a program of competitive grants. 
   The second part has to do with school report cards. 
   Senator DORGAN will be speaking on the second half, and I will address my comments to the first part. 
   This amendment would authorize $500 million a year from the year 2000 to 2004 for competitive grants to school districts to help provide remedial education for afterschool and summer school courses, for low-performing students who are not making passing grades. 
   Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to provide Federal incentives and Federal help to those school districts that abolish and/or do not allow social promotion. As a condition of receiving these funds, school districts would have to adopt a policy prohibiting social promotion for students; require that all K through 12 students meet minimum achievement levels in the core curriculum defined as subjects such as reading and writing, language arts, mathematics, social sciences, including history, and science; test student achievement in meeting standards at certain benchmark grades to be determined by the States for advancement to the next grade; and, finally, provide remedial education for students who fail to meet achievement standards including tutoring, mentoring, summer, before-school and after-school programs. 
   School districts would be authorized to use funds to provide academic instruction to enable students to meet academic achievement standards by implementing early intervention strategies or alternative instructional strategies; strengthening learning by hiring certified teachers to reduce class sizes, providing professional development, and using proven instructional practices and curricula aligned to State achievement standards; providing extended learning time such as afterschool and summer school; and developing intensive instructional intervention strategies for students who fail to meet State achievement standards. The amendment also addresses the special needs of children with disabilities by allowing school districts to follow the child's individualized education plan. 
   Why do we need this amendment? Perhaps nothing better describes why we need this amendment than an article which appeared in the Los Angeles Times five days ago about the largest school system in the United States--California's--and I want to read the headline: ``California Ranks Second to Last in U.S. Reading Test.''  
   California ranks second to last among 39 States in a new Federal assessment of fourth grade reading skills. The study revealed Thursday that only 20 percent of the students are considered proficient readers.  
   Mr. President, California has 5.6 million students, more than the population of 36 other States, and only 20 percent of them are reading proficiently at the fourth grade level. 
   That is an incredible statement of what the practice of social promotion has done. 
   I truly believe that the linchpin to educational reform is the elimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are failing are simply promoted to the next grade in the hopes that someday, somewhere they will learn. 
   This practice alone, I believe, after visiting literally dozens of schools, is the main reason for the failure in the quality of public education today. It is largely responsible, in my view, for its decline. 
   Achievement standards must be established--and enforced. To promote youngsters when they are failing to learn has produced a generation that is below standard and high school graduates who can't read or write, count change in their pockets, or fill out an employment application. It is that bad. And California is just about the worst. 
   It is such a shame to hand a high school diploma to a youngster whom you know cannot fill out an employment application for a job. In my State, a state that is restructuring its economy and seen the emergence of a new high-skilled, high-tech work base, this means doom for the ability of these youngsters to sustain themselves with gainful and fulfilling employment in the future. 
   This same article, discussing this assessment of reading skills, also shows that 52 percent of our fourth graders scored below the basic level, meaning they failed to even partially master basic skills. 
   The news wasn't much better for California's eighth graders, who ranked 33rd out of 36 States, and only 22 percent were proficient readers. In December 1998, a study by the Education 
   Trust ranked California last in the percent of young adults with a high school diploma--in other words, students are not even finishing and getting their diploma--37th in SAT scores, and 31st of 41 States in eighth grade math. Nearly half of all students entering the California State University system require remedial classes in math or English or both. 
   The news is also grim nationally. I start out with California to say that this all begins right at home. But the news is also grim throughout the rest of the United States where our students are falling far behind their international counterparts. The lowest 25 percent of Japanese and South Korean eighth graders outperform the average American student. In math and science, United States 12th grade students fell far behind students in other industrialized countries, which is especially troubling when we consider the skills that will be required to stay ahead in the 21st century. United States 12th graders were significantly outperformed by 14 countries and only performed better than students in Cyprus and South Africa. We scored last in physics and next to last in mathematics. 
   What is social promotion? Simply stated, social promotion is the practice, either formal or informal, of a school's advancing a student from one grade to the next regardless of that student's academic achievement. In some cases, it is even regardless of whether they attend school or not. It is a practice which misleads our students, their parents and the public. 
   The American Federation of Teachers agrees. Let me quote from their September 19, 1997, study:  
   Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count; for teachers who must face students who know that teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the business community and colleges that must spend millions of dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the Nation.  
   That is well said. But merely ending social promotion and retaining students in the same grade will not solve the problem. We cannot just let them languish without direction in a failing system. Instead, we must provide ongoing remedial work, specialized tutoring, afterschool programs, and summer school. All must be used intensively and consistently, and that is what this amendment is designed to create. It is designed to create both the incentive and also the help to accomplish this. 
   I know it can work. Last June, I led a delegation of California leaders to Chicago. We saw a dominantly poor, dominantly minority school district turned around, social promotion abolished, and the remediation, summer school, and tutoring put in place. And now test scores and grades are improving. 
   How widespread is this practice, ubiquitous as it is? It is widespread. Although there are no hard data on the extent of the practice, authorities in schools and out of schools know it is happening, and in some districts it is standard operating procedure. In fact, 4  in 10 teachers reported that their schools automatically promote students when they reach the maximum age for their grade level. And the September 19, 1998, AFT teacher study says social promotion is ``rampant.'' 
   It found most school districts use vague criteria for passing and retaining students. They lack explicit policies of social promotion, but they have an implicit practice of social promotion, including a loose and vague criteria for advancing students to the next grade. And they view holding students back as a policy of last resort and often put explicit limits on retaining students. 
   Also the study found that only 17 States have standards--only 17 States have standards in the four core learning disciplines: English, math, social studies, and science. Only these four have standards which are well grounded in content and are clear enough to be used, says the AFT study. 
   In July of last year, I wrote to 500 California school districts and asked about their policies on social promotion. I must tell you, their responses are vague and often misleading, and they include the following: Some school districts say they don't have a specific policy. Some say they simply figure what is in the best interests of the student. Some say teachers provide recommendations, but final decisions on retention can be overridden by parents. And some simply just promote youngsters, regardless of failing grades, nonattendance, or virtually anything else. In short, the policies are all over the place. 
   Last year, in California the legislature passed and the Governor signed into law a bill to end social promotion in public education, a giant step forward. In California now, this could affect fully half of California's students because 3 million children in California perform below levels considered proficient for their grade level. The grant funds authorized in this amendment can be very helpful in providing ongoing remedial and specialized learning and provide necessary help for these 3 million children in my State, and the millions of children in other States as well. 
   President Clinton called for ending social promotion in his last two State of the Union speeches. Last year, he said: ``We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.'' 
   I will never forget, in 1990, when I was running for Governor of California and I appeared before the California teachers association, I said we must end social promotion, and I was roundly booed. How things change. We now have the President of the United States, and a Democrat to boot, saying we must end social promotion. 
   I believe just as firmly in 1999 as I did in 1990 that the practice of social promotion is the Achilles heel of public education in the United States of America. 
   The seven States that have a policy in place which ties promotion to State-level standards today are California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. I really want to give them my kudos and say congratulations and right on. 
   I mentioned that the Chicago public schools have ditched social promotion. After their new policy was put in place in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 students in Chicago failed tests in the third, sixth, eighth, and ninth grades, and then went to mandatory summer school. Chicago's School Superintendent Paul Vallas has called social promotion ``educational malpractice.'' He said from now on his schools' only product will be student achievement. What welcome words those are. 
   In my own State, the San Diego School Board in February adopted requirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate grade-level performance, and they will require all students to earn a C overall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and for high school graduation. 
   For example, San Diego schools are requiring that their eighth graders who do not pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer school. 
   Let me conclude. A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college professors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a student has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63 percent of employers and 76 percent of professors said the diploma is not a guarantee that a graduate can read, write, or do basic math. What a failure. 
   I first got into this because I also serve on the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. Every year I had California chief executive officers, particularly in high tech companies, come in and say: ``We can't find high school graduates we can hire. Please increase the quota of people from foreign countries who can come to us as temporary workers and work for us, because we can't find qualified Americans.'' What a condemnation. 
   California employers tell me consistently that applicants are unprepared for work and the companies have to provide basic training to make them employable. High-tech companies say they have to recruit abroad. For example, last year MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills to their employees. On December 17, a group called California Business for Education Excellence announced they were organizing a major effort to reform public education. These major constituencies--the California Business Roundtable, the California Manufacturers Association, the American Electronics Association, companies like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Pacific Bell--had to organize because they see firsthand the results of a lagging school system. 
   So I offer this amendment today. It can provide the money to help teachers teach and students learn. It is estimated that this year the budget will have $4 billion more in it for public education. I say let's authorize the expenditure of $500 million for the kind of remedial and summer school programs that in fact can help us abolish social promotion and really have excellence and accountability in both our teachers and our students. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Dakota, because I think, between us, we really have struck at the linchpin of reform. 
   One is in the report card situation, to provide an ability for every parent to know some of the basics about the school that his or her children attend, and to be able to make some judgments on their own whether that child is in the best learning environment. And what the report card could do is spur competition, I think, I say to the Senator, among students, among schools,  among school districts, if they have a way to compare one to the other. 
   When you were talking about Cannon Ball, North Dakota, I was thinking about Los Angeles, and going into a school that had 5,000 students K through sixth grade. Everything was in shifts. You can imagine the cacophony of sounds with 5,000 small children in this school. I had never seen a school this size before. 
   As we debate social promotion, I am troubled by the size of some schools. I have read the views of educational experts and what they said about the size of the school. I read they advised that elementary schools be no bigger than 350 students to have that teacher-student quality relationship; middle schools, 750 students; and high schools maybe a maximum of 1,200 students. 
   Because of the lack of money and the inability to do some of these things, schools just diminish their quality. Like you, I am very hopeful that there will be an additional amount of $4 billion for public education in this year s budget. I think the American people want it, I think our students need it. 
   I just want you to know that I am very pleased to join with you on this amendment. I hope it can stay in. I hope it will survive conference. I hope people will realize that we have to make major structural changes in public education. Certainly a report card for schools to benefit parents, the elimination of social promotion, and the provision of remedial programs and summer school can help. Ongoing and consistent programs, in which children can be brought up to their grade level, are critical to helping these students learn and become productive citizens and are critical to ending this ``educational malpractice.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Feinstein-Dorgan amendment.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Public Lands and Recreation Investment Act of 1999. This bill will provide funding for two of our nation's most important conservation and recreation programs--the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act--that have been woefully underfunded in recent years. 
   Every year, the Federal government collects about $4 billion from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. These leases have detrimental impacts on our environment, so it is fitting that in 1965 Congress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This fund is authorized to use $900 million annually in Outer Continental Shelf lease payments to purchase park and recreation lands in or near our national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands. The fund also is supposed to provide grants to states, so that state and local governments may purchase parklands and recreation facilities. 
   Acquisition of these lands protects some of our nation's most crucial natural resources, including key watersheds that provide drinking water to millions of Americans, and vital wildlife habitat for endangered species. Public lands also provide recreation opportunities for millions of Americans, and open spaces in increasingly crowded urban areas. Over the years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected lands in all 50 States, including such special places as Yellowstone National Park, the Everglades, and the California Desert. 
   Unfortunately, the Land and Water Conservation Fund's tremendous promise has not yet been fulfilled. Last year Congress and the President provided only $328 million of the $900 million collected by the Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition. The rest went back into the Treasury, for deficit reduction or spending on other programs. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has collected over $21 billion since its creation in 1965, but only $9 billion has been spent. Unappropriated balances in the fund now total $13 billion, and they are growing every year. 
   In the meantime, a huge backlog has developed in the federal acquisition of environmentally sensitive land. The U.S. Department of Interior estimates that the cost of acquiring inholdings in national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands now totals over $10 billion. In addition, the federal government receives about $600 million in Land and Water Conservation Fund requests each year. 
   The funding shortfall has been particularly difficult for State and local governments. For the last several years, Congress has provided no funding for the stateside grants portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or to The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, a separate program that provides for rehabilitation of recreation facilities and improved recreation programs in our nation's cities. 
   Last month President Clinton proposed the Lands Legacy Initiative, which would provide $1 billion from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in fiscal year 2000. The President's initiative would expand our nation's public lands, provide grants to states for land acquisition, promote open space and ``smart growth,'' improve wildlife habitat, and protect farmland from development. The Lands Legacy Initiative is a good first step, but our commitment to public lands should not be a one-year deal. 
   Therefore, I am pleased that other Senators have introduced bills that would provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, as well as a number of other programs. I support Senator BOXER's bill, the Permanent Protection for America's Resources Act, and I look forward to working with her and with all Senators interested in public lands, coastal restoration, and wildlife protection. 
   If Senator BOXER's bill does not move, however, the bill that I am introducing today is a moderate alternative that I believe will enjoy broad  bipartisan support. The bill is important for three reasons. First, it focuses exclusively on guaranteed annual funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. I want to ensure that the Land and Water Conservation Fund remains a top priority for Congress regardless of other important environmental programs that are funded. We cannot lose sight of how important the Land and Water Conservation Fund is to America's conservation and recreation efforts. 
   Second, the bill makes no changes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund that impede the federal government's ability to acquire land. Two bills currently pending in Congress would restrict federal land purchases to inholdings within existing parks only, and require prior Congressional authorization even for small acquisitions that have traditionally been approved through the appropriations process. These bills also require that two-thirds of the federal funding be spent east of the 100th meridian. 
   Under these terms, projects such as the Headwaters acquisition, where the federal government and State of California bought the largest ancient redwood stand in private hands, would have been impossible. I believe strongly that the primary purpose of the Land and Water Conservation Fund--to enable the federal government to permanently protect our nation's most special places--must be preserved and strengthened, not eroded. 
   Finally, this bill revives the state grants portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has funded over 37,000 state parks projects over the last three decades, as well as the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. These programs have worked well for decades, and I would like to restore funding for them while preserving broad latitude for states and local governments to determine their own conservation and recreation priorities. The bill does not establish competitive grants under the state program. 
   Specifically, the bill amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to say that $900 million will be automatically appropriated each year for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. The bill also provides that 40 percent of the funds provided under this act must be spent on stateside grants. This will revive the moribund State grants program and ensure that states get their fair share of parks and recreation dollars. States will be required to ``pass through'' 50 percent of the grants they receive directly to local governments. 
   In addition, the bill provides that 10 percent of the funds provided under this act be allocated to the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery program. This will ensure that recreation facilities and open space remain top priorities where they are 
   urgently needed--increasingly crowded cities. The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will be amended to allow funds to be spent for construction of recreation facilities, and acquisition of park lands in urban areas. 
   The bill also requires the President to submit an annual priority list to Congress for expenditure of funds provided to federal agencies under this act. The bill specifically provides for Congressional approval of this priority list, so that Congress will retain authority to decide how Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars are spent on federal lands. 
   The bill changes requirements for the Land and Water Conservation Fund's stateside grants program, including a new requirement for States to develop, with public input, action agendas that identify their top conservation and recreation acquisition needs. Finally, the bill provides that Indian tribes will be recognized collectively as one state under the state grants program. 
   The Public Land and Recreation Investment Act will have a major and immediate impact on conservation and recreation nationwide. In my home state, increased funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund could allow for the purchase of 483,000 acres of inholdings in national parks and wilderness areas in the California Desert, dramatically improving recreation opportunities in three of our nation's newest national parks. It could permanently protect sensitive watersheds at Lake Tahoe and help preserve the Lake's astounding water quality. And it could restore wetlands in San Francisco Bay, which has lost over 80 percent of its wetlands in the last 100 years. 
   Nationally, funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will help to preserve special places like Cape Cod National Seashore and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, whose land acquisition needs have gone unmet in recent years. 
   Reviving the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will help cities across our nation improve parks and recreation opportunities for their residents. In the past, the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act has funded summer recreation, anti-drug counseling, and job training for teenagers in low income neighborhoods in Fresno. The City of Milwaukee instituted a ``Park Watch'' program to help neighborhoods combat vandalism and crime in city parks. And in Tuscon, Arizona, the UPARR program funded a health and physical fitness program for children, senior citizens, and disabled youth. 
   This bill is strongly supported by groups that seek to protect conservation and recreation resources for all Americans.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues from Wisconsin and Tennessee in co-sponsoring Senate Resolution 54, which was introduced on February 25. This resolution makes a strong, and much needed statement about U.S. concern and commitment to African peace and stability. 
   In the past several years, Sierra Leonians have seen their country go through a tumultuous period. On May 24, 1997, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) seized control of Sierra Leone. The United States demanded that democratically elected President Tejan Kabbah be reinstated immediately. 
   Although diplomatic efforts by the United States and the Economic Community of West African States failed, a West African intervention force, (ECOMOG), was authorized by the international community to intervene, and it was successful in removing the unrecognized military rulers from power. On March 10, 1998, President Kabbah returned after 10 months in exile and reassumed control. 
   Unfortunately violence continues to ravage the country. In January of this year, RUF launched an offensive to take the capital, Freetown. Though ECOMOG drove rebel forces from the city, numerous reports of rape, mutilations, kidnapping of children for forced combat, and killings of innocent civilians by RUF forces continue to surface. 
   Official estimates report that in the last 2 months alone, the death toll has reached 2,000 to 3,000 people, with many also dying from lack of food and medicine. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates the number of refugees fleeing to Guinea and Liberia at 440,000. 
   The administration has expressed shock and horror regarding the desperate situation in Sierra Leone and I am pleased that they have indicated they will provide $1.3 million for logistical support for ECOMOG in 1999, and $55 million for humanitarian assistance for the people of Sierra Leone. This Resolution builds on the administration's efforts, and calls for a strong U.S. commitment to end the violence and suffering in Sierra Leone. 
   First, it condemns the violence committed by the rebel troops and those  that provide them with financial, political, and other types of assistance. 
   Second, it supports increased U.S. political and logistical support for ECOMOG, while recognizing the need for ECOMOG to improve its performance and increase its respect for humanitarian law. 
   Third, it calls for immediate cessation of hostilities and the 
   observance of human rights. 
   Fourth, it supports a dialogue between members of the conflict in order to bring about a resolution. 
   Finally, it expresses support for the people of Sierra Leone in their endeavor to create and maintain a stable democratic society. 
   The situation in Sierra Leone and the influx of refugees to neighboring countries threatens the stability of the entire West African region. This is not a time for the United States and the international community to turn our backs. The people of Sierra Leone have already suffered too much and will suffer even more if we do not act. Rather, this is the time to stand firmly on the side of peace and democracy and the betterment of the lives of all Sierra Leonians. 
   By passing this legislation, we are making a strong statement in support of the efforts to contain and bring to a peaceful end this conflict. We have seen all too many times, in all too many places around the world the price that is paid if we choose to avert our eyes and allow violence to flourish. We should not make that mistake. We should not hesitate to raise our voice. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and in favor of human rights and justice in Sierra Leone.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you. I would like to thank the Senators for their courtesy. 
   I rise to add my support to the resolution offered by the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Arkansas. 
   I do so with a considerable sense of disappointment because for much of 1998, politics in the People's Republic of China appeared headed toward an authentic transformation. The government began to tolerate--and even encourage--discussion among intellectuals, academics, and reformers of the gradual development of democracy in China, to the point that many began to speak of a ``Beijing Spring.'' 
   After many years of stalling, China signed the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which, when ratified, would require China to allow much closer international scrutiny of its human rights practices. Cross-strait discussions resumed with Taiwan. 
   And during President Clinton's visit to China last summer, President Jiang Zemin, an old friend of mine, did two extraordinary things; he allowed the Chinese people to hear President Clinton directly by televising both his speech at Beijing University and the two leaders' joint press conference; and, in the press conference, President Jiang implied that the Chinese leadership would be prepared to meet with  the Dalai Lama to discuss the question of Tibet if the Dalai Lama would make certain statements about the principle of One China and Tibet and Taiwan's status as a part of China. 
   That was a major step forward for many of us who have advocated this for years. 
   Each of these developments seemed to represent a hopeful shift toward a new, more open attitude by the Chinese government. It seemed to reflect the confidence of a new generation of Chinese leaders, firmly in control, unafraid to allow their people to stretch their minds, and willing to deal forthrightly with difficult political questions like Tibet and Taiwan through negotiations. But now these hopes appear to be in abeyance. 
   I now believe that the hardliners appear to be strengthening their hand, and in so doing are causing their President, Jiang Zemin, to lose face as they prevent him from allowing a further opening-up of Chinese society and from carrying out a negotiation to solve real issues of deep concern to six million Tibetans. 
   The recent spate of arrests of dissidents of China, followed by summary trials and convictions of several of the most prominent among them--Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin--raise the ugly specter of a renewed tightening on political freedom in the months leading up to the tenth anniversary of the Tiananment Square tragedy. 
   On Tibet, the Dalai Lama abandoned plans to use his recent visit to the United States to make far-reaching statements intended to open the door to negotiations with China, amid unmistakable signals from Beijing that it was not prepared to begin a dialog regardless of what he said. Meanwhile, China's persecution in Tibet has only intensified. The brutal tactics of brainwashing, intimidation, and torture--tools of the Cultural Revolution--are now in use in Tibet. 
   The United States can continue to make contributions toward systemic changes that will instill the rule of law in China, which would, for example, make summary trials a thing of the past. Congress failed to fund the President's rule of law initiative last year; we should not repeat that mistake this year. Congress and the Administration should continue to resist sanctions and economic penalties that will only make the situation worse, but we must develop a stronger policy to put pressure on China to begin a dialog with the Dalai Lama on providing autonomy for the people of Tibet. An important step was taken last month when Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Julia Taft was named the State Departments Special Coordinator for Tibet. 
   This resolution argues for an additional step the United States can take. It urges the Administration to support and work for the passage of a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

   Whatever the reason for China's entrenchment, it now presents a serious challenge to strengthening of relationships between our two countries. 
   I happen to remain convinced that sustained, active dialog and engagement with the Chinese leadership is the wisest course, but in these discussions we must be frank and open and the interests of both our Nations must be served. The United States can continue to make contributions towards systemic changes that will instill the rule of law in China which would, for example, make summary trials a thing of the past.

   This resolution argues for an additional step the United States can take. It urges the administration to support and work for the passage of a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. While we should acknowledge China's progress in many areas and continue to encourage China in search of greater progress, we should also use the forum of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to let China and the world know that China's human rights abuses are unacceptable. 
   Ultimately, China's leaders must come to understand that the economic freedom that have until recently championed--and which they still know is necessary for China to fully modernize its economy--must advance together with social and political freedom. As in Hong Kong and Taiwan, China's ability to withstand economic turmoil will depend in part on the ability of Chinese citizens to make judgments for themselves. Political leaders cannot expect to draw a line between economic and political judgments. Both must be allowed to flourish hand-in-hand. And that means viewing the efforts of Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin to organize a more pluralist Chinese polity, and viewing the efforts of the Dalai Lama to promote dialogue and religious and cultural freedom, as encouraging signs of China's modernization, not as dangerous signs of China's instability.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today alongside my colleague from North Dakota in support of S. 456, the Information Technology Tax Credit bill, which provides employers with a tax credit for information technology training for their employees. 
   The purpose of this legislation is quite simple: To assist American companies which are having difficulty in recruiting skilled workers to fill positions in the information technology field. 
   Information technology--including computer programmers, systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers--is a critical ingredient in the growth of the U.S. economy as well as the economy of California. A field that barely existed a few decades ago, information technologies are now among the most important emerging technologies in the world. 
   Information technology now accounts for more than $500 billion a year to U.S. economy, and one-third of all new jobs created since 1992 are in computers, semiconductors, software, and communications equipment. 
   According to recent studies, ``e-commerce'' is projected to grow from $2.6 billion in 1996 to over $220 billion in 2001--explosive growth that will generate countless additional jobs. 
   And, just as important, many information technology jobs tend to be high value added, high-wage. 
   Last year California alone was responsible for sales of approximately $125 billion in high-tech production--almost than double 1992's $64 billion in sales. 
   Computer services--just one sector of the IT economy--have created 100,000 jobs in California in the past five years. There are now over 400,000 people in California employed directly in high-tech manufacturing jobs. When information technology business service jobs are added into the mix, there are currently over 700,000 information technology jobs in California, according to the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
   And yet, despite this explosive growth--or perhaps because of it--America is simply not producing enough skilled and able workers to meet the needs of the information technology field. 
   Last year the Information Technology Association of America releases a study which estimated that there are more than 340,000 high skilled positions in the information technology field that are not filled. 
   And the Department of Labor has projected that our economy will require more than 130,000 information technology jobs in just three fields--computer scientists and engineers, systems analysts, and computer programmers--every year for the next decade. 
   One of the most sobering experiences of my Senate career occurred last year when I was told point blank by the CEO's of several large California high-tech companies that the United States is simply not producing a sufficient number of skilled and educated workers to fill the information technology positions that their companies need to fill if they were to be able to continue  to grow and successfully compete in the international economy. 
   To meet the needs of these companies, last year Congress had to revise the cap on H1B visas to allow foreign professional and skilled workers who had the education and skills to fill these information technology positions to come to the United States. 
   While raising the H1B visa cap may meet the short term needs of these companies and of the economy, it is not a long-term solution to this problem. 
   To avoid the danger of a ``hollowing out'' the U.S. workforce we must invest more in the education and training of American workers so that they have the education and skills needed for the information technology jobs which make up the backgone of the new high-tech economy. 
   We must make sure that new workers entering the workforce have the skills they need to match with the jobs they want to be able to get. We must focus on retraining unemployed, older, and displaced workers, and encourage new partnerships between the IT industry and educational institutions. And we must reach out to those who have been left out to make sure that they have the training they need to join in our current economic prosperity. 
   To meet these needs, this legislation provides a tax credit for employers who offer information technology training for individuals, equal to 20 percent of the information technology training program expense, capped to $6,000 in a calender year. 
   And, to help those who may have been excluded from the economy of today take their place in the economy of tomorrow, it provides a 5 percent increase in the value of the credit as an additional incentive for training in empowerment zones or enterprise communities. 
   The current strength of U.S. information technology industry comes, in large part, from a long and successful partnership between government, educational institutions, and industry. 
   This legislation builds on that partnership to both meet our current needs and to train the next generation of information technology workers, and to maintain the U.S. economy's strength and leadership in the twenty-first century.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, to introduce the Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act. This bill, supported by more than 80 industry organizations, is especially important to California, where over 20 percent of the nation's high-tech jobs are located. 
   The genesis of the bill was a request by several industry groups--including the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Chamber of Commerce and the Information Technology Association of America--to develop legislation to prevent frivolous and baseless lawsuits that could jeopardize companies actually solving Y2K problems. 
   In concert with Senator HATCH and industry groups, a bill has been drafted that is narrow in focus and moderate in application. In developing this legislation, we have sought to solve an important problem and feel we have worked to develop a fair bill. We remain willing to address concerns with this legislation. It is a starting point, not a final piece of legislation. 
   This bill is a bill that will prevent frivolous and baseless litigation, but will not restrict an individual's right to sue to mitigate real damages. 
   Let me outline a few key provisions of the legislation. 
   First, this bill provides a 90-day ``cooling off period,'' during which no Y2K lawsuit may be filed and a three-step process must be followed: 
   A. Anyone alleging harm due to a Y2K failure must first provide written notice to the potential defendant of the problem. 
   B. The defendant then has 3 days to respond in writing. 
   C. The defendant also has 60 additional days to fix the problem. 
   This cooling off period is important because it allows companies to concentrate on solving the problem before suits are filed and hopefully, it will eliminate the rush to litigation that many anticipate. 
   Obviously, the hope is that if a company is given an opportunity to solve a Y2K problem, that company will proceed to do so with dispatch. Therefore, there will be fewer injured parties, ergo, fewer will need to file suit. 
   Second, the bill limits punitive damages to $250,000 or three times economic loss, whichever is greater. However, for individuals whose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or for small businesses, of fewer that 25 full-time employees, punitive damages would be limited to the lesser of $250,000 or three times economic damages. 
   Third, this bill provides for proportionate liability, so that a defendant would be limited to the 
   percentage proportion of that defendant's fault in causing the alleged harm. In other words, ``no deep pockets.'' 
   Fourth, the bill establishes requirements that the plaintiffs must allege specific harm and damages when filing suit, including the factual basis for the calculation of damages. 
   The bill also provides either party the opportunity to request Alternative Dispute Resolution at any time during the 90-day cooling off period provided for in this bill. If the parties agree to use Alternative Dispute Resolution and the dispute is settled, the defendant must pay the settlement in 30 days unless other arrangements are agreed to. 
   Sixth, the bill provides that if a contract specifically limits liability for actions that would include a Y2K action, no recovery is available beyond the contract terms. Recovery, however, is available if the contract does not mention liability limitations. Recovery is also available for any contract entered into without a true ``meeting of the minds.'' This would include contracts, for instance, between large companies and ordinary consumers. Even if the terms of use within a product box state a limit on liability, courts can award Y2K damages. 
   The bill also sets minimum injury requirements for class action lawsuits to prevent attorneys from gathering large numbers of plaintiffs that have not really even been harmed by a given Y2K defect. 
   Additionally, the bill requires that all potential class members be notified of a Y2K class action by U.S. mail, return receipt requested. That notice must include information about the nature of the action, the jurisdiction, claims that are not being pursued, and the arrangement for attorneys fees. 
   Ninth, the bill provides federal courts with jurisdiction over Y2K lawsuits so long as any member of the class is a citizen of a State different from the defendant (or is a citizen of a foreign country). Current law states that if any class representative of the class action is a citizen of the State in which the business is located, the federal courts have no diversity jurisdiction. This makes it easy for the attorneys filing a class action to have it heard in state court. 
   However, the bill does allow a federal court to abstain from exerting jurisdiction in cases where most class members are in the same State as the defendant and the case will be governed primarily by that State's law, or if the class is small or the amount in controversy is less than $1 million. 
   In summary, it is clear that there are consumers and businesses that have been and will be harmed by Y2K defects. For these companies and individuals impacted by Y2K problems, the Hatch-Feinstein bill preserves the right to sue and to recover damages, and actually increases their chances of finding a quick solution to their problems. 
   But the bill also prevents the kind of litigation nightmares that would distract from Y2K solutions and drain resources from already burdened companies throughout the country. 
   Mr. President, we believe that this bill represents a fair and reasoned approach to what is surely a real problem. But as I have said, this bill also represents a starting point, not an ending point. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue developing a fair bill that can pass in the near future. We must give businesses the reasonable protections they require to solve Y2K problems efficiently, quickly and without unnecessary distractions. I thank Senator HATCH for working with me on this issue, I urge my colleagues to contact us and to work towards a bipartisan, reasonable solution to this problem.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I just want to point out to everyone who is interested that a censure resolution has been entered at the desk. It has 38 cosponsors. 
   Mr. President, during these trying days, the question has been asked of many of us: ``What will we tell our children about this sordid period in our Nation's history?'' 
   Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I had hoped to be able to tell my granddaughter and, indeed, the rest of our Nation, that the United States Senate had come together in bipartisan fellowship to approve a censure resolution that would deliver a clear message that the behavior of President William Jefferson Clinton has been inappropriate, intolerable and unacceptable. 
   Unfortunately, some in this body have forestalled our ability to bring such a resolution to the floor of the Senate for a vote. This I regret deeply. 
   There are moments in history when we are able to rise up against the forces driving us apart and come together with a united purpose. I believe that the censure resolution provided us with just such an opportunity. 
   While not a cure-all, the resolution is a way to share with our children and the rest of our nation our findings, our sentiments, our belief that the actions of the President are a violation of the trust of the American people and have brought shame and dishonor upon the presidency and the man. 
   But as has been made clear, those of us who truly believe a strong censure is the appropriate resolution in this case are being prevented from bringing it to the floor of this Senate for a vote. 
   The main co-sponsor is the Senator from Utah, Mr. ROBERT BENNETT. In all, it is co-sponsored by 36 Senators.--over 1/3 of this Senate. 
   The words of the resolution were strong, but they are fitting words and I believe a bipartisan majority of the Senate would be prepared to vote for this censure resolution if it were permitted to come to a vote today. 
   Over the past few weeks, I have worked very closely with a large number of Senators to develop a bipartisan resolution, largely because I felt it so important that anyone who looks at this shabby episode of American history understands that while one may not vote to convict and remove a president, one can have profound dismay and concern about the misconduct that was inherent in the articles of impeachment. 
   That is why I regret deeply that some have seen fit to prevent us from voting on a censure resolution. 
   Because that cannot happen today, I have joined with the cosponsors of this resolution to formally present it to the Senate and record it in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, making clear for all time the strong censure of this President and condemnation of his actions by at least one-third of the U.S. Senate. 
   Earlier today, I voted against conviction and removal of the President on both articles of impeachment. I did not believe the House managers established beyond a reasonable doubt that this President is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
   Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government, and therefore this President, who has been a good President for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office. 
   However, I feel very strongly and sincerely that the acquittal of the President on the articles of impeachment should not be the Senate's last word on the President's conduct, and that without further action such as a resolution of censure, the wrong message about the President's actions and the Senate's views thereon will be sent to the country. 
   One of the most worthwhile experiences of my Senate career has been listening to the remarks of the Senators over the past three days on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Each one gave substantial deliberation, serious thought and research and tried his or her level best to maintain their oath of impartiality. 
   It should be clear that this was not an easy time. It should be clear that every one in the Senate at every minute of every day wished this were not happening. But we found ourselves caught up in a constitutional requirement that gave us little choice. 
   I hope we come out of this with a deeper understanding of the divisions and polarization, which all of this has caused, and that every effort can be made, not only by our leadership, but by every member of the Senate in every issue that comes before us to seek out a bipartisanship and to work  together to solve the problems facing our nation. 
   A good start in this process would have been to have allowed a vote on the censure resolution. I hope that when we return from the President's Day recess, we will do better.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a private relief bill that provides permanent residency to Oleg Rasulyevich Rafikova, Alfia Fanilevna Rafikova, and their children, Evgenia Olegovna Rafikova and Ruslan Khamitovich Yagudin, who without this legislation, would have to return to Russia and face possible threats of blackmail and kidnaping. 
   The Rafikova family came to the United States on August 28, 1997, from Ufa, Russia, on a visitor's visa to receive their inheritance from Alfia's uncle, the famous ballet dancer, Rudolf Nureyev. Rafikova's now fear returning to their home country because they fear that the local Mafia would try to extort their inheritance from them. 
   According to Alfia, everything changed for the family in Ufa, Russia, when the local media announced the death of her uncle, Rudolf Nureyev and exaggerated the amount of her inheritance and falsely made assertions that the family already had the money. Alfia claims that she and her husband started getting harassing phone calls, threats of kidnaping their children for ransom, and death threats. The events escalated to a day when they were robbed of everything except the clothes they were wearing. 
   Alfia's inheritance is substantial enough that she and her family will not be a public charge. In fact, Alfia and her husband Oleg, who is a chef by training, would like to start a restaurant in San Francisco, providing jobs for Americans. Alfia's two children are attending school in San Francisco and look forward to the day they  could call the United States their new home. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation so we can give the Rafikova family a chance to restart their life in the United States.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today, a legislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but failed to be enacted because the bill was not considered by the House during last Congress. 
   This legislation provides permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a recently widowed young mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the devastation of being separated from her child and family here in the U.S. 
   Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically killed in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old U.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride. 
   Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to permanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation. 
   Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual friend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and visited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were married in September 1995 and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong in May 1996. 
   Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. However, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks after his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, because the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her status. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens to self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have been married for over 2 years. 
   Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her young child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces losing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son. 
   Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could not care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-supporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her retirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through Jimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and Ryan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in Thailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong and their church. 
   Suchada was previously granted voluntary departure for one year on October 1996 to explore other options or prepare to leave the United States. During that time period, Suchada and her family have explored all options but failed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired and Suchada must leave the country immediately, leaving behind her young child and her family here in the U.S. 
   Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Suchada rebuild her life in the United States.

    Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a legislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but failed to be enacted because it was never considered by the House during last Congress. 
   The bill provides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio (18 years old), Fauricio (16 years old), and Ana Lozano (15 years old) who now face deportation because they lost their mother in 1997 and the immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents. 
   The Lozano children face a dire situation without this legislation since despite the fact that they came into the country legally, they could be deported because they were orphaned. 
   The children lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until February 1997 when she died of complications developed from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the children have been living with their closest relative, their U.S. citizen grandmother, who currently lives in Los Angeles, California. 
   Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS despite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them in El Salvador except their estranged father who cannot be located by the family. 
   Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an orphanage in El Salvador. Here in the U.S., the children have their U.S. citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving home. 
   I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano children by asking the INS District Office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they can do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way to protect the children from deportation. 
   I urge all the members to support this bill so that we can help the Lozano children rebuild their lives in the United States.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I are introducing a bill to guarantee that the decision of how long a patient receives care in the hospital is left to the attending physician. Our legislation would require health insurance plans to cover the length of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate. 
   The bill is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American  College of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Psychological Association. 
   Only a physician taking care of the patient, who understands the patient's history, medical condition and needs, should make the decision as to how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians are trained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each individual patient. Every patient's condition varies and the course of their illness also varies. Some patients are fragile or weak. Others do not respond well to general anesthesia. Complications arise. Each patient is a unique individual with varying degrees of health. 
   The American Medical Association, concerned that pre-determined length of stay criteria are ``moving away from scientific, patient-focused principles of care,'' resulting in ``quicker and sicker'' discharges and poor patient outcomes, has developed patient-based discharge criteria. These criteria include considerations such as the patient's physiological, psychological, social and functional needs. The AMA criteria say: ``Patients should not be discharged from the hospital when their disease or symptoms cannot be adequately treated or monitored in the discharge setting.'' 
   Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, actuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not a physician or other representative of an insurance company, that should decide when to admit and discharge someone. 
   A number of physicians and other health care providers have expressed to me their great frustration with the current health care climate, in which they feel they spend too much of their time trying to justify their decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies. 
   For example, Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of a hospital, told National Public Radio on October 1, 1997: ``I spend my days watching the care on my unit be directed by faceless people from insurance companies on the other end of the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire job is to talk to insurance reviewers *.*.* The reviewer's background can range anywhere from high school graduate to nurse, social worker or even actual physicians.'' 
   In 1996, we addressed the problem of ``drive-through'' baby deliveries because insurance plans would only pay for one day of hospital car for childbirth. This was fraught with problems like jaundiced babies that had to be rehospitalized and mothers who developed problems which only worsened because they were sent home despite physicians' view that a mother's and baby's stability are not usually reached until the third post-partum day. 
   We have also been told of so-called ``drive-through'' mastectomies. Some HMO's have made mastectomy an outpatient procedure. Women who have had a radical mastectomy at 7:30 a.m. have been out on the street at 4:30 that afternoon, dizzy and weak, unable to cope with drainage tubes and disfigurement. Senator SNOWE and I are introducing a separate bill to address this.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills to stop the contamination of California's drinking water by the gasoline additive MTBE. 
   First, I am introducing a bill to allow California to apply its own clean or reformulated gasoline rules as long as emissions reductions are equivalent or greater. California's rules are stricter than the federal rules and thus meet the air quality requirements of the federal Clean Air Act. This bill is the companion to H.R. 11 introduced by Representative BILBRAY on January 6, 1998. 
   MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl either is added to gasoline by some refiners in response to federal requirements that areas with the most serious air pollution problems use what is called ``reformulated gasoline,'' a type of cleaner-burning gasoline. The federal law requires that this gasoline contain 2 percent by weight oxygenate. MTBE has been the oxygenate of choice by some refiners. 
   The major source of MTBE in groundwater appears to be leaking underground storage tanks. In surface water, it is recreational gasoline-powered boating and personal watercraft, according to the California Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The second bill requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make petroleum releases into drinking water the highest priority in the federal underground storage tank cleanup program. This bill is needed because underground storage tanks are the major source of MTBE into drinking water and federal law does not give EPA specific guidance on cleanup priorities. 
   The third bill will move from 2006 to 2001 full implementation of EPA's current watercraft engine exhaust emissions requirements. The California Air Resources Board on December 10, 1998, adopted watercraft engine regulations in 
   effect making the federal EPA rules effective in 2001, so this bill will make the deadline in the federal requirements consistent with California's deadlines. In addition, the bill will require an emissions label on these engines consistent with California's requirements so the consumer can make an informed purchasing choice. This bill is needed because watercraft engines have remained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and up to 30 percent of the gas that goes into the motor goes into water unburned. 
   These three bills represent three steps toward getting MRBE out of California's drinking water. 
   BILL 1: THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN GAS FORMULA
   The Feinstein-Bilbray bill would provide that if a state's reformulated gasoline rules achieve equal or greater emissions reductions than federal regulations, a state's rules will take precedence. The bill would apply only to states which have received waivers under Section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. California is the only state currently eligible for this waiver, a waiver allowing California to set its own fuel standards. The other 49 states do not set their own fuel specifications. 
   This bill would exempt California from overlapping federal oxygenate requirements and give gasoline manufacturers the flexibility to reduce or even eliminate the use of MTBE, while not reducing our air quality. 
   In 1994, the CARB adopted a ``predictive model,'' which is a performance based program that allows refiners to use innovative fuel formulations to meet clean air requirements. The predictive model provides twice the clean air benefits required by the federal government. With this model, refiners can make cleaner burning gasoline with one percent oxygen or even no oxygen at all. The federal two percent oxygenate requirement limits this kind of innovation. In fact, Tosco and Shell are already making MTBE-free gasoline. 
   In addition, Chevron has said:  
   MTBE is the best oxygenate of choice for blending CBG (clean burning gasoline) in California refineries....... However, consistent with our desire to reduce or eliminate MTBE from cleaner burning gas (CBG), we want the flexibility to be able to make prudent use of any oxygenate--MTBE, ethanol, or the use of no oxygenate--while meeting the emissions performance standards of reformulated gasolines. If the government allows this flexibility, Chevron would likely use more ethanol than now to efficiently provide cleaning burning gasoline.  
   The legislation allows that companies who serve California's gasoline needs to continue to adopt innovative formulas for cleaner burning gasoline without contaminating the water. 
   The University of California study, released in November, recommended phasing our MTBE and concluded that oil companies can make cleaner-burning gasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1999 with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE. 
   This bill has four provisions: 
   For breast cancer-- 
   1. It requires insurance plans to cover hospital stays as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate. Our bill does not prescribe a fixed number of days or set a minimum. It leaves the length of hospital stay up to the treating physician. 
   2. It requires insurance plans to provide notice to plan subscribers of these requirements. 
   For all cancers-- 
   3. It prohibits insurance plans from linking financial or other incentives to a physician's provisions of care. 
   4. It requires plans to cover second opinions by specialists to confirm or refute a diagnosis. If the attending physician certifies that there is no appropriate specialist practicing under the insurance plan, the plan must ensure that coverage is provided outside the plan for a second opinion by a qualified specialist selected by the attending physician at no additional cost to the patient beyond that which the patient would have paid if the specialist were participating in the plan.

   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator KYL, to once again introduce a constitutional amendment to provide rights for victims of violent crime. 
   We have achieved significant progress in our effort to pass the amendment. After working extensively--indeed, exhaustively--with prosecutors, law professors, the Justice Department, the White House Counsel's Office, and leaders of victims groups from around the country to carefully craft and hone the amendment's language, we succeeded in bringing the amendment to markup in the Judiciary Committee. 
   After numerous committee business meetings, and one of the most high-minded debates in which I have been privileged to participate, the Judiciary Committee passed the amendment by a strong, bipartisan vote. Unfortunately, with the press of final business at the end of the Congress, there was not sufficient time to consider the amendment on the Senate floor and work it through the House. 
   So here we are now, carrying the fight forward into this new, 106th Congress. We are fighting to ensure that the 8.6 million victims of violent crime in the country receive the fair treatment by the judicial system which they deserve. Too often in America victims of violent crime are victimized a second time, by the government. 
   Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. What really focused my attention on the need for greater protection of victims' rights was a particularly horrifying case in 1974, in San Francisco, when a man named Angelo Pavageau broke into the house of the Carlson family in Portero Hill. 
   Pavageau tied Mr. Carlson to a chair, bludgeoning him to death with a hammer, a chopping block, and a ceramic vase. He then repeatedly raped Carlson's 24-year-old wife, breaking several of her bones. He slit her wrist, tried to strangle her with a telephone cord, and then, before fleeing, set the Carlson's home on fire--cowardly reteating into the night, leaving this family to burn up in flames. 
   But Mrs. Carlson survived the fire. She courageously lived to testify against her attacker. But she has been forced to change her name and continues to live in fear that her attacker may, one day, be released. When I was Mayor of San Francisco, she called me several times to notify me that Pavageau was up for parole. Amazingly, it was up to Mrs. Carlson to find out when his parole hearings were. 
   Mr. President, I believe this case represents a travesty of justice--It just shouldn't have to be that way. I believe it should be the responsibility of the state to send a letter through the mail or make a phone call to let the victim know that her attacker is up for parole, and she should have the opportunity to testify at this hearing. 
   But today, in many states in this great nation, victims still are not made aware of the accused's trial, many times are not allowed in the courtroom during the trial, and are not notified when a convicted offender is released from prison. 
   I have vowed to do everything in my power to add a bit of balance to our nation's justice system. This is why Senator KYL and I have crafted the Crime Victim's Rights Amendment before us today. 
   The people of California were the first in the nation to pass a crime victims' amendment to the state constitution in 1982--the imitative Proposition 8--and I supported its passage. This measure gave victims the right to restitution, the right to testify at sentencing, probation and parole hearings, established a right to safe and secure public school campuses, and made various changes in criminal law. California's Proposition 8 represented a good start to ensure 
   victims' rights. 
   Since the passage of Proposition Eight, 31 more states have passed constitutional amendments guaranteeing the rights of crime victims. Just this past November, Mississippi, Montana and Tennessee added victims' rights amendments to their state constitutions. These amendments were overwhelmingly supported by the voters, winning with 93%, 71% and 89% of the vote, respectively. 
   But citizens in other states lack these basic rights. The 32 different state constitutional amendments differ from each other, representing a patchwork quilt of rights that vary from state to state. And even in those states which have state amendments, criminals can assert rights grounded in the federal constitution to try to trump those rights. 
   The United States Constitution guarantees numerous rights to the accused in our society, all of which were established by amendment to the Constitution. I steadfastly believe that this nation must attempt to guarantee, at the very least, some basic rights to the millions victimized by crime each year. 
   For those accused of crimes in this country, the Constitution specifically protects: 
   The right to a grand jury indictment for capital or infamous crimes; 
   The prohibition against double jeopardy; 
   The right to due process; 
   The right to a speedy trial and the right to an impartial jury of one's peers; 
   The right to be informed of the nature and cause of the criminal accusation; 
   The right to confront witnesses; 
   The right to counsel; 
   The right to subpoena witnesses--and so on. 
   However, nowhere in the text of the U.S. Constitution does there appear any guarantee of rights for crime victims. 
   To rectify this disparity, Senator KYL and I are putting forth this Crime Victims' Rights Amendment. This provides for certain rights for victims of crime: 
   The right to be notified of public proceedings in their case; 
   The right not be excluded from these proceedings; 
   The right to be heard at proceedings to determine a release from custody, sentencing, or acceptance of a negotiated plea; 
   The right to notice of the offender's release or escape; 
   The right to consideration for the interest of the victim in a trial free from unreasonable delay; 
   The right to an order of restitution from the convicted offender; 
   The right to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any release from custody; and 
   The right to notice of your rights as a victim. 
   Conditions in our nation today are significantly different from those in 1789, when the founding fathers wrote the Constitution without providing explicitly for the rights of crime victims. In 1789, there weren't 9 million victims of 
   violent crime every year. In fact, there are more victims of violent crime each year in this country now than there were people in the country when the Constitution was written. 
   Moreover, there is good reason why defendants' rights were embedded in the Constitution in 1789 and victims' rights were not--the way the criminal justice system worked then, victims did not need any guarantee of these rights. 
   In America in the late 18th century and well into the 19th century, public prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence criminal cases themselves, by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant, and initiating a private prosecution. The core rights in our amendment--to notice, to attend, and to be heard--were inherently made available to the victim. As Juan Cardenas, writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, observed, ``At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often hired a prosecutor.''  
   Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private prosecution. With the explosive growth of crime in this country in recent years (the rate of violent crime has more than quadrupled over the last 35 years), it became easier and easier for the victim to be left aside in the process. 
   As other scholars have noted:  
   With the establishment of the prosecutor the conditions for the general alienation of the victim from the legal process further increase. The victim is deprived of his ability to determine the course of a case and is deprived of the ability to gain restitution from the proceedings. Under such conditions the incentives to report crime and to cooperate with the prosecution diminish. As the importance of the prosecution increases, the role of the victim is transformed from principal actor to a resource that may be used at the prosecutor's discretion.  
   Thus, we see why the Constitution must be amended to guarantee these rights: 
   There was no need to guarantee these rights in the Constitution in 1789; 
   The criminal justice system has changed dramatically since then; and 
   The prevalence of crime in America has changed dramatically creating the need and circumstances to respond to these developments and restore balance in the criminal justice system by guaranteeing the rights of violent crime victims in the Constitution. 
   Among the amendment's supporters are Professor Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School. 
   Let me just briefly quote portions of his testimony from the House hearing on the amendment last Congress:  
   The rights in question--rights of crime victims not to be victimized yet again through the process by which government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, and release the accused or convicted offender--are indisputably basic human rights against government, rights that any civilized system of justice would aspire to protect and strive never to violate. 
   [O]ur Constitution's central concerns involve protecting the rights of individuals to participate in all those government processes that directly and immediately involve those individuals and affect their lives in some focused and particular way ..... The parallel rights of victims to participate in these proceedings are no less basic, even though they find no parallel recognition in the explicit text of the U.S. Constitution. 
   The fact that the States and Congress, within their respective jurisdictions, already have ample affirmative authority to enact rules protecting these rights is ..... not a reason for opposing an amendment altogether ..... The problem, rather, is that such rules are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened.  
   Some people argue that state victims' rights amendments are sufficient. 
   However, crime victims throughout the country, including those in the other 18 states, deserve to have rights, just as we applied civil rights to people throughout our great nation 30 years ago. 
   Moreover, state amendments lack the force that a federal constitutional amendment would have, and too often are given short shrift: 
   Maryland has a state amendment. But when Cheryl Rae Enochs Resch was beaten to death with a ceramic beer mug by her husband, her mother was not notified of this killer's early release only two and a half years into his ten year sentence, and was not given the opportunity to be heard about this release, in violation of the state amendment. 
   Arizona has a state amendment. But an independent audit of victim-witness programs in four Arizona counties, including Maricopa County where Phoenix is located, found that: 
   Victims were not consistently notified of hearing during which conditions of a defendant's release were discussed ..... 
   Victims were not consistently ..... conferred with by prosecutors regarding plea bargains .....; and 
   Victims were not consistently ..... provided with an opportunity to request post-conviction notification. 
   Ohio has a state amendment. But when the murderer of Maxine Johnson's husband change his plea, Maxine was not notified of the public hearing, and then was not given the opportunity to testify at his sentencing, as provided for in Ohio law.
