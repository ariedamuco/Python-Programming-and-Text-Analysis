   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Houston arrival of a Ronald McDonald Care Mobile--a state-of-the-art pediatric mobile healthcare unit. It is one of the first in an innovative initiative of the Ronald McDonald House Charities, known and respected worldwide for its dedication to improving children's health. 
   In cooperation with its local affiliates and local hospitals or health systems, RMHC has begun rolling out these Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles to bring free medical and dental services to children in underserved communities. The Houston Ronald McDonald Care Mobile will be operated and staffed by the Harris County Hospital District. It will travel, on a regular schedule, to schools, churches, apartment complexes and other neighborhood sites where need is great. This RMHC partnership will significantly strengthen the District's capacity to serve the county's disadvantaged children and their families. 
   The Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles are a far cry from the usual converted vans and school buses. They are specially-designed pediatricians' offices on wheels, with two patient examination rooms, a laboratory, reception and medical records areas and, in some cases, a hearing screening booth and dental hygiene room. The units are also staffed to deliver first-rate care. Staffing will vary according to local needs but is likely to include a pediatrician, a pediatric nurse, and a manager. There may also be a social worker, a dental hygienist, an asthma specialist and/or medical residents, nursing students, and interns in training. 
   The Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles will go directly into underserved communities. They will provide primary care, including immunizations and medical screenings; diagnosis, treatment, referral, and followup for serious medical and dental conditions; and health education for children and their families. Staff will also help eligible families obtain government-assisted health insurance and will partner with communities to address critical local childhood health needs. 
   Our children are our nation's most precious resource. We are all beholden to the Ronald McDonald House Charities for bringing vital health care to the underserved so that they may learn and play and grow up strong. This truly is giving back to the community at its finest.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to note a very important event for the city of Abilene, Texas. On December 2 of this year, the Abilene Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its 50th anniversary. This is one of Abilene's oldest performing arts organizations. This great symphony orchestra enriches the cultural life of this city in a unique way. It has drawn top quality musicians to this wonderful city. Abilene is now a city where talented musicians can also teach and perform. When the Philharmonic started in 1950, concerts were held in the old Abilene High School with audiences of less that 100 people. Now, the Abilene Philharmonic Orchestra performs in the Abilene  Civic Center with crowds averaging 2,000. I would not only like to acknowledge this organization for their 50th anniversary, but also the enormous impact they have had on the Abilene community.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very sad time. It has been a sad time for America. I want to focus on the sadness in Texas. 
   Mr. President, last week Texas laid to rest three of her sons, killed in the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole. Seaman Timothy Gauna of Rice, Petty Officer Ronchester Santiago of Kingsville, and Fireman Gary Swenchonis of Rockport, were killed in the October 12 disaster. 
   Since then, I have visited with the families of these three sailors. I met with some of them at the Cole memorial service in Norfolk, VA. Fine, loving individuals, they are trying, as we all are, to make sense of the senseless. 
   These young men had their lives ahead of them. They wanted to go to college, to travel, to raise their own families. They volunteered for the Navy because they loved their country and wanted to give something back, and now they are gone. 
   It may not be possible for us to understand the magnitude of this loss to the families involved. 
   Can we know the anguish of Mr. Swenchonis, whose son Gary was laid  to rest in the same cemetery as Gary's grandfather? A son with just 2 months left on his enlistment? 
   Will we ever understand the loss of Rogelio Santiago, a Navy veteran himself, who was planning a trip with his son Ron to his native Philippines in December? 
   Have we ever experienced the bewilderment of Sarah Gauna, who said she would never hang up the phone with her boy until she had made him laugh, as she waited days to learn the awful truth about Timothy? 
   We cannot feel the depth of sorrow of these families, but we are all diminished by their loss because U.S.S. Cole was a small patch of American soil and on that patch we lost our own. 
   Today, as we come and go in our ordinary routine, life is anything but routine for those they left behind. 
   Today, the U.S.S. Cole, crippled but proud, has begun the long journey home. She is under tow for a rendezvous with another larger vessel that will literally carry her home to America. 
   The ship is cold. It is dark and quiet. But the spirit of the fallen Texans and the 14 others who lost their lives carries on in the valiant efforts of their 300 shipmates. They saved the ship and they mean to rebuild it to fight another day. 
   In the words of her Commanding Officer, ``We're going to get this ship back home [and] put back together so that she can again sail and defend American freedom throughout the world.'' 
   That is exactly what is going on today in so many other distant places across the globe. Today we remember the Cole, but she was just one representative of a proud service that is still on watch. 
   Today as most Americans get up for work, have breakfast with their families, perhaps attend a son or daughter's school play or athletic event, we may not think much about the tens of thousands who left their families alone on a pier months ago to sail into harm's way, expecting, but not really knowing for sure, if they would come home. 
   Just today--November 1--on, over, or under the seven seas, more than 41,000 sailors and marines are standing watch on the bridge of a warship, landing aircraft onto the deck of a carrier, manning nuclear power plants leagues beneath the surface, training to land ashore from the sea. 
   These thousands do not count a much greater number ashore who repair the ships, maintain the aircraft, and perform a host of other activities that mark an ordinary day in the life of a superpower. 
   Those young men and women are out there serving under our flag in places where they are not always welcome but whose presence is reassuring. 
   Every once in a while, we hear from them. Not when they are landing their fighter onto the rolling deck in pitch blackness, scared but exhilarated all the same. We do not read about it when they bring their ship alongside an oiler, two 10,000-ton machines just 90 feet apart at 15 knots for 3 hours replenishing their stores at sea to extend the reach of freedom. 
   There are no cameras there for the 19 year-old Marine guard at the gate of the overseas naval installation at 3 o'clock in the morning who must decide in an instant whether the vehicle approaching him is loaded with explosives or is just a shipmate coming back from liberty. 
   They do not seek our recognition, but at times, that is demanded of us. Unfortunately, now is one of those times. At a time such as this, we cannot believe what we see but we marvel at the courage and dedication of these young people. 
   I received an e-mail message that has been circulated around the world, shared with me by Knox and Kay Nunnally, whose son attends the Naval Academy. A helicopter pilot from the U.S.S. Hawes recorded what he saw when he was assigned the task of taking airborne photos of the stricken Cole pierside in Yemen, just days after the tragedy. His words bring home to us just what it is we ask of our sailors and marines:  
   I will tell you that right now there are 250-plus sailors just a few miles away living in hell on earth. You can't even imagine the conditions they're living in, and yet they are still fighting 24 hours a day to save their ship and free the bodies of those still trapped and send them home. 
   As bad as it is, they're doing an incredible job. The very fact that these people are still functioning is beyond my comprehension. Whatever you imagine as the worst, multiply it by ten and you might get there. 
   I wish I had the power to relay to you what I have seen, but words just won't do it. I do want to tell you the first thing that jumped out at me--the Stars and Strips flying. I can't tell you how that made me feel ..... even in this God forsaken hell-hole our flag was more beautiful than words can describe.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts has been at it again, trying to bring the Presidential campaign to the Senate floor and misrepresenting the record in Texas. Once again, as promised, I am here to stand up for the record of the Governor of Texas and to stand up for the State of Texas. 
   I ask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, if he would consider in the future not misrepresenting Texas for two reasons: 
   One is, I don't think it is persuasive to anyone in America to continue to hear the downgrading of a State in our country, and I certainly don't think it affects the Presidential race. Secondly, I just don't think that it is necessary or proper to downgrade a great State such as Texas or any other State in America. 
   Of course, I am from Texas; of course, I love my State. But I think, objectively speaking, a lot of other people do because we have just surpassed New York to become the second largest State in America. People are not moving there because they think we have a terrible education system. They are not moving there because they think we don't treat our children well. They are not moving there because we don't have health insurance for our children. They are not moving there because we have a bad environment. They are moving there because it is a wonderful place in which to live, and it has gotten better since George W. Bush became Governor. 
   So let me just set the record straight. We have a patients' bill of rights in Texas. It is the model upon which other States are now basing the laws that they are beginning to pass or look at passing. We have a very good patients' bill of rights because it has an independent review mechanism. You have an internal review and you have an external review. It is an independent review so that the bottom line that we all want will occur, and that is that a patient will get the care the patient and the doctor believe is in the best interest of the patient. That is what a patients' bill of rights is. We also have caps on limits for lawsuits which are allowed after the exhaustion of the internal and external reviews. There are caps on pain and suffering and noneconomic damages. That makes sure that we don't have a plethora of lawsuits, and it would keep the patient and the doctor making the decisions for health care in the forefront of our interest. So it is a model law. It is a good law. Whatever misrepresentations have been made about it, the Governor allowed it to become law. It happened on his watch. 
   Secondly, we are very proud of the improvements we are making in our public education system. Most States are not satisfied with where they are in public education. Texas is working very hard to improve our public education system, and under the leadership of Governor George W. Bush we are winning. Test scores are going up and, most especially, the test scores are going up in the minority communities. That is one of the focuses that Governor Bush has made in my home State of Texas because we all looked at the high school dropout rate. We were all unsatisfied with that number. We said, what can we do, especially in our Hispanic community, where the high school dropout rate is the highest per capita? We said, we have to go back to the basics. 
   That is what Governor Bush did. He went back to the basics and he put the resources into it. That is about $8 million more than had been spent before. He said, we are going to go to the third grade level and that is going to be the firewall. We are going to test children in preschool; we are going to test them in the first grade and in the second grade. But if they can't read at grade level in the third grade, they will not be promoted to the fourth grade because we know that if children can't read at the early stages, they will never be able to reach their full potential in the public education system. That was the initiative of Governor Bush and, I might add, along with a great house speaker, Pete Leahy, a Democrat, and a Lieutenant 
   Governor--at the time it was Bob Bullock, a Democrat; today, it is Rick Perry, a Republican. But we do work in a bipartisan way in the legislature. We always have in Texas. That is something that we have done since the days I served in the Texas legislature. We worked together, Democrats and Republicans. It is why I was so surprised when I came to the Senate and it didn't work that way here. We are not used to doing business that way. 
   With all due respect, I think Texas has it right because after the elections in Texas, we come together--the Governor and the legislature--to do what is best for the children and the people of Texas. Wouldn't it be refreshing if that were the case in Washington, DC? Wouldn't it be refreshing if the leadership that Governor Bush has shown, along with Pete Leahy and Bob Bullock, could be transferred to Washington, DC, with President Bush and TOM DASCHLE and RICHARD GEPHARDT? Wouldn't that be refreshing? That is what Governor Bush would like to do because we think it works. We know it works because the test scores show that it works. 
   Madam President, we are making a huge leap in the right direction for improving public education, and we are going to the heart of the matter. We are making sure our children in the third grade can read, and we are focusing on the basics. We are focusing on reading, writing, arithmetic, history. 
   All of us have seen these polls of young people in our country where the television person walks up to the young person and says: What is the only State in America that is totally surrounded by water? 
   The young person can't answer the question. We know Hawaii is the answer, but I think we should focus on the basics--geography and history. That is what we are trying to do in Texas, and that is the kind of leadership we need for this country. 
   So I hope that we will examine the record in Texas in a positive way--or even in a neutral way, for Heaven's sake--because if you are neutral, you would see that Texas is a great place in which to live; that we have a great quality of life. Do we have problems? Sure. Are we working on those problems? Yes. We are doing it under the leadership of our Governor, George W. Bush. 
   Let me say, too, that we are also making great strides on the environment. We have a particular problem, particularly in Houston, TX, where 50 percent of the chemical refining plants in the world are located--the petrochemical refining plants. Fifty percent of the petrochemicals in the world are located on the gulf coast between Houston and Victoria. 
   I see that my time is up. I will step back and allow others to speak, but I will not step back if the record of Texas is misrepresented. I am here to stand for the facts and the good record of our Governor and our great State. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, once again I would like to make the record clear. Since the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts focused on health care and children's health care, I would like to talk about the Texas record. I would like to talk about Governor Bush's leadership on health care for our children. 
   Under Governor Bush, the percentage of Texans without health insurance has gone down while the number of Americans without health insurance has gone up. 
   I also think it is worth mentioning that the Governor, along with the bipartisan legislature, took all of Texas' tobacco money, $17.4 billion in tobacco money, and allocated almost every single penny--in fact, every single penny that was not put aside for education programs to try to encourage young people not to smoke has gone for health care, health care for children, health care for indigents. The money, wisely, was put into trust, and every county in Texas reaps the benefit of that trust fund because the interest on the trust fund is spent in each county for indigent health care. 
   So I think Governor Bush and the Texas Legislature are to be commended for focusing on health coverage for the people of Texas and for the children of Texas. In fact, under the leadership of Governor Bush, Texas spent $1.8 billion in new funding for health care for the uninsured. He also increased funding for childhood immunizations by $330 million, resulting in an increase in the percentage of immunized children from 45 percent to 75 percent. 
   Mr. President, although I have to say, once again, I do not think it gets anyone anywhere to talk about the record in Texas, and misrepresent that record, I think it is very clear that Texas is one of the leading States in our Nation in taking care of children, in improving its public education system, and it has been a focus of Governor Bush and our Democratic speaker and our former Democratic Lieutenant Governor; We now have a Republican Lieutenant Governor. We have improved health care and education.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. So I think Governor Bush's record is clear. I think the great speaker, Pete Leahy, working with the Governor, Bob Bullock, and Rick Perry, working with the 
   Governor, have done very well in health care for the children and for the uninsured in Texas. Just as we are proud of the improvements in our public education system--and certainly we recognize every State has problems. I do not think it does much good to talk about the records of different States. But I do think if you look at the record of Governor Bush in Texas on these issues, you will be impressed that it was a priority and that we have been successful in improving public education, in covering our children under the SCHIP program, making more people eligible for these programs, and immunizing our children so they would be protected from the normal childhood diseases. 
   I stand by my Governor and by my State. Once again, I do hope we can stop the misrepresentation of the record.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today we are considering the Conference report for the District of Columbia. This conference report also includes the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations act. 
   We crafted a good bill in conference. 
   We have fully funded the D.C. tuition program--which allows D.C. high school students greater educational choices beyond the border of this City. 
   We have fully funded the new metro station in the New York Avenue corridor, which I know is important to the economic development of the City. 
   We have $3 million in funding for the Poplar Point environmental clean up. 
   We have increased funding for the Courts. The salaries of Court employees are 19 percent below the level of federal court employees--thus--it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a quality workforce. 
   Our bill also increases the budget for offender services so that we continue the program of drug testing and treatment for offenders who are on probation or awaiting trial. 
   Much as been said in the past about ``riders'' to the District budget. This year, we have eliminated over 30 of last year's riders.  
   The bill will authorize the District's planned tobacco securitization program--the proceeds of which will be used to reduce debt or build reserves. 
   With respect to the District's reserves, we have restructured the reserve funds of the District so they can function more efficiently. This is probably the most important reform in this bill. 
   The District is supposed to hold a $150 million reserve now--and a budget surplus of 4 percent of revenues. 
   But we found last year that the District wanted to dip into the emergency reserve funds for things that are considered ordinary expenses. We also found that the reserves were really hollow--entirely dependent on how much cash flow the District had on any given day. 
   I didn't think this was good enough for this City. The bond markets want and need reassurance that the District's financial turnaround is sound. 
   We have restructured the District's reserves so that they will have both an emergency reserve and a contingency reserve. This is modeled on the practices of other cities. And, most importantly, when established, these reserves will be in cash and will be held in separate accounts, earning interest. 
   The contingency reserve, which will be 3 percent of their budget, is for unanticipated expenses, like court orders, new federal mandates or extremely bad weather. It will be more flexible. 
   The emergency reserve, which will be 4 percent of their budget, is for extraordinary needs, like natural disasters. It will be the backing for the financial soundness we seek. 
   In consultation with the CFO and the Mayor, we allow the District a seven year glide path to establish these reserves, but both have assured me the tobacco securitization program will be used to fund this emergency requirement now. There could be no better use than this and debt reduction. 
   The District has had a dramatic financial recovery. I consider this the last leg of the financial plan. This will serve as a true ``rainy day'' fund--one that is ready and able to be tapped in those circumstances. 
   To conclude, although the President has indicated he has reservations about the CJS bill--he has indicated that the D.C. portion of the conference report is a bill he would sign. 
   Madam President, let me now turn to the Commerce, Justice, State provisions. 
   I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their work on this bill. They have worked very hard to put more federal resources on our border, though we still have a long way to go. 
   These are not resources just for Texas. The drugs that come into the United States along the Southwest border will find their way into every city in the United States. The Southwest border is ground zero in the war against drugs. 
   Making our border more secure--makes every American city more secure from the scourge of drugs. 
   The Conference report provides for the hiring of over 400 new border agents. I would have preferred a higher number--but the Administration has dragged its feet on higher agents in the past--so we know this is a realistic goal for next year. 
   It provides $15 million in equipment upgrades for the border patrol. 
   It provides greater funding for DEA, with emphasis on helping drug threats at the State and local level. 
   The Conference report also addresses the ``upstream'' effect of more law enforcement on the border. 
   What has happened is this: as we have increased our law enforcement presence on the border--a strain has been felt on our judiciary system. 
   This bill provides for 13 new U.S. Attorneys along the Southwest border--where they are desperately needed. The five U.S. courts along the border are the busiest courts in the Nation--handling 26 percent of all the criminal cases in the United States. These new positions are desperately needed. 
   The bill also provides for two new Federal judges one in the Southern and one in the Western judicial district in Texas. I sponsored the bill to create 13 new judgeships along the border. I would have preferred the full number of judgeships, but I am pleased the Committee has accommodated the need for new judges in my State. 
   The bill does not provide badly needed salary increases for border patrol agents, which the Senate has passed and fought to produce. I will continue to press to bring our Border Patrol in line with all other border government salary schedules. 
   It is regrettable that the President has threatened to veto this bill, particularly over the immigration provision. I believe we have struck a balanced approach on this issue in this bill. 
   President Clinton's plan would grant broad amnesty to immigrants that arrived between 1982 and 1986. Our Border Patrol Officers have said ``a new amnesty would encourage innumerable others to break our laws in the future.'' I couldn't agree more. 
   Our proposal would provide greater due process to those who believe they were wrongly denied amnesty. We also shorten the waiting period for spouses and children to join their relatives in the United States. These relatives will likely be able to immigrate legally soon, but we allow them to come to the U.S. while their petitions are awaiting action. This is a reasonable proposal the President should accept. 
   Madam President, I will yield the floor and urge my colleagues to support the bill.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. David M. Laney, who soon will complete his term as a member of the Texas Transportation Commission. Governor George W. Bush appointed Mr. Laney to the commission in April 1995, designating him chairman and Commissioner of Transportation. In April 2000, he stepped down as Commissioner of Transportation, serving the remainder of his term as a member of the commission. 
   During his term on the commission, Mr. Laney has been the champion of the state's efforts to increase the state's share of federal transportation dollars returning to Texas. As chairman, he was a partner to the Texas Congressional delegation's efforts to develop fairer highway funding formulas, promoting the efforts of a coalition of ``donor'' states to work with Congress toward achieving at least a 90.5 percent return on payments into the Highway Trust Fund. As a result of our efforts, Texas received an increase of more than $700 million annually in federal highway funds and David Laney deserves a great deal of the credit. 
   In addition, he promoted increased federal funding for the nation's general aviation and reliever airports, which Congress provided in the Aviation Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21). Finally, Mr. Laney has been a strong advocate for the state's small urban and rural transit systems, working with Congress to provide much needed discretionary funding to address the vehicle replacement needs of these vital transportation systems, the most extensive in the nation. With these additional funds for Texas transportation programs, the commission will be better able to meet the tremendous transportation demands of the growing regional and international trade traffic in Texas. 
   With a look to the future, as Commissioner of Transportation Mr. Laney led the Texas Department of Transportation in its efforts to obtain the flexible financing tools it needs to help address transportation needs in Texas. He was successful in working with the Texas Legislature to create the Texas Turnpike Authority Division of the department, which provides toll-funding options for the state's major transportation projects. With his strong support and encouragement, the division has applied for and expects to receive an $800 million loan under the federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act for a major Central Texas turnpike project. Under Mr. Laney's leadership, the commission has used the Texas State Infrastructure Bank, authorized under the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, to provide needed assistance to localities to help move forward important transportation projects. 
   Mr. Laney also initiated a major Texas border strategy to address the demands of international trade traffic. 
   Throughout his tenure on the commission, Mr. Laney has provided strong and confident leadership to the Texas Department of Transportation, promoting the development of a first-class Texas transportation system. His legacy is a transportation agency with a menu of solid financial and operational tools providing a safe, effective, and environmentally-sensitive transportation system for the people of Texas and the nation. His dedication to transportation and his strong leadership on the commission will be missed. 
   Mr. President, I know my fellow Texans join me in this expression of appreciation to David Laney for his exemplary leadership on the Texas Transportation Commission.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it looks as though we are going to have to respond to the many charges that are being made on the Senate floor in the Presidential campaign. I am sorry it has come to that because I don't like to see that happening on the Senate floor. I am committed to not letting the record go unchallenged when I know for a fact the record is being misrepresented. 
   In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts earlier this afternoon misrepresented the facts about Governor Bush's record in Texas. I am very proud to say that Governor Bush has an outstanding record in Texas; that Texas is a great place to live; that Texas has surpassed New York now to be the second largest State in America. That is because so many people are choosing to come to Texas to live. They are coming for a variety of reasons. Quality of life is No. 1. A good solid public education system that is improving every day is another. Quality health care is another. We have many reasons to be proud of the record of our State and the Governor and the legislature of our State. 
   I will address first the issue of education. This has been the most egregious misrepresentation. In fact, the Rand organization that does research into many areas put out just this last July a comprehensive study of public education reforms in our country. The report based its analysis on the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests given between 1990 and 1996. The authors ranked the 44 participating States by raw achievement scores, by scores that compare students from similar families and by score improvements. They also analyzed which policies and programs accounted for the substantial differences in achievements across States that can't be explained by demographics. 
   What they were doing is taking 44 States that had significant public education reforms and determining what worked and what didn't. I will read directly from the press release that was issued by the Rand Corporation.  
   Math scores are rising across the country at a national average rate of about one percentile point per year, a pace outstripping that of the previous two decades and suggesting that public education reforms are taking hold. Progress is far from uniform, however. One group of states--led by North Carolina and Texas and including Michigan, Indiana and Maryland--boasts gains about twice as great as the national average.  
   I just learned that Senator KENNEDY made the charge that Texas is dead last in public education. 
   I think the Rand study released in July of this year that looked at a comprehensive set of scores from 44 States should be given some weight. 
   No. 2, from the Rand report:  
   Even more dramatic contrasts emerge in the study's pathbreaking, cross-State comparison of achievement by students from similar families. Texas heads the class in this ranking.......  
   I am not going to read the names of the States that are at the bottom because I don't think it is necessary. Texas is No. 1.  
   Although the two States are close demographic cousins, Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points higher on the NAEP math and reading tests than their.......counterparts. In fact, the Texans performed well with respect to most States. On the fourth grade NAEP math tests in 1996, Texas non-Hispanic white students and black students ranked first compared to their counterparts in other States, while Hispanic students ranked fifth.  
   The report goes on to say:  
   The most plausible explanation for the remarkable rate of math gains by North Carolina and Texas is the integrated set of policies involving standards, assessment and accountability that both States implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  
   I remind you that Governor Bush was elected in 1994 in Texas. That is when we started beginning to see the results of the reforms that have taken place. 
   Let's talk about Governor Bush's record. Since being elected Governor, George Bush has seen minority test scores increase by 85 percent. Overall test passage rates increased by 38 percent. Governor Bush and the legislature, working together, increased teacher salaries by one-third since his election, increased public funding of education by $8 billion, and per pupil  expenditures have increased by 37 percent. Under Governor Bush's education reform plan, social promotions were ended. We spent $200 million in new early education funding to make sure all third graders read at grade level. 
   That is the emphasis Governor Bush has made in Texas that is beginning to reap the great rewards shown by the students who have been tested in these recent tests that are now being studied. In fact, Texas is at the top of the class. It is because they are going to the third grade level to target students who don't have reading skills. Governor Bush believes that if a child can't read at grade level in the third grade, of course, the child is going to have trouble going through the public education system. 
   It does not take a rocket scientist to know if the child is trying to progress without reading skills, the child is going to fall behind. That is what we are trying to correct in Texas, and it is working. It is working. That is why our test scores are skyrocketing. 
   I think we need to put to rest all of the misinformation that is out there about the Texas public education system. We are very proud that we are putting the money into the system; we are increasing teacher's salaries; we are attracting more teachers so that our teacher shortages will go down. 
   Most public schools have teacher shortages, and we are trying to address that issue with creativity. We are trying to attract people into the classroom who have specific skills that we don't have in the classroom now because of the teacher 
   shortages. So we are targeting math and science and languages and computer skills. We are looking to retired military people, people retired from industry, and we are trying to attract them to the teaching profession because we think it is so important that our young people have access to this kind of quality in the classroom. 
   We in Texas stand second to none in the improvements in our public education system, and it is going nowhere but up. We know if we can catch those children in the third grade, they are going to have a chance to reach their full potential, and that is what Governor Bush is doing in Texas and what he wants to do for our country. 
   Let's talk about health care. Governor Bush and the Texas Legislature have led the effort to enact the Nation's first comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. In fact, Texas has a Patients' Bill of Rights, and it is a terrific program. It is working. It is working because we have an independent review process, because we are targeting health care; we are not targeting trial lawyers being able to sue HMOs--although that is allowed if all of the appeals are exhausted. It is allowed, but there are caps on noneconomic damages. So that brings more reasonable limits to irrational lawsuits, but it allows the protection of the patient who doesn't get the good care. 
   But the focus is not on retribution; the focus is on getting health care in the first place. It doesn't help the patient to be able to sue later for a terrible accident. What we want is for the health care decisions to be made by the patient and the doctor. That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights does in Texas. It became law while Governor Bush was our Governor, working with our bipartisan legislature. 
   Today, we have 100,000 children enrolled in the CHIP program. We will enroll 425,000 by the end of next year. We are in the process of educating parents about who is eligible for the CHIP program. We are going to reach every child who is eligible for this program so that our children will have health care. 
   Let me tell you what Governor Bush and the legislature did to make sure of that coverage. They allocated the largest part of the tobacco settlement that Texas got to the CHIP program for health insurance for every child in Texas, and they put into a trust fund billions of dollars from which the interest will go to every county in Texas for the purpose of providing indigent health care in those counties because, of course, in many counties in Texas the buck stops with them for the provision of health care for their indigent population. 
   This money will come in perpetuity to every one of the 254 counties in Texas. Every one of those counties will participate in the interest on that trust fund for their health care needs in that county, and that is a huge help for those counties providing that health care. That was done under the leadership of Governor Bush and the great speaker of the Texas House and the Lieutenant Governor of Texas. It was a bipartisan effort that made that happen. 
   So I think our Texas health care system is very sound. I have heard a lot of charges being made about the quality of our public education and our health care, and I just happen to know firsthand that those making the charges are misinformed. I don't think we need to run down one of the great States in our Nation in order to get advantages in the Presidential race. 
   I am disappointed, frankly, in my colleagues who would do this. I am disappointed that they don't have enough to say about their views and their visions for our country, that they have to come to the Senate floor and run down Texas in their campaign for President of the United States. I don't think it is necessary, I don't think it is proper, and I don't think it is seemly. I think we can do better in this country, and I don't think--at least I hope that not one person in this country is going to have his or her vote swayed because of what is happening in Texas. 
   I would like to think that if people are looking at Texas they have the facts and that they have a good feeling about my great State. I certainly don't think running down my State is the way to run a Presidential campaign because people are moving to our State by the thousands. That is why Texas is now the second largest State in America--surpassing New York. They are coming there because it is a good climate in which to do business; it is a good climate in which to create jobs; and it is a good climate in which to raise a family. It is a good place to live. And we have a Governor who has contributed a whole lot to make that happen. We have a great legislature that has worked with our Governor in a bipartisan way. 
   That is what our Governor would like to bring to the Congress. We would like to be able to work in a bipartisan way to make the laws that will achieve the dreams of every American child. We would like to have cooperation between the Republicans and the Democrats. But I don't think we are fostering cooperation when people come to the Senate floor and run down my State. I don't think that is very bipartisan, and I don't think it is very honorable. 
   I hope we can turn off the Texas bashing. I hope we can talk about the dreams and aspirations of our Presidential candidate. I hope we can give Governor Bush the credit for the reforms in the public education system that are making such a difference in the lives of so many Texans. Our children are learning to read and they are beginning to like school. They are wanting to stay in school, and they are not going to drop out of high school if they have a chance to see that their public education is going somewhere. We are giving hope to our children. We are taking care of them. That is what we should all want for all of our States. 
   I don't think we should have to continually come to the floor to defend our State. I hope I don't have to do it again. But I guarantee that I will be here again if I hear that one of my colleagues is bashing Governor Bush and the State of Texas. Every time I hear that is happening, I am going to come to the floor and I am going to ask for time to set the record straight because the record is a good one. The record is one of education reform that has a goal, that allows every child in Texas to reach his or her full potential, and a goal that we want for every State in this country. We want no child to be left behind. We want every child to reach his or her full potential with a public education--not that we don't wish the children who have private education well. We want them to have those choices. We want children to be able to go to private schools, or parochial schools, or public schools, or charter schools. We want all the options out there because we believe with all of the options that every child will then have a chance to do what is best for that child, and we believe the base of all of this is a strong system of public education. 
   We believe that a public education that has competition is a better public education. That is why we want the  choices and the creativity for our children's education. 
   I hope this is the end of Texas bashing. I hope this is the end of our congressional session so we can have our Presidential campaign on the merits so that the people of our country will be able to listen to the Presidential candidates. But I don't think we need to have a Presidential race that runs down the State of one of our candidates. Thank goodness we don't see that happening on the other side of the aisle. The 
   Republicans are not bashing Tennessee. We like Tennessee very much. We don't think it is necessary to run down a State from which another Presidential candidate comes in order to get advantages. We happen to believe Tennessee is a great State. We believe Texas is a great State, too. 
   I hope this is the end of this kind of politicking. I hope it is the end of using the Senate floor for political advantage in the Presidential race. 
   I hope we can give the credit that is deserved to the Governor of Texas and to the Legislature of Texas working together and for their willingness to address the issues of education reform, for their willingness to address the issues related to health care and health care coverage for our children because we have made it a priority in Texas. That is why it is such a terrific State; we believe in the jobs that are created in Texas and the good working people who live in Texas have been able to do very well because we have a healthy climate in Texas and a healthy business climate, as well as a healthy environment and a healthy climate in which to raise families. Those are the fundamentals of what our State has to offer, and it is why so many people are moving to our great State and why we welcome that move. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to correct the record that was created with some misinformation earlier today. I hope we will not have to defend Texas again. I hope we are very close to ending the Texas bashing because I don't think anybody is going to vote against Governor Bush because of misinformation about Texas. I think the people of America are smarter than that. I think the people of America deserve better than that. It is my fervent hope that they are able to hear the candidates' views on the issues without the negative campaigning on what is happening in Texas. I think if anybody would just come to Texas and see for themselves, they would be very pleased with the leadership of Governor Bush and our Texas Legislature. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I deny that that is the relevant point. Because, in fact, 41 States are behind in the CHIP program sign-up because when Congress passed the Children's Health Care Program, they gave the States 3 years to spend the money. It just happened that our State meets every other year in the legislature. By the time they were able to meet and start the CHIP program, the State had had a very steady influx of children. We are on the way, and 40 other States are in the same situation. 
   So I am going to reclaim my time. I would like for the rest of my 15 minutes to start now because I thought the  Senator from Massachusetts was going to ask a question. But I am not going to yield further. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts has been speaking for quite awhile about my home State of Texas. If there is more than 15 minutes before we start the foreign operations bill, I ask unanimous consent to be able to continue speaking until Senator MCCONNELL comes and have the full time to refute what I think are misrepresentations of the Texas record.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the State of Texas has just surpassed New York as the second largest State in America. That didn't happen because our State wasn't well run. It didn't happen because we have a sorry education system. It didn't happen because we don't take care of our children. It happened because we have a great quality of life. We have a Governor, George W. Bush, who is doing a great job, and we have a legislature led by our Lieutenant Governor, Rick Perry, and our House Speaker, Pete Laney. One is a Democrat; one is a Republican. They work together. That is the way we do things in Texas. 
   There has been a gross misrepresentation about Texas throughout the campaign for President and on the Senate floor today. I will tell the Senate why the State of Texas is in great shape and why it is absolutely unconscionable to trash Texas in order to get an advantage in the Presidential race. 
   Let's take education. Everyone would acknowledge that we have a problem in the public education system of our country. Our Congress, the Republicans, and our Governor in Texas have tried to open up our public education system. Governor Bush has tried to take the problems we have and put creativity and more State resources into those problems so that every child will have a chance to reach his or her full potential in our State of Texas. That is what we have tried to do in Congress for the entire United States. We have tried to put creativity into the schools. We have tried to give parents more choices. 
   Every time we do, however, it is the people on the other side of the aisle who throw up the roadblocks, who want to have the Federal Government, from the top down, dictate what the local governments and the school boards would do all over our 
   country. 
   If you think that Governor Bush disagrees with that, you are right. And so do I. He believes in local control. He is very pleased that Congress is going to put more money into public education, but he wants the decisions made by the people who know the children and who know what the children's needs are. 
   Let me tell you what he has done in Texas. We were very concerned about the high school dropout rate in Texas. It was especially high in our Hispanic community. Governor Bush believes, as do I, that if our young people are dropping out of high school, that is trouble--T-R-O-U-B-L-E--for all of us. It means those children will not have a chance to succeed, and it means our society is losing the benefit of a productive citizen. 
   Governor Bush said: Let's find out what the problem is. Well, we found out what the problem is. Many of those young people who are dropping out of high school can't read very well. So he said: We are going to attack this so that every child will be able to read at grade level, so that every child will be able to participate in public education all the way through the system. So we start testing our children in Texas in preschool, kindergarten, in the first grade, in the second grade. And in the third grade, the child must read at grade level. The child is tested. And if the child cannot pass the test, the child will not progress to the fourth grade. 
   That child will be given extra help to learn how to read until that child can read at grade level. Then that child will go to the fourth grade. Governor Bush believes that a child is not going to be able to learn multiplication tables if a child can't read in the third grade. Governor Bush wants to go back to basics in education. He wants reading, writing, arithmetic, and history to be the core subjects that are taught in our schools. That is what he has done in Texas. The test scores are going up, and especially they are going up among our minority students. In fact, we have phenomenal increases in the test scores of our minority students, which is the emphasis we have put in the program, because we are so hopeful that by starting at that third grade level, every child will be able to reach his or her full potential. 
   Texas is one of two States that has made the greatest recent progress in education according to the congressionally mandated National Education Goals Panel. African American fourth graders in Texas ranked first in the Nation in math. Since 1992, African American fourth graders in Texas have made the greatest gains in math, and Hispanic fourth graders have made the second greatest gains. 
   African American and Hispanic eighth graders in Texas ranked first and second in the Nation in writing. Texas eighth graders, as a whole, ranked fourth in the Nation. Under Governor Bush, the number of students passing all parts of the State skills test has increased by 51 percent. The number of both minority students and economically disadvantaged students passing all parts of this test increased by 89 percent. 
   I think that is a record of which our Governor should be very proud. 
   We have had problems in our public education system. We have had children who don't speak English in great numbers in our education system. We are a border State. We value education. Our Governor was the first to step up to the line and say we would educate every child in Texas regardless of whether or not that child was a legal resident of Texas. The children of illegal immigrants are educated in Texas, and that is under the leadership of our Governor. 
   So I think it is very important that we set the record straight because it is a good record. We take care of our children, and we believe a strong system of public education is the ticket to success in our country. We believe Texas is leading the way. 
   Now the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that a Federal judge had said we are not doing enough for the children in the insurance program that has been a part of Medicaid. I think that is very interesting because that lawsuit was filed when we had another Governor in Texas, not Governor Bush. That lawsuit was filed when Ann Richards was the Governor of Texas. Governor Bush has been in office for 7 years, so that lawsuit has been pending for over 7 years. I wonder what it was that made Federal Judge William Wayne Justice decide to rule in the last 6 weeks in that case. I wonder why he waited for over 7 years to declare that Texas was not meeting its responsibilities. Furthermore, I wonder why he waited until October 30 to ask for the report from the State--October 30 of an election year in which our Governor is running for President. I just ask that question about the timing. 
   As a matter of fact, it happens that our State is going to report that they are doing everything they can to cover every child with Medicaid and under the CHIP program because 41 States were not able to meet the 3-year mandate of the CHIP program, for a combination of reasons. Partly, it was regulations put out by the Federal Government that our States had to digest before they would be able to go forward and put the program in place. Our State legislature meets every other year, as do many other State legislatures. So once they met, they put the program in place. Texas has been going full steam ahead ever since that point. Mr. President, 100,000 children are now covered under our CHIP program; 400,000 are expected to be covered by the end of next year. 
   Under Governor Bush, the percentage of Medicaid-eligible children who get  prevention care has doubled from 30 percent to 60 percent. Congress is going to pass legislation that is going to help all 41 States that haven't been able to get their programs up completely and running, so that all of them will be covered and they will have the money they need, including Texas. So 41 States had to get the program up and going with legislatures that meet every other year. So the States and the Federal Government are working together to make sure children are covered, and our Governor is leading the way. 
   I want to discuss the Patients' Bill of Rights, which was mentioned by the Senator from Massachusetts. He acted as if we didn't have a Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas. We do have a Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas, and the Governor worked very hard to get that bill passed. The disagreement between the Governor and some of the people in the legislature, which was the subject of the negotiation, was how much the caps on pain and suffering lawsuits would be. The Governor thought they were too high. He didn't veto the bill; he let it go into law. In 
   fact, because he did that, it is the basis of the law that eventually Congress will pass, because it has very clear internal reviews and very clear external reviews and because those reviews are so comprehensive and independent, there have been virtually no lawsuits filed, which is exactly what you want. You want patients to be covered; you want them to get the care they need. You don't want a bunch of lawsuits in which the patient is a person forgotten in the process. You want a Patients' Bill of Rights so that you can get the care and because the internal and external reviews have been so good, the system is working. 
   It is law in Texas today because Governor Bush was the leader who worked to get those internal and external reviews, who worked to have reasonable caps, who let the bill become law, and who now, I hope, will lead our country to a Patients' Bill of Rights that will not be a lawsuit machine but will give patients and their doctors the ability to make their decisions. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts said our Governor, in running for the Presidency, has a prescription drug benefit for our elderly, but he said it was ``fuzzy.'' It is not fuzzy. He wants a prescription drug benefit for our elderly people who need it. He wants to do it immediately. He does not want one person to have to decide between a necessity in life and a prescription drug. So he is advocating exactly what we have been trying to do in Congress, which is to get money to the States immediately to help in a transition until we can have a real addressing of the issue of prescription drug benefits. He is advocating an option in Medicare so that every person will have the ability to have coverage, if that is the option the person in Medicare chooses to have--prescription drug benefits--something that would operate like Medicare Part B or Medicare Part C. 
   I think we should not have to criticize a State in order to make a point in a Presidential race. I don't think the people of America are very persuaded, and if Vice President GORE doesn't have anything else to talk about but the State of Texas, he should not be the leader of our country because I think most people would like to know what Vice President GORE and what Governor Bush are planning to do in the future for our country. I think their platforms are pretty clear. I don't think you have to say that the State of Texas is backward when we have one of the best qualities of life of any State in our Nation, and people are voting with their feet because they are moving to Texas by choice. Texas is a great place to live. We have wonderful people, and we have a legislature that operates in a bipartisan way. I don't think you would hear one of our legislators stand on the floor of the House or Senate and trash another State in order to make a point, because it is just not necessary. 
   We have a system of public education that is improving every day in Texas. It is under the leadership of Governor Bush that that is happening. We are covering our children in the CHIP program, and our outreach is comprehensive. We are trying to do the education efforts today so that every child who is eligible will know through that child's parents that they are eligible. 
   We have a Patients' Bill of Rights that is the leader in the Nation for patients in our State, with their doctors having control of their health care. We did it under the leadership of Governor Bush.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to discuss for a moment this Rand report that has been quoted so many times by Senator KENNEDY and others. It seems there are some people in the Rand organization who have put something out showing Texas in a bad light in the education system. 
   That was not a full study. Rand actually did a full and comprehensive study. It was released July 25 of this year. I will read a few highlights of the comprehensive study. The study examined and compared the results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress Tests taken between 1990 and 1996 among 44 States. They judged the States according to State score improvements, raw achievement scores, and scores comparing students from similar demographic groups. 
   Results from the Rand study show that math scores in Texas had improved at twice the rate of the national average. Texas was second among all States in improved math scores. Texas leads all States in a comparison of students from similar socioeconomic and family backgrounds. Texas African  Americans and non-Hispanic white fourth graders ranked first on this test in math in 1996. Texas Hispanic fourth graders ranked fifth. The study confirms earlier reports that Texas is one of two States that has made the greatest overall academic gains in recent years. 
   The report went on to say one reason why Texas has been so successful, according to the Rand study, has been the higher percentage of teachers who are satisfied with their teaching resources. Governor Bush provided those resources. He wants to do the same thing through initiatives such as Reading First, at the Federal level, which would offer training and a curriculum for teaching reading to K-through-12 teachers. 
   Governor Bush thinks reading is fundamental. I think his mother is the one who started that when she started the Reading First Program for America. He believes if a child can read, that child is going to be able to take the next steps in public education. That is why Governor Bush put the resources there in Texas. That is why the real Rand study that was comprehensive showed the great improvement in Texas. That is why his education plans for America will work because we want no child to be left behind in Texas or any other State. 
   I hope the campaign rhetoric doesn't hit the Senate floor again. I am not going to stand here and I am not going to sit in my office and listen to anyone else use Texas as a whipping boy, A, because Texas is a great State; B, we have a great Governor; C, the things that are being said are misrepresentations; and D, in Texas, where we have been behind in the past, Governor Bush has said we are going to get ahead. 
   We are tackling our problems. Every State has problems. I am proud of the leadership in Texas of our Speaker, Pete Laney and our Lieutenant Governor, Rick Perry, and our Governor, George Bush, who have worked together in a bipartisan way to make sure the resources are going into public education and into our children's health insurance program. It was our legislative leaders working with Governor Bush who said our entire State tobacco settlement would go to fund the children's health insurance program, and they took a huge part of our State tobacco settlement and put it in a trust fund in which every county in Texas will participate in perpetuity for the treatment of our indigent health care patients all over Texas. 
   That was the leadership of our State legislature, and our Governor. Because they do want quality health care for all our Texas residents. 
   Maybe I am a little biased, but I think I come from a very great State. I think the statistics prove it. I do not want to hear anyone else say that Texas is not meeting its responsibilities in education, in health insurance, in patients' rights--because we are a leader. We are a leader and we want everyone in America to have the quality of public education that we are building to get in Texas. We want every child in America to reach his or her full potential. We want every child to have health insurance coverage. We want every person in Texas to have quality health care. That is why all of our tobacco settlement is going for health care or education programs to educate young people on the hazards of smoking. That is it, that is the entire use of our tobacco money: to educate young people on the hazards of smoking and health care for every citizen of Texas who needs it. 
   I am very proud of our record. I am proud of our Governor and I think he is the person who can bring these qualities to the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have just passed the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 2000. I am very pleased that we have been able, in a very bipartisan way, to pass this bill. I would like to just talk a little bit about how we came to pass the Aviation Security Act of 2000. 
   Thanks to Senator SLADE GORTON, the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I was able to chair a hearing in which we heard from the FAA, particularly Admiral Flynn, about the state of our airport security. ``What is the state of our airport security?'' we asked. We wanted to know if we were doing everything we could to give our traveling public the most security possible. 
   Admiral Flynn did a report and shared that with the Members of the Senate who came to the hearing. Every single Senator who attended the hearing became a cosponsor of the bill that we have just passed because there were some areas that we could clearly see needed to be made more strict, more stringent, just to make sure that we take every single measure we can to make our airports totally secure. Not that they are not, but there were some areas in which we could do better. 
   So after the hearing and because of the outstanding testimony of Admiral Flynn of the FAA, we did put together a bill that was quite bipartisan. Chairman JOHN MCCAIN of the Commerce Committee came together with Chairman SLADE GORTON of the Aviation Subcommittee. Senators HOLLINGS, INOUYE, BRYAN, and ROCKEFELLER all became immediate cosponsors of the bill. With that bipartisan group, we were able to make the changes that have been passed by the House and now will go to the President. 
   Six hundred million travelers will pass through U.S. 
   airports. Their safety depends on the soundness of the inspection points and the checkpoints, and we all have been through those monitors and we know how important it is that we have the best equipment and the best trained technicians to make sure we do not have any kind of firearms or explosives of any kind going into our airplanes. 
   So we were able to pass this bill. I just want to make a couple of the points that are important in the bill. 
   First, today, a person who has a lapse in employment history--whether it would be a year, 18 months, 2 years--would have a criminal background check done before they could be hired to be an airport baggage screener. 
   Under the bill that we are passing today, there will be a criminal history record check on every person who becomes a baggage screener. 
   Secondly, we looked at the airport training requirements for airport baggage screeners. We found that in the most industrialized countries there is a minimum of 40 hours of required training before a person can become a baggage screener, but in America the standard is 8 hours. 
   The committee and the Congress believe we need to have more hours of required training and a test for baggage screeners. That will happen because of the bill we have just passed. 
   Third, the security procedures in sensitive areas, such as the air traffic control towers, will be beefed up. And there will be prescribed security protocols and sanctions for people who violate those protocols. 
   And fourth, the new generation of explosive detection systems will be utilized at a higher rate because of the bill we have passed today. 
   I think we have done a very good job. I am very pleased that we had such a bipartisan effort on this piece of legislation. It could not have happened without the House and the Senate working together and so many people who did come into the negotiations on this bill. The leadership of our chairman, JOHN MCCAIN, and our subcommittee chairman, SLADE GORTON, were essential, along with Senators HOLLINGS, INOUYE, BRYAN, and ROCKEFELLER. 
   I also thank the staff who worked so hard. As you know, many times Senators have 10 things that are being asked of them at any one time. Without very good staff work, this would not have passed. So I especially thank my Commerce Committee staff legislative aid, Joe Mondello, who did yeoman service in making sure the bill got through committee and worked out all the little things that came up that could have unraveled the bill and did not. On Senator MCCAIN's staff, Mike Reynolds, and Rob Chamberlin, who also did terrific work in making sure we got this expeditiously through the committee in the last hours of the session, because we did not want to wait 60 days before we could bring this back next year. It is too important. 
   The air traveling public deserve to have the very best airport security. That is what this bill will allow. I believe the President will sign the bill. I urge him to do so. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
   During this month, a number of public and private agencies, organizations, and foundations will increase their efforts to make Americans more aware of the impact of this disease, as well as the need for early detection and increased resources to search for better treatments and ultimately for a cure. 
   Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among all women, and the leading cause of cancer death among women aged 40 to 55. By age 80, women have a 1-in-12 chance of developing the disease. This year alone, an estimated 175,000 women and 1,300 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Of those diagnosed, more than  41,000 women and 400 men can be expected to die from the disease. 41,000 women, that is about 117 per day--117 mothers, daughters, wives, and sisters whose lives will be cut short and whose families will be devastated by their loss. And, as I noted, the disease can also affect men with no less impact on them and their families. 
   But many of these deaths can be prevented, through regular screening and early detection and treatment. In fact, if detected early through self-exams and mammograms, the survival rate for most types of breast cancer exceeds 90 percent. And, while the number of breast cancer diagnoses continues at an unacceptably high level, the overall survival rate is increasing. We are beginning to turn the tide against breast cancer. 
   Though the phenomenal activities of private groups like the Susan G. Komen Foundation, of which I am proud to have been a founding supporter, more and more women are getting the message: get smart and get screened. Through events like the wildly popular ``Race for the Cure,'' the Komen foundation has also raised over $215 million to help fund breast cancer research. My friend Nancy Brinker, sister of the late Susan G. Komen, has led the group from an idea to a leading force in health care that has, without doubt, helped to save and improve thousands of women's lives. 
   Many other groups and individuals are also helping to further the cause. The National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations has worked to expand research and public education in this area. The Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization is another group that has been very active in supporting those directly and indirectly affected by breast cancer. 
   With regard to research, I have worked with my colleagues in the Senate, leaders like Senator MACK of Florida and Senator SPECTER of Pennsylvania, to ensure that our Federal commitment to disease research, and particularly that for breast cancer, continues to grow. 
   We have made remarkable progress. While federally-supported breast cancer research was not a large part of our overall federal disease research budget even a few years ago, that has changed dramatically in recent years. NIH funding alone on breast cancer totaled almost $500 million last year, and is expected to top $525 million this year. In fact, over the last decade, NIH breast cancer research funding has increased by 600 percent. 
   In addition, I have worked hard as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure that our breast cancer research that is conducted under the auspices of the DOD health research infrastructure continues. This contributes an additional $175-plus million per year to this cause. 
   Most recently, I was proud to have joined forces with my colleague, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, to extend the issuance of the Postal Service's new Breast Cancer Awareness Stamp. To date, over 214 million of these stamps have been sold, generating $15.1 million for research. The first round of grant announcement using these funds was actually just made. These funds will support innovative and promising new research opportunities in understanding and treating breast cancer. 
   These efforts have begun to pay off. Through the development of ever-more effective diagnostic tools, like digital mammography, and through the development of innovative new treatment and preventative drugs, like Tamoxifin, we are slowly but surely beginning to get the upper hand on this disease. 
   But early detection remains the key. That is why the American Cancer Society recommendations on screening are so important: women aged 40 and above should have annual mammograms and clinical breast examinations; women aged 20 to 39 should have clinical examinations every three years; and all women 20 and over should conduct a breast self-examination every month. 
   Finally, I would note that the Senate just this week passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, a bill that ensures that women who do not have health insurance and who are found to have either breast or cervical cancer through the Federal Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, will get the follow-up care they need. 
   We have come a long way from the days when former First Lady Betty Ford brought breast cancer out into the national discourse, beginning the long overdue dialogue and public awareness campaign to save women's lives. But we still have much to do to match her courage and to live-up to her vision of the day when all women are appropriately screened and when we defeat breast cancer once and for all. 
   During this month, I urge my colleagues in Congress and all Americans to reflect upon this issue, to support research and efforts, and to arm themselves with the knowledge they need to respond should the unthinkable occur in their lives or in the lives of a loved one. Working together, we can and will beat breast cancer.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, having heard my distinguished colleague from Vermont talk about the judicial selection process, I rise to commend Senator HATCH and his leadership of the Judiciary Committee. 
   It is very difficult to accommodate all of the requests and responsibilities that are entailed in a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. I think Senator HATCH has done the very best job he possibly could in getting appointments through, appointments that are reflective of Clinton administration priorities. The vast majority of Clinton appointees have gone through. In my home State of Texas, we have had 20 nominations. Senator GRAMM and I have supported 18 of those, and 17 have gone through. There is still one pending that we support. 
   I think Senator HATCH has bent over backwards to do his due diligence but to respect the wishes of the Democratic side and the administration. I don't want to leave unchallenged some of the comments made that indicate that serious consideration has not been given to every single Clinton appointee and that in most cases those appointees have been put forward. 
   It is important that a lifetime appointment be scrutinized because there is no accountability of that lifetime appointment. We need to look at all of the factors surrounding a particular nominee, knowing the power that a Federal judge has and that the accountability is limited. 
   I applaud Senator HATCH. I think he has done a terrific job under very difficult circumstances. I hope he will continue the due diligence and also continue apace with the nominations process.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Hospital Preservation Act that Senator ABRAHAM and I introduced last year. We achieved partial relief for hospitals last year, but we have reintroduced it this year in an attempt to get more relief for the beleaguered hospitals of our country. 
   Today we have both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee working on this very important legislation. We will have legislation that will, at least for this year, restore the cuts that are being made to our hospitals in Medicare payments, but I am hoping we can get more. In fact, there are many areas of our health care system that have been undercut by a combination of the Balanced Budget Act and have actually been cut even more forcefully by the Health Care Financing Administration than was ever intended by Congress. 
   When we passed the Balanced Budget Act, we said we would look at the effects, and if we needed to refine it in any way, we would do that. Congress has met its responsibility in that regard. We had the Balanced Budget Act Refinement Act passed. We have come back and restored cuts that were too much. That is what we are doing in the bill that is before us or will be before us very soon, that is now being considered by the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee. In fact, the legislation would increase payments to hospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies, managed care organizations, and other health providers that are paid under Medicare. 
   This legislation is needed especially for our hospitals because they are the front line of our health care delivery system. This legislation builds on legislation Congress passed 
   last year that reversed some of the cuts in provider payments that did result from the Balanced Budget Act and from excessive administrative actions taken by the Health Care Financing Administration. 
   Last year's bill contained important provisions that have helped preserve the ability of American hospitals to continue to provide the highest level of health care anywhere in the world. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act that  Congress passed last year did make the situation a little brighter for some of these struggling hospitals. It eases the transition from cost-based reimbursement to prospective payment for hospital outpatient services. It restores some of the cuts to disproportionate share payments, and it provides targeted relief for teaching hospitals and cancer and rehabilitation hospitals. 
   I was proud to have been the prime advocate in the Senate for one of the provisions in that bill that restored the full inflation update for inpatient hospital services for sole community provider hospitals, those located primarily in rural areas that provide the only institutional care in a 35-mile geographic area. However, last year's bill was really just a start. I think we have all heard from hospitals that they are really hurting. Hospitals are actually beginning to close, in Texas and all over the Nation. Independent estimates are that this trend will only get worse unless something is done. 
   I and many of my colleagues in Congress continue to hear from hospital administrators, trustees, health professionals that they were struggling to maintain the quality and variety of health services in the face of mounting budget pressures. With the statutory and HCFA-imposed cuts that they were seeing, many efficiently run hospitals began for the first time to run deficits and threaten closure. For many of these hospitals to close, particularly those in rural areas, would mean not only the loss of life-saving medical services to the residents of the area but also the loss of a core component of local communities. Jobs would be lost. Businesses would wither, and the sense of community and stability a local hospital brings would suffer. 
   My colleague, Senator Spence ABRAHAM of Michigan, and I began the task of looking for the best way to provide significant assistance to these hospitals to make sure the payments they were receiving for taking Medicare patients were fair and adequate to enable them to continue serving our Nation's seniors, and also to have the support they need to run their hospitals. We decided to try to expand the sole community provider hospital provision to all hospitals. 
   The bill we have introduced will make sure that Medicare payments for inpatient services actually keep up with the rate of hospital inflation. We will restore the full 1.1 percent in scheduled reductions from the annual inflation updates for inpatient services called for by the Balanced Budget Act. Moreover, rather than just applying to a small group of hospitals, this legislation would benefit every hospital in America, providing an estimated $7.7 billion in additional Medicare payments over the next 5 years. 
   Now, you may ask, where is that $7.7 billion going to come from? Well, when we passed the Balanced Budget Act, we projected savings of $110 billion over the 5-year period that should have occurred from the cuts we put in the Balanced Budget Act. But, in fact, instead of $110 billion, we are now projecting $220 billion in savings. So the $7.7 billion just for this part of the bill has already been saved, and $100 billion more is estimated when you take into account the whole 5 years. 
   So the bottom line is, we cut too much; we are going to restore part of those cuts; and we are still going to be approximately $100 billion ahead. So we will have saved $100 billion, as we intended to do, but we will restore the cuts that have caused such hardships to the hospitals throughout our country. 
   The bill that is being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee contains a full 1-year restoration in the inflation update for hospitals. The pending Senate Finance Committee bill would restore the cuts in 2001, but it only delays the 2002 cuts until 2003. This is progress. 
   I so appreciate Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN's efforts in the Senate Finance Committee. But I don't want to delay those cuts. I want to restore the cuts for the full 2 years. I hope that in the end we can go ahead and do that because these hospitals need to know that there is a stability in their budgeting, that they will be able to look at the restoration in the cuts for the next 2 years. They need to be able to plan. They need to know they will have the adequate funding for Medicare that they must have to give the services in the community and to support the hospital for all of the people and the health care needs of the community. 
   So we are not doing anything that would bust the budget or go into deficits. The fact is, this is a refinement. We have cut $100 billion too much, and we are restoring $8 billion of that. 
   In the bill that is being considered by the Senate Finance Committee, we also will strengthen the Medicare payments for the disproportionate share hospitals, for home health care agencies, for graduate medical education, and for Medicare+Choice plans. We are not out of the woods, but we are taking a major step in the right direction. 
   I commend Senator ROTH for his leadership of the committee, along with Senator MOYNIHAN. I implore Congress to move swiftly on this very important legislation. We cannot go out of session without addressing the issue of keeping our hospitals from suffering disastrous cuts in Medicare--cuts that they cannot absorb and cuts that are not warranted. This is our responsibility, Mr. President. 
   I thank my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, for helping me so much on this issue. He has been a leader. After listening to hospital personnel in his home State of Michigan, he came to me and said, ``We have to do something; let's do it together,'' and I said, ``Great,'' because we must act before we leave this year in Congress. We cannot go forward without addressing this very important issue for the hospitals and health care providers of our country.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have introduced on behalf of myself and Senators GRASSLEY, GRAMM, KYL, DOMENICI, DODD, FEINSTEIN, HOLLINGS, and SESSIONS. 
   We have submitted this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to deal with the issue of the certification of Mexico. Several of us introduced a bill earlier in the session after the election of the new President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, to try to address the issue of two new administrations in both of our countries that will be faced with the automatic certification of the issue of how we are dealing with illegal drug trafficking as a bilateral effort in our two countries, but with two administrations that have not had time to sit down and come up with a plan that would cooperate fully in this very important effort. 
   Since time is so short, we have come up with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I think will at least say it is the will of the Senate. If we can pass this before we adjourn sine die, I think it will be a major step in the right direction to give some relief to the two new Presidents who will be sworn in for both of our countries and to say, first of all, we in the Senate take this very seriously. One of the most important issues for our countries is dealing with illegal drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States. Realizing that neither President could be held accountable yet for the programs that should be put in place, we are going to have a 1-year moratorium. 
   This is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution: 
   Whereas Mexico will inaugurate a new government on 1 December 2000 that will be the first change of authority from one party to another; 
   Whereas the 2nd July election of Vincente Fox Quesada of the Alliance for Change marks an historic transition of power in open and fair elections; 
   Whereas Mexico and the United States share a 2,000 mile border, Mexico is the United States' second largest trading partner, and the two countries share historic and cultural ties; 
   Whereas drug production and trafficking are a threat to the national interests and the well-being of the citizens of both countries; 
   Whereas U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drugs is a cornerstone for policy for both countries in developing effective programs to stop drug use, drug production, and drug trafficking; Now, therefore, be it 
   Resolved,

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my intention to speak for a couple of  minutes, and then I will suggest the absence of a quorum and ask if the distinguished Chair would also like to say a few words. And if he indicates such, I will step aside. 
   I want to speak about something that is happening that is very important to our country and to the rest of the world. As we speak, hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavian people are demonstrating in the streets, saying they want the election result to be declared. It was an election. There is a question about how free it was. 
   Certainly President Milosevic is trying to have a runoff, to have time to get his troops back together. But it is clear the people of Yugoslavia are standing up for their rights. During all the time the United States has been dealing with the issue of President Milosevic and his wife continuing to keep down the people of Yugoslavia and the satellite countries--Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo--to keep them from having the opportunity to express their free will, we in America have said to the people of Yugoslavia: Please, make your voices heard. 
   We will be supportive of what the people of that country want to happen. Clearly, there has been somewhat of a revolution in this last election period. 
   I hope and pray for the people of Yugoslavia that they will get their voice, that they will have their voices heard, that they will have representation in Parliament, and that the truly elected President of Yugoslavia will be able to take office. 
   It is impossible for us to know if the election was fair. It is impossible for us to know if there should be a runoff. Certainly the people have taken matters into their own hands, and they have shown a spirit that cannot be denied. 
   The hearts and prayers of the people of America are with the people of Yugoslavia today, hoping they will be able to have a free and fair Presidential election; that they will be able to have a Parliament that is truly representative of the people of Yugoslavia. That extends to the people of Montenegro, the people of Macedonia, the people of Kosovo, that they, too, will have their free will to be in control of their countries. 
   We are watching in our country and we wish them the best. We hope the people of Yugoslavia can take control of their own destiny. That is what we would wish for every person in the world, for every country in the world, and no less certainly for Yugoslavia. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great Texan and great American, Mr. Edwin L. Cox and to call out his outstanding service to the nation through his support of the Library of Congress. On Thursday, October 5th, The Library of Congress will be celebrating its bicentennial and the 10th Anniversary of the James Madison Council. The Madison Council is the Library's private philanthropic organization and, along with Council Chairman John W. Kluge, Ed Cox helped found and build the Council from a handful of members in 1990 to more than one hundred committed supporters today. 
   Madison Council members have supported more than 200 Library projects since 1990. These gifts account for almost half of all private gifts to the Library. Ed served as the first Vice-Chairman of the Madison Council when it was founded in 1990, and became the first Chairman of the Council's Steering Committee in 1992. To support the Library in acquiring new and rare items, Ed and fellow Madison Council member Caroline Ahmanson formed the Acquisitions Committee, which has been instrumental in acquiring rare and historically significant items for the Library. Ed also established the Edwin L. Cox American Legacy Endowment, which makes possible the purchase of rare and important materials highlighting our history. 
   Ed Cox's long record of service to his country includes his duty in the United States Navy, where he earned the rank of lieutenant. He left to begin building one of America's great independent energy companies, Cox Oil and Gas. He has translated his success into a strong record of public activism, joining the boards of the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, the Texas Cancer Society, and the Dallas Society for Crippled Children. 
   In 1978, recognizing his business acumen and boundless contributions to a better society, Southern Methodist University renamed its business school in his honor, and The Edwin L. Cox School of Business is recognized as one of America's best. 
   In this Bicentennial year of the Library, Ed continues to give of himself and to lead others in support of the Library. He chaired the Council's Bicentennial Committee and mobilized Council members to participate in the Library's Bicentennial programs. He has also been a key member of the Library's Trust Fund Board for the past 10 years. 
   James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, has called Ed ``one of the Library's most valued friends.'' His dedication and service have made the Library's collections richer and its services to the Congress and the Nation more comprehensive than ever. All Americans are the beneficiaries of Edwin L. Cox's generosity in enriching one of our nation's greatest institutions.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very important vote. It is a very important issue. I have been a strong supporter of opening relations with China, of opening trade with China, not because China has been the kind of ally we would all hope it would be but because I have believed that having open trade relations with them would improve the relationship; that if we had some leverage in a trade relationship, we would be able to ask them and have some leverage for them to have fair trade, to recognize intellectual property rights, and to become a part of the community of nations. 
   But it seems to me we are saying we want free and open trade and nothing else should matter; that if we have free and open trade, we should not stand up for our national security interests. That is what I have been hearing on the floor now for 2 days. If we are going to engage China on issues such as North Korea and weapons proliferation to Iran and Iraq, as was proposed by the Senator from Delaware, how can we engage them if we say, by the vote today, it is not really a big issue to us, that weapons proliferation takes second place to trade? 
   For me, national security doesn't take second place to anything. I think it should be the position of the Senate that we are responsible for the national security of our country and that that is our most important responsibility. If we know China is sending its nuclear formulas to places such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and that that is going to put American citizens in direct harm's way and stop the balance of power between North and South Korea and make it heavily favoring North Korea, are we really going to stand by and say we will try to engage them when we have not spoken to them in any way when we had the chance to do it, as we do right now? I hope not. 
   It has been said that it will kill this bill if we add an amendment. I wasn't elected to the Senate to rubber stamp the House of Representatives. I wasn't elected by the people of Texas to rubber stamp the President. I was elected to the Senate to do what I think is right and to fulfill my responsibilities to the people I represent. National security is my No. 1 responsibility. If it kills a bill because the Senate adds an amendment and allows us to talk to the President about it and talk to the House of Representatives, then I think that is our role and our responsibility. I reject totally those who would say don't vote for this amendment; it is a killer amendment; it will kill the bill. 
   It will not kill the bill. We have brains. We know we might have to compromise in some way, but we want to be forceful that we are not going to allow China to spread nuclear weapons of mass destruction around the world, especially to rogue nations that would do our country wrong. We are not going to stand up and say today, I hope, that we are afraid to amend a bill because it might kill it. No, that is not why I was elected to the Senate. I was elected to the Senate to do what I think is right. I hope the Senate will speak very forcefully today that we can work with the House and with the President and we will pass free trade with China, with national security addressed. That is the issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand up for their people, as they were elected to do. Let's work this out and have a free and fair trade agreement that is good for both countries. Thank you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of the marriage penalty. Today, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly, 270-158, in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it is going to become law because the President has vetoed the bill, and even the overwhelming margin of 270-158 is not enough to override the President's veto. 
   So 21 million American couples are going to have to suffer an inequity in the Tax Code again this year. They are going to have to suffer and pay $1,400, average, in taxes just because they decided to get married. If two people, a policeman and a schoolteacher, get married, they get hit the hardest because they suffer from the marriage penalty tax. 
   I am very proud of the House of Representatives for trying to override the President's veto. I am proud that they spoke overwhelmingly, even though it was 20 votes shy of the two-thirds majority that was necessary. But we need to fix the marriage penalty tax. We need a President who will sign marriage penalty relief, and we need a President who will work with us to have real tax relief for the citizens of our country who are working so hard to make this economy great. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Thompson amendment. 
   I have been listening to the debate on the THOMPSON amendment for the last day or so. I am very concerned that his amendment has been portrayed as a bill killer. 
   I support PNTR. I want to open trade with China. This is very important for the future of both of our countries. But I am also very concerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I cannot see any situation in which the security of the United States of America would take second place to a trade issue, even a most important trade issue. Nevertheless, I would never, ever I put the security of our country in a secondary position. 
   To say that we cannot go back to the House and resolve our differences because we would vote on a responsible amendment that would require a reporting of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is just beyond my comprehension. This is the United States Senate. To say we cannot amend a bill that has been passed by the House would be the height of irresponsibility.  
   I am also speaking today in favor of normal trade relations with China because I want our countries to have a mutually good relationship. The idea that we would have a good relationship on trade but one that gives a wink and a nod to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to people intent on hurting the United States of America is not a fair trade. I couldn't possibly exercise my responsibility as a Senator and vote against the Thompson amendment. 
   In early 1969, newly elected President Richard Nixon asserted:  
   One-fourth of the world's people live in Communist China. Today they are not a significant power, but 25 years from now they could be decisive. For the United States not to do what it can at this time, when it can, would lead to a situation of great danger. We could have total detente with the Soviet Union, but that would mean nothing if the Chinese are outside the international community.  
   Today, President Nixon's words sound remarkably prescient. China is undeniably a major world power, thanks in large part to leaders such as Presidents Nixon and Bush and Reagan, Secretary Jim Baker, Secretary Henry Kissinger, China is not outside the international community but neither is China fully a member in good standing of the family of responsible nations. 
   The major issues our two nations must confront are difficult and complex: China's military buildup, arms sales and proliferation, the future of Taiwan, bilateral trade, and human rights. All of the previous Presidents in my lifetime have recognized the unfolding importance of China, and they have all pursued policies aimed at constructive engagement with the Chinese Government. 
   The question at issue with our vote on PNTR and our vote on the amendments that condition the Senate's approval of PNTR must be, what are the underlying goals of our relationship with China and what are the primary issues that should guide American policymaking and actions. 
   My answer is, our policies should be focused on cultivating a stable and peaceful Asia. We should look to economic competition and mutual prosperity to bring this about, and we must at all times consider the security interests of the United States. 
   As the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, JESSE HELMS, pointed out yesterday, the Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a direct threat to the national security of the United States. I share his view that it would be irresponsible for us not to address that threat. 
   The Federal Government has no greater responsibility nor 
   higher duty to the people of our country and to our allies than to provide for the common defense of the United States of America. 
   The bipartisan amendment offered by Senators THOMPSON and TORRICELLI is a responsible vote. It does not scuttle PNTR, as some have warned. This is the responsible action of the Senate. It would be my fervent wish that we could vote our conscience on this very important issue, and not in any way respond to the scare tactics that have been put forth that this will kill the bill, but instead do what is right for both of our countries; that is, open, normal trade relations, and secure the United States from weapons proliferation by China or any other country or rogue nation that would seek to harm our people or our allies anywhere in the world.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. I submit this bill on behalf of myself, Senator DOMENICI, Senator DODD, and Senator FEINSTEIN. 
   The purpose of the bill is to put a 1-year moratorium on the decertification process for Mexico as it relates to the illegal drug trafficking issue that we have been dealing with for so long. The reason we are introducing this bill and hope for expedited procedures is that we have just seen a huge election in Mexico in which, for the first time in 71 years, there is a president from the opposition party, from the PRI, which has been the ruling party in Mexico all this time. 
   Democracy is beginning to be real in Mexico, and we want to do everything we can to encourage this democracy. We want to do everything we can to have good relations, better relations, with our sister country to the south, Mexico. 
   Vicente Fox has visited the United States. He has opened the door for better relations. I know our next President, whoever he may be, will also want to do the same thing. 
   It is a very simple bill. It is a bill that says for 1 year we are not going to go through the certification-decertification process, and hopefully our two new Presidents will begin a new era of cooperation in this very tough issue that plagues both of our countries. Having a criminal element in Mexico and a criminal element in the United States certainly is a cancer on both of our countries, and we want to do everything we can to improve the cooperation in combating this issue. 
   The inauguration of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico on December 1st should usher in a sea change in Mexican politics as well as the U.S.-Mexico relationship. Not only will 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) come to an end, but hopefully so too will come an end to the flood of illegal drugs from Mexico into the U.S. 
   Despite the promise of a new day in our relationship with Mexico, a dark cloud looms on the horizon--the annual drug certification ritual in which Congress requires the President to ``grade'' drug-producing and drug-transit countries each March 1 on their progress in the war on drugs. 
   The facts have remained essentially unchanged over the past several years. Mexico is the source of about 20-30% of the heroin, up to 70% of the foreign grown marijuana, and the transit point for 50-60% of the cocaine shipped into the United States. 
   Mexico has never been decertified, but the thought of being in the company of Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan on this list, has done little except to antagonize their political leadership and thwart expanded cooperation. There is no reason to go through this exercise next March and grade President Fox after fewer than 120 days in office. Further, with a new U.S. President taking office on January 20, there is no reason to set up a major confrontation between the two before they have even had an opportunity to work together cooperatively. 
   I am proud to introduce legislation with Senators PETE DOMENICI, CHRISTOPHER DODD, and DIANNE FEINSTEIN which will grant Mexico a 1-year waiver from the annual certification process. I hope the Congress will pass this waiver legislation before we adjourn. 
   This 1-year waiver will give President Fox the time he needs to develop and implement a new drug-fighting strategy in Mexico. And it will give the United States the time we need to work with President Fox in the creation of this new strategy, and to finally put in place the law enforcement needed to stop the flow of drugs across our 2000-mile shared border. 
   The United States has enjoyed a long-term partnership with Mexico that has grown closer and more cooperative over time. The North American Free Trade Agreement cemented and strengthened our relationship--and our interdependence. Just last year, Mexico surged past Japan as our nation's second largest trade partner. 
   But partnership is a two-way exchange, and in recent years we have drifted into tolerance of unacceptable conditions in the arena of drug trafficking and the endemic corruption it causes in communities on both sides of the border. The border has been a sieve for drugs, and it has resulted in a degree of lawlessness in Texas and along the U.S.-Mexico border that we have not seen since the days of the frontier. Even worse, the war on drugs plays out daily on nearly every schoolyard across our nation. 
   I am more optimistic than ever, though, by the election of Vicente Fox, that Mexico is prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to contain the drug threat. And as he seeks to make progress on this almost overwhelming issue, we do not need to poison the spirit of early cooperation by injecting drug certification. 
   Specifically, this bill waives for one-year only the requirement that the President certify Mexico's cooperation with the United States in the war on drugs. This waiver does not exempt Mexico from any of the reports or other activities associated with the certification process. It simply says the President does not need to ``grade'' Mexico by choosing between certification, decertification, or decertification with a national interest waiver. 
   This 1-year drug certification waiver will give both the United States and Mexico time to develop a process that will make us partners rather than adversaries in addressing the one issue that can make moot all of the promising opportunities between our two nations. 
   Still, President-elect Fox and the Government of Mexico should make no mistake about the priority the United States places on winning the war on drugs. We will expect this to be a top priority of our new President, and we hope that this will be a priority of President Fox. 
   The Mexican government must take effective, good-faith steps to stop the narco-corruption that infects and demoralizes both of our countries. We ask them to take effective action to destroy the major drug cartels and imprison their kingpins, implement laws to curtail money laundering, comply with U.S. extradition requests, increase interdiction efforts and cooperate with U.S. law enforcement agencies. 
   President-elect Fox has shown every willingness to work with the United States in developing these objectives. He knows the challenges ahead, and especially the ones that will come as Mexico's democracy continues to evolve and be tested. The United States should not add the pressures of the certification process next year to a situation so full of risks and opportunities.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if Senator DOMENICI would yield for 1 more minute, I would like to, first of all, thank him for allowing us the time to introduce this bill. If we are going to be able to pass this by the end of the session, it is imperative that we get the bill into the process. I also thank the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from California for being prime cosponsors because this will show the Mexican people and the new President-elect of Mexico that we do want cooperation. 
   I believe it is in our long-term best interests that we develop trade relationships with our neighbor to the south, that we work with them on investments because as we increase the standard of living in Mexico, I think many of the immigration problems and the problems dealing with illegal drugs will also be wiped away. 
   So this is a new era. I think this bill will signal that we do want cooperation and friendship. I have high hopes for President-elect Vincente Fox. I have high hopes that our new President will focus on this issue as well, to try to come up with a whole new process beyond certification and decertification, which certainly has not worked very well in the past. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for setting aside time this morning so many of us could pay tribute to PAUL COVERDELL. Certainly last week, many of us who were friends with PAUL really were not up to giving him a proper tribute because the shock of losing one of our friends was so enormous that we really did not feel that we could get through the kind of tribute that PAUL deserves. So I thank the majority leader for giving us this time. 
   We have now had a chance to collect our thoughts about the sudden death of our colleague and friend, PAUL COVERDELL of Georgia. One need only look at the breadth of representation at the memorial service in Atlanta to understand the many ways in which PAUL's life affected ours. 
   At the service, it was hard to miss the sweet but sad irony that, for one last time, PAUL COVERDELL was the great unifier. The Democratic Governor of Georgia, Governor Barnes, called PAUL COVERDELL--one of just a handful of Republicans in the State legislature when Governor Barnes, himself, was elected to the legislature in 1974--he called PAUL his best teacher in politics. Senator KENNEDY, our colleague from across the aisle, with whom Senator COVERDELL had tangled on many important education issues, sat right next to me in the church to honor PAUL COVERDELL. 
   Senator COVERDELL is sorely missed in the Senate and in Georgia. 
   He is not missed because he was a great legislator--but he was. His innovative approach to helping families have more flexibility in education spending became the Coverdell education savings account bill. 
   We do not feel his loss as badly as we do simply because he was a great Senate leader--but he was. His leadership could bring disparate policy and political strands together to form a single, strong bond that allowed us to move forward with our priorities. 
   Others have said it, but I will repeat for emphasis: PAUL COVERDELL was as close as any Senator comes to being indispensable to his party. 
   He will not be missed most because he was a giant in Georgia politics--but he was. Over the past third of a century, he built, from virtually nothing, the Republican Party of Georgia, starting at a time when, much as in my own home State of Texas, Republicans numbered only a few in the state Legislature. 
   Georgia is a better state today--and so is Texas--because there is a strong two-party system. PAUL COVERDELL is the reason why. And the people of Georgia registered their appreciation by making him the first Georgia Republican in over a century to be reelected to the Senate.  
   And he won't be missed the most because he was an outstanding administrator and a man of vision as the Director of the Peace Corps--but that is certainly the case. 
   PAUL was the right man for the job in 1989 when President Bush appointed him to head the Peace Corps, just as the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. 
   In 1989, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia were emerging from behind the Iron Curtain. PAUL COVERDELL thought about his agency. It was a creature of the Cold War, created to keep the Third World from falling prey to communism by exposing those countries to the energy, promise and ideals of American youth. 
   The Peace Corps helped win the cold war, and PAUL COVERDELL had the vision to know that it could also help win the peace. Although it had been dedicated to helping underdeveloped countries with subsistence agriculture and infrastructure projects, Director PAUL COVERDELL saw the promise of helping win the Cold War peace when he asked: ``Why not in Europe, too?'' 
   Under his leadership, the Peace Corps began sending volunteers into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, blazing a new trail for this old cold war agency. On June 15, 1990, President George Bush wished farewell to the first such volunteers as they departed for Hungary and Poland. 
   Today, those countries are firmly in the sphere of freedom and democracy, and last year joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. PAUL COVERDELL'S vision had become a reality. 
   When he was director of the Peace Corps, Senator COVERDELL emphasized a particular program that had gone fallow given the many other priorities the agency was facing. This program, part of the Peace Corps' legislative mandate to foster greater global understanding by U.S. citizens, offered fellowship to returning volunteers in exchange for their agreement to work in an underserved American community as they pursued their degree. 
   Senator COVERDELL placed renewed emphasis on this program as Director of the Peace Corps and has been credited by Peace Corps alumni for his leadership in this area. These fellowships, funded through private-sector financed scholarships or reduced tuition agreements with universities and colleges, have been a great success. 
   PAUL obviously continued his pursuit of excellence in education with many innovative proposals right here in this body. I will be offering legislation that renames the program the PAUL D. COVERDELL Peace Corps Fellowship in memory of his commitment to both the Peace Corps and education. 
   A greater legislator, a leader of his party and of his State, a man of peace and vision: These surely describe, PAUL COVERDELL, but they do not explain the depth and breadth of warm outpouring that we have seen since his sudden death last week. 
   More than any other reason, Senator COVERDELL will be missed because he was a sweet, warm man, utterly without pretension.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Houston Minority Business Council and the other groups and individuals who are now preparing for ``EXPO 2000, a Business Opportunity Marketplace,'' to be held on August 31, 2000, in the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas. This annual event is Texas' largest minority business trade fair and offers a meeting ground for corporations seeking to identify experienced minority entrepreneurs. 
   Over the last decade, the number of minority owned businesses grew in the  U.S. by an impressive 168 percent. These businesses generate half a trillion dollars in revenue and employ nearly four million workers. This success has been in large measure due to the efforts of groups like the Houston Minority Business Council and the dedicated individuals throughout Texas and this nation who seek to expand economic opportunities for all Americans. 
   The EXPO has been an outstanding example of such efforts, and has opened the doors of the marketplace by successfully pairing minority business owners with representatives from more than 220 local and national companies. The event provides these minority entrepreneurs with direct marketing opportunities with corporations, government agencies and educational and financial institutions that need capable contractors to support their missions. The EXPO has produced real results, with two thirds of participants reporting having obtained contracts for as much as two million dollars within a year of the event. 
   I have worked hard in the U.S. Senate to build upon efforts like this to expand Federal contracting opportunities to small and disadvantaged business entrepreneurs. I have helped lead the efforts to defend programs such as the 8 (a) Federal business development program, worked to curb the ``bundling'' of Federal contracts that hurt small businesses, and I have served as a champion of Small Business Development Centers, which assist small businesses in getting the capital and assistance needed to get started and expand. 
   I again commend the organizers, supporters, and participants of EXPO 2000. These fine men and women represent the best of Texas' entrepreneurial, hard-working and neighborly spirit. I wish them all much future success, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to ensure that all Americans share in the fruits of our economic prosperity.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I keep hearing the Democrats talk about tax breaks for the wealthy. I have talked to couples who make $30,000 apiece. I have asked them directly: Do you think that you are wealthy? Do you think that you do not send enough money to the Government? Do you think you are paying more than your fair share? 
   The answer is, they do not think they are wealthy. They do think they are doing their fair share. And they are trying to do something for their children that they will not be able to do if they send $1,400 more to Washington, DC, instead of being able to save it for their children's education or taking a family vacation or giving them extra computers or books or clothes that they would want to have for their own families. 
   A couple that earns $30,000 each is not wealthy. We must understand they are hard-working Americans. Many times the spouse who wants to stay home to help their children does not do so because they think they need to work to bring in the extra income. We are talking about tax relief for the hardest hit among us--people who make $25,000 a year, $30,000 a year, $40,000 a year. They are paying 28 percent in Federal income taxes. And they do not think they are wealthy. They earn this money, and they deserve to keep more of it. 
   We are talking about 50 million Americans who would benefit from the  tax relief we are giving today. Twenty-five million couples will get relief from the marriage tax penalty. 
   Over 60 percent of the House of Representatives voted to pass this bill. Over 60 percent of the Senate will vote to pass this bill. 
   Is the President going to fly in the face of the elected Representatives--in those numbers--who want to give relief to hard-working Americans? 
   If we were saying that this was going to take up all of the surplus, that we were not going to be able to pay down debt this year, that would be one thing. That is not the case. Instead, we are being good stewards of our taxpayer dollars. We are putting a fence around the Social Security surplus so that it stays in Social Security. We are going to pay down the debt by billions this year. 
   But we think it is time to return to the people who earn the money more of the money they earn to keep for the decisions in their families. 
   Mr. President, tear down this unfair tax. It is time to have a tax correction for the hard-working married couples in this country. 
   We are sending the bill to the President today to do just that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for not giving up on marriage tax penalty relief for hard-working American families. He deserves praise because there is no doubt this has been a rugged road. 
   We passed marriage tax penalty relief last year and sent it to the President in a bill that had other tax relief measures. The President said: No, that is too much tax relief for the American people; send me smaller bills. 
   Under the leadership of Senator ROTH, and with the help of our distinguished assistant majority leader, DON NICKLES, SAM BROWNBACK, JOHN ASHCROFT, SPENCER ABRAHAM, ROD GRAMS, together as a team we said we were going to send the President a clean marriage tax penalty relief bill; we were going to make sure that hard-working American families who are paying a penalty for being married got relief this year. That is the result of what we have done today. 
   Sixty percent of the Senate today is sending this bill to the President. Over 60 percent of the House passed the same bill this week. We say to the President: You asked us to send you a smaller bill, and we are doing it. 
   Most of us wanted to give tax relief in a bigger way. We wanted to go all the way through the 28-percent bracket, but the President said no. We came back with 15 percent, doubling of the standard deduction through the 15-percent bracket. What that means is a couple earning between $43,000 and $52,000 combined will stay in the 15-percent bracket. If one person in a couple makes $25,000 a year and the other makes $35,000 a 
   year, they will stay in the 15-percent bracket longer. 
   It means tax relief for every American couple. Every American couple who uses the standard deduction is going to get relief because that standard deduction is doubled. Fifty million people in our country will get tax relief if the President signs the bill. 
   We are increasing the amount of the earned-income tax credit because we believe married couples who have just come off welfare or who are the working poor deserve that earned-income tax credit so they know that working is better than being on welfare. We want them to have the incentive to do that. We want them to have the pride of going to work and contributing to their families every day because we know they think better of themselves when they do that. 
   I do not see how President Clinton can use an excuse to veto the bill we are sending him today. I do not see what excuse remains. We have taken all of the excuses off the table. 
   He said in his State of the Union Message to Congress and to the American people he favored marriage tax penalty relief. We sent him a bill last year; he vetoed it. He said there were too many other tax cuts in the bill. Today, we are sending him a plain, simple marriage tax penalty relief bill for hard-working Americans who earn in the $25,000 to $35,000 range of income. That is who will benefit. 
   I have heard people on the other side say that this is a tax cut for the rich. There is no way anyone who has visited in the home of a couple, each of whom make $25,000 a year, can say that those people are rich. We say they have earned this money and we want them to keep more of the money they earn. The fundamental difference is we believe the money that people earn belongs to them. We do not believe it belongs to the Federal Government. 
   We have a non-Social Security surplus. This is only letting them keep more of the money they earn rather than sending it to Washington because we are being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars today. We are setting aside the Social Security surplus for Social Security only, we are paying down the debt, and we are giving back to the people part of the money they earned if the President will sign the bill. 
   This week has been a good week for hard-working Americans, for small business people, and for people who own farms and ranches because we have given relief from the death tax to small businesses and family-owned farms so their heirs will not have to sell that business and put people out of jobs, and we have given marriage tax penalty relief. 
   This is the right thing to do, and I urge the President of the United States to hear 60 percent of the Senate and 63 percent of the House of Representatives who said they believe in marriage tax penalty relief, and we urge the President of the United States to sign this bill and give relief to Americans today because this will take effect immediately. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, cheerful, fun, accessible, down to earth, loyal, friend--those are the words you think of immediately when describing PAUL COVERDELL. I am not going to make a long statement today because I know there will be a time set aside for our memorials to PAUL COVERDELL. I have seen some of our friends today--PAUL'S friends, my friends--and many of them do not feel capable of talking about him right now. It is not that he wasn't one of our greatest friends. They are not here because they can't talk about him yet. 
   This is a man who served our country in so many ways, all the things a good citizen should do: He served in the Army; he was the head of the Peace Corps; he was a wonderful Senator, one of our leaders in the majority--the fourth highest ranking among us. 
   I do want to say more about him later, but for now I think our majority leader said it very well last night. All of our hearts are broken for the loss of this wonderful man who will have every tribute that we can give him in the future weeks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are not talking about a tax cut today. We are talking about a tax correction. We are talking about 21 million married couples in this country having tax equity. 
   We have heard the arguments: This is a tax for the rich. Is a schoolteacher who makes $30,000 a year and a policeman who makes $32,000 a year a couple who are rich? That is what the other side would have you believe. They think this is a tax cut for the rich. 
   I ask the question: Does a schoolteacher and a policeman believe the Federal Government can decide better how they should spend their own money than they can decide for themselves? That is what it gets down to. 
   When I hear the other side saying this is going to cost the Government too much, I think: Who do they think this money belongs to? Do they think it belongs to the people who earn it or do they think it belongs to people in Washington, DC, who have never met the families who are paying these taxes? I think the money belongs to the people who earn it. 
   We are looking at a $2 trillion non-Social Security surplus. We are talking about tax cuts. With the death tax and the marriage tax penalty relief that we have given in the last week in this Senate, it would be 10 percent of the projected non-Social Security surplus--10 cents on the dollar. 
   What are we going to do with this money if we don't let people keep more of the money they earn? Are we going to dream up new programs that will not affect these people? I don't think that is the right approach. 
   We are talking about tax relief for hard-working American families--people who make $30,000 a year or $32,000 a year or $35,000 a year--because we believe marriage should not be a taxable event. We believe people should be treated the same if they get married. If they are two working people who are trying to save their money to buy their first home, they should have the right to do it with their own money, especially since we are talking about 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. 
   We are talking about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars today. We are talking about letting hard-working families keep the money they earn to do a little bit better for their children or to be able to start a family or buy their American dream home. 
   That is what we are talking about. We believe the family can make the decisions for themselves better than someone in Washington. 
   Marriage penalty relief is what we are talking about. Tax equity is what we are talking about. We are talking about fairness today for hard-working Americans.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator BROWNBACK and I are going to make statements about the bill. This is my bill. I have been working on marriage penalty relief for the last 4 years. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, Senator BROWNBACK, and I, along with my colleague, Senator GRAMM, have all made this a very high priority in our legislative agenda. We have made this a high priority because we believe it is un-American to make people choose between love and money. That is what the marriage penalty does. 
   In America, if you make $30,000 and you are a schoolteacher and you marry a policeman who makes $30,000, all of a sudden, you owe more in taxes. I thought it was interesting; the Senator from Massachusetts just said we have spent a trillion dollars by giving death tax relief. We spent a trillion dollars, and what do we have to show for it? 
   I have to ask the question: Whose money is it? Is letting people keep more of the money they earn in their pocketbooks and to decide how they want to spend it wrong? I think we should let people keep their money. I don't consider it spending a trillion dollars, allowing people to keep the money they earn. I think it is the reverse. 
   I believe we should not be spending other people's money, when we are running a huge surplus and don't need it in the Federal Government for new programs. I believe the American people can make better decisions about how they spend the money they earn than we can here in Washington.  
   So when you are talking about tax relief, you are not talking about spending money. It is not the Government's money. It belongs to the people who earn it. Government, by the consent of the governed, will take some money for the good of everyone--for national defense, for clearly Federal issues that cannot be done by people individually, for our security. But it becomes confiscatory when a couple making $30,000 apiece has to pay $1,000 more in taxes just because they get married. That is what we are trying to eliminate today. 
   When the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts says we have done nothing for the average family, I just ask him if a policeman and a schoolteacher constitute an average family. I think they do, and I think they deserve the $1,000, or $1,400, more they are paying in taxes to make the downpayment on their first home. That is help for the American family. That is help for the average family. A young couple who make $30,000 each and get married may not be able to save for a downpayment if they are having to pay $1,400 more in taxes just because they got married. 
   So tax relief is not spending money. Spending money that other people earn is spending money--their money. I think there is a huge difference. 
   The bill we have before us today would double the standard deduction so that if you get married, you don't get penalized. Today, if two single working people get married, they will pay approximately $1,100 more in taxes because of the standard deduction. We want to double the standard deduction because we don't think it should be different for two working singles or a married couple, both working. So we want the standard deduction to be $8,800, exactly double the standard deduction. 
   Secondly, we want people in the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket not to be punished because the got married and were pushed into a higher tax bracket. We do this by widening each bracket for married couples so that it is exactly double the bracket size of a single taxpayer. So in the 15-percent bracket, if you are single or married, it will not make any difference because you will not go into the next bracket if we can pass marriage penalty relief because, of course, that is the problem. When a schoolteacher, who makes $26,000 and is in the 15-percent bracket, marries a policeman who makes $26,000 and is in the 15-percent bracket, they go into the 28-percent bracket, and that is why they pay more in taxes. We want them to be able to stay in the 15-percent bracket, each of them making $26,000 a year. That 
   is exactly what our bill does. 
   Our bill increases the earned-income tax credit because we know that people--especially people coming off welfare--need to be able to have an earned-income tax credit to make sure they do better working than being on welfare. The Senate bill increases the earned-income tax credit parameters by $2,500. That is higher than the House version of the bill by $500. We think that is right. We want the people at the lowest end of the spectrum to know it really does make a difference that you work. We want it to be a benefit. 
   Another important aspect of our bill is preserving essential tax credits for families. Important tax credits such as the $500 per child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the HOPE scholarship credit for families who want to send their children to college, the credit for expenses related to child care--they would all remain intact, regardless of the alternative minimum tax. Many families are finding that, with the alternative minimum tax, they lose the basic deduction that everyone else gets. The $500 per child tax credit should apply, regardless of whether a person is in the alternative minimum tax category. 
   We are trying to have a balanced approach for people who have a real problem. Just prior to this debate I, and several other Senators met with some of the couples that are affected by this bill. We had a couple from San Antonio, TX, Noe and Connie Garcia. He works for an insurance company; she is a Government employee. When they did their taxes last year, they estimated that they paid over $1,000 more in taxes because they are married. 
   We had a very young couple, Hubert and Min Joo Kim, come to visit with us today. They live in Maryland. She is a teacher; he is an engineer. They have been married for 2 years, and they have a 1-year-old daughter named Isabelle, who is absolutely a precious child. But they are losing the ability to do some of the things they would like to do for Isabelle because they are paying a marriage tax penalty. 
   Earlier this year I met with Kervin and Marsha Johnson live in Washington, DC. Kervin is a D.C. police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They were married last July. This year, they paid almost a $1,000 more in taxes because they chose to get married. 
   Mr. President, these are just a few of the 21 million American couples who are suffering from the marriage penalty tax. This is not just tax relief, this is a tax correction. This is correcting an inequity that I don't believe Congress ever intended. Congress did not intend to say: If you are a policeman and you make $30,000 a year, and you marry a schoolteacher who makes $30,000 a year, we want you to pay $1,400 more in taxes. I don't believe Congress ever intended that to happen. 
   I think it is time for Congress to correct this inequity. If we pass this, next year the vast majority of couples will get immediate tax relief as we increase the standard deduction. Beginning the year after next, we start the phased-in increase of the tax brackets. 
   We are going to be debating this bill today, and we are going to start voting on some amendments Monday night. 
   When we passed marriage tax penalty relief once before, the President vetoed the bill. He said he didn't like some of the other tax cuts that were in the bill. The President said in his State of the Union Message that he favored tax relief for American families. He has said he favors marriage tax penalty relief. He said: Send me those bills individually because then I can pick and choose. So we sent him individually the elimination of the earnings test on Social Security recipients. He signed that bill. Today, because Congress acted and the President signed the bill, a person who receives Social Security benefits can work as much or as little as he or she wants to work. There will be no penalty. There will be no earnings test. We have opened the doors to hundreds of thousands of our senior citizens who would like to earn extra income. 
   Today we passed the elimination of the death tax. It is going to the President because we believe the American dream does not have fences. We believe the American dream is, if you come to America, you will have the freedom to succeed, and it will not be dependent on who your grandfather was. It will be dependent on you. If you want to work hard and give your children a better chance than you had, we want you to be able to keep the fruits of your labors and give your children that chance. 
   We have passed that. We have sent it to the President. We hope the President will sign that bill. Now we have marriage penalty relief. This is the marriage penalty relief for middle-income people who do not have the ability to make the choice not to get married because they want to start a family, and they want their children to grow up in a healthy, wholesome atmosphere. They don't have that choice because our tax code punishes them for doing so. 
   We are going to correct this inequity. We are going to pass marriage penalty relief. We are going to do what the President asked us to do; that is, send him the bill by itself. I hope he will sign it so we can give marriage penalty relief to hard-working American families. 
   I will close and ask that we hear from Senator BROWNBACK from Kansas, who has been the lead cosponsor of marriage penalty relief. We have worked for years side by side, along with Senator ABRAHAM, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator GRAMS, and my colleague, Senator GRAMM, to see this come to a successful conclusion. 
   I hope we can give the middle-income people of our country--people in the 15-percent bracket, the people in the 28-percent bracket, and people who get earned-income tax credits--more of the relief they deserve because I reject the argument that tax relief is spending money. Tax relief is spending money only if you think the Government has a right to the money you earned, and I don't think the Government does. I think the people who earn the money are entitled to that money. Tax relief is not spending money because the  Government doesn't own the money that is earned by the hard-working people of this country. We want them to keep more of it. That is the bottom line in this debate. 
   I would like to yield the floor to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask to be notified at 2 minutes because Senator CRAIG from Idaho also desires to speak. 
   Mr. President, if the highway trust fund were going to be affected at all, I could not be a sponsor of this amendment. But the highway trust fund is specifically held harmless. 
   We passed a budget resolution in this Senate that said we would give $150 billion in tax relief for this Nation over the next 5 years. We are talking about roughly $12 billion of that money that we have already allocated for tax relief for hard-working Americans. That is what will keep the highway trust fund totally whole. 
   The highway trust fund will not lose one penny. There will be no safety crisis. There will be no stoppage of money going into the flow for the highway trust fund. In fact, this is a tax relief measure because we have had a crisis that was not expected. We have had a crisis with families going on vacation, consumers, people who have to drive to work every day. What about the independent trucker who is now paying $150 to $200 a tank more than they have ever paid before because the price of gas is so high? 
   We must give this temporary relief, as we take longer term measures to try to take our dependence on foreign oil down to a level that is acceptable. Until we do that, we need to give this immediate relief. We have it in the budget to do it. We will not touch the highway trust fund. 
   The leaders in this effort--Senator ABRAHAM, Senator FITZGERALD, Senator GRAMS--come from States that are particularly hard hit. They are States where truckers are saying they can't meet their contract requirements. They may even lose their trucks. 
   Mr. President, I urge support for the Abraham amendment.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, shortly before the July 4th recess, the Senate passed an Emergency Supplemental spending measure as part of the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This measure dealt with a number of critical needs, including aid for fire victims in New Mexico and funds to continue the war on drugs in Colombia. I am pleased that this legislation also included $12 million to reimburse county and municipal governments along the U.S.-Mexico border for the high costs that they have incurred in handling drug prosecutions and incarcerations for the federal government. 
   Dramatic increases in manpower and resources for the Border Patrol and Customs Service has meant dramatic increases in drug and alien smuggling and illegal crossing apprehensions. Our border counties, which have handled these cases for the federal government for many years, have borne heavy costs of these prosecutions with no reimbursement from the federal government. These are some of the poorest counties and communities in the nation, and they can no longer afford to pay the costs associated with an expanded caseload they are handling for the federal government. 
   Specifically, this provision will enable the United States Attorneys to assist border county and municipal governments in the Southwest Border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California with their court costs, courtroom technology needs, the building of prisoner holding spaces, administrative staff, and indigent defense costs that are associated with the handling and processing of drug cases that would otherwise fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal government. 
   I appreciate the help and commitment of Senator GREGG, Chairman of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator STEVENS, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for working so closely with me to address the needs of the Southwest border. I also want to thank Jim Morhard, Staff Director of the Commerce-Justice-State panel, and Kevin Linskey, for their hard work on this matter. Jim and Kevin serve both the Committee and Senator GREGG very well, and their efforts on the staff level are making a difference in improving the lives of people living along the U.S.-Mexico border.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of this bill. There is no question that what the Senator from New Jersey has just said has some resonance when you talk about paying dues to society. 
   But this is not money that has never been taxed before. This is money that was taxed when it was earned. It is money that was taxed when it was invested. It has been taxed and taxed and taxed. Who could say that an average family who now pays 40 percent of their income in taxes is not giving back enough to society? 
   On top of all of the taxes they paid on this money, now we are saying we want to change the American dream, which has always been to come to our country--come to America where you have the freedom to work as hard as you want to work, do as well as you want to do, and give your kids a better chance than you have. That is what the American dream has always been. Those who are against this tax are saying: No, no. That is not the American  dream anymore. What we are saying in America is come to America and you can be this successful, and as long as you don't go beyond this, it is OK. 
   We should not put boundaries on success in America. That built our country. Hard work of people who are judged on what they are and not on who their grandparents were is what has built this country. 
   The estate tax takes away part of the incentive for people who work so hard to give their kids a better chance than they had. 
   It hurts small business. Seventy percent of all family-owned businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 87 percent don't make it to the third generation. That affects the small business itself, but it affects a lot of people who have jobs in those small businesses. It is the little people who are getting hurt because they don't have jobs anymore. 
   I have read stories where the main employer in a small town had a family-owned business and could not make it because they had to sell the assets of the business in order to pay inheritance taxes. 
   Among a survey of black-owned enterprises, nearly one-third say their heirs will have to sell the businesses to pay the death tax, and more than 80 percent report they do not have sufficient assets to pay the death tax. In fact, the president and CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce has written a letter in support of this bill because he says the total net worth of African Americans is only 1.2 percent versus 14 percent of the population. 
   The CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce supports the bill before us today. He said African Americans have been stuck at 1.2 percent of the total net worth of this country since the end of the Civil War in 1865, and that getting rid of the death tax will start to create a new legacy and begin a cycle of wealth building for blacks in this country.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the condition of the classrooms within our military dependent schools. A number of our classrooms contain asbestos, roofs leak, classes are overcrowded, three or four teachers have to share the same desk, science labs are 30 plus years old and potentially unsafe, and some schools are not in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act. 
   I am ashamed that military families who live on base are forced to send their kids to school facilities in these conditions. I was even more disturbed when I found out the many other  school districts that teach large numbers of military dependents have similar infrastructure problems. 
   Amazingly most kids have done well despite this environment but I worry about the impact the deteriorating school facilities has on declining military retention and recruitment. The condition of these schools is clearly a quality of life issue for military families. 
   Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to help alleviate these problems and ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment for more than 80,000 children of members of our armed forces. 
   My amendment establishes a grant program within the Department of Defense to assist school districts with repair and renovation costs for facilities used to educate large numbers of military kids. The program would enable qualified school districts to apply for grants up to $5 million every two years to help meet health and safety, class size, ADA, asbestos removal, and technology requirements. 
   The program would also assist school districts faced with significant enrollment increases due to increases in on-base housing or mission changes. Lastly, school districts could seek assistance for repair and renovation costs of Department of Defense owned schools being transferred to a local school district. 
   For example, at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia a DOD owned elementary school is being transferred to the local school district but $4 million in repairs is needed to bring the school up to the local district's safety and fire standards. 
   Why is Department of Defense assistance needed? Most of the school districts serving large numbers of military children have limited bonding ability or no tax base to raise the necessary capital funding. 
   For example, seven public schools districts that serve military dependents are located solely on the military installation and in turn have no tax base or bonding authority. The seven schools rely on impact aid and state funding and almost all repair or renovation expenditures come at the expense of instructional funding. 
   The Department of Education is authorized to provide construction funding for impacted schools but only $10 million is provided for hundreds of impacted schools nationwide. An additional $5 million is available for school facilities owned by the Department of Education but the needs of those schools far exceed the available funding. 
   The Department of Education has essentially abdicated its responsibility to ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment at federally impacted schools. We often hear of the need for more federal dollars for school construction but who deserves this more than the children whose parents serve in our armed forces. 
   Schools that teach large numbers of military dependents receive supplemental impact aid assistance through the Department of Defense, $30 million in FY 2000 benefitting about 130 schools. However, the funding is not sufficient to meet major repair and renovation costs. 
   A comprehensive program is needed to address this serious quality of life issue. And, without Department of Defense assistance tens of thousands of military children will continue to learn in inadequate and unsafe facilities. 
   This amendment would benefit the 30 most heavily impacted school districts that teach military children. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important quality of life issue that will benefit more than 80,000 military children.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator COLLINS, the cosponsor of this amendment, who has worked with me because of the very example that she just gave. 
   She has the situation in her State where this actually has curbed the creativity of public schools in offering more options for parents who believe their adolescent boys or their young girls would do better in a single-sex setting. In fact, in Detroit, MI, there is a boys school that has the same success that Senator COLLINS has just mentioned about a girls class in Maine; the boys are able to have a single-sex atmosphere. And sometimes it is shown by studies that adolescent boys do better in that atmosphere. 
   We want public schools to have the same options and the Federal help that are available in parochial and private schools for creative approaches and solutions to our education problems. We want options, not mandates. But we want every child in this country to reach his or her full potential. We want that child to be given opportunities in a way that best fit that child's needs. 
   That is why I think this amendment is going to be overwhelmingly accepted in the Senate--just as these amendments have been in the past. It will give the guidance to the Department of Education that will clarify the issue once and for all; that we want absolutely every option available in our public schools that will give every child in this country the ability to succeed. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor and ask my colleagues for their support 
   of the Hutchison-Collins amendment.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly because I think we have agreement in a bipartisan effort on this amendment. I am very pleased that we will be able to offer this amendment and hopefully clarify some of the issues that have surrounded single-sex classrooms in schools for public education. 
   As most people know, title VI is the part of our education funding that allows for new and innovative and creative approaches to public education. We have set aside money so school districts can come forward and say that their school districts need this particular type of emphasis. If it is creative, and it serves the needs of that particular school district, they can get Federal funding for those kinds of programs. 
   One of the types of education that has been proven in certain instances to help the girls or boys who have participated are single-sex schools and single-sex classrooms. Many parochial schools and private schools are single sex. There are girl schools and boy schools. Some parents want to have their children in that atmosphere because they believe that sometimes girls can excel if they don't have boys in the class and they are more willing to speak up. This has been shown in many instances to be the case. And the same is true particularly with adolescent boys where they have single-sex schools, and they are not diverted by having girls in the class. They do better in some circumstances. 
   We are not saying that we prefer this approach. We are not saying that we mandate it. We are not even suggesting that it be done. We are saying that we want to have as many options for public school districts and students as we can possibly give them so that the local community and the parents can make the decision for the boys and girls who are attending those schools about what will give them the best chance to get the best education that they can get. Allowing them to have title VI funding for a single-sex school or single-sex classroom is one way to put one more option out there. That is what this amendment does. 
   I am very pleased to have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to try to clarify this situation because, in fact, we have several public schools that are single sex. 
   The Young Women's Leadership Academy in East Harlem is a girls school. California has three girls schools and three boys schools. Western High in Baltimore is over 100 years old. It is a girls school. Philadelphia has a girls school that has been quite successful for many, many years. 
   We say if this is an option that parents want to pursue, we want to have that option on the table. Parents may not be able to afford a private school or maybe they prefer public education. Let's give them another option among the many that we are seeing now in creative learning and better opportunities for the young people in a particular school district. That is what the amendment does. 
   I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. I believe there is no opposition to this amendment. I am very pleased that is the case because if we can clarify this and if we can open more options for school districts to have to meet specific needs of students and their individual school districts, why not? 
   That is what our Federal dollars should do--allow the decisions to be made at the local level with as many options as we can possibly give them. 
   I appreciate the support of everyone in the Senate. I have worked with many Members of the Senate. Senator COLLINS is a cosponsor of this amendment. Senator COLLINS has been one of the strongest supporters of girls schools and classrooms and boys schools and classrooms of any Member of the Senate. 
   I look forward to having our vote tomorrow. I hope, frankly, that it is unanimous. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks of several of my colleagues who spoke previously on several issues of importance to me and my home state of Texas with regard to provisions in the fiscal year 2001 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill. 
   The bill as presently drafted would rescind important welfare funding to states under the program known as ``TANF'' (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families). It would also cut the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program by $1.1 billion. Finally, the bill would threaten funding under the Children's Health Insurance (or ``CHIP'') Program. 
   I was very pleased to hear Senator STEVENS, the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator ROTH, the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, confirm on the floor today that they are committed to resolve these issues in favor of the states during the conference. I look forward to working with both Senator STEVENS and Senator ROTH to ensure that these issues are adequately addressed in that process. 
   It is my understanding that the rescissions in TANF, CHIP, and SSBG funding in the bill were, in effect, temporary measures included until the broader funding issues could be resolved in conference. Nevertheless, I am very pleased to hear a reaffirmation of their commitment to address this in conference. 
   In particular, I am committed to ensuring that TANF funds totaling $240 million, including $39.5 million in Texas, are not jeopardized. These funds stem from a provision in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act that I and others supported to provide additional funds to high-growth, high-need states like Texas, Florida, California, and others. Under the revisions in federal welfare payments contained in that welfare reform bill, states like these stood to lose significant funds, and it was unclear whether they would be able to meet their legal obligations to low income families. 
   To help ensure that states like these could continue to meet the needs of their residents while they transition to the new system of emphasizing work and self-sufficiency over dependence, I supported the inclusion of these so-called ``supplemental grants'' funds in the welfare reform law. Since then, these funds have been an important component of some 17 states welfare reform programs, programs that have been tremendously successful. For example, in my state of Texas, welfare rolls have been reduced by 63 percent. 
   Texas and other states that have been so successful in helping people to become self-sufficient should not be penalized for that success. While some have argued that states have billions in unused welfare funds, it is my understanding that Texas, for one, has obligated to date all of its TANF funds. To rescind more than $39 million in funds from our state would disrupt not only the welfare program, but also the many other activities funded by TANF funds in the state, including worker training and child care. This disruption of fiscal year 2000 funds would also affect the state legislative process, necessitating a retroactive budget adjustment during the next session of the Texas Legislature, which will not meet again until January of next year. 
   The federal TANF program was also intended to allow states to develop funding reserves to utilize during times of economic downturn and/or higher than usual unemployment. For example, the Texas Workforce Commission was able to recently use TANF funds to respond to the more than 18,000 Texans who lost their jobs during the oil price crash of 1997 to 1999. 
   It is also fundamentally unfair to only cut TANF funds to the 17 states that presently receive them, while not affecting the funding received by the other 33 states. These states, on average, use TANF funds at a higher rate than the national average, using 97 percent of their total allocations versus 93 percent for other states in fiscal year 1999. In short, they need the additional funds. 
   Many states that receive these supplemental funds are presently planning to expand their welfare and related programs, to include a broader range of services to enable all welfare recipients to become self-sufficient. Many single mothers, for example, have child care and transportation needs that make it all but impossible to find and keep a job. Others simply lack basic education and job skills that preclude them from holding virtually any employment. Still others have chronic substance abuse and psychological problems that are complex and difficult to address. As states seek to bring these so-called ``hard core'' welfare recipients into the economic mainstream, they will need all the TANF and other forms of federal assistance they can get to break the cycle of poverty. 
   Mr. President, I again want to thank the Senator from Alaska, Senator STEVENS, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, and the Senator from Delaware, Senator ROTH for their comments today and for their responsiveness on these issues. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, as it was reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill reduced funding for two vitally important programs--the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program. 
   When you look at the bill, there are major increases for other programs, which to me, suggests that the Subcommittee did not adequately prioritize what should be funded. 
   The programs that these cuts would have affected--S-CHIP and SSBG--are essential for welfare reform; helping to keep people off welfare and eliminating some of the reasons why people went on welfare in the first place. 
   I support many of the programs and items that are funded by this bill, and  I commend the fine work of our federal agencies in carrying out these programs, but I am not convinced that we should provide huge increases in funding for some programs--like a 15 percent increase for NIH--at the expense of addressing basic human needs in other programs--such as S-CHIP and SSBG. 
   Mr. President, I oppose the cuts to these programs that have been included in this bill. I know that the Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator STEVENS, has indicated that he will work to ensure that full funding is restored in Conference. However, I want to be clear to my colleagues--these two programs must not return to the Senate floor with these cuts intact. Funds must be restored in Conference, and, in my view, the Conferees also need to take out some of the increases in the Labor-HHS bill in order to bring it within its 302b allocation. 
   Mr. President, as my colleagues know, when Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, one of the provisions included in that landmark legislation called for the establishment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program--or S-CHIP as it is known. 
   S-CHIP is the single largest federal investment in health insurance since the establishment of the Medicaid and Medicare programs in 1965. It is a partnership between the federal government and our states, enacted to improve access to health care for children. 
   I lobbied for this program as Vice Chairman of the National Governors' Association. As the Governor of Ohio, I understood how important it would be to the children of this country and their parents. In particular, I saw what it would mean to parents who were moving off welfare as part of welfare reform but needed assurances that their kids would have health care. 
   As most of my colleagues know, as people move off welfare, they lose their Medicaid insurance. However, even as individuals move towards picking up health insurance where Medicaid left-off, the biggest thing that parents are concerned about is being able to provide health care for their children. I am concerned that if the S-CHIP program is not funded appropriately, it will take a lot of people who have gone off welfare and force them to have to go back on. 
   I remember speaking to mothers who were on welfare when I was Governor, at the time when we were going through welfare reform, and many of these individuals told me that the reason they went on welfare in the first place was to get health care coverage for their children. 
   S-CHIP gives parents peace of mind that their children have access to quality health care if it is not available through their place of employment and they don't have enough money to afford health care coverage. 
   S-CHIP is not a ``one size fits all'' sort of program. One of the more appealing aspects of S-CHIP is its flexibility. States have been able to design innovative new programs and methods of reaching out to help uninsured children. 
   Some states are even looking at with ways in which they can provide family coverage for the same cost as covering a child. 
   Thus far, S-CHIP has been able to help over 2 million children obtain health insurance, and the opportunities to expand the program through its flexibility seem limitless. It is a program that is universally supported in our states. 
   Therefore, you can imagine my surprise to find that when the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its version of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill last month, the bill contained a provision to rescind $1.9 billion from S-CHIP. 
   The reason given for this S-CHIP rescission was a desire to free up $1.9 billion in budget authority to help finance discretionary programs in the Labor-HHS appropriation bill. 
   Although the Senate appropriations bill restores the $1.9 billion to S-CHIP in 2003, the funds would be of little use to states and children in need of health insurance in the coming fiscal year. 
   If the federal government is to be a true partner with the states, then the states must have the confidence that the federal government will not shrink from its commitment to S-CHIP and to children. Actions such as the proposed $1.9 billion rescission threaten the integrity of a critical program designed exclusively to help 2 million of our nation's children. 
   I can understand why our nation's governors, Republicans and Democrats, have been united in their opposition to the proposed cut in S-CHIP--because the program works. We should not be in the position of reversing the federal-state partnership that makes this vital program function. 
   In addition to the proposed cuts in S-CHIP, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill had proposed another break in a commitment that Congress made with the states. 
   In 1996, as part of welfare reform, Congress agreed to provide $2.38 billion each year for the Social Services Block Grant, or SSBG. 
   States and local communities have been able to target SSBG funds where they are most needed. For example, in my state of Ohio, funds have been used for such programs as adoption services in Washington County and foster care assistance in Montgomery County; home-based care for the elderly and the disabled such as home delivered meals in Franklin County; child and adult protective services in Cuyahoga and Allen Counties; and substance abuse treatment in Hamilton County--just to name a few. 
   However, the funds for SSBG have been chipped away little by little. In fiscal year 2000, the program is funded at $1.7 billion, but the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill, as reported, only proposed $600 million for fiscal 2001--75 percent less than the amount promised to governors in 1996! 
   A cut of this magnitude would be difficult, at best, for state and local governments to absorb, especially on top of the cuts over the past few years. Congress can't assume states will make up for the loss. 
   As such, the lack of funding would have caused a disruption in critical services to individuals in need--many of whom are not covered by other federal programs. 
   Many of the programs funded through SSBG prevent additional costs to the federal government in the long run. For example, SSBG helps provide in-home services to the elderly and the disabled, thereby eliminating the need to place them in a costly institutional setting. In addition, SSBG funds are used for family preservation and reunification efforts in order to cut down on the number of foster care placements. 
   The notion that states can make up this $1.1 billion loss with TANF funds is false. Many of the populations served through SSBG, primarily the elderly and the disabled, have no connection to the traditional welfare system and cannot be served with TANF funds. 
   That's why I am pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with the Appropriations Committee to take these provisions from the Labor-HHS bill. In my view, these provisions would have had a devastating impact on our most vulnerable citizens: children, the poor and the elderly. 
   Again, I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work in getting these provisions removed from this bill. I believe their efforts will go a long way towards restoring the faith of our state and local leaders that the Senate is truly committed to giving them the opportunity to help all Americans.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that has been discussed by Senator THOMAS, and others, just before I came to the floor. It is also an issue that every American who drives a car has on his or her mind. 
   No one could fail to see the impact the high price of gasoline at the pump is having on hard-working Americans and American families at the end of June who are looking to take their family vacations. They hope to do it by car. I hope they can, too. But we have a situation with regard to gas prices that has occurred for a number of reasons. And because Congress and this administration have not acted, we have a worse situation than ever. 
   I will talk a little bit about some of the causes of this. But I do not think we have to dwell on the causes all day because I think we can do something proactive that will begin to be a solution--both a short-term solution and a long-term solution. 
   First, the causes. Clearly, we have an incredible dependence on foreign oil today. Seven years ago, we had about a 46-percent dependence on foreign oil; today, it is 56 percent; and it is projected to be 65 percent of our oil needs by 2020. So I think it is incumbent on all of us in public office to try to take short-term steps to solve the immediate crisis, particularly in the Midwest, but not without taking long-term action as well. 
   We have a bill that is pending at the desk today. It is the National Energy Security Act. It would take some steps, putting some things on the table that would make a difference for our country and for the working people of our country who depend on gasoline. 
   Let's look at some of the causes for the gas price crisis now being seen in the Midwest and elsewhere. The Congressional Research Service has attribute 25 cents of every gallon of gasoline at the pump in certain parts of the Midwest to the reformulated gas phase 2 requirement that the EPA is insisting on imposing beginning June first of this year. These additional costs are the result of the added expense of adjusting the refining process for the new gasoline requirement, particularly when the gasoline is required to be blended with ethanol, as is the case in the Midwest. In addition, there are added costs of transporting the ethanol, which cannot be moved via pipeline, to the sites where the gasoline is blended and distributed. Other additives, such as MTBE, are readily available at the refineries and so you have reduced transportation costs. You can put the MTBE--which was the requirement in the past--in at the refinery and send it to places such as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan--the places that are suffering right now--but the ethanol has to be carried from the agricultural areas, where it is grown, put into a new system in the refineries, and then shipped back to the Midwest. So you are talking about time, shortages, and costs that have added 25 cents per gallon. CRS estimates that an additional 25 cents of the increase in Midwest gas prices is attributable to recent problems with oil and gas pipelines that feed the upper Midwest, which have come at a time when gasoline stocks nationwide are particularly low and when the demand for gasoline is on the rise. 
   With regard to the EPA requirements, we had hoped the EPA would say, OK, we are facing a crisis right now, so maybe for this summer we can relax those new EPA regulations and go with what has been the regulation of the past. 
   Secondly, it is very important to realize that each State and many local governments impose additional taxes on gasoline at the pump. It just so happens that many of the midwestern States and cities within those States have higher taxes than the average in the country. The average combined federal and state gasoline excise tax is about 40 cents per gallon. In Chicago, Illinois, however, it is 61.3 cents per gallon. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it is 47.2 cents per gallon. So we can see that there are wide differences across the country in taxes of gasoline. 
   I commend the Governors of these States who are seeing the crisis and responding immediately. The Governor of Indiana has put a moratorium on the State sales tax on gasoline. The Governor of Illinois is calling a special session of the legislature to review taking similar action.  
   The Federal Government should assist these and other States by repealing, for a time, the 18.4 cents-per-gallon Federal gas tax. If we suspend this Federal tax through Labor Day of this year, that will give relief in addition to the State taxes selected States are giving, and it will give us time to catch up with the EPA regulations and some of the other transportation problems that have caused the rise in gasoline prices. We should follow the lead of these midwestern Governors. That may also encourage other States to follow suit by responding in a similar fashion and giving the American people some much needed relief at the pump. 
   I would not for one minute suggest we should take the money from that gasoline tax and take it away from the highway trust fund. We need to keep the highway trust fund whole so we can continue to make the improvements in safety and highway construction necessary for the States that depend on those funds. 
   The on-budget Federal surplus is estimated to be about $60 billion this year. The estimates are going up because in fact we are getting more and more of a surplus. We know we want tax relief for hard-working Americans, and this is in fact tax relief for hard-working Americans, including truckers who are suffering under the increases in diesel fuel costs. 
   We read stories about our own Coast Guard not being able to patrol the waters, where they are supposed to be doing drug interdiction and patrolling for summer safety. They can't afford the fuel because the prices have gone up so much. We need to give relief across the board, and we need to give tax relief for hard-working Americans. 
   I am today introducing legislation granting a temporary repeal, through Labor Day, of the entire Federal gasoline and diesel tax. The bill will also ensure that the highway trust fund is made whole. This bill will give hard-working Americans immediate tax relief during the peak summer driving months, those who have to drive to work or who are going to take a family vacation this summer. At the same time we in Congress must act to take the longer term steps that we must take to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense. 
   Let's talk about that for a minute. This administration is not only adhering to the regulations that make it so hard to drill for oil and gas in our own country, causing hundreds of thousands of jobs to go overseas, but they are also insisting on increasing the oil royalty rates. I fought the increase in oil royalty rates last year and the year before because I was very much afraid we were going to add so much to cost that our domestic drillers would go overseas. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. We are continuing, through this administration, to have increases in oil royalty rates at a time when oil prices have spiked to $30 a barrel. 
   The fact is, we can't survive on $10-a-barrel oil and we can't sustain the economy on $30-a-barrel oil. That does not make sense for our country. What we need is price stability within a reasonable and sustainable range. The numbers show we are more and more dependent on foreign oil because we make it so hard for the 
   little guys, the marginal well producers, to make it in our country. The big guys are leaving our country in droves because it is more efficient to go elsewhere to drill for oil and gas. 
   As a matter of fact, just to cite a few real numbers, when oil was $10 a barrel, the little oil and gas producers went out of business in droves: 150,000 marginal oil and gas wells closed--that is out of a total of 600,000--65,000 good paying jobs were lost in this country; communities were devastated. 
   In one example, in Midland-Odessa, the unemployment rate doubled in 1 year from 5 to 10 percent. School district revenues were hit by $150 million, causing a virtual halt to any new hiring, and in some cases school districts were having to let teachers go in the middle of the term because they could not pay their salaries for the rest of the year. They had to close classrooms because of this crisis when the price of oil was $10 a barrel. 
   For some reason, when we were having that kind of problem, people weren't as tuned in. What has happened is, when we lost the 150,000 marginal wells, we lost the ability in 15-barrel-a-day wells to match the amount of oil we import from Saudi Arabia every day, because it adds up. We can produce 20 percent of the needs of oil in our country with these 15-barrel-a-day wells. 
   Just to put that in perspective, a well in Alaska produces on average about 600 barrels a day; a well offshore, over 1,000 barrels a day. We are talking 15 barrels a day for marginal wells. 
   What I would like to do is have a trigger. If the price goes below $14 a barrel for these 15-barrel-a-day drillers, let us have a tax credit so they will be able to stay in business and keep those jobs, not cap the wells, so that when the price goes up to $17 per barrel or more, those people have stayed in business and will keep producing. That is one part of a long-term strategy that would bring us up to 50-percent capacity for our oil needs every day. 
   This problem is not going to get better. Dr. Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is probably the most credible independent oil economist, told a group of Senators and Members of Congress just last week that one of the problems we are facing is an increasing demand because of an increasingly hot economy worldwide. 
   We know our economy in America is very strong, but that is also the case around the world. That causes more demand on our energy resources. So if we are going to have a policy that we would be dependent on foreign oil only 50 percent, we are going to have to produce oil in our own country and we are going to have to have those little barrels that add up, those little wells that produce 15 barrels a day, that add up to hundreds of thousands of jobs in our country, that support our schools. We are going to have to keep those people in business because they can't make it at $10 a barrel, but they can make it on $17 a barrel. 
   So if we will treat them like farmers and when we don't have markets, or when the prices are so low that a farmer can't make it, we will try to keep them stable and level. That is what we have been doing in this country for a long, long time. I would like to see us treat our small oil producers in the same way because if there is anything that is crucial to the security of our country, it is at least being able to produce 50 percent of the energy needs of our country in order to have some stabilizing effect. When we depend so much on foreign oil, what happens is they can shut down the supply whenever they want to, and the OPEC countries have clearly done that. That causes a spike because of low supply, high demand, overregulation in our own country, and the unwillingness of this administration to say we are in a crisis. Let's work together to do something about it. 
   Senator LOTT, Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator DOMENICI, Senator NICKLES, Senator BREAUX, Senator BINGAMAN, and Senator LANDRIEU have all been very proactive in trying to put forward a program that would give us short-term relief and long-term relief for energy in our country. I do want the short-term relief of the 18-cent Federal tax to be paused until after Labor Day for our independent truckers, for our families going on vacation, and for the working people of our country who must use cars to go to and from work. I want that relief, but we must tie it to long-term relief because, if we don't, if things stabilize for the short term, we are still going to be under the thumb of foreign interests; we are still going to face the possibility that another crisis will come. Why not anticipate it and do something proactive now that will provide long-term relief as well as short-term relief? 
   I am introducing legislation that will provide the short-term relief. We must tie that in with the long-term relief if we are going to do what is right for this country. The National Energy Security Act is pending before the Senate. I hope we will take the action that has certainly been called for with the crisis we are facing. But let's take a longer-term view. Let's try to put some long-term energy policies in place because, certainly, this administration has failed to do so. 
   If this administration would step up to the line and say: Of course, we are not going to increase our royalty rates at a time like this and say we need a little more time before the phase II ethanol regulations take effect in the major cities--let's try to tamp down this crisis. Let's help the Governors of the Midwest, who are taking State  taxes off gasoline for this summer, and take the Federal gasoline tax off as well, make the highway trust fund whole by giving tax relief to hard-working Americans, and let's realize that the security of our country depends on our being able to provide for our own energy needs. It is clear that no matter what we do for our neighboring countries that supply most of the oil and gas we consume in this country, they don't seem to pay back. I think the fact that they will not up their production to meet the demand is wrong; nevertheless, I am not going to whine about it. I am going to take positive action that puts America in charge of our own destiny. That is the responsibility of this Congress, and that is what this Congress must do. 
   Hopefully, the President will follow our lead and we can do something that is right for America, even if other countries we have helped in the past will not give us a break. We can do what is right for ourselves, and I hope we will. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Wellstone amendment. 
   I think it would be the height of irresponsibility to reduce this defense budget by $1 billion, for any purpose. Obviously, for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has not yet been reauthorized, there will be billions spent--correctly so--for the improvement of the education of our children. To withdraw the funds from the Department of Defense and put money into a bill that has not yet been reauthorized, I think would be shirking our responsibility to support our troops in the field and make sure they have the equipment they need to do the job we are asking them to do. 
   Whether it be the missile defense system, the F-22, the F-16, the ships that we need so badly, or whether it is a quality-of-life issue, we are trying to increase the pay levels and the quality of housing for our military. We are trying to provide the health care that is deserved for the people in the service and for their families. 
   Where would we take the $1 billion? Which part of our military budget that is already underfunded would we withdraw? I think it is very important we continue to finish this bill, that we allocate the resources we need to stop the flight from our military that we see occurring as we speak. We are having a very hard time retaining the good people who are serving in the military. They are leaving the military. They are leaving the military for a variety of reasons, some of which we can do something about: pay, types of housing, health care, and making sure they have the training and the equipment they need to do the job we are asking them to do. We need to make sure we do retain our best people. 
   Second, I think it is very important we let potential recruits know we are going to take very seriously these quality-of-life issues. That is exactly what this bill, the underlying appropriations bill for the Department of Defense, is designed to do. 
   I object to any reduction of the Department of Defense bill to reallocate resources to other areas that have already had their budgets approved by this Congress. We have set the levels of spending in Congress. We have allocated money for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have allocated money for all of the other agencies to be able to do their jobs. We need to set up a firewall in defense. We need to say we are going to put the money into defense to keep our security in this country. 
   If we start adopting amendments such as the Wellstone amendment that would start taking $1 billion out and allocating it to some other cause, I think we would be walking away from our responsibility to strengthen our national defense. When we are 6,000 below the congressionally mandated troop strength level, as we are today, I think it is most certainly the responsibility of Congress to say, why do we have 6,000 fewer troops than we have allocated to do the job of keeping the security of the United States? I think once we determine the cause, we need to address that cause and we need to correct the problem. The way we do it is to make sure we are fully funding the equipment, the training, and the quality-of-life issues for our military personnel. We are asking them to do a pretty tough job. We need to give them the tools to do it. 
   I am very fortunate to be able to visit so many of our troops around the world. I am very privileged to be on the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee and, before that, on the Armed Services Committee. I have visited our troops in Saudi Arabia, Italy, Bosnia, Kosovo, Germany, as well as, of course,  throughout the United States of America. It lifts your heart to go to a base or to an outpost and talk to our military personnel. They are dedicated. They believe in our country. They believe in what they are doing. They are out there and they are going to do the job given to them to do. 
   In the 7 years that I have been in the Senate and have made it a point to visit our troops wherever they may have been, I have never yet met one who did not inspire me, who did not make me believe that the security of our country was being handled by these young people and these generals and these admirals. They are dedicated and they are doing a terrific job. But it is the responsibility of Congress, it is the responsibility of the Senate, it is the responsibility of this body to make sure every one of those young men and women out in the field, who are patrolling as we speak, who are walking along the lines between Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia, who are in Bosnia trying to keep Bosnia in a peaceful condition, who are in the deserts of Saudi Arabia right now, or in Kuwait, trying to keep some stability in the Middle East, get the support and the equipment and the training they need to do the job. 
   If we start voting for amendments that take $1 billion out of an already short defense budget and start allocating that to other programs--worthy programs, but we have already set the spending limiting for those programs--we would be shirking our responsibility to support those who are supporting us. That is why I oppose the Wellstone amendment and why I hope this Senate will take the responsible action and reject any effort to take $1 billion out of the funds for the defense budget. It has emergency money in it to replenish the coffers where we have taken from the basic defense budget to fund the peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. It is essential we get on with our responsibility and reject the Wellstone amendment. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, 56 years ago today, 176,000 allied soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy in what was the largest invasion in history. The operation was officially known as Operation Overlord, but I have never heard anyone refer to it by that name. It is now known as D-Day. 
   While there have been hundreds of other D-days in other historic locations such as Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and Inchon, the forces that landed on Normandy Beach 56 years ago today truly changed the course of history. When we hear the term ``D-Day,'' we reflect on that awful and incredible day on Normandy Beach with reverence for what was accomplished and for all that was lost, and with respect the people who were there--those who did not survive and those who did. 
   Thousands of young Americans died that day establishing that small beachhead on the continent of Europe. Within a year, the Allied forces went on to crush the Nazi war regime and brought forth on the European Continent an unprecedented period of peace. 
   Today, we look back on that time and we remember and respect what was done. 
   When the cold war ended, the Wall came down and the Warsaw Pact disbanded. The United States began to draw down forces from Europe for the first time since we had gone in on D-Day and established a presence, and set up the plan to help our vanquished enemy. 
   Military strategists began to talk of new missions for NATO. They spoke of the need for NATO to go ``out of area or out of business,'' implying that unless NATO could find a new reason to exist after the end of the Cold War, there may be no reason for it to exist at all. 
   That new mission began to come into focus in the Balkans five years ago when the United States committed peacekeeping forces to Bosnia to enforce the provisions of the Dayton Peace Accords. 
   What was conceived by the administration as a one-year mission to accomplish specific military objectives is now in its fifth year--with greatly expanded civilian nation-building objectives and no end in sight to the deployment. 
   Today we are on the eve of another anniversary in the search for new NATO missions. One year ago, on June 10, NATO halted the bombing in Serbia and Kosovo. As in Bosnia, we again have deployed thousands of American forces to yet another Balkan quagmire with unclear objectives--and there is no end in sight to the Kosovo mission, either. This time the ethnic groups we seek to reconcile have not tired of the killing, apparently, and it continues as our soldiers stand by helpless to deter murder. 
   The General Accounting Office estimates that the cost of our Balkan peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo now tops $23 billion. We have become mired in the problem, unable to stand back and assess where we are. Nor are we able to look at the situation and say we must have a strategy.  
   We know what this has cost our country: For the past five years, recruiting and retention problems in the U.S. military services have been exacerbated by endless peacekeeping missions. Our armed services today are not up to their congressionally mandated troop strength; they are at least 6,000 short. 
   As the world's only superpower, we have a responsibility to lead. America led when the parties first came together in Dayton, but the Dayton Peace Accords simply stopped the fighting. We did not create conditions that could actually solve the problem without the presence of thousands of outside forces. We ended the hostilities--and we should be respectful of that achievement--but we did not create effective economic and political structures. 
   That must be our goal for a lasting peace. As one American military peacekeeper said to me on a recent visit, ``Everyone's job in Bosnia is to work on the problems we face, but no one seems to 
   have the responsibility for actually solving those problems.'' 
   We need to search for ways to solve these problems. Today I am introducing legislation to authorize funds to reconvene the parties to the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the Bosnia conflict, those who were involved in the Rambouillet talks that failed to avert the conflict in Kosovo and other regional entities. We must review our progress to date. If we cannot do that, how can we call ourselves leaders? 
   We must look for a long-term settlement based on greater self-determination for the governed and less by outside powers. That may involve tailoring current borders to fit the facts on the ground. It will create conditions of genuine stability, reconstruction and prosperity. It will allow us, in a responsible way, to set some timetables, some measurements for success, and, hopefully, to begin turning over these peacekeeping responsibilities to our European allies within a reasonable time frame. 
   We must have self-determination that works. The current policy wagers America's reputation, prestige and will on a mirage of multicultural democracy in the Balkans. We are trying to create governments that ignore history, nationality and ethnicity. Elections have been held in which refugees were bused into disputed regions to vote for elected officials who cannot serve because they are unable to return to their prewar homes. 
   American officers spend their days deciding which vehicles can travel down which roads, and escorting Serb families in hostile Albanian territory to the dentist and back or to the library and back. 
   This effort is diverting the United States from its global responsibilities. We occupy a unique place in the world today, standing astride history's path as the most powerful nation that ever may have existed. Our supercharged economic engine certainly reflects the best that mankind has to offer. However, a superpower's core responsibility is not to right every wrong, but to preserve its strength for those challenges that only a superpower can address. 
   The United States must know when to encourage capable allies and proxies to address contingencies that fall short of that standard. Instead, time and again, our military readiness to address potential threats--such as North Korea, mainland China, Iraq--has been diverted to contingency provisions on the periphery of our nation's security concerns. 
   America's peacekeeping burden in the 1990s has resulted in two of our Army divisions reporting themselves unfit for combat. 
   We can achieve more in the Balkans than a peace enforced at bayonet tip. We ought to tie our continued financial support to a comprehensive regional settlement, to substantial military withdrawal from the region and to a firm policy of encouraging the Europeans to do more--with our support, which will always be there. 
   Any NATO member can patrol the Balkans, but only the United States can defend NATO. That is the role of a superpower, and that is the role of a strong and reliable ally. 
   As we take up the armed services budget this week, I hope we can take on the role that is the responsibility of the Senate and try to put some long-term potential peace into play. I am not saying I know what the outcome of any kind of conference should be. But I do know it is our responsibility to call such a conference and begin to assess where we are; to look with vision to the future and set the standard that must be set for the lasting peace that we want and hope for and will work for and support in the Balkans.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, yesterday the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, came to the Senate floor to discuss Social Security reform. In her discussion, she took on the issue of some of the Texas municipalities that had chosen to opt out of Social Security and attempted to show they were doing less well than anyone in the Social Security system today. I want to refute some of those remarks, especially the ones that referred to these counties in Texas, and give the other side of the story. 
   She attempted to show that municipal employees in Texas, particularly Galveston County, are not doing as well under their own retirement plan than if they were part of the Social Security system. 
   Just in the last few minutes, I talked to the county judge of Galveston County, Judge Yarborough, who is a very good Democrat, a very good person, and is doing a good job in Galveston County. He says in the 5 1/2 years he has been county judge, he has never had one complaint from an employee in Galveston County and, in fact, has had many retirees come up to him and say how glad they are that they have their own retirement system rather than having been forced into the Social Security system back in the eighties when they were allowed to opt out. 
   First and foremost, because this is important, this was somehow linked to Governor Bush's Social Security plan. There is no linkage whatsoever. In fact, the opt-out was done in 1981 by Galveston and a few other municipalities around my State, and there were others around the country. There was a window during that time in which county and municipal employees were able to 
   opt out of Social Security, and Galveston County did decide to opt out. 
   I hope as we go into the future and as we talk about Governor Bush's Social Security plan, we will not attempt to link that window when some municipalities opted out of Social Security to Governor Bush's plan. That is important because Governor Bush has said all along, from the very beginning when he put his plan forward, that, in fact, we would have a choice under his plan. Anyone wanting to stay in the present Social Security system would have that option. 
   That is a very important distinction to make because people might want to keep that option after they have looked at the alternative that will be available, but, in fact, millions of Americans will decide that they want to have a part in making some decisions on their own for the Social Security tax they pay. 
   Nearly 5 million municipal employees across the country are not part of the Social Security system. One such area is the city of San Diego. The rates of return on these pension programs are very good--so good, in fact, that the California Senators sent a letter to President Clinton in which they said:  
   Millions of our constituents, who will receive higher retirement benefits from their  current public pensions than they would under Social Security, are appealing to their elected representatives in Washington. We respectfully urge you to honor the original legislative intent underpinning the Social Security system, and exclude this provision from any reform plan you consider during the remainder of your term.  
   It is clear that if municipal employees are earning higher rates of return and want to stay in their own retirement plans, they should not be forced into a system of lower returns, and it should be a choice they have. I agree with the Senators from California in their goal. 
   I will now talk about the specifics of the Galveston plan. Many of these same Galveston employees have urged me to oppose their inclusion in Social Security. 
   Some of the information that was used on the floor yesterday was based on a GAO report, but if my colleagues read the report carefully, they can see the clear differences between Social Security and the plan in Galveston County. 
   First, it is important to remember that, in Galveston, they have a basic retirement plan that every employee puts money into and on which they have returns. That plan is separate. In 1981, they were allowed to opt out of Social Security so that their 7 percent they would have paid into Social Security would, in fact, go into a supplemental plan. In Galveston County, we are talking about a supplemental plan to their basic retirement plan, so everything they get with the 7 percent which they put into their own supplemental plan is over and above their basic retirement system. 
   The GAO said that ``outcomes generally depend on individual circumstances and conditions.'' So each case is taken on an individual basis--it is hard to make broad statements about the plan. The annuity each retiree receives is based on the contributions and the time served in government; it is not a defined benefit formula, such as Social Security. Nevertheless, the plan is designed to provide a return similar to Social Security, which it does, and it has some features that are even better. 
   The GAO noted that ``The Galveston plan also has a very conservative investment strategy that has precluded investing in common stocks.'' The Galveston supplemental plan only relies on Government bonds and very safe Treasury-type investments, and the average return has been approximately 8 percent per year. When one compares that to Social Security, however, it is very high. 
   The Heritage Foundation has estimated that some workers are getting a 1- to 2-percent return on their money from Social Security. 
   Also, comparing the Social Security plan to the Galveston plan, it is not accurate because the Galveston plan is a supplement, not the basic retirement system. 
   Lastly, the GAO noted one critical point that was left out of the Washington debate: The Galveston plan benefits are fully funded, GAO says, ``while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without increasing revenues.'' 
   Thus, the Galveston plan is financially sound. It is not dependent on significantly increased contributions or massive tax increases to meet its promises. 
   Here, in Washington, we have promised benefits without developing a plan to pay for them. In Galveston, no retiree is subject to the mercy of the Congress that the benefits might change. 
   Here are some of the facts about the differences between the Galveston plan and Social Security. 
   For individual earners without a survivor benefit, the monthly annuity figures for retirees are nearly identical or better than Social Security. For low-wage workers, there is a $1 difference. For workers with wages over $25,000, they would earn nearly $200 a month more under the Galveston plan than they would under Social Security. 
   A worker earning $50,000 will earn nearly $1,000 more every month. 
   If you have a 45-year work history, the numbers are higher across the board at every income level in the Galveston plan. 
   The Cato Institute also reviewed the Galveston retirement plan. For a worker who earns $30,000 for 30 years, he or she will have a $320,000 investment in retirement. This is based on a 4.5-percent return when, in fact, Galveston is getting 8 percent. 
   I should also note that the numbers in GAO are based on a 4-percent return each year. So the numbers in GAO are very low in their estimates, and most workers are going to receive a much higher benefit. 
   According to Cato, the employee with the $320,000 in savings could earn a monthly annuity of $2,494, compared to Social Security, which is $1,077. 
   So according to Cato, the monthly annuity would be $2,494 for a Galveston employee, compared to $1,077 under Social Security. 
   The county of Galveston believes the average annuity is approximately 7.8 percent for every $1,000 in retirement funds. The Social Security Administration thinks that is too high and made the GAO use a lower annuity figure. So the monthly annuity figures used by GAO are lower than for the Galveston workers. 
   I think it is very important that we take this debate out of the Bush plan or the Gore plan when we are dealing with the employees in cities such as San Diego, CA, or Galveston County, TX, because it is very clear that the Galveston County employees have a major benefit. As the county judge said this morning: Retirees come up to me every day and say thank goodness. 
   Another good feature of the Galveston plan is that if the retiree does not use up all of the retirement when that person dies, it is passed on to the spouse or the children. That does not happen in Social Security. 
   I think it is very important, if we are going to build up a stability in our working people and their families, that we would have this kind of alternative with which the Galveston County employees are very pleased. 
   I think it is very important that we not put this in the political realm. If we are talking about the actual numbers, I think the municipal employees that were allowed to opt out in the early 1980s are mostly happy with their plans. They like the choices they have. Galveston was very conservative and did not go into the stock market. 
   But I think the bottom line is that we need to give people a choice, a choice to stay in the Social Security system as it is today and have the exact same returns that they would be entitled to under Social Security, or if they choose not to do that, and they do want to have some control over their own taxes they pay in--maybe 3 percent of the 12-plus percent they pay in Social Security--I think we ought to let them do that. Because even with the stock market fluctuating, the returns show that they will do better and they will be able to give their children something they have not been able to under the present Social Security plan. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been on the floor for a long time this morning. I will address two major points I keep hearing because it is important that we refute those points. 
   First, we are not setting a deadline. We are not withdrawing troops. The Byrd-Warner amendment says we are voting to make the decision, after plenty of time for the President and our allies, consulting with Congress, to make a plan. We are setting a timetable in which we would have the opportunity to set a plan, and that timetable will probably be October or December of next year. Then after we have a plan from the President, we will have a vote on that plan and on the long-term strategy. 
   Every time Congress exercises its responsibility to do what it is required to do under the Constitution, which is declare war and support the Army and the Navy, the administration and many on the other side say: What kind of signal does that send? What kind of signal does that send to our allies? What kind of signal does that send to that terrible tyrant Milosevic? 
   No. 2, they say setting a deadline is irresponsible. I will answer both of those questions. 
   We are sending a message. We are sending a message to our allies and to President Milosevic. It is a clear message, and it says, America is going to lead. America is going to come in and bring all the parties to the table, and we are going to formulate a policy. We are going to lead. 
   It says, our goal is a lasting peace in the Balkans, not an unending morass of indecision that wears out our troops, debilitates our own national security, and does not help our allies or the Serb people at all. It says to Milosevic, we are serious and we are going to formulate a plan. The President of the United States should take the lead and consult with our allies and consult with Congress, as is required in the Constitution. 
   Our policy in the Balkans has been drifting. Ever since I came to Congress 7 years ago, it has been drifting because the administration has never come to Congress and said: This is my plan; will you approve it? Instead, he spends money from the Defense budget with no authorization and then comes in and asks for emergency funds to replenish the Department of Defense. Of course, we are going to vote yes. Of course, we are going to replenish the funds that have already been spent so our troops will be paid and our equipment will be updated. Is this Senate going to allow our troops to be deployed on a mission that has never been laid out? Is that a responsible action of the Senate? The answer is no. The Byrd-Warner amendment is taking the responsible action for the Senate. 
   I will answer question No. 2: Setting a deadline is irresponsible. This is the bait and switch. This is what they say every time. If you set a deadline, you are irresponsible. How could you do that and cut and run from our allies? But if you say, OK, we are not setting a deadline, we are going to say, 1 year from now, we have a timetable that begins the process for a plan and then, once you have the plan on the table, you have an orderly process to implement that plan. 
   This is not a vote to withdraw troops. It is not a vote to cut and run. It is not a vote to even have a deadline. It is a vote to take the responsibility to approve a plan for a lasting 
   peace in the Balkans. This is a vote to be a responsible and strong ally and a formidable enemy. It is a vote that asks the same of our allies in return, that they be strong and reliable allies. 
   It is a vote to take the responsibility in the Senate for our own national defense. I ask the question of my colleagues: If we do not take the responsibility for our national security, if we do not take the responsibility when we see that we cannot recruit and retain members of our armed services today, if we don't take the responsibility for addressing that problem, who will? Which of our allies will step up to the line and say, we are worried about your national security deteriorating? Which of our allies is going to step up to the line and say, I am concerned that you are not providing the nuclear umbrella that we must have and that only you can provide? 
   The buck stops here. The Byrd-Warner amendment says we are up to the task. We will defend our own troops in the field, to give them a mission and a timetable and a responsible plan under which they can operate. We will be a strong, reliable, and stable ally for all of our friends. We will formulate a plan that is responsible as a superpower should. We will no longer have emergency funds that refill coffers of money that have already been spent on a mission that is not spelled out. We will no longer be irresponsible. We will take the responsibility that has been put on our shoulders by the people of our States. 
   A vote for the Byrd-Warner amendment will do exactly what we were elected to do; that is, take the responsibility for our country and our allies.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for heading the task force that put together a balanced approach, with a clear goal--a simple goal--of reducing foreign oil dependence in the United States of America to under 50 percent by the year 2010, so that 10 years from today we could have what I think is a very modest goal of 50-percent capability in the United States of America to produce the oil and gas needs of our country. 
   It does not take a rocket scientist to see what has been happening to oil prices over the last 3 years. First, we went down so low that the little guys could not make it. We lost thousands of small well producers because they could not make it on $10-a-barrel oil. They could not meet their expenses. So they went under and they capped the wells. 
   When a well is capped, it is almost impossible to reopen it because it is so expensive. These are wells that produced 15 barrels a day or less. We are not talking about gushers. We are not talking about thousands of barrels a day, which some do produce in other parts of the country. We are talking about 15 barrels a day, a barely break-even proposition at any price, but certainly not at $10. 
   What we are trying to do is take the artificially low prices and the ridiculously high prices that we see today because we are dependent on foreign imported oil, and say: What will allow us to stabilize these prices? What will allow us to stabilize these prices is exactly what is in the bill we are introducing today and which we hope Congress will act on before we leave; and that is, we encourage the little guys by giving them a floor--just as we do farmers--when prices go below $17 a barrel. We would just give them a tax credit so they could stay in business. 
   The Senator from Alaska talked about many of the other parts of this bill. I hope we can have bipartisan support so we can stabilize the prices for consumers in America and jobs in our country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending Lieberman amendment. Senator LIEBERMAN is a friend of mine, and I know he has spent a lot of time with many colleagues trying to put together a substitute that could have bipartisan agreement. I think the Senator's amendment does make some good attempts, but there are concerns that will also force me to vote against his amendment. 
   I think the amendment is overly prescriptive. The reason I feel so strongly about this is that the amendment we just passed--Senator LOTT's amendment--which included my and Senator FRIST's careers-to-classroom provision--the whole purpose of that is to give more flexibility. I think what we are doing is drawing the bright red line  between the philosophy of what the Democrats are hoping to do and what the Republicans are hoping to do. The Republicans are trying to withdraw a lot of the redtape that we hear complained about by teachers everywhere we go in our States. When I go to a town hall meeting, in an urban or rural area, they complain about the redtape and the regulations that keep them from being able to do the job they want to do, which is to teach children in the classroom. 
   I think Senator LIEBERMAN's amendment fails to provide the flexibility and the accountability for our States and public schools, which really is the hallmark of the bill that is before us today. I am concerned about the revised formula for title I. I am concerned because title I will take millions of dollars from many of the rural and other schools in Texas and across America. 
   While I certainly understand the goal of providing money for low-income schools, I don't think it should come at the expense of our Nation's rural schools. They also have a great need, and oftentimes they lack the resources to give the quality education they need and want for their children. 
   I am also concerned about the provision in the Lieberman substitute that effectively requires certification for teachers' aides and other paraprofessionals. I think this is something best left to the States and the local districts. In fact, to go back to the amendment we just passed, Senator FRIST and I have been working, along with Senator GRAHAM from Florida, on a different concept that goes away from the overcertification issue and says we want professionals in the classroom, and we want to encourage school districts to put professionals in the classroom, even if they didn't major in education in college. 
   Now, I have to take a step back and say that I am very proud that my alma mater, the University of Texas, is actually beginning to do some testing on education degrees to see if we can focus more on the area of expertise that is going to be taught in the classroom and less on the ``how to make lesson plans'' part of the education degree. So far the tests have been very positive of the students who have gone more in the area of expertise for which they are going to be the teachers and less into the ``how to be a teacher''--not that you do away with that because it is important; but you lessen the focus on that and go more for the actual expertise that is going to be transferred to the children in the classroom. That is the exact concept of the careers-to-classroom amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator FRIST and myself. 
   It is very similar to what Senator BOB GRAHAM and I had worked on as well. Basically, it says to the midlevel professional who may be looking for a career change or who may be retiring because they have done well in their field, we want you to come into the classroom and give the benefit of our knowledge and expertise to children who are in schools that have teacher shortages or are in rural areas. 
   Here is an example. A friend of mine majored in French in college and taught French in private schools. She moved to a small school district in Greenville, TX. They wanted to offer French in Greenville High School. She wanted to teach it, but she didn't have a teacher certification. So she was not able to be put into the classroom in Greenville High School, and the students in that high school were deprived of that option because she was not certified. 
   Now, what she did--because she wanted to do this so much--she commuted 30 miles to the nearest teacher college and she eventually got her certification; but it took her several years because she was also raising children. During that period, those children who wanted to take French could not have that option at Greenville High School. 
   I think that is wrong. I don't want her to have to jump through that many hoops in order to give a great opportunity to that school district that they otherwise would not have. So our careers-to-classroom provision takes rural schools and schools that have teacher shortages and matches them with people who have professional expertise--especially in the fields of math, science, and languages. We can enhance education to a greater degree if we have qualified teachers. 
   We give encouragement. We give authorization for funding for school districts that will give alternative certification, which is expedited certification to these teachers who want to go into the classroom and help enrich the experience that our children will have all over our country. 
   We hear a lot on the Senate floor about the need to hire more teachers and reduce class size. There is a growing problem in America. 
   It has been estimated by the National Council on Education Statistics that the United States will need an additional 2 million teachers in public schools over the next decade. During the 1970s and 1980s, the American school age population grew at a relatively slow rate. But increased immigration and the new baby boomers have turned these numbers around. In 1997, a record 52.2 million students entered our Nation's public schools. Between 1998 and 2008, the population of secondary schools is going to increase an additional 11 percent. This is most pressing in our inner cities and rural communities. 
   We are trying to address these concerns by giving more flexibility and taking away some of these disincentives to get good professionals into the classrooms. I think our amendment, which has been agreed to by the Senate, is a better concept than the Lieberman approach, or Senator KENNEDY's approach, which I think have the effect of putting more restrictions and more redtape in the system. 
   I think we have tried the other way. While I believe Senator KENNEDY and Senator LIEBERMAN are very sincere in wanting better public education, I think we diverge on how we get there. I think we have tried the ``everything emanates from Washington'' approach to get Federal funding. I think now we 
   ought to try something new. Let's try giving States flexibility by putting the money into the classroom where it does the most good rather than building up the Federal bureaucracy that has the effect of retarding the ability to be creative. Let's have the capability to put more teachers in to fill the teacher shortage with qualified teachers as well. 
   I want to end by saying that I believe in public education. I am a total product of public education. I know that is what makes America different from other countries in the world because we don't say to certain people: you will get a good education but other people in society will not have the same opportunity. 
   We have said in America that we want every child to reach his or her full potential with a public education. We want every child to have a choice. Many children choose private education. I support that, too. But it is our responsibility to have public education for children who cannot afford a private education or who do not want that kind of experience to be able to succeed and be the best with that public education. 
   The underlying bill and the Lott-Gregg-Hutchison-Frist amendment gives the tools to our country to create the public education system of excellence that is required to keep America a meritocracy and not an aristocracy. 
   Thank you. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator ROTH and Senator GRASSLEY for helping us write a very good bill that will give relief to 21 million married couples in this country; 42 million people will receive a benefit. 
   When I go through my State and a policeman comes up to me and says, ``I cannot believe how much more I am paying since I got married,'' or a schoolteacher or a county clerk or a sheriff's deputy, I wonder what could we be thinking. This is not a tax cut; this is a tax correction. Twenty-one million American couples are paying a penalty only because they are married. That is not right. 
   The President of the United States, in his March 11 radio address, addressed six tax cuts he thinks would be a good idea. Two of those are in the bill we are voting on today. He said:  
   ......a tax relief to reduce the marriage penalty, tax relief to reward work and family with an expanded earned income tax credit.  
   Of the six tax cuts he says he favors, two are in the bill on which we will be voting. One has to ask the fair question: Why would so many of the Democrats refuse to let us bring up the bill that addresses exactly what the President has asked us to send to him? 
   We sent him marriage tax penalty relief last year. He vetoed the bill. He said there was too much in it; there were too many other tax cuts. I happen to believe there is not a tax cut that I do not like because I think hard-working Americans deserve more relief. We are only using part of the income tax withholding surplus here, not Social Security surplus, not even 
   all of the income tax withholding surplus. We are only using part to give the money back to the people who earned it. 
   Nevertheless, the President said it was too much. So we said: All right, we are going to send him smaller tax cut bills just as he requested. 
   We sent him one which removed that terrible added tax on Social Security recipients between the age of 65 and 70 who want to work and make more than $17,000. That is gone. We passed the bill, we sent it to the President, and he signed it. 
   There must be a real problem on the Democratic side, and I quote the distinguished leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate in Reuters on April 13 of this year when he said:  
   I think the Republican bill is a marriage penalty relief bill in name only. It's a Trojan horse for the other risky tax schemes they have that have been proposed so far this year.  
   To what risky tax schemes could he be referring? Was it the Social Security earnings tests we eliminated for  people who are over 65 and want to work? Was it the education tax credits we have passed and is now in conference to help parents by giving a credit for their children's education starting in kindergarten and going all the way through college? Or is it the small business tax credits he thinks are risky tax schemes to help our small business people create new jobs to keep our economy going? 
   I do not think one can make the case that this is a risky tax scheme. This is marriage penalty relief for 21 million American couples who are paying the tax only because they got married. In addition, we add more people who will get the earned-income tax credit because they are coming off welfare and are working and feeling good about themselves. We want to encourage them to do that. A family of four making $31,000----

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa, who has done a wonderful job in managing this bill, and more importantly for his role in the Finance Committee to make sure that we have a great marriage tax penalty relief bill. 
   I thank the Senator from Montana for talking in straight terms, as he always does, about what our priorities are: Does this money belong to the people who earned it or does it belong to the Federal Government in Washington, DC? 
   I think it is very interesting; when people talk about tax cuts, you can tell immediately how Members are going to vote by how they refer to the tax cuts. 
   As the Senator from Missouri said earlier, if you are going to be against tax cuts, you are going to say: How much will it cost the Federal Government to give this tax relief? But if you believe that people who earn the money deserve to keep it, then you are going to say: How much is it going to cost the American family if we do not give them back part of the excess that they have sent to Washington in income tax withholding? 
   I want to make the point again, we are not talking about the Social Security surplus providing money for tax cuts. We are talking about the income tax surplus. That means that people have sent too much to Washington and we are trying to return some of it. 
   I think it was an interesting argument earlier, on the Democratic side, where it was shown that Federal taxes have gone down in our country. We are trying to lower Federal taxes, but, in fact, what has happened is local taxes have gone up. So all of the neutral sources in our country today tell us that there is, in fact, a higher tax burden on the average American family today than ever before in peacetime. That is a big burden on an average family. 
   About 40 percent of the average family's income is taken in taxes. That is a fact. And we are in peacetime. We do have a balanced budget. We do not need that much. We should send it right back to the people who earned it, to put in their pockets for them to make the decisions as to how to spend it. That is what we are trying to do today. 
   I think it is interesting when you listen to the debate. The distinguished Democratic leader yesterday said, in the debate: ``I think the Republican bill is a marriage penalty relief bill in name only. It is a Trojan horse for the  other risky tax schemes that have been proposed so far this year.'' 
   I want to go over what we have taken up this year, what we have proposed this year, and just say to the American people: I wonder what the risky tax schemes are. 
   Is it a risky tax scheme to let people on Social Security between the ages of 65 and 70 work without paying a penalty? Is that a risky tax scheme? Is the education tax credit that Senator COVERDELL passed earlier this year to give parents a tax credit to buy education enhancements for their children--the computers, the extra books, the tutors--a risky tax scheme? Or is it the small business tax relief that we passed to try to give our small businesses an opportunity to grow and create new jobs in our country? 
   I am not sure to which ``risky tax scheme'' the Democratic leader refers. But if that is a ``risky tax scheme,'' I am guilty because I do believe the hard-working people of this country deserve to keep more of the money they earn. 
   This marriage tax penalty relief was provided for in the budget we passed last week. We would take only 50 percent of the allocation over a 5-year period. We think that is quite responsible as stewards of our tax dollars.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 2000. I would like to recognize the efforts of Commerce Committee Chairman MCCAIN and Aviation Subcommittee Chairman GORTON who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. I am also joined by Senators INOUYE, ROCKEFELLER, and BRYAN in this effort to improve the security of the flying public. 
   Approximately 500 million passengers will pass through U.S. airports this year. Protecting their safety in an incredible challenge to the men and women of the aviation industry. The Federal Government, through the Federal Aviation Administration and Industry together, must do everything within our power to protect the public from the menace of terrorism and other security threats. 
   In 1996, soon after the tragedy of TWA flight 800, I proposed new requirements to improve security at the nation's airports. Congress adopted these requirements as part of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. This legislation tried to improve the hiring process and enhance the professionalism of airport security screeners. The act also directed the FAA to upgrade security technology with regard to baggage screening and explosive detection. 
   In my view, the FAA has been slow to implement these vital security improvements. The FAA does not plan to finalize the regulation to improve training requirements for screeners and certification for screening companies until May 2001. Five years is too long to wait. Technology upgrades have also been slow in coming, even though the upgraded technology is readily available. The traveling public should not have to wait yet another year before these improvements are implemented. 
   The FAA must modernize its procedure for background checks of prospective security-related employees. An FAA background check currently takes 90 days. That is too long. Under current procedures, the FAA is required to perform these checks only when an applicant has a gap in employment history of 12 months or longer, or if preliminary investigation reveals discrepancies in an applicant's resume. But 43% of violent felons serve an average of only seven months. This gap should be closed. 
   My legislation, the Airport Security Improvement Act, would direct FAA to require criminal background checks for all applicants for positions with security responsibilities, including security screeners. The bill will also require that these checks be performed expeditiously. 
   My legislation also directs FAA to improve training requirements for security screeners by September 30 of  this year. FAA should require a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction and 40 hours of practical on-the-job training before an individual is deemed qualified to provide security screening services. This standard would be a substantial increase over the 8 hours of classroom training currently required for most screening positions in the U.S. The 40 hour requirement is the prevailing standard in most of the industrialized world. 
   Finally, my bill would require FAA to work with air carriers and airport operators to strengthen procedures to eliminate unauthorized access to aircraft. Employees who fail to follow access procedures should be suspended or terminated. I understand that FAA is currently working on improving access standards. I hope this bill will encourage them to do so in a timely fashion. 
   We are privileged to have with us today a distinguished panel of witnesses who are well-versed in the area of airport security. I want to welcome them to the hearing and I am looking forward to their testimony.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for taking time on the Senate floor to discuss an issue which is not before us this very minute, but it is something that requires much more thought, much more long-term debate in the Senate. 
   I commend the leadership of these two distinguished members of the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis. Certainly, both have served in our military quite honorably, and especially Senator CLELAND, who has given so much for our country. I say thank you for setting aside this time. I look forward to participating on future  occasions that you are setting aside for discussion of the big picture items. 
   I think one of the problems we face today is we haven't truly come to grips with what America's role in the world is in the post-cold-war era. The issues you are bringing forth are exactly what we should be setting out in order to have a policy in the post-cold-war era that allows the United States to take its rightful place and do the very best job we can for America and for our allies around the world. 
   It is an understatement to say that the United States is the world's only superpower. In pure military terms, we are a colossus. Our troops are in Japan, Korea, throughout Europe, and in the Middle East. 
   We guard countless other nations. We keep tyrants in check from Baghdad to Pyongyang to Belgrade. No other nation has ever wielded such military power. 
   Leadership on this scale requires discretion, the confidence to know the right course, and the will to pursue it--the confidence to know when not to engage but to encourage others to do so. 
   True leadership is striking out on a right course of action grounded in a central philosophy of advancing the American national interests. Simply put, both our allies and our enemies must know what to expect from the United States of America. We must always be strong. We must rely upon diplomacy to maintain much of our leadership. But when diplomacy fails, global leadership may require the use of military force. 
   When and how should the United States use our military power? 
   There was a time when the answer was clear. During the cold war, we determined we should only use military force when our vital national interests were clearly threatened. In the cold war, there was a clear military focus on a threat we could easily identify. We knew that if we acted, the Soviets would react. There was a clarity. 
   Today, however, because we are the only superpower, we are often called upon to act when there is a crisis anywhere in the world. Leadership in this instance requires much more discipline than in the past. 
   In our political system, that discipline comes from the checks and balances that have been built into it. 
   The only clear authority our Constitution grants to the President in committing our forces to conflict is in the role of Commander in Chief to deploy troops. But equally clear in the Constitution, Congress alone has the power to declare war, to raise and support an Army, and to provide for the Navy. 
   Our framers couldn't have been more clear on this issue. They did not break with the monarchy in England to establish another monarchy in America. They feared placing in the hands of the President the sole power to commit to war and also implement that war. Yet, especially in the last 50 years, Presidents have sent our troops into conflict without formal declaration of war that would be required by Congress, and not only for emergencies such as repelling sudden attacks that were envisioned by our founders. 
   Congress is being gradually excluded in its constitutional role in foreign policy. The consultation process is broken, and it must be fixed. 
   In a representative democracy such as ours, elected officials must stand up and be counted when the fundamental decisions of war and peace are made. 
   I believe it is important for Congress to reclaim its deliberate role intended by the Constitution. I have proposed limits on the duration and size of a force that can be deployed without congressional approval. I have proposed that the President be required to identify the specific objectives of a mission prior to its approval by Congress. 
   Too often operations such as those we have seen in Bosnia, and now Kosovo, become open ended with no milestone to measure success, no milestone to measure failure, and no exit strategy. 
   It is the hallmark of this administration for the United States to go into regional crises and displace friendly, local powers who share our goal and could act effectively on their 
   own. In Kosovo, we fought and sustained an unsustainable government. We are trying to prevent the realignment of a region where the great powers have tried and failed many times to impose their will on ancient hatred and atrocities. 
   In fact, I am interested in working with others to see if we can address this issue. We must condition future peacekeeping funds on the requirement that the administration reconvene the parties to the Dayton peace accords that ended in the Bosnia conflict, and those involved in the Rambouillet talks that resulted in Kosovo, and other regional interests. 
   We must review the progress we have made and begin developing a long-term settlement based on greater self-determination by the governed and less wishful thinking by outside powers. This will probably involve tailoring the current borders to fit the facts on the ground. But this will create the condition for a genuine stability and reconstruction. When we take up further funding of Bosnia and Kosovo, I am not going to try to determine the outcome of these talks, but it is essential that we reconvene the parties to see where we are. For Heaven's sake, that is a modest proposal from the world's only superpower. 
   Years ago, President Nixon laid out principles on how our military forces should be used overseas. Based upon his principles, I offer the following outline for a rational superpower to try to bridge the ethical question: 
   First, we should acknowledge that bold leadership means war is the last resort--not the first. We cannot let our allies and our enemies suck us into regional quicksand. This is what happened in Bosnia and Kosovo. Our allies refused to act on their own, insisting they could not take military action without a commitment of U.S. troops. That was not the case. Our European allies have sophisticated military forces. We should have been ready with backup assistance with heavy air and sea support, intelligence monitoring, supplies, and logistical coordination, but they did not need our combat leadership for a regional conflict that could be contained by their own superb ground forces. 
   Second, we should not get involved in civil conflicts that make us a party to the conflict. We learned this with tragic consequences in Somalia when we got in between warring forces trying to capture one warlord. Yes, Serbia has a terrible leader. And it was tempting to punish him with our military force. But look who pays the price with many innocent civilians in Serbia as well. Often these types of missions are ones in which our allies can do a better job because oftentimes it takes more money and it is less efficient for American troops to do peacekeeping missions. 
   When we commit 10,000 troops, it is not 10,000 troops. It is 10,000 troops on the ground and 25,000 troops in the surrounding perimeter to protect them. This is because American troops are always the target wherever they are, as they were in Somalia and as they have been in Kosovo. You are never going to hear me say we should not have the protection force. Of course, we are going to have the protection force if our troops are involved. 
   I have heard it said by many in our military who come home from overseas that if there is an incident, it is going to be against us. 
   I have heard our military people say if they are walking with other groups of military on parade, that people who are wishing to protest will let the Turks go by, the French go by, and the Brits go by. They wait for the Americans to hurl the epitaphs. We have to have a protection force. But that is not the case for many of our allies. 
   Third, why not help those who are willing to fight for their own freedom? The administration seems to see no option between doing nothing and bombing someone into the stone age. 
   There are, too often, other options. These options that we ignore, and sometimes even oppose, include local forces willing to fight for their own freedom. 
   In Bosnia, for example, since 1991, we have maintained an arms embargo on the Muslim forces who wanted, and begged, to be able to fight for themselves. I met with them many times. I have been to Bosnia and that region seven times. I am going again next week. I am going to have Easter services with the great 49th Division, the reserve unit that is in control of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. Congress voted to lift the arms embargo and allow the Muslims to have arms to defend themselves, but the administration opposed it. For 3 years the Muslims and Croats were routed because  they could not fight. They didn't have the arms. But the Croats got the arms, they ignored the arms embargo, and they fought back. When they did, President Milosevic cut a deal. 
   I think we need to look at the option of helping people who are willing to help themselves rather than keep a fight artificially unfair. 
   Fourth, we should not even threaten the use of troops except under clear policies. One clear policy should be if the security of the United States is at risk. When should we deploy our troops? We need a higher standard than we have seen in the last 6 years. Look at the war in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. security interests were at stake. A madman, with suspected nuclear and biological weapons, invaded a neighboring country and threatened the whole Middle East. It could have realigned the region in a way that would have a profound impact on the United States and our allies and subjected the entire territory to chemical, biological, and perhaps nuclear weapons. 
   We, of course, should always honor our commitments to our allies. If North Korea invades the south, we are committed to helping our allies. We also have a responsibility toward a democratic Taiwan, which has been under constant intimidation from Communist China. We have the world's greatest military alliance, NATO, where we are committed to defend any one of those countries that might be under attack from a foreign power. 
   It is in the U.S. interest that we protect ourselves and our allies with a nuclear umbrella. Yes, we would use troops to try to make sure a despot didn't have nuclear capabilities. 
   These are clear areas of U.S. security interests. However, the United States does not have to commit troops on the ground to be a good ally. If our allies believe they must militarily engage in a regional conflict, that should not have to be our fight. 
   The United States does not have to commit troops to be a good ally. If our allies believe they must militarily engage in a regional conflict, that should not have to be our fight. We could even support them in the interest of alliance unity. We could offer intelligence support, ``airlift,'' or protection of noncombatants. We do not have to get directly involved with troops in every regional conflict to be good allies. 
   When violence erupted last year in Indonesia, we got it about right. We stepped aside and let our good ally Australia take lead. We helped with supplies and intelligence, but it wasn't American ground troops facing armed militants. 
   Instead, we should focus our resources where the United States is uniquely capable; in parts of the world where our interests may be greater or where air power is necessary. 
   It is not in the long-term interest of our European allies for U.S. forces to be tied down on a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia or Kosovo while in some parts of the world there is a danger of someone getting a long-range missile tipped with a germ warhead provided by Saddam Hussein and paid for by Osama Bin Laden. 
   A reasonable division of labor--based on each ally's strategic interests and unique strengths--would be more efficient and more logical. 
   What has been the result of our unfocused foreign relations? Qualified personnel are leaving the services in droves. In the past 2 years, half of Air Force pilots eligible for continued service opted to leave when offered a $60,000 bonus. 
   The Army fell 6,000 short of the congressionally authorized troop strength last year. We used up a large part of our weapons inventory in Kosovo. We were down to fewer than 200 cruise missiles worldwide. That may sound like a lot, but it's just a couple of days worth in Desert Storm. 
   So let's be clear that if we do not discriminate about the use of our forces it will weaken our core capabilities. If we had to send our forces into combat, it would be irresponsible to send them without the arms they need, the troop strength they need, and the up-to-date training they must have. It takes 9 months to retrain a unit after a peacekeeping mission into warlike readiness. 
   As a superpower, the United States must draw distinctions between the essential and the important. Otherwise, we could dissipate our resources and be unable to handle either. To maximize our strength, we should focus our efforts where they can best be applied. That is clearly air power and technology. This will be the American responsibility, but troops on the ground where those operations fall short of a full combat necessity can be done much better by allies with our backup rather than us taking the lead every time. 
   Any sophisticated military power can patrol the Balkans, or East Timor, or Somalia. But only the United States can defend NATO, maintain the balance of power in Asia, and keep the Persian Gulf open to international commerce. 
   I thank the distinguished Senators ROBERTS and CLELAND for allowing Members to discuss these issues in a way that will, hopefully, help to solve them in the long term.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. I hope we are going to be able to move to pass this bill before people have to write their checks during the weekend deadline for income taxes this year. 
   Right now, there are negotiations underway between the Republicans and the Democrats about what kind of amendments should be offered. I very much hope that the Democrats will agree to offer some relevant amendments because I think there are surely legitimate disagreements about how we would give marriage tax penalty relief. But I also hope we will not have extraneous amendments offered, no matter how good the cause, which would take away from what President Clinton asked us to do, and that is to send him a marriage tax penalty bill that does not include extraneous legislation. That is what we are attempting to do. 
   So I hope we can move forward into the amendment phase and talk about our differences. I think the distinguished Senator from Indiana wants tax relief for hard-working married couples. I think we may have a few differences, but in the end I suspect that he and I will both vote for the bill that is passed out of this Senate; that is, if we can get to the vote. That is what I hope we can do. 
   I think we need to be very careful in the debate, though, about accuracy and what the different proposals are going to do. I heard a Senator earlier today in debate say that this bill on the floor will break the Treasury. I think the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, perhaps didn't look at the numbers and didn't match it to the budget resolution because, clearly, this not only doesn't break the Treasury, it doesn't even spend half of the allocation in the budget we passed last week for tax relief. In fact, it is $69 billion over 5 years, and the budget we passed last week is $150 billion over 5 years. So this is not even half. 
   We do hope to give tax relief to other people in our country. We want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We want to let seniors work if they are between 65 and 70 and not be penalized for it, and that bill has already been passed. We want small business tax cuts to make it easier for our small businesses to create the jobs that keep our economy thriving. We would like to give education tax cuts. Under the leadership of Senator COVERDELL, we passed education tax cuts that would help people give their children the education enhancements that would increase their education quality. All of these things fit within the $150 billion tax relief in the budget that we passed last week. 
   I think this is quite responsible and I think it is long overdue. We are talking about a tax correction as much as anything, because it is outrageous to talk about people who are single, working; they get married and they don't get salary increases, but all of a sudden they owe $1,000 more in taxes. It is time to correct this inequity. That is exactly what the bill before us does. It corrects the inequity all the way through the 28-percent tax bracket. It helps people all the way through those income brackets. 
   Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleague from Alabama if he would like to speak. I don't know if others are waiting to speak, but he was waiting earlier. I am happy to yield to him at this time because he has been a leader in this effort. 
   How much time does the Senator need?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for making those points because I think they are very important. The differences between the Democrat alternative and the Republican plan that is on the floor are actually quite extensive. 
   In the first place, the Democrat plan is $100 billion less in tax relief for American families. We are trying to cover more families. Not only are we trying to cover the people who are in the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket, which takes us through everyone who pays taxes up to $127,000 in joint income, but it also increases the earned-income tax credit for those who don't pay taxes at all. This is what helps a person who has been on welfare who goes to work and actually makes a salary of from $15,000 to $30,000 not have to pay any kind of penalty, even though they don't pay taxes. 
   We want to add to the $2,000 earned-income tax credit $2,500 more to the salaries that would qualify for the earned-income tax credit. This is an incentive for working people who are in the lowest levels of pay to continue working and to realize that it is more important for them to work and to have an incentive to work than to be on welfare. 
   The points made by the Senator from Iowa are very appropriate. The Republican plan not only offers more relief, it offers more relief to more people, $100 billion more. 
   Secondly, the Democrat plan is phased in over a very long period of time. It doesn't become fully effective until 2010. It is very backloaded. Fifty percent of it doesn't even take effect until 2008. We want to try to make that timeframe less, and we want to have significant tax cuts for hard-working American families. 
   Of course, we truly do believe that people will be able to make the decisions with the money they earn better than they will be able to live with decisions made in Washington, DC. In fact, I think it is very important that people realize, as they are writing their checks on April 15--or Monday, April 17, if they can wait until the very end--that the chances are they are in the 48 percent of the married couples. If they are in that 48 percent that has a penalty, their tax bill next year will be an average of $1,400 less, if we can pass the Republican plan, send it to the President, and if the President will sign it. The President has said he is for tax relief for married couples. We certainly think he should sign the bill. If he doesn't sign the bill, we would really like to know why because this is a better tax cut plan. 
   There is probably just a difference on what is a marriage bonus. For a married couple where one spouse decides to stay home and raise the children and they don't pay as much in tax as the single person doubled, I don't think that is a bonus. I would not want to tell my daughter, who has three children, that she is not working when she is staying home with them. Thank goodness we have people who want to stay home and raise their children. I don't want to make that decision for them, but I certainly want them to have the option and not be penalized in any way. 
   I think everything we can do to encourage families to be able to make that choice we should do. I do not consider it a bonus. What I want is total fairness. What I want is, if a person is single and marries another single working person, when they get married there is no penalty whatsoever. The $1,000 we now make them pay because they got married would be spent instead by them, to start building their nest egg, to have their first home, to buy the second car, whatever it is they need, as newlyweds, who are the ones who struggle the hardest. We want them to have the benefit of not having discrimination in the Tax Code. 
   What we are talking about is tax relief; it is a tax correction. It is saying that we don't want to penalize people for getting married. When 48 percent of the married couples in this country do have that penalty, what we want to do is correct it. I hope the Democrats will work with us to have relevant amendments that could be put forward. This is a good debate. I think we can differ on the way we would give marriage tax penalty relief. But my plea with the Democrats is let us take it up. Don't say that you have to offer extraneous amendments which don't have anything to do with marriage tax penalty, especially when President Clinton has asked us to send him a marriage tax penalty bill. That is what I hope will happen at 5 o'clock. 
   I hope the President will work with the Democrats and tell them he believes in tax relief. I hope we can pass that relief for the hard-working Americans who deserve a break. I urge my colleagues to help us offer these amendments. Let's debate them and let's give Americans tax relief as they are signing those checks to the Federal Government this week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Montana for saying, first of all, he thinks we will have a marriage tax penalty relief bill passed. I certainly think a couple of amendments--five or six or so--on either side, which are relevant, to try to perfect legislation is quite reasonable. I hope that is what the Democrats intend to offer. That isn't what we have seen so far. So perhaps we are coming to a conclusion. I hope so. 
   Let me say that if the only bill on the floor were the Democratic alternative, I would vote for it because I have voted for it before. It is not a bad plan. But I think the Republican plan is better. Here is why. First of all, our plan helps more people who are in the lower levels, the middle-income levels, who really need this kind of help. We say that if a single person making $35,000 married, or a single person making $30,000, you double the bracket so their combined bracket is going to be the same. They will not be penalized in the 15-percent bracket or the 28-percent bracket. Now, I would be for going all the way through those brackets because I am for tax relief for hard-working Americans. 
   Ours is a bigger bill. It covers more people. I think it is the better approach. I would be for bracket relief across the board, too, because I think the tax burden is too heavy and we are talking about the income tax surplus, not the Social Security surplus. So this  is the money people have sent to Washington that is beyond what the Government needs for the Government to operate. So I think ours is better, but I don't think yours is bad. I just hope we can give the most tax relief to the most people.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. If we took our plan and yours and put them together, I would think that would be better than the Republican plan. Your plan alone is not as good as the Republican plan because it doesn't give that much relief. Our plan gives $2,500 more in the earned-income tax credit. This is helping people come off of the welfare rolls and have the opportunity to be paid to make them whole. These are people who make $12,000 to $30,000 a year, when they have two children, a family of four. It also helps people in the 15-percent bracket and in the 30-percent bracket.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate on the repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. I think perhaps there is a misunderstanding of what this resolution does. I will reiterate it. 
   The bill which Senator LOTT has introduced, along with Senator MURKOWSKI and myself, gives a Federal fuels tax holiday that would suspend through the end of this year the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax that was put on about 3 or 4 years ago. If the average gasoline price in our country reaches $2 a gallon, it would suspend for the rest of this year the entire 18.4-cent-per-gallon Federal excise tax on gasoline. 
   The bill specifically holds harmless all of the trust funds. Social Security, and the highway trust funds would not be affected. So we would make up any lost revenue from other sources, not the highway trust fund. 
   I do not think the highway contractors should be alarmed. The highway contracts are going to go out just as they have been. We are now 2 years ahead in contracting. There will be no suspension of the contracting under the highway trust fund. I think our highways are a first priority, and I do not think the highway contractors should be concerned in any way that that is going to lessen to any degree. 
   It is very clear what this does. It says to the traveling public, it says to the family trying to take a vacation, it says to the truckers who are depending on a gasoline price that is stable, so they know what that price is going to be, approximately, when they make their contracts to haul goods back and forth in our country, we are going to have a suspension of up to 18 cents a gallon until prices come down to a level that is reasonable and that could have been anticipated when a contract was made. Airline passengers are paying $75 one way on most trips across this country because of this gasoline price increase. 
   We need to respond to something so basic to so many people, and that is the transportation costs--for people to take a family vacation, to drive to and from work, or for their very livelihoods, if they are truckers. We are going to respond to this crisis. 
   I have heard people from foreign countries say: I do not know what you Americans are complaining about; we pay $4 a gallon in Europe--in Brussels, in London. That is not the price on which our economy is based. We travel greater distances. We have an economy that is based on gasoline prices in the $1- to $1.40-a-gallon category. That is an important part of the cost of doing business in our country. 
   Furthermore, we do have the ability to control our own destiny. We do have the ability to drill and explore in our country. Many private businesses, small businesses, want very much to do that. They want to be able to drill a well as small as one producing only 15 barrels a day. 
   To put that in perspective, a 15-barrel-a-day well is a very small well. The average well in Alaska produces 650 barrels a day. In the Gulf of Mexico, it could be 10,000 barrels a day. We are talking 15 barrels a day. Our small businesses can continue to do business and make a modest profit on a 15-barrel-a-day well, but they have to know the price is going to be somewhat stable. When oil prices went down to $9, $10 a barrel, 2 years ago, these little guys could not make it. These little producers are small businesses, and they could not break even on $9 or $10 a barrel. 
   What I would like to propose is that we pass the bill before us today to give instant relief to the consumers and business people in our country, but that we look at the longer term issue as well, and that is, what can we do to encourage our small businesses to be able to stay in business, drilling wells that produce 15 barrels a day or less? If they will stay in business, they will produce the same amount we import from OPEC today. That is the important issue. We will not be at the whim of OPEC, to have huge price spikes, if we will encourage our own people to explore and drill even the small wells. 
   There is another advantage of that, and that is it keeps the jobs in America. Today we are going to foreign countries and producing because it is cheaper to do it over there in OPEC countries or in Mexico or Venezuela. It is cheap to do it there. That does not create American jobs; it creates jobs in foreign countries. 
   If we pass the bill before us today and say we are going to give relief immediately to the people who are driving to work, the people who depend on a stable price as they drive their trucks carrying goods back and forth across the country, I am saying let's look at the long term, too. Let's look at the stable price that is necessary for them to enter into contracts that will keep them in business. Let's do it by encouraging our small producers to take the risk to go out and drill either a dry hole or one that would produce up to 15 barrels a day, by giving them a tax credit if the price goes below $17 a barrel, so they can stay in business, much as we do for farmers when the prices they can get on the open market do not allow them to break even. 
   We want the farmers to stay in business so they will be able to continue to provide food for our country and for export. Why not do that for a small producer? If that well produces 16 or more barrels a day, no tax credits, because the margin, then, is much higher and they will be able to break even in the low-price times. 
   I am saying let's give immediate relief and let's look at the long term, let's do something that will be a win-win for our country, something that will provide more price stability so we will not have the price spikes we are seeing now. We do that by stopping our 56-percent dependence on foreign imports for the fuel we require every day in this country. Let's do it by creating more American jobs for small businesses, and let's keep those jobs in America so we will be more self-sufficient and more in control of our own destiny. 
   I hope my colleagues will pass the bill that is before us today, give the instant relief, and say we are going to protect the highway fund absolutely, so the contracts can continue to be let and our highways will continue to be built and improved and maintained. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader to yield for a question. 
   I am confused. It appears the distinguished deputy minority leader suggested you were not conducting the Senate like the Senate. Yet you have offered to go forward on the bill, you have offered to have the Democratic amendment that is a substitute come forward, and you have offered to go into morning business so that no one is obligated.  
   The alternative, it seems to me, is to shut down the Senate entirely. I don't think that is conducting the business of the Senate as the Senate should be conducted. 
   I ask the distinguished leader, does it appear that the distinguished group from the minority doesn't want to debate the marriage tax penalty at all and would prefer to shut down the Senate rather than talk about this very important tax correction for the hard-working people of this country?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was going to ask the distinguished leader if the comments made are correct that he has approved every amendment that came forward. It seems to me we have voted on a number of amendments that wouldn't have been the choice of the majority leader, but the majority leader has tried to accommodate the minority. I can't think of anything we haven't voted on this year. Frankly, I can't think of one issue that we haven't addressed, whether we wanted to or not. 
   The idea being put forward that somehow the majority leader is running the Senate as if it is under his control, I think, is so far out of bounds it is almost laughable. I hope we could at least have morning business to talk about whatever 
   issues Members want to discuss. 
   I want to talk about the marriage tax penalty. My distinguished colleague from Illinois wants to talk about organ transplants. I can't imagine why the distinguished minority would object to morning business so Members from his side and Members from our side could talk until, hopefully, the majority and minority leader are able to come to an agreement on some kind of reasonable timetable so we can enact marriage tax penalty relief for the 21 million American couples who pay a penalty, who are going to be writing their checks to the U.S. Government this week, realizing they are paying $800, $1,000, $1,400 or more just because they are married and because the Tax Code clearly has an inequity that we have the ability to address. 
   We can have legitimate disagreements on this issue. If we are going to have irrelevant amendments, I ask the American people to look at the issue for what it is. Let Members debate, let Members talk about our differences on the issue. I hope the distinguished minority won't shut down the Senate.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for making a wonderful statement about the importance of the marriage tax penalty and tax relief in general for the hard-working people of our country. He is absolutely right; people are paying a higher rate of tax than they have ever paid in peacetime. 
   I am concerned that there seems to be a problem with taking up this bill and debating amendments. I am very concerned about what appears to be an effort to not take up this bill and have relevant amendments considered. 
   We are going to disagree on the merits of the marriage tax penalty. I hope we come to a conclusion that will significantly lower the marriage tax penalty for most of the 21 million American couples who now pay that penalty just because they are married. 
   I hope the distinguished minority will allow us to go forward with the debate. I hope my colleagues will allow us to talk about our differences on this issue. 
   I want to be clear; the questions we have just heard in the last hour appear to be related to offering amendments which are not relevant to the marriage tax penalty and could, in fact, kill the marriage tax penalty bill. If it is the Democrats' strategy to kill the marriage tax penalty bill for 21 million Americans in the name of other amendments they want to offer that are not relevant, I hope they will think about that. 
   We all want to address Medicare and prescription drugs. We have addressed minimum wage. There are many issues on which we can disagree, but I hope we can all agree that those are not relevant to the marriage tax penalty, and that we will not let our disagreements on issues such as minimum wage or the way we want to provide prescription drugs to interfere with a very simple concept, a very clean bill that gives marriage tax penalty relief to 21 million American couples, which is exactly what the bill before us does. 
   In the Finance Committee, Republicans and Democrats of good will debated the marriage tax penalty. They passed a bill out of their committee, and it deals with the marriage tax penalty. It did not deal with extraneous issues because, in fact, the President asked us to send specific bills to him so that he could make his decision on what he would sign and what he would not, one tax cut at a time. 
   We will be able to test the President and his commitment to giving marriage tax penalty relief. We sent him marriage tax penalty relief last year. We sent significant marriage tax penalty relief to the President last year, and the President vetoed the bill. 
   The President said: Oh, you have the marriage tax penalty relief in conjunction with all these other tax cuts. We had across-the-board tax rate cuts that  would have helped every American paying taxes. We had significant cuts in the inheritance tax. We had other tax cuts for small businesspeople. The President said: That is too much. In fact, I think he said it was reckless to give people that much of the money they earned back to them. I believe he said it was reckless. 
   The President said: Give me smaller tax cuts. So that is exactly what we are doing. We are trying to give him a significant cut in the marriage tax penalty. We are trying to say to the President: We want marriage tax penalty relief. You have said you are for it. We are going to send you a bill that includes marriage tax penalty relief, that deals just with marriage tax penalty relief. 
   I would think the Senate would be able to come to an agreement on a marriage tax penalty bill--with relevant amendments of any type--and go forward to discuss our differences on the merits on marriage tax penalty relief. 
   That is what the majority leader offered the Democratic minority. He offered them the ability to have relevant amendments and disagreements on the merits of this bill. That is fair. We all understand that. We have a little different approach on marriage tax penalty relief. We can debate those issues--if we have the chance. But it seems the Democrats do not want us to have that chance. It seems they do not want to be required to have relevant amendments so we can discuss this and give it to the President to sign. 
   I hope it is not the Democrats' view that we should put this off. I hope they are not going to require that we not pass marriage tax penalty relief this week before we go into recess for a week to spend Easter with our families. I certainly hope that is not the result we are going to see here. I hope the result will be reached of a good marriage tax penalty relief bill before we leave for a week of recess over the Easter holiday. I think we owe that to the people of this country. 
   I have received some mail from my constituents.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would just say, the distinguished Senator from Kansas is making a very good point. He has raised this point for the last 3 weeks. That is, are the Democrats going to block consideration of a real marriage tax penalty relief bill by requiring that extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with marriage tax penalty relief be offered as a condition for bringing this bill to the floor? I think the distinguished Senator from Kansas is exactly right. 
   I have to stand up for my majority leader. I am so proud of our majority leader for standing on the floor and offering the Democrats every single option that would keep this floor open for debate. He offered them the option of going forward on their prime amendment. He offered them the option of offering any relevant amendment. He offered them the option of just having morning business so that anyone can come to the Senate floor and talk about their issues of concern. That is exactly what our majority leader did. He did exactly what he should be doing to move the business of the Senate along. 
   I have to say, in response to the Senator from Kansas, I think it is very important it be known that the majority leader has allowed any amendment to come before the Senate. Just last week, on the budget, many of us had amendments that were knocked off--just knocked off the budget--by an objection from a distinguished Member on the Democratic side because he did not want to vote on those amendments en bloc. There were many amendments from both sides of the aisle that were just knocked off. 
   The distinguished majority leader did not do that. He allowed them all to come in. I think he has been the most open he could possibly be in allowing every single amendment of every possible conception to be offered on many of the bills we have had before us this year and, most recently, last week on the budget bill. We have taken a position on every single controversial issue that has been brought up in our country since the session started in January. 
   The distinguished majority leader today is asking that we be able to debate marriage tax penalty relief, with any number of amendments that are relevant, because the distinguished majority leader believes we can have differences in approach. 
   We passed a marriage tax penalty relief bill last year to which we all agreed. It was overwhelmingly passed. We sent it to the President, and it was vetoed. The President said: The tax cut is too much. We don't want to give that much money back to the people who worked so hard for it. Send me something smaller. 
   That is exactly what the Finance Committee is doing. The Finance Committee voted a bill out--smaller, but it does give relief to every single married person in this country. It gives total relief to people in the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket. It increases the earned-income tax credit for the poorest working people in our country. That is what the bill does. So why wouldn't we be able to take the bill to the floor and debate it? 
   I think the Senator from Kansas is on to something. The Senator from Kansas is saying, why would the Democrats want to kill marriage tax penalty relief with extraneous amendments? 
   We have had sense of the Senates.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Kansas for making a very good point. He is saying maybe now it is time for the President to step in and show his commitment on this issue. Maybe he can work with the distinguished Democratic minority in saying, I think this is something we ought to do, such as an emergency. 
   I guarantee Kervin and Marsha Johnson believe it is an emergency, as they are filling out their tax forms this week. Kervin is a D.C. police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They were married last July. This year they will pay $1,000 more in taxes because they got married 7 months ago. 
   I guarantee that Eric and Ayla Hemeon believe this is an emergency. Eric is a volunteer firefighter and works for a printing company. Ayla works for a small business. They have been married for 2 years and are expecting their first child in about a month. Last year they paid almost $1,100 in a marriage tax penalty just because they got married and that they would not have paid if they were single. They are filling out their tax forms right now, and they would like to see the Congress give them relief from paying that $1,100 next year so they can buy something for their new baby. 
   Lawrence and Brendalyn Garrison believe this is an emergency. He is a corrections officer at Lorton prison. She is a teacher in Fairfax County, VA. Last year we estimate they paid nearly $600 in a marriage tax penalty. They are really upset about it. When I talked to them last week, they said: We have been married 25 years and we think you should pass marriage tax penalty relief and make it retroactive. 
   I think they have a good point. They have been paying the penalty for 25 years. This is an error in the Tax Code that must be corrected. 
   Jerri Dahl of Arlington, TX, believes this is an emergency. He wrote me a letter and said:  
   It is tax time again, and I am not going to let it go by without attempting to do something about what I feel is a terrible injustice to working people. I am not joking when I tell you that my husband and I are seriously contemplating divorce in order not to be penalized financially next year.  
   I think we have a number of people in this country who believe this is an emergency, who, as they are writing the check to the Government, believe the Senate should act on a bill that would give them relief from a payment they should not have to make. Most people in our country believe they owe a fair share of taxes to the Government. They love this country and they want to do their part, but most people don't want to do more than they think is fair. When a single person in an office is sitting next to a married person in an office and they have the same job and make the same salary and the married person has to pay more in taxes than the single person sitting at the next desk making the same salary, that doesn't pass the test of fairness. 
   I commend the majority leader for attempting to bring this bill to the floor. I commend my colleague, the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, and the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH. They have been working on this legislation for a long time. Senator ROTH brought the bill forward last year. The President vetoed it and said it was too much. Senator ROTH came back this year. He originally had a different bill--it was a doubling of the 15-percent bracket--but he listened to many of 
   us who said, let's go to 28 percent so people in that middle-income bracket can get relief. That is the middle-income couple who needs that money to be able to do more for their children or to buy their first house or to pay for the car. 
   The working people of our country deserve better government than they are getting today. They deserve better government than the Democrats shutting down the Senate because they don't want open debate on marriage tax penalty relief. 
   I hope tomorrow they will change. I hope they will change and say it is OK to discuss this issue. It is OK to have disagreements, but let's keep our eye on the ball. Let's come together, Democrats and Republicans, and correct the inequity in the Tax Code in this country that says a married person and a single person in the same job making the same salary should pay the same taxes. 
   That is what we are seeking today. I hope the Democrats will come back fresh tomorrow and say: We agree with you. Now is the time to do the responsible thing. Let's correct the Tax Code to say every person working in this country should pay their fair share of taxes but no more. Let's give tax relief to the hard-working married couple who has been paying a penalty for 6 months or a year or 25 years. Let's correct it now because now is the time we can. 
   As the majority leader said about the gas tax reduction that we also tried to give people today: If not now, when? If not this, how? 
   Let us be a little more forthcoming in creativity when it comes to helping the hard-working people of this country have the marriage penalty relief they deserve. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I commend my colleague from Maine for submitting this resolution. It is very similar to a resolution I submitted 2 years ago. Unfortunately, the U.S. Trade Representative has not taken this cause as a serious cause. I hope with bipartisan support on Senator COLLINS' resolution the U.S. Trade Representative will see this is an issue on the northern border and on the southern border. It is a very serious issue that severely disadvantages retailers in the United States and also is a handicap for the consumers in both Canada and Mexico that want to purchase big items such as television sets, refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers available on the borders that they are not able to purchase without huge tariffs. 
   We passed the North American Free Trade Agreement to do away with tariffs so we would have free and open trade across our borders. It is not working when it comes to retailing in that cross border area where people walk back and forth. Parity is achieved if you fly in and out of our three countries, but not if you go across by car. 
   It is a terrible inequity. I hope Senator COLLINS' resolution gets the attention of our U.S. Trade Representative about the seriousness of this issue. I commend her for the resolution.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is absolutely right. We are going to take care of Medicare. We are going to have reform that includes prescription drugs of some kind. But we are saying a good idea is in the wrong place, and it is going to absolutely eliminate the ability for us to correct a huge inequity in the Tax Code. This is not a tax cut. It is a tax correction. Twenty-one million American couples pay an average of $1,400 extra just because they got married. A policeman and a schoolteacher get married and owe $1,000 more in taxes. This is wrong. 
   We must go on record saying that we are not going to tolerate it for one more minute. The Robb amendment eliminates our ability to do that. We cannot allow the Robb amendment to vitiate all the efforts that we have made to correct the marriage penalty tax in this country. We will deal with prescription drugs. We will deal with Medicare. We are committed to doing that, and we are committed to doing it in this budget. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I urge rejection of the Robb amendment and the passage of the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, while the negotiations are going on, I will say it is my intention to offer an amendment, which would be a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that we would eliminate the marriage tax penalty in this country. Certainly, the sense-of-the-Senate is quite short and pretty  clear. The Senate would find that marriage is the foundation of American society; that the Tax Code should not penalize those who choose to marry; that a report to the Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis estimates that, in 1999, 48 percent of married couples will pay a marriage penalty under the present system; 
   that averages $1,400 a year. The sense-of-the-Senate amendment will be that Congress shall pass marriage penalty tax elimination legislation that begins a phaseout of this penalty in 2001, pass marriage penalty tax legislation that does not discriminate against stay-at-home spouses, and consider such legislation prior to April 15, 2000. 
   We are scheduled to debate marriage penalty relief next week. It is certainly appropriate that we say to these people the week they are beginning to write their checks to the IRS: If you are paying $600 more or $1,000 more or $1,400 more just because you are married, help is on the way; the Senate is committed to eliminating this tax. 
   I do not even think we ought to call it a tax cut. This is a tax correction. This is a correction of an inequity in our code. 
   That clearly and simply is what my sense-of-the-Senate amendment is. It is provided for in the budget resolution before us. The Senator from New Mexico has provided $150 billion in this budget for tax relief for hard-working Americans. 
   If one looks at the tax relief we have already passed in the Senate, it still would not reach $150 billion. We passed tax relief for Social Security recipients so people between the ages of 65 and 70 could work without being penalized. We have passed tax relief for small businesspeople who are hard hit with the many regulations and taxes that are put on their businesses. We have provided tax relief for families who are trying to provide enhancements for their children's education. Senator COVERDELL has been the lead on that bill which gives people the ability to take tax credits and tax deductions when they have to buy their children computers, books, tutors, or enhance college tuition or private school tuition--whatever the cost is to parents, to give children the enhancement their parents believe they need and that their parents would be able to give from tax cuts. And we add on top of those marriage penalty relief. 
   We met with some wonderful people this morning--real people--who are suffering from the marriage penalty. The bill that will come up next week has the elimination of that penalty. 
   Kervin and Marsha Johnson met with us today. Kervin is a District of Columbia police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They were married last July. This year they will owe $1,000 more in taxes because they got married. They are newlyweds. They were shocked that this happened. 
   We also met with Eric and Ayla Hemeon. Eric is a volunteer firefighter who also works for a printing company. She works for a small business. They have been married for 2 years and are expecting their first child in about a month. Ayla talked to us about what this means. What it means to them is $1,100 they are paying to Uncle Sam instead of doing something to benefit their first child who is almost here. 
   We had the two newlyweds, and then we had an older couple who met with our group this morning, Lawrence and Brendalyn Garrison. He is a corrections officer at Lorton, and she is a teacher in Fairfax County. Last year, they paid about a $600 marriage penalty. 
   When we talked to them about what the bill which will come up next week would do for them, they said: Gosh, do you think you could make it retroactive? Because they have been married for 25 years. 
   These are real people with real faces who would get marriage penalty relief. 
   Mr. President, I will stop and yield the rest of my time to Senator SESSIONS. I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he will allow me to take 5 extra minutes for the Senator from Alabama.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It will express the sense of the Senate that it is time for marriage penalty relief. Why would we have a Tax Code that says a policeman and a schoolteacher getting married owe Uncle Sam $1,400 more in taxes? In fact, that is exactly what the Internal Revenue Code does, and that is exactly what we want to change. 
   My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we will start working to relieve the marriage tax penalty, and it says we will do it before April 15 of this year. 
   Of course, we all know what April 15 is. It is tax day. We want people who are writing their checks to pay their taxes this year to start thinking about the penalty they pay because they are married, and we want them to know that if our bill passes and the President signs it, they will be relieved of that penalty next year. 
   We are saying it is time for Americans to have a fair Tax Code. This is not so much a tax cut as it is a tax correction, and it is high time we do this. 
   It is amazing we even have to take up a bill such as this because one would think the Tax Code would not discriminate one way or the other between people who are single and people who are married. We are trying to get the fairest return for all Americans. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, 21 million married couples pay this penalty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the penalty averages $1,400. 
   The bill that will be coming from the Finance Committee next week is a terrific bill. It is very simple and very clear. It doubles the standard deduction so that every married couple will have double the standard deduction than they have today. It will be totally fair. The standard deduction will be $4,400 for a single person and $8,800 for a married couple. 
   In addition, it doubles the brackets at the 15-percent level and the 28-percent level. That takes in the large majority of people in our country who pay taxes. In fact, in the 15-percent bracket, over 6 years, we increase the amount that can be made as a couple and still pay 15 percent from $43,000 to $52,000. So we would have $8,650, to be exact, more in the 15-percent bracket before one goes into the 28-percent bracket. 
   The 28-percent bracket today stops at $105,000, and we take it to $127,000, so one would still pay in the 28-percent bracket rather than going to the 31-percent bracket. 
   In addition to that, we take the very lowest income people who receive an earned-income tax credit and we make that credit $2,500 instead of the $2,000 it is today. 
   We are trying to do something for people in the lowest bracket and in the middle bracket. We think this is going to help the 21 million couples who are affected by this onerous tax disadvantage. 
   I had the privilege of meeting today with three couples, all of whom would have their marriage tax penalty totally eliminated if we pass the bill that will be before us next week. 
   We met with Kervin and Marsha Johnson. Kervin is a District of Columbia police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They have been married 1 year. They are going to have to pay  $1,000 more in taxes because they got married last year. 
   We also met with Eric and Ayla Hemeon. Eric is a volunteer firefighter and works for a small printing company. Ayla works for a small business. They have been married for 2 years and are going to have a wonderful event in about 1 month; they are going to have their first baby. 
   But, unfortunately, they are paying a marriage penalty of $1,100 that will take away from what they can do for their new baby. 
   We heard from a couple who have been married 25 years, Lawrence and Brendalyn Garrison. He is a corrections officer at Lorton. She is a teacher in Fairfax County. Last year, they paid $600 in a marriage tax penalty. Mrs. Garrison is clearly a schoolteacher because she said to me: If you pass this bill, do you think we could make it retroactive? Twenty-five years? I applaud her spunk. We will not be able to do that. But we can certainly give them the next 25 years with a little more relief. 
   What we are saying today is, we want the Senate to vote, before April 15, before people are required to have their taxes in, in order to let them think about exactly what they are paying this year; and if they are one of the 21 million couples, they can think about how much less their taxes will be next year if we pass our legislation. 
   So the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment is going to say it is the sense of the Senate that we pass this simple legislation next week. I do not see how anyone could possibly oppose having the marriage tax penalty relieved from so many of the taxpayers in our country. 
   Congress is trying to give relief to a lot of people in our country who have been burdened with unfair taxes. This year, for instance, we have given tax breaks to small businesspeople because we know the economic engine of America is small business. We know that the taxes and regulations hurt small business the most because they have the smallest margins. They are having a hard time making ends meet. So we have given tax relief to small businesses. 
   This year, we have given tax relief for parents who are trying to enhance their children's education. We are trying to give tax relief to a parent who would want to buy a computer for a child, or extra books, or perhaps a tutor, or perhaps tuition, or perhaps a band uniform. All of these things enhance education. We want people to have some tax breaks to be able to do that. Senator COVERDELL passed that bill earlier this year. 
   We have given medical savings accounts as tax relief for people who would build up a savings account for their medical expenses--tax free--as an encouragement to provide for their medical needs. 
   We have given relief to Social Security recipients who are 65 to 70 years of age who want to keep working but heretofore have been penalized for that right. 
   All of these tax cuts that we have given this year--plus the marriage penalty tax relief we will give next week--total about $136 billion over 5 years. 
   The budget resolution we are debating today has $150 billion in tax cuts reserved because we are committed to tax relief for hard-working families. So we are well within this budget resolution with the tax cut bills that have been passed by this Congress so far. 
   So far, the President has not signed any of these bills. Some of them have not gone to the President. But we hope he will sign the Social Security bill, which will be the first one on his desk, so that Social Security recipients will have the option to work if they so choose. We hope we will put the others on his desk in due order, including the marriage penalty relief. 
   We have passed marriage penalty relief before, but the President vetoed it last year. We are coming back. The President said: Send me these bills one at a time. That is exactly what we are doing. We are sending him marriage penalty relief by itself to see if he really is committed to tax relief for hard-working American families. 
   I hope we can pass this sense-of-the-Senate amendment; it will take the first step toward saying the Senate is serious about marriage penalty relief. I believe we will be able to pass this bill next week. I think we will send it to the President. I think he will have a chance to explain to the American people that he either does support marriage tax penalty relief or he does not and, if not, why. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope they will not support any amendments that are extraneous to this amendment because it is pretty simple and pretty clear; we are seeking the support of the Senate for marriage penalty relief. I hope we can do it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the marriage tax penalty. We are trying not so much to give a tax cut to married couples but to make a tax correction. It is not the business of Government to say that when you are married your taxes should be higher. The Tax Code should be blind. 
   It should be fair to all. Any single person making $35,000 a year marrying someone making $35,000 a year should not automatically go into a higher tax bracket. In fact, under today's Tax Code, that is exactly what happens. It is one of the most egregious oversights of our tax system that we must address. 
   It is estimated that 21 million married couples pay a marriage penalty; about 48 percent of people in this country who are married pay a penalty for being married. The question is, What can we do to correct that inequity? This is not just a tax cut. It is a tax correction. 
   Yesterday, Senator ROTH revealed his plan that will go to the Finance Committee for markup, hopefully, tomorrow. It is a very solid beginning. His plan, first and foremost, does something that will affect every single married couple: It doubles the standard deduction. 
   Today, the standard deduction is $7,350 for a married couple. It is $4,400 for singles. One would think a married couple would get $8,800. That is not the case. They get $7,350. Regardless of the tax bracket, there is a marriage tax penalty from the standard deduction. Senator ROTH's bill doubles the standard deduction next year. 
   Second, the bill starts with the lowest tax bracket, the 15-percent bracket. Over a 6-year period, starting in 2000, that bracket will be doubled for married couples. This is an $8,650 increase that allows people to continue paying in the 15-percent level for $8,650 more. Basically, that means if someone today is making up to $43,000 as a married couple, they are in the 15-percent bracket. We raise that to $52,500. As a married couple making about $26,000 a year, they will stay in the 15-percent bracket and will not have that penalty. 
   It is important for people to know that everyone pays up to the $52,000 in the 15-percent bracket. Even if you go up to the 28-percent bracket or the 36-percent bracket, you will also get that 15-percent bracket relief. 
   It was my hope to double the 28-percent bracket, as well, because this is where most people get hit the hardest. A policeman who marries a schoolteacher gets hit in that 28-percent bracket. They are making approximately $30,000 each. They would not be fully covered under the bill that will go to markup. 
   There will be opportunities to increase that bracket to 28 percent, which is what we hope to do. We want to go up to about $120,000 in joint income to do away with that penalty for married couples. We will take the 28-percent bracket up to about $126,000. A 28-percent tax bracket is almost a third of what a person makes, so with salaries of $40,000 or $50,000, it is a pretty big hit, especially if you have children and are trying to do the extras for their education. 
   We have the 15-percent bracket doubling, starting in 2000. We want to make that 28 percent, but even if we can do the 15 percent, it is certainly a step in the right direction, saying to people they should not be penalized because they chose to get married. The penalty is not small. The average is about $1,400 more that people pay. If they are making $28,000 a year or $40,000 a year and have to pay $1,400 more in taxes, that is a lot of money, money that could be saved for the first downpayment on a house. It is money that could be put on car payments, mortgage payments, or a family vacation. 
   This is the time in people's lives when they need the money the most, when they are a young couple, just beginning. They do not have a nest egg yet. To tax them $1,400 more a year is a heavy penalty. There is no reason for it. We should not make the choice for people that if they get married they must pay more taxes. 
   The alternative minimum tax is also reformed in Senator ROTH's plan. The alternative minimum tax is a tax that is levied on people. An alternative minimum tax is levied perhaps because too much of their income is tax free. This has begun to hit more and more people. 
   The alternative minimum tax has begun to hit people who make $75,000 a year as married couples. This keeps them from having the $500-per-child tax credit fully given; it keeps them from getting the Hope scholarship money fully given; it keeps them from having an adoption credit fully given. It takes away the value of those credits. 
   We say to people: You get a $500-per-child tax credit because we want you to have more of the money you earn, but if you make over $75,000 a year, we will take part of that credit away. We want to make those types of tax credits, the nonrefundable tax credits, whole for people, regardless of where they are in the system. We don't want the marriage tax penalty to encroach on that, as well. We are trying to exempt those nonrefundable tax credits from the AMT. 
   We also increase the earned-income tax credit for low-income couples, so if a person chooses to go to work and get off welfare, which is what we are encouraging them to do, we don't want to punish them by taking away their earned-income tax credit. 
   It is ironic that today we say to a married couple: You will pay more in taxes than if you had stayed single. We have a higher tax burden in our country today in peacetime than any time since World War II. We are trying to take away some of that tax burden on hard-working Americans. We find with many couples that both work because the tax burden is so high. They are trying to do extra things for their children. In order to meet all of their needs and the extra requirements they have for giving their children a good education, they are having to go to work. That second income is penalizing that spouse who decides to leave the home and go into the workplace. 
   This is wrong. It is time to end this unfair part of our Tax Code. We started trying to correct this inequity 3 years ago. We sent President Clinton a bill that had marriage tax penalty relief in it and the President vetoed that bill. 
   It is very important that President Clinton look carefully at this particular bill. It hits people at the lower and middle-income level. The President has said he is for income tax relief for middle-income people. He has said that in public statements. But, in fact, he has vetoed the marriage tax penalty relief we have sent him. 
   I hope this is going to be a clean bill. I hope it will be a bill that is not amended with extraneous amendments that are not marriage tax penalty amendments. If we can send that clean bill, then I think the President will have some explaining to do if he does not sign it to give this relief to hard-working American couples. 
   We are about 20 days away from having to file the income taxes for 1999. April 15 is the day. April 15 is Saturday, so we get a reprieve until April 17. But when people are filling out their income tax returns in the next few weeks, I hope they will think of this marriage penalty that most people are paying in this country. I hope they will realize Congress is trying to give people relief. Congress is trying to double the standard deduction, so when you are filling out your form in the next 20 days, realize if you are married, your standard deduction is $7,350. Under our plan it would be $8,800 that would be totally exempt from taxation. 
   Furthermore, we would give you about $8,000 more over the next 6 years in the 15-percent bracket. So whereas today you would start going into that 28-percent bracket at $43,000, we are going to give you up to $52,000 over a 6-year period with the bill that is going into the Finance Committee tomorrow. We are hoping we can even expand that to the 28-percent bracket so more people will pay at the lower bracket levels. This will help every single tax-paying American who is married and paying this penalty. 
   I hope very much the President of the United States is listening. I hope we can pass this clean marriage penalty bill through the Senate. We have a good start in the House bill. We have a good start from the Senate Finance Committee mark. I hope we can even make it better. With a relatively small addition, I think we can. I think we can go from the 15-percent to the 28-percent bracket--doubling. That will give significant relief to the most taxpayers in this country. Most people pay in the 15- and 28-percent brackets. That is where I think we need the relief. 
   I urge my colleagues to work with us on this marriage penalty relief. I urge the President to listen to the hard-working people of this country who are saying: We need relief, and most of all, we need fairness in our tax system. It is not fair to tax people because they are married. 
   I see my colleague from Georgia is on the floor. My colleague from Georgia has been one of the early cosponsors of this marriage tax penalty relief. He has been a stalwart defender of fairness in our Tax Code and fairness in our tax system. I appreciate that he is here and I yield the floor to the Senator from Georgia.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator COVERDELL for his remarks. He laid out the fairness question very well. I thank him for the leadership he has provided in trying to give tax relief to hard-working American families on several fronts. Of course, he was the leader helping people give their children extra education benefits. Unfortunately, that bill was vetoed last year by the President, and hopefully, having passed it again this year, the President will give that area of tax help to the hard-working families who want to send their children to college or who want to buy a computer for their child in elementary school. That has been led by Senator COVERDELL. 
   Certainly, Senator COVERDELL is now helping lead the effort on reduction of the marriage penalty tax because, of all the Tax Code inequities, this is the biggest. It affects the most people. It is the biggest tax cut that should be given. It is a fairness question. 
   If one is a policeman and making $30,000 a year and marries a schoolteacher, why should they pay $1,400 more in taxes just because they get married? There was no promotion, no bigger salary but the same salaries, two people, and they got married. They pay $1,400 more a year in taxes. It hits the schoolteacher and the policeman the hardest. 
   It is the people making that $25,000 to $35,000 who get hit the hardest. Yet that is the couple trying to save to buy a home for their family or to upgrade a home or to buy the second car or to go on a family vacation. This is money that should not be spent by the Federal Government; it is money that should be spent by the people who earn it. That is the question today. 
   We are going to continue to debate the issue of the marriage penalty tax, and we will be testing people to see what their priorities are. Why would we continue to have this inequity in the Tax Code when we can fix it? We can fix it, and we are going to have the opportunity to do that the week people are beginning to pay their taxes. We are going to take this bill up the week of April 10, so that when people are filling out their tax forms, they can look at that standard deduction and say: My goodness, I am a married person and my standard deduction is $7,350 and it should be $8,800. If the bill that will be before the Senate on April 10 is passed, it will be $8,800 next year, and this year will be the last year that a married couple has to pay more taxes because of the standard deduction inequity. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator from Georgia. I urge my colleagues to look at this issue. Let's focus on doing away with this inequity as soon as we possibly can. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of our Energy Committee, for taking the lead on this very important issue. Not one person who drives a car in this country or rides on an airplane can fail to realize what is happening--that we have oil prices that are going through the roof and it is affecting every one of us in our daily lives. 
   The sad thing is that this could have been avoided. We had the opportunity to present an energy policy in this country that would not make us beholden to foreign oil resources. In fact, when President Clinton took office, we imported 48 percent of the oil needs in our country. Today, it is approaching 56 percent. Over 50 percent of the oil needs in our country are imported. 
   I am going to vote for all the quick fixes that we can to get prices down as quickly as possible because it does hurt people who have to drive for a living, or those who are planning family vacations, to have this kind of added expense they didn't count on. But if we do a short-term fix without a long-term fix, we are doing nothing to solve the real problem in this country--that we are consuming more oil than we are producing and we are too dependent on foreign sources. 
   I want to help the people in the Northeast who are suffering from terrible heating oil shortages and high prices. I want to help every American who is driving a car and seeing $50 register on the gasoline pump. I want to make sure we realize we can do something to make our own country more self-sufficient and these are things that will be good for everyone. 
   When prices were so low that small producers could not break even--in 1997 and 1998--we lost much of the small business in our country that is in oil production. I have a great empathy for farmers in our country, as does Congress and the President. So 
   when prices are artificially low for agricultural products, we do something for the small farmer to make sure they can stay in business because they are the bread basket of America and it is in all of our interests to do that. 
   But somehow, when we talk about small oil producers, people don't think of that as a small business. They think of oil as big oil. They think of it as J.R. Ewing. That is not the small producer in our country. A normal well in our country would be putting out 1,000 barrels. In Alaska, they put out 6,000 barrels a day. When we talk about a marginal well, we are talking about a 15-barrel-a-day quantity; the output is 15 barrels a day. This is a very small, low-profit-margin well. These are small businesses that are creating jobs in America. 
   What I want to do as part of a long-term solution is help those small producers when prices go so low that they have to go out of business and close their wells. In 1997 and 1998, 20 percent of these producers were put out of business because prices were $7, $8, $9 a barrel and they could not break even. Once a well is shut in, they pour concrete down the hole, so it is very expensive to reopen it. 
   Now, to put this in perspective, you might think, why would we want to save a 15-barrel-a-day well? The reason is that all of those small wells, put together--about 500,000 of them across the country--can create the same amount of oil as we import from Saudi Arabia. So if we can keep these little guys in business, that creates a base for our country that does make a difference--the same amount of oil we import from Saudi Arabia that we are getting in our own country, creating jobs in our own country, creating taxpaying citizens, paying taxes to school districts, paying sales taxes to our States and income taxes to the Federal Government. So this is not a loss to the Federal Government; this is a win for everyone. 
   In my State of Texas, where they have given tax breaks to small producers--the 15-barrel-a-day producers--they have reopened wells and they have put over a billion dollars into the economy of the State just by giving incentives for these small guys to stay in business. So if we can do this when prices fall below $17 a barrel, we will create revenue for our States and Federal Government, jobs for American people, and we will create more oil so the price is stabilized, so we won't see the spikes caused by foreign countries deciding they are not going to produce. It is a win for everyone. 
   This is not big oil. The big oil companies rarely, if ever--I would say never, but I could be wrong; maybe there is a well out there that is 15 barrels a day, but it is not the kind of thing big companies do. But it is a livelihood for a small producer, and we should treat them like a small family farmer because it is in our interest to do so. It doesn't hurt us in revenue, it helps us. 
   My addition to the long-term solution here is to help producers who are drilling wells that produce 15 barrels a day, or less, by giving them a tax credit for the first 3 barrels of the 15 barrels when the price falls below $17 a barrel. 
   That is it. 
   If it goes to $18 a barrel, there is no tax credit because then they can break even on their own. But when it falls below $17, then they need that help to keep those jobs, to keep that well pumping until they get to $18 a barrel. Frankly, if we did this, the prices would stabilize and we wouldn't have the lows and the highs. 
   I commend our chairman, Frank MURKOWSKI, for putting together a package. I wish we had an energy policy from the administration. I hope they will work with us. 
   Our package says we are going to lower the gasoline taxes immediately until prices go back up to the $17 or $18 a barrel level; we are going to give help to people who need help in extra funding for fuel oil; we give help to the truckers who rely on fuel prices being at a steady level when they make contracts. We will do the short-term fixes. But we must address the long-term problems. If we did, we could pump immediately 250,000 barrels a day in our country with the small guys, with the little guys--the little oil producers who would reopen a well or believe they could make the investment to go back in and start drilling again--and start our production so we would not be totally beholden to foreign countries for our energy needs. 
   I hope our package is not just short-term fixes because if it is, we will be walking away from the responsibility of Congress to have an energy policy that will for the long term stabilize prices at a reasonable level so we can keep jobs in America and so we can have the security that we will not import more than 50 percent of the needs of our country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the chairman is exactly right. In fact, if we helped these small stripper wells and these little guys so they could afford to go back in and drill again, we would be creating the same number of barrels as we import from Saudi Arabia. They could produce 250,000 barrels almost immediately if they knew there was a policy that would protect them against a drop because then they could afford to make the investment.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on March 7, 1959, history was made when the first aviator charted over a million miles in a jet. Although it seems commonplace today, at the time, traveling a million miles was indeed, an aviation milestone. Well, today, more than forty years later, we are considering another aviation milestone of sorts: a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration which will be of significant benefit to our nation's communities, our air infrastructure and the flying public. 
   I represent a state that has an enormous amount of aviation. Texas is home to one of the Nation's busiest airports, DFW, but we also have 27 other primary airports, 21 designated reliever airports and more than 1600 other small airports that Texans depend upon to get from one place to another. Therefore, I recognize the importance of aviation to my state, the critical role my state plays in the national aviation system and the important of Airport Improvement Program funding in maintaining it. 
   This bill provides a framework and the necessary tools to responsibly and substantially fund our nation's air infrastructure as we have never done before. For the first time we will guarantee that all receipts and interest in the Air Trust Fund--totaling more than $33 billion--will be spent over the next three years for only aviation purposes. We will enhance air safety, allow local areas to provide for their financial needs, and assist our traffic controllers in watching our skies and protecting the flying public. 
   The Airport Improvement Program, on which so many of our airports rely, will see an increase of $1.9 billion this year alone. It will increase to as high as $3.4 billion over the next four years. This funding will allow our airports to make necessary improvements to their existing facilities and expand to accommodate the amazing growth that all of our nation's airports have seen in recent years. Additionally, the Military Airport Program, which helps to assist our current and former military airports by providing funds for needed structural improvements, will see a boost from twelve airports to fifteen designated and eligible this year, and 20 designees, thereafter.  
   In Texas, we are affected by both national and international air traffic growth. Traffic to Latin America in the next few years is set to exceed capacity and place an even larger burden on neighboring air route systems. This will affect traffic in the Gulf of Mexico, in particular, where traffic is controlled in large part by the air traffic control center in Houston. 
   In fact, this is one important area where improvements are greatly needed. A large portion of the Gulf of Mexico remains without visual communication on radar, nor sufficient two-way communication, in general. Traffic in much of the gulf is controlled solely by one-way radio communications. The Gulf of Mexico airspace accommodates passenger airlines serving destinations worldwide, cargo and general aviation traffic engaging in air commerce, and heavy helicopter traffic serving the offshore petrochemical industry. It also serves important users such as our armed forces, Coast Guard, Customs Service, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. All aircraft, from large commercial planes, to military aircraft, to helicopters need to have direct two-way communication to protect the safety of all those who fly these skies. 
   Currently, if a craft hits turbulence due to poor weather and seeks to ascend or descend the pilot must radio in to a controller, who must check the frequency and the surrounding traffic and then dial and pilot back and advise him on altering his position. One-way communication alone simply to reach the controller can take as long as seven minutes, and as long as fifteen minutes total to relay back to the controller. This is unacceptable for a pilot who needs to respond immediately to escape violent turbulence and blindly must change his altitude. This frightening scenario could be all too real and common as air traffic grows. 
   The FAA Gulf of Mexico Task Force was formed to highlight the problems in the gulf and recommend solutions. More than 100 individuals representing the Federal Aviation Administration, airlines, the military, and others in the industry have come together to address this problem and seek an expeditious and thorough remedy. We can wait no longer to let this safety hazard go unaddressed. This bill gives the FAA the tools to begin to remedy this situation. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction to provide for our aviation needs, both on the ground and in the sky. By putting our Aviation Trust Fund dollars to work we can help all airports large and small provide for their needs. We can ensure that our skies are safe, our airports are secure and that our controllers have modernized tools to accommodate the growing air traffic demand. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has decided to pass this important legislation.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York for their leadership on this issue, finally getting it to the floor in this form. I think it is very clear we are going to pass it and give the needed relief to our senior citizens.  
   I could not go forward without mentioning my colleague, Senator MCCAIN. Senator MCCAIN received a huge welcome back to the Senate. No one has forgotten what has happened in the last 3 months. I think a great impact has been made on the politics of our country. I think the contribution made by Senator MCCAIN will resonate for a long time to come. He has brought new people into the process. He has shown what courage is. He has given people an idea of what courage and serving one's country can do. I think he has added tremendously to the process. Our Republican caucus met at noon, and he got the longest standing ovation he probably ever will get. Certainly it was heartfelt. I think everyone is very glad we are going to have him back and working with Members to put together many of the reforms about which we have been speaking. 
   It happens that the bill we are discussing today was originally introduced by Senator MCCAIN. He was the first to introduce the bill to repeal the earnings test on Social Security benefits. 
   In 1935, when Social Security was passed, we had a very different senior citizen population and a very different need in our country. People didn't live as long. They were not as healthy. They were not as vigorous. They didn't want to work, by and large, after the age of 65. Today, if people want to work after the age of 65, they have contributed to Social Security all their lives, and they decide they want to take their benefits, what happens? They get docked. For every dollar over $17,000 a Social Security recipient receives, they lose $3 in their Social Security benefits. 
   Today is not 1935. Today people are vigorous. Many people want to work. Many people want to supplement their incomes. We also have a need for more workers in this country. We have very low unemployment. Our high-tech companies are asking people to come back to work. They need skilled workers. Our service industry is burgeoning. It needs skilled workers. This group of senior citizens is among the best in our country, and they now have a surtax because they receive Social Security benefits. 
   Let me give an example. If someone earns $26,000 a year and they are on Social Security, they lose $3,000 of their benefits. The average Social Security recipient receives $9,600 in benefits. So one-third of their benefits is lost if they go to work. 
   What Senator MCCAIN said is very important. The people to whom this matters most are the people who need it. It is not the person who has been fortunate in life and has investments; they are not worried about the $9,600 or $12,000 in Social Security benefits. It is the person who is living on $26,000 or $30,000 a year who wants to be able to work to add a little extra cushion. That is what was intended under Social Security; that would be a baseline. Hopefully, one would have the ability to have savings to add to their retirement security. Some people have not gotten the savings so they want to work. 
   There is no reason in today's good times to severely penalize a solid worker, someone we actually need for our economy. 
   I thank Senator ROTH from Delaware and Senator MOYNIHAN from New York for bringing this bill to the floor. Senator ASHCROFT has been a great leader, as well as Senator MCCAIN. Many have worked together on this. 
   The bottom line is, this is an idea where the time has passed. It hasn't come, it has gone. We should have done this years ago. We have chipped away at it. We are on a roll right now to take that earnings test up to $30,000 from $17,000. That is not good enough. We can eliminate it. This is the right thing to do. This is the time to do it. We have a burgeoning economy. We need the workers. We need the high-tech employees. We need these solid citizens in our economy. If they want to be here, they should have the choice. 
   I urge our colleagues to pass this quickly. I hope we can pass it cleanly, get it to the President, and give these people the opportunity to make their choices in their senior years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, and the other cosponsors of the bill, the Marginal Well Preservation Act of 2000. This bill represents a necessary and workable proposal to ensure that the United States does not lose even more of its domestic energy production and to help prevent the further escalation of gasoline, diesel, and home heating oil prices for consumers. 
   Mr. President, just a few days ago, on March 18, President Clinton announced his support of a number of provisions to respond to the recent spike in oil and gasoline prices in America. Among the issues to which he referred, I was most pleased and surprised to hear the president express his support for, quote, `tax incentives ..... for domestic oil production,' enquote. 
   Well I for one welcome the President's long overdue endorsement of an issue that I and many other Senators have been promoting, discussing, and introducing legislation on for years. It is unfortunate that the President's newfound support for domestic oil production comes now, rather than a year ago when our domestic producers were being wiped-out by record low oil prices and when communities across Texas and other states were having their economic and tax base decimated. Nevertheless, I do welcome the president's comments, and I urge him to now turn those comments into action. 
   I publicly urge him and the Treasury Department to pledge to sign into law, and to urge Congress to pass, the bill we are introducing today. Called the Marginal Well Preservation Act of 2000, this bill borrows from legislation I introduced earlier this year to create incentives to keep marginal wells (those producing fewer than 15 barrels per day--and a corresponding level for natural gas) in production during times when oil and gas prices fall below break-even. The bill also contains provisions that the Administration explicitly endorsed over the weekend: the same-year deduction of geological and geophysical (exploratory) and delay rental costs associated with lease development. Taken together, these two provisions will help ensure a minimal level of protection for our nation's independent oil and gas producers and will help prevent America from becoming even more dangerously dependent on foreign oil. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the President's recent round of proposals, tt seems as if everyone these days has their own ``quick fix'' to address the recent spike in oil and gas prices. But regardless of what short term solutions may be proposed, as America slips further and further into dependence on foreign oil the volatility of oil and gasoline prices is almost certain to get worse. The only logical response to this crisis is to increase our domestic supply of oil and gas. 
   Much of the estimated 350 billion barrels of our domestic oil reserve lies not on public lands, but on private property where oil and gas production already occurs. Why isn't that oil and  gas being produced? The answer is that much of it is in small pockets and is relatively difficult to retrieve. Such ``marginal well'' production accounts for roughly 20 percent of our domestic oil production, or about as much as we import from Saudi Arabia. 
   But while these wells are critical to our energy security, they are the most susceptible to oil price crashes, like we saw during 1998 when oil fell below $10 per barrel. During this time we lost over 65,000 American jobs and over 150,000 marginal oil and gas wells. And despite the high price of oil today, the small, independent producers that own the majority of marginal wells cannot assume the economic risk of re-opening them because there is no assurance that the price of oil will not again fall in the near future (see enclosed article). 
   The Marginal Well Preservation Act will provide a tax credit of $3 per barrel for the first three barrels of production when oil falls to between $17 and $14 per barrel for oil, and a corresponding price for natural gas. This represents the average break-even price for these wells. In states like Texas, where marginal well tax incentives have been enacted, the result has been to keep thousands of wells open that would have been closed, and thousands of American jobs here that would have moved overseas. Such a tax credit at the federal level would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help us meet our growing demand for natural gas. 
   If we were to enact the marginal well tax credit today, we would not only ensure a long-term safety net for producers, but we would also create an incentive today to re-open those shut-in wells. In fact, a reasonable estimate is that, within a reasonably short period of time, we could bring half, or 75,000 of those shut-in wells back into production. This would mean an addition of about 250,000 barrels of daily production. Given that America uses 19 million barrels of oil per day this may not seem like much, but when one considers just how tight the supply of oil is today, this relatively small increase in production could have a significant impact in the price of crude oil and oil products like gasoline and diesel fuel. 
   In addition, Mr. President, this bill brings the U.S. Tax Code in line with the present-day realities of the oil and gas industry by allowing oil and gas exploration (geological and geophysical) costs to be expensed rather than capitalized, and by allowing delay rental lease payments to be deducted in the year in which they are paid, rather than when the oil is actually pumped. The Administration's own endorsement of this measure, which I and others have been promoting for years, should mean it's quick enactment into law, and I hope that it does. 
   In fact, the Administration estimates that allowing the expensing of exploration costs alone could spur an additional daily production of 126,000 barrels, on top of the roughly quarter million barrels that the marginal well provision would bring back in the near-term. For those keeping score, that totals almost 400,000 barrels of added daily production that can conservatively be expected to result from the passage of this bill. But it must be done soon. We are quickly approaching a $2 per gallon nationwide price for gasoline, and we have not even entered the peak vacation driving season. Americans need relief now, and this bill will give it to them. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue, and I appreciate the support of Senator BREAUX and my other colleagues who are cosponsoring the bill. Most importantly, I urge the President and my other colleagues in the Senate, particularly those from non-energy producing states, to join with us in supporting this effort. High prices and low prices are two sides of the same coin, and it is high time we realize that. Price dives are as detrimental to producers as price spikes are to consumers. 
   We can break this cycle, and we can do it now by passing the Marginal Well Preservation Act.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this year commemorates the 88th anniversary of the founding of this outstanding organization and designates the week of March 11, 2000 as National  Girl Scout week. I am joined in supporting this resolution by Senator MIKULSKI and Senator HATCH. 
   On March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America became the first national organization for girls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress. 
   The Girl Scout Organization has long been dedicated to inspiring girls and young women with the highest ideals of character, conduct, and service to others to that they may become model citizens in their communities. It is not easy growing up, particularly in today's society. The Girl Scouts is one organization that has consistently guided young women in their formative years. 
   For 88 years, the Girl Scout movement has provided valuable leadership skills for countless girls and young women across the nation. Today, overall membership in the Girl Scouts is the highest it has been in 26 years, with 2.7 million girls and over 850,000 adult volunteers. I am proud to say that I, too, was a Girl Scout. 
   I am pleased to be joined by Senator MIKULSKI in support of this legislation which designates the week beginning March 11, 2000, as ``National Girl Scout Week.'' I ask our colleagues to join us.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the high gasoline prices that every one of our constituents is finding at the gas pump today and about the rise in home heating oil prices my friends from Maine and Vermont were talking about that are hurting their States so much. 
   In fact, I commend Senator MURKOWSKI for holding a hearing today in the Energy Committee to talk about this issue and what we can do to address it. I was slated to be one of the people testifying at the hearing, but because I was visiting with education leaders from my State, I could not be there and missed the hearing. 
   I want to speak on this issue because this is a crisis coming down the road. For the people in Maine and Vermont, it is here already. But for our constituents who are going to try to take vacations this summer, it is going to hit them right between the eyes because gasoline prices at the pump are going up, and I see no relief in sight. 
   The common refrain today is, the United States has no energy policy. That is not really accurate. The United States does have an energy policy, and it is the wrong one. Our policy is to restrict domestic exploration, and in those areas where exploration is permitted, there are punitive taxes and regulations on producers. 
   The result is that at periods of low prices, such as we had last year--prices on which a small producer cannot break even--those producers leave the business and they do not come back. 
   The fact is, when it comes to our most precious commodity, we do not control our own destiny. We are seeing our Energy Secretary going hat in hand to foreign countries and saying: Please, produce more oil. 
   Worse, we had plenty of opportunity to address this crisis. It did not just happen in a vacuum. In 1998 and 1999, crude oil prices hit their lowest point in decades: $9 a barrel, $8 a barrel. Hundreds of thousands of small wells shut down, and thousands of jobs were lost. Of course, it made us more vulnerable because we lost the production. We have ignored this cycle since the oil price shock of the 1970s. Our dependence on oil from foreign countries is now at 55 percent. 
   Energy-producing and energy-consuming States share two interests: Maintaining a large and reliable source of energy in our own country, and reducing volatility in oil and gas prices. 
   Unfortunately, the measures proposed by this administration to address the current crisis in home heating oil will not address either of these priorities. There is talk about increased funding for the Energy Department Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps homeowners make their homes more efficient. Others support an increase in the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to provide heating assistance to low-income families. We are discussing a temporary adjustment of EPA sulfur content limits in home heating oil. I have seen requests for additional appropriations for the Coast Guard icebreaking efforts in waterways. We are even considering getting the Federal Government into the price-fixing business by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   These are stopgap measures. But the most important thing is, if we enacted all of them, it would not solve the problem. We need a policy that encourages domestic production that is sustainable when prices go below break even. 
   While the problem is fairly localized now, we are going to see long gas lines this summer or we are going to see people not taking their summer vacations. 
   Instead, we need the quick fixes--we need to address some of those areas that need fixing right now for low-income families--and we need an energy policy that goes along with it that will sustain domestic production through the busts we have seen in the last 2 years. We need price stability. 
   The first step toward breaking that cycle is a simple one: Understanding that cold Vermont households and out-of-work Texas wildcatters are two sides of the same coin--our overdependence on foreign energy sources. 
   At the heart of our growing dependence on overseas sources has been the steady decline in the number of small producers. Wildcatters--small producers--once drilled more than 9,000 wells a year. Last year, there were 778. You wonder why we have an oil shortage? Many of these wells are so small that once they close, they cannot be reopened; it is not financially sound to do so. 
   What are we talking about? What is a wildcatter? A wildcatter is a person who has a well that produces 15 barrels or fewer a day. There were close to 500,000 such wells across the United States. Together, those wells, at just 15 barrels a day, have the capacity to produce 20 percent of America's energy 
   needs. This is roughly the same amount of oil that is imported from Saudi Arabia. During last year's oil price plummet, more than one-fourth of these small wells closed, most of them for good. We have it within our capacity, in our country, to produce that 20 percent of the oil that is consumed here, which is the same amount we are importing from Saudi Arabia. 
   The overwhelming majority of producing wells in Texas are these marginal wells. In fact, marginal wells account for 75 percent of all crude production for small independent operators, up to 50 percent for midsized independents and 20 percent for large companies. So even the major companies can make a go of it with the small wells if we do not saddle them with so many costs that it is not financially feasible. 
   A more sensible energy policy would be to offer tax relief to producers of these smaller wells; that would help them stay in business even when prices fall below break even. 
   For 2 years I have been working with my great cosponsors--Senators DOMENICI, NICKLES, BREAUX, and LANDRIEU--on legislation that would provide incentives to these small producers. When they can stay in business during these low prices, supply will go up and we will not see that supply shortage causing high price spikes. 
   I think our legislation provides a quite reasonable tax credit: A $3-a-barrel tax credit for only the first three barrels of daily production in one of these small wells. We offer similar credits for small gas wells. 
   The marginal oil well credit would be phased out when prices of oil and natural gas actually go up. For oil, it would phase out at $14 to $17 a barrel. We are not talking about having tax credits today when we are paying $30 a barrel for oil; we are talking about tax credits when the price falls below break even. 
   At 14 to 17 barrels a day, a small producer can make it. So when the price goes up, the tax credit goes out. The tax credit is only for the first three barrels in a well. A countercyclical system such as this would keep these producers alive during these record-low prices. They are not grabbing when the price is $20 a barrel; they are trying to stay in business and keep those jobs when the price goes below break even. 
   There is another benefit to encouraging marginal well production. It has a multiplier effect. In 1997, these low-volume wells generated $314 million in taxes paid to State governments. These revenues were used for State and local schools, highways, and other State-funded projects. 
   Another part of our plan is to offer incentives to restart inactive wells by  offering producers a tax exemption for the cost of doing so. So going in and trying to reopen a well that has been capped, which is very expensive, could be done with a tax exemption for the expenses of doing it, and that would ensure greater oil availability and increase Federal and State tax revenues. Everyone would win--more jobs, more tax revenue for our States, and, most importantly, more domestic oil. 
   Actual results have shown that this can work. In my home State of Texas, a program similar to this has met with huge success. Over 6,000 wells have been returned to production, with State tax abatements injecting $1.6 billion into the Texas economy in a year. Think what we could do nationwide. 
   A recent study by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission examined State incentive programs and found that the average program attracts $1.1 billion in investment over its lifetime, with over $50 million in net tax collections typically associated with each incentive. That incentive will create 6,000 jobs and $16 billion in impact for the States. 
   There is more to do. We should look for ways to reduce the cost of excessive regulation on our domestic producers. This was what the fight we had last year over MMS royalty valuation was about. Some said it was a giveaway to big oil. It wasn't. It was about keeping costs low so we don't push more producers out of business. Maybe those paying record prices for home heating oil and gas today have a different perspective on that issue now. The MMS is going to release its new oil royalty valuations tomorrow, and I challenge everyone to see if they raise the price of drilling for oil on public lands. If they do, the President is just saying, yes, we are going to continue that policy to try to keep domestic production down so we can be held by the throat by OPEC countries. 
   The overlapping regulations that govern exploration and production and refinement add $4 to $5 a barrel to the cost of oil. Compare that with the overall cost of production in Saudi Arabia, including capital and labor, of $2 to $3 a barrel. Is it any wonder that oil companies are drilling in Saudi Arabia instead of in our country, providing jobs for our citizens? 
   Our fight last year on MMS was over the opposition to adding yet another complicated scheme of rules and further raising the cost of production. When gas prices were low, few Senators were listening. In fact, the major television networks weren't listening either. They were pretty brutal during that debate. Today we are seeing the results of that brutality. 
   We don't have to be at the whim of market forces. We don't have to be out of control of our own domestic oil production. 
   What we need is to be part of the price setting, not the price taking. We must increase our domestic oil supply. 
   This is something we can all rally around. I will work with the Northeastern Senators to get quick fixes to their problems. I will work with all of the Senators whose constituents are going to be affected by high gasoline prices. But let us not do a quick fix without also having a longer term fix that would keep our jobs in America, that would keep our oil prices stable, that would keep the revenue coming into our States for schools and highways at a time when prices go below break even. We can have a win for everyone, if we can pass legislation that will provide help for everybody and provide a stable oil supply for our country. We have the opportunity to create a domestic policy for oil and gas in this country that makes sense and will benefit all of our constituents. Let us take that chance. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important point in our history and that is to commemorate this day 164 years ago, Texas Independence Day. 
   Each year, I look forward to March 2d. This is a special day for Texans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day 164 years ago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great, great grandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of Washington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. The declaration stated:  
   We, therefore ..... do hereby resolve and declare ..... that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign and independent republic.  
   At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was hospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After declaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a constitution and organized an interim government for the newborn republic. 
   As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It would exact a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. My great, great grandfather was there, signing the declaration of independence. As most of the delegates did, he went on eventually to fight the Battle of San Jacinto. He didn't know it at the time, but all four of his children who had been left back at home in Nacogdoches died trying to escape from the Indians and the Mexicans who they feared were coming after them. 
   Fortunately, he and his wife, my great, great grandmother, had nine more children. But it is just an example of the sacrifices that were made by people who were willing to fight for something they believed in. That, of course, was freedom. 
   While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican troops held the Alamo under siege, challenging this newly created republic. 
   Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis sent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. He knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he had only a very few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. Colonel Travis wrote:  
   Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, of everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.--William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Commander.  
   What American, Texan or otherwise, can fail to be stirred by Col. Travis' resolve? In fact, Colonel Travis' dire prediction came true--4,000 to 5,000 Mexican troops laid siege to the Alamo. In the battle that followed, 184 brave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend off Santa Anna's overwhelming army. But the Alamo, as we all in Texas know, was crucial to Texas' independence. Because those heroes at the Alamo held out for so long, Santa Anna's forces were battered and diminished. 
   Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to defeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, just a month or so later, on April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible on the horizon at last. 
   Each year, on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where the 54 patriots pledged their lives, honor, and treasure for freedom. 
   On this day, I read Colonel Travis' letter to my colleagues in the Senate, a tradition started by my friend, the late Senator John Tower. This is a reminder to them and to all of us of the pride Texans share in our history and in being the only State that came into the Union as a republic. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to continue the tradition that was started by Senator Tower, because we do have a unique heritage in Texas where we fought for our freedom. Having grown up in the family and hearing the stories of my great great grandfather, it was something that was ingrained in us--fighting for your freedom was something you did. 
   I think it is very important that we remember the people who sacrificed, the 184 men who died at the Alamo, the men who died at Goliad later that same month. Their deaths gave birth to Texas Independence and we became a nation, a status we enjoyed for 10 years before we entered the Union as a State. 
   I might add, we entered the Union by a margin of one vote, both in the House and in the Senate. In fact, we originally were going to come into the Union through a treaty, but the two-thirds vote could not be received and, therefore, President Tyler said, ``No, then we will pass a law to invite Texas to become a part of our Union,'' and the law passed by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate. 
   I am very pleased to, once again, commemorate our great heritage and history.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment adds flexibility to our school systems. I am working with Senator JEFFORDS and his committee, and Senator LEAHY as well, on the ESEA reauthorization. 
   I wish to lay down the marker with this amendment because I think it is the key to what we are talking about. We are trying to give parents more options for their children to make the choices that are best for each child. 
   One of the problems we have in high-needs schools across our country is that we do not have qualified teachers to teach subjects that will benefit young people all over our country. It may be computer courses. It may be language courses. Yet we have people who have had careers--people in the military, people in corporations and businesses--who may be proficient in French and they may live in an area where the school is not able to teach French because they do not have a qualified teacher. This would be a big benefit to the young people in that school system if they had that as an option. It may be the Russian language or the Chinese language. It may be computer skills. It may be chemistry or biology classes. There are so many areas, but they just are not teacher qualified. 
   My bill, which is called Careers to Classrooms, is being offered as an amendment to give more flexibility to the States by allowing them to go to a high-needs school and give priority in that high-needs school to recruiting teachers. 
   My amendment also encourages a certification process that will bring the teacher up to speed quickly. It is an expedited certification process so the teacher will not have to wait a whole year to go into the classroom but can go through an expedited certification process by that State. 
   It is important we replicate the programs that have succeeded. My Careers to Classrooms amendment replicates the Troops to Teachers Program that has been in place and has been very successful. It uses retired military people who have experience in the military which they can transfer to the classroom and enrich educational opportunities for our young people. This allows people in the private sector to do the same. 
   This is similar, but not the same, as the Graham amendment. The Graham amendment goes toward the universities being able to have programs. Mine is for the States to put these programs in place. 
   I urge the adoption of my amendment. I think it adds an enriching experience for the classrooms, particularly in high-needs schools, whether it be in an urban community that does not have access to teachers or in our rural areas. 
   I happen to know of a case involving a woman who was a French major in college. She had taught French in private schools. She moved to a small town in Texas where they wanted to offer French in the high school. She wanted to teach it, but she could not because she did not have the teacher certification. 
   This is made to order for this situation. This is a French language major who taught French in private schools and who wants to give this opportunity to a small Texas high school. I want her to be able to do that because we know those students will be enriched by having that option. 
   I urge the adoption of my amendment. I hope we can offer this kind of enrichment to schools all over our country by giving the States this option. 
   Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the bill if I can ask approval of my amendment. Does he want a voice vote?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak. I am very pleased to support the bill. Of course, I acknowledge the leadership of Senator COVERDELL and Senator ROTH. They have been the leaders in trying to give more choices to more parents in our country to do what is best for their children. 
   In Washington, sometimes we get a one-size-fits-all mentality, but everyone knows that every child in this country is different and every child has different needs. What we should be doing in Washington is giving parents the ability to choose what is best for their particular child. That is what S. 1134 does. 
   The Affordable Education Act of 1999 is exactly what this country needs to empower parents to do the best for their children. Our goal is to give every child the opportunity to succeed in this country. No child can succeed without a good education. 
   This bill is simple and it is compelling. We have in the law now an education IRA. It allows post-tax contributions to be invested and then used tax free for college tuition and other costs. This is a great idea. 
   Once again, Senator COVERDELL and Senator ROTH led us to pass this bill. It creates an added incentive for Americans to save, particularly at a time when Americans have a negative savings rate. It encourages more Americans to think about and plan for and pay for college for their children. More college-educated Americans mean more higher-income Americans; it means more tax revenues to offset the lost revenues. If ever there was a win-win tax policy, this is it. 
   So why would anyone oppose expanding this tremendously successful program for K through 12 education expenses? We have a high school dropout rate that is unacceptably high for the greatest country on Earth. We have children who are unable to afford basic supplies, much less computers. We have children literally trapped in failed schools. 
   I support this bill because I support the ability of parents to choose what is best for their children. This bill ensures the maximum possible flexibility for parents. If they wish to save for college and use the proceeds to pay for college tuition on a tax-free basis, they can do that. If they want to use the proceeds to purchase band uniforms for their child, they can do that--or books or computers or anything that would relate to the education or development of their children. 
   And yes, parents can use the accounts for private or parochial school tuition--which forms the core of the opposition to this bill by the President and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   I am not going to apologize for supporting a bill that allows working families to save their own hard-earned  money to send their children to the school that will give them the best choice and the best start in life. It takes not one penny from the public schools in this country. 
   I do not apologize for supporting that because I know working-class Texans who have told me they want the choice to send their child to a school that they think is the best. 
   Choice is what this bill is all about. Choice is at the heart of a provision that I offered to this bill last year, 
   which was passed on the Senate floor before being vetoed by President Clinton. That amendment would, for the first time, make Federal funds available for public single-sex schools and classrooms as long as comparable educational opportunities were made available for students of both sexes. 
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved this amendment on two previous occasions. I am confident it will again because I am going to bring it up on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act scheduled to be taken up later this year in the Senate. 
   I might say, Senator COLLINS, who is sitting in the Chair today, is a very strong supporter of this amendment. I appreciate her leadership on this issue. She has talked to parents in Maine who have wanted to be able to send their children to a single-sex classroom because they know that child would be able to do better in that environment, but they have been discouraged by the Department of Education. 
   So because of that experience, because Senator COLLINS listened to her constituents in Maine, we are now going to team up and let every child in America have the choice that the parent in Maine wants for her child. 
   I offered that provision to help remove the cloud of doubt that was hanging over the education community about what the Federal Government would do if parents decided this is what they wanted, and they went to the school board and asked for the authorization of a same-gender school or classroom. 
   The amendment is simple. It adds the establishment and operation of same-gender schools and classrooms to the list of allowable uses for funds under title VI, the Federal innovation education block grant program. This amendment is necessary because for too long the Department of Education has discouraged States and public schools from pursuing voluntary single-sex programs, despite the clear benefits that such programs have for some students and despite the fact that they would only be offered where parents asked for it and support it. 
   Ask almost any student or graduate of a same-gender school, most of whom are from private or parochial schools, and they will almost all tell you--enthusiastically--that they were enriched and strengthened by their experience. 
   Surveys and studies of students show that at certain levels of education, for some students, both boys and girls enrolled in same-gender programs tend to be more confident, more focused on their studies, and ultimately more successful in school, as well as later in their careers. Both sexes report feeling a camaraderie and a sense of peer and teacher support that they do not encounter to the same degree in coeducational classrooms. Teachers, too, report fewer control and discipline problems--something almost any teacher will tell you can consume a good part of classtime. Inevitably, these positive student attitudes translate into academic results. 
   Study after study has demonstrated that girls and boys in same-gender schools, on average, are academically more successful and ambitious than their coeducational counterparts. These results and benefits of same-gender education for hundreds of thousands of American students and their families can be an option in public schools as well as parochial and private. 
   Susan Estrich, a professor of law at the University of California, stated in a recently syndicated article regarding the amendment:  
   Without boys in the classroom, researchers have found, girls speak up more, take more science and math, and end up getting more Ph.D.s, and serve on more corporate boards. While the benefits of single-sex education for boys have been less well-documented, there is at least anecdotal evidence that boys' schools in the inner cities, where discipline is stressed and positive male role models emphasized, may result in lower dropout rates and higher test scores. 
   I believe this is an idea that should be an option for every parent. It is not a mandate. It is not even a recommendation. It is just an option. Why not let the parents have the full range of choices in public school? That is what the innovation provision of title VI is supposed to do. 
   We also hear a lot on the Senate floor about the need to hire more teachers and to reduce class size. Many on the other side of the aisle think the answer to the growing teacher shortage is to simply have the Federal Government hire more teachers, pay for a fraction of their salaries, and force local school districts to pick up the rest. I think there is a better approach and one that will not only ensure that more teachers are hired but that better teachers are also hired, teachers with real-world experience and knowledge that can be translated into the classroom. 
   Called Careers to Classrooms, my proposal would build on a tremendously successful Department of Defense program that takes experienced, qualified military service men and women and helps them transition into the classroom as teachers. The program seeks out and helps place members of the military, with at least 10 years of service and skills, in high-need areas such as math, science, computers, and language skills. It also helps many of them with stipends while they get their certification, which usually comes through a streamlined certification process. 
   Careers to Classrooms takes this successful model and applies it to civilian professionals interested in sharing their knowledge with public school students. Under this program, individuals with demonstrable skills in high-need areas, such as computers or foreign languages, would be helped to find a school that has a need for teachers in their field. It would provide assistance to the school to hire the individual while they obtain their certification--again, under a streamlined process. 
   This is another example of a win-win for a career person who would like to go into a different career, would like to go into teaching, happens to be able to speak French or Russian or Italian or Chinese, and would like to offer that to a school that can't offer it to students because they don't have a qualified teacher. This approach is far less costly than simply paying the salaries of new teachers regardless of their expertise or background. 
   While there is no question our teachers need to be paid, and paid well, this is an area that has been left to the discretion of our States and local school districts throughout the history of this Nation. Our Nation's parents and their children do not need more Federal control, more bureaucracy, and more redtape. 
   I had a teacher come to one of my townhall meetings in a small town in north Texas. The teacher was about to go out of her mind. She brought me the number of forms she has to fill out. It was this tall--this tall--with pages she has to fill out just to be a teacher in this very small school district in north Texas. 
   That is not what our teachers need. What we need is to empower our parents with greater choices to find the education path that is best for each individual child in this country. We need to give teachers the ability to teach rather than have more Federal mandates. We need to make options available, and we need to do it in an innovative and flexible manner. 
   Heaping more money on a failed system has been exhaustive to our teachers, to our principals, to our superintendents, to our parents, and to our children. The policies of the past have failed. The Affordable Education Act and the two additional proposals I have outlined are policies of the future, policies that will enable every child in this country to fulfill his or her potential. 
   That is our goal. How we get there is the debate we are having today. I want to do it with flexibility, with options and empowerment of parents. That is what Senator COVERDELL and Senator ROTH are giving us the opportunity to pass. I urge my colleagues to support this very good piece of legislation. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to Alan Greenspan. I think the Senate has done exactly what it should have done, which is overwhelmingly approve the nomination of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He has been in that position for 13 years and has guided our country on a very even keel while going through an economy that could have been volatile but because of his leadership has not been. I look forward to continuing this long string of prosperity in the economy we have been able to have under the leadership of Chairman Greenspan.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, for the next 30 minutes, we are going to talk about a subject that I think perhaps is the highest priority we have in Congress, and that is to correct a terrible inequity in the tax laws of our country--a penalty that we exact on married couples. 
   You may ask, penalty on married couples? Are you serious? Well, the fact is, yes, I am serious. The Tax Code, over the years, has not kept up with what has happened in our country demographically, which is that over 64 percent of the married couples in this country today have two incomes; both spouses work outside the home, in addition to working inside the home. The Tax Code has not caught up to treating them fairly when they get married. In fact, what has happened is that we have not increased the standard deduction to be double for a two-income-earning couple; nor have we expanded the tax brackets for a two-income-earning couple. So if you take the example of a schoolteacher and a sheriff's deputy or a policeman, one of whom makes $27,000 a year, the other of whom makes $31,000 a year, they will pay an extra $717 in taxes just because they got married. 
   Now, generally, this is a young couple who is getting married, who need the extra money now more than ever. It is a couple who want to buy their first home, want to have their first child, want to buy the extra car they will need to fulfill their responsibilities. But, in fact, we take money away from their ability to fulfill their hopes and dreams. 
   Americans should not have to choose between love and money and, most certainly, the Government should not encourage this. We need to have policies that encourage marriage, encourage families. 
   I read an interesting article recently pointing out that marriage is one of the key factors in determining poverty. One in three poor families is headed by an unmarried parent. In contrast, 1 in 20 married couples are considered to be in poverty. So being married is one of the factors in people being able to lift themselves out of poverty. So, of course, knowing this, we should be even more attuned to this inequity. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 21 million married couples are paying this penalty; that is, 42 million Americans are paying a higher tax because they are married. This tax hits hardest those couples with two incomes. Two-thirds of those married couples, that have two incomes, will pay a tax penalty simply for being married. These couples are paying an average of $1,400 more; that is $29 billion in taxes being sent to Washington--money which our Treasury should not be receiving--$29 billion in money just because people are married and not single. 
   Why are many people working? In many instances, it is because of the incredibly high tax burden. We have the highest tax burden since World War II on families in this country. Nearly 40 percent of the income families earn goes straight to the tax collector. How can we solve this problem? We can start by increasing the standard deduction for married couples from $7,200 to $8,600. This would make it exactly double what is available to single taxpayers. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, and myself have introduced legislation to do exactly this. That should be our very first step. In fact, that is exactly what the Congress passed last year and sent to the President, but he vetoed it. It was part of a balanced tax package that would have put $790 billion back in the pockets of the taxpayers of this country. But the President chose to veto that legislation. 
   This same legislation was introduced this week by Congressman ARCHER, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on the House side. His legislation would increase the standard deduction in 2001 for married couples to twice the rate applicable to singles. 
   The second thing we can do is to widen the tax bracket for married couples so that it is twice the size of the corresponding bracket for singles. 
   Let me give you an example. 
   A married couple is taxed at the 15-percent rate up to $43,350 in income. But if two single people make the same salary, they could be taxed at 15 percent on income up to $50,700. That means $7,350 is taxed just because people are married. 
   We need to change this policy. Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, and myself have introduced a bill that would adjust every bracket so that married couples would not pay a penalty. They would not go into higher tax brackets just because they are married.  If one person makes $20,000 a year, and another makes $55,000 a year, they should pay taxes on what they earned, not putting it together and penalizing them by making the entire $20,000 that is earned by one spouse to be taxed at the higher 28-percent bracket of the other spouse. 
   This week, Congressman ARCHER introduced legislation that would widen the 15-percent bracket. This is clearly the right direction. But I also want to make sure we don't forget those people in the 28-percent bracket. They get hit hard by the marriage penalty as well. The people who move up to the 28-percent bracket when they are earning the 15-percent bracket salaries should not pay that penalty. That is what we are trying to correct. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, and I have introduced this legislation for 3 straight years. We have tried to get the President to sign tax relief for our married taxpayers. 
   Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee reported legislation out, and it will be considered on the House floor next week. This is a great step forward. It is a step in the right direction. I commend Chairman ARCHER for acting so quickly. 
   I hope we can pass a balanced tax bill this year. I hope we can make the linchpin of that bill the marriage tax penalty relief. 
   But that is not the only tax relief that our people in this country deserve, and the working families deserve. They also deserve tax credits for education expenses, and tax credits for caring for elderly parents, which is becoming a bigger problem--a bigger issue--as our population is aging. 
   We want to make sure small businesses and farmers and ranches don't have to be broken up because of the inheritance tax. 
   We want to try to make sure we have capital gains tax reductions so that people will be encouraged to invest in our country to help spur our economy forward. 
   We have a lot of wage earners who will be coming into our economic system. We want to make sure we can absorb them. The way we can do this is by creating new jobs. The way you create new jobs is to invest in capital. 
   I want a balanced, good tax cut bill. I want to say very clearly that we are not talking about taking the entire surplus and giving it back to the taxpayers of our country. We have bifurcated our surplus. We have said that trillion dollar plus in surplus funds that belongs to Social Security is going to stay in Social Security, so that will always be there. It will be part of a trust fund, and Social Security will be safe forever. 
   What we are talking about is an income tax withholding surplus. This is the surplus that people have sent to Washington in income taxes--not Social Security taxes. We are talking about taking approximately one-third of the income tax withholding surplus and giving it back to the people who sent it to Washington because it is very clear that if we don't give it back to the people who sent too much, it will sit here and it will eventually go away. There is nothing like the creativity of the Federal Government when it comes to spending more money. 
   Mr. President, we want to give people the bonus they have sent to the Federal Government back. We want them to make the decisions for their children about how they are going to spend the money they earned that belongs to them. That is the bonus they deserve. 
   We are going to make marriage tax penalty relief the linchpin of our balanced tax cut plan, and we are going to put in capital gains tax relief and inheritance tax relief and relief for people who are sending their children to college, or perhaps to a private school that has a huge tuition fee. That is very difficult for the family to absorb. 
   Sometimes when I talk to my friends and people who I meet in airports and in cities I visit, the second spouse is working for education expenses for their children, or for the expense of caring for an elderly parent. We want to help them. 
   I think we can get a balanced tax cut for the working people of this country that will give them the relief they deserve because they sent more money to Washington than we need for the services we must cover. 
   I am very proud that I have two cosponsors who have worked so diligently with me to try to keep this issue in the forefront of issues the Senate will address. Senator ASHCROFT from Missouri and Senator BROWNBACK from Kansas have been cosponsors of my legislation every time we have tried to push it through. Last year, we won. But the President said no. We are coming back until we win this for the married couples of this country so they get the money they earned in their pocketbooks to decide what is best for their families--not somebody in Washington, DC, they have never met making that decision for them. 
   I am proud Senator BROWNBACK is here to talk about how this affects families in Kansas, his home State. And later I am hoping Senator ASHCROFT will be able to also come and talk about the legislation we have tried so hard to push through, and which I hope this year will be the one that we see the victory for the hard-working people of our country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from Kansas for joining me today to talk about this very important issue. 
   The House is getting ready to take action. We have spoken once on this issue. We have taken the lead to give relief to the hard-working taxpayers of our country. We do not think people should have to choose between having the money they earn to spend for their families or sending it to Washington, when it is already in excess because we have income tax withholding surpluses. 
   I appreciate the leadership of Senators ASHCROFT and BROWNBACK on this  issue. We will not give up. We will not walk away from this issue. Before we leave the Senate, the married people of this country will be treated equally by the IRS Code across the board. It is our responsibility, and we will not walk away from it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Alan Greenspan's nomination as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Many years from now, historians may look at the Clinton Presidency and say that the best decision he made in office was to keep Alan Greenspan at the helm of the Federal Reserve. 
   Alan Greenspan, the individual, is a man of unquestioned integrity and intellect. I have known him for over two decades. He is truly one of our finest public servants. He has served at the Federal Reserve since 1987, and a steady hand at the wheel he has been. When the economy could have been volatile with a less experienced person, having him there caused the seas to be more tranquil. As my colleague Senator GRAMM has said, he may be the finest central banker we have ever had in the United States or, for that matter, the world has ever known. 
   In fact, it is the example he has shown that has caused many other countries to realize the importance of having a central bank of transparency, of having someone who is not political at the helm of Federal Reserve policy. This example is going to strengthen many new democracies we are seeing in the world today, and his example will be the one they follow. 
   I find it curious that there are some in opposition to this nomination, and it is really ironic in light of yesterday's headlines that the economic expansion that began in 1991 is now the longest in American history. That did not happen by accident. It did not happen by luck. It happened because there was a steady hand at the wheel. That may not be the only reason we have had economic expansion. Our creativity, the spirit of entrepreneurship in our country, also has a part in that. But if we had someone who was trigger happy at the Fed, someone who would jump too quickly and too far, it could have caused a very 
   different result. I am very pleased that the President has renominated Alan Greenspan. 
   There is an old saying: If it ``ain't'' broke, don't fix it. It seems to me some of the Senators I have heard on the floor today speaking in opposition to Alan Greenspan's renomination are fixing a Maytag. In fact, this ``ain't'' broke, and the last thing we need to do is tinker with something that is working very well. 
   America is enjoying an unprecedented economic expansion. Of course, Alan Greenspan's steady hand at the Federal Reserve Board has allowed our economy to flourish and not be crippled by high inflation or interest rates. It has not been an easy task. Every time the Federal Open Market Committee meets, the airwaves are full of people saying the Fed either made the right decision or the wrong decision, they should have done more, they should have done less. It is a careful balancing act, but I can think of no one I would be happier to have in charge than Dr. Greenspan. 
   He knows the power of his words. Many times I have been in the audience when he has spoken, and he is very careful not to overstep. He knows that what he says is going to affect the stock market, and he does not want to have such an impact. He himself jokes sometimes to audiences: If you think you understand what I am about to say, you have misunderstood. 
   He does not want to do something that is going to have a drastic impact, that will have a 1-day impact or a 2-day impact or a 1-week impact. What he wants is to have a steady, noninflationary atmosphere so we will not have interest rates that are too high, interest rates that are too low, an economy that is too hot, an economy that is not hot enough. He understands these issues because of his experience. 
   We do not know what our economic future holds, but this much we do know: Whatever economic ups or downs may confront us in the future, and particularly economic ups and downs of other countries which we cannot control, the person most capable of dealing with them is Alan Greenspan. With him in charge, we are much more likely to avoid economic pitfalls for our country. 
   I urge the Senate to approve his nomination. I am certain it will. From the speeches I have heard on the floor today, the overwhelming sentiment is going to be to confirm Alan Greenspan. 
   He has been at the Federal Reserve for 13 years. He has presided over the greatest economic expansion in the  world, and most surely we will be in our strongest position to withstand whatever might hit us in the future if we have someone with his experience, his integrity, and his intellect at the head of the Federal Reserve Board. 
   I hope my colleagues will confirm him tomorrow and that it will be an overwhelming vote. The time has come for us to move on this important nomination. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, the American Hospital Preservation Act. 
   This legislation builds upon legislation we introduced last year to preserve the ability of American hospitals to continue to provide the highest level of health care to be found anywhere in the world. The bill will fully restore scheduled cuts in annual inflation adjustments for in-patient services given to hospitals under the Medicare program. 
   Mr. President, last year Congress passed legislation restoring almost $17 billion over five years in scheduled cuts and reductions in increases in provider reimbursement payments for various Medicare services. While some of these cuts were mandated by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, or ``BBA,'' which laid the historic foundation for the balanced federal budget we enjoy today, many more of the cuts and the dramatic impact of some of the cuts came as a direct result of policies and practices of the Health Care Financing Administration. All told, Medicare providers faced an estimated $200 billion in reduced payments over the next five years, far in excess of the 1997 estimate of $116 billion in savings. On top of this, in 1999 the Clinton Administration proposed an additional $9 billion in cuts from the Medicare program, on top of the BBA savings. 
   All of this began to spell disaster for American hospitals, the backbone of our nation's health care delivery system and those health care providers most heavily dependent on, and sensitive to, the Medicare system. Last year, I and many of my colleagues in Congress began to hear from hospital administrators, trustees, and health professionals that they were struggling to maintain their quality and variety of health services in the face of mounting budgetary pressures. With the HCFA-imposed cuts they were seeing, many well-reputed and efficiently run hospitals even began for the first time to run deficits and to project closure in the next few years. 
   For many of these hospitals, particularly those in the rural areas of our nation, to close would mean not only the loss of life-saving medical services to the residents of the area, but also the loss of one of the core components of the local community. Jobs would be lost, businesses would wither, and the sense of community and stability that a local hospital brings would suffer. 
   The Balanced Budget Refinement Act Congress passed last year made the situation a little brighter for a number of these struggling hospitals. It eases the transition from cost-based reimbursement to prospective payment for hospital outpatient services, it restores some of the cuts to disproportionate share (``DiSh'') payments, and it provides targeted relief for teaching hospitals and cancer and rehabilitation hospitals. 
   I was particularly pleased that the bill contained a portion of the legislation I introduced last year, an expanded version of which I am introducing today. While my bill proposed restoring in-patient inflation adjustments for all hospitals, the final legislative package included such relief only for fiscal year 2000 and only for  designated ``sole community provider'' hospitals. While this was a step in the right direction, more must be done not only to ensure survival among our nation's hospitals, but also to ensure that they continue to be able to provide the highest level and quality of care that they can to their patients. 
   Hospitals continue to struggle to meet the continued rise in personnel costs, prescription drugs, and blood supplies, just to name a few areas. And this is coming at a time when hospitals are being doubly squeezed by the pressures of flat or reduced government health care reimbursement rates and the rapid growth of cost-conscious managed care private insurance. 
   The bill we are introducing today will make sure that hospitals are able to adjust to these changes by ensuring that their Medicare payments for their in-patient services actually keep up with the rate of hospital inflation. It will restore the full 1.1 percent in scheduled reductions from the annual inflation updates for in-patient services called for by the BBA. Moreover, rather than just applying to a small group of hospitals, this legislation would benefit every hospital in America, providing an estimated $6.9 billion in additional Medicare payments over the next five years. 
   Mr. President, I realize that this bill will require some budgetary offset, and that the overall goal of maintaining a solvent and strong Medicare system for our nation's seniors is and will remain the overriding goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that this bill meets that objective and fits within our overall budget constraints. 
   But I believe that, as we enter a new millennium and a new era of medical breakthroughs the likes of which we can only now dream about, we simply must continue to invest in the core infrastructure of our nation's health delivery system--our hospitals. Doing so will ensure the future health and longevity of all Americans. This bill will take a significant step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators ABRAHAM, KYL, and GRAMM, I am proud to introduce Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 74, honoring the 75th anniversary of the United States Border Patrol. 
   Mr. President, the men and women of the Border Patrol are our Nation's first line of defense in the war on drugs and illegal immigration. Since 1924, the Border Patrol has guarded some 8,000 miles of international boundaries, and has maintained a reputation for getting the job done. The Border Patrol story is one of long hours and hard work in defense of our country. 
   The Department of Labor Appropriations Act of 1924 created a Border Patrol within the Bureau of Immigration, with an initial force of 450 Patrol Inspectors, a yearly budget of $1 million, and a yearly salary of $1,300 for each Patrol Inspector, with each patrolman furnishing their own house. 
   The Border Patrol has grown from that initial force of 450 to more than 8,000 today, located in 146 stations under 21 sectors. The Border Patrol's officers have assisted in controlling civil disturbances, performing National security details, aided in foreign training and assessments, and responded with security and humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of numerous natural disasters. 86 agents and pilots have lost their lives in the line of duty--six in 1998 alone. 
   By far, the Border Patrol's greatest challenge has come along our nation's Southwest Border, which is a sieve for illegal drugs and aliens. Last year, there were 6,359 drug seizures along the Southwest Border by the Border Patrol. These drugs had an estimated street value of $2 billion. There were also nearly 5 million illegal crossings. 
   The Border Patrol and the Congress are responding to this challenge, providing funding to hire 1,000 new agents in fiscal year 2000, just as we have for the past two years. I hope that the Immigration and Naturalization Service will put these funds to good use, hiring these critical agents, and using other resources Congress has provided to improve the equipment and technology available to the Border Patrol. 
   The United States Border Patrol has the difficult dual mission of protecting our borders and enforcing our immigration laws in a fair and humane manner. They do both very well under difficult conditions. 
   I want to congratulate all who serve with the U.S. Border Patrol on this 75th anniversary and express to them to thanks of a grateful nation.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-hutchison-tx-2-19991110</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could take a moment to explain the amendment. We have agreed to 30 minutes equally divided. I would then turn it over to Senator KOHL to explain the underlying amendment. 
   Basically, Senator KOHL and Senator SESSIONS are going to try to put a cap on the homestead exemption that would apply uniformly to every State. I think that is a mistake because every State is different. The valuation of property is different in every State. This does not make any allowance for those variations in property. 
   The Kohl-Sessions amendment has a $100,000 cap in bankruptcy proceedings on homestead exemptions, but the median value of a home in California is over $215,000; in Oklahoma it is $92,500. So right there you can see there are differences in America. 
   Secondly, 11 homestead exemptions around the country would be immediately overturned if we have a Federal standard for a homestead exemption. The States of Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, California, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island would all have their caps lifted in favor of a Federal rule that would attempt to be one size fits all. 
   In my home State of Texas, it is actually a constitutional provision; it is not a statute. It does not refer to money at all. It refers to acreage. There is the urban acreage and there is the rural acreage. So I think it is very important that we have the ability to address this by every individual State. 
   For 130 years in our country, the Federal Government has allowed the States the ability to set its own laws in this area. The homestead exemption does differ State to State. For 130 years, the Federal Government has said the States may do this. 
   The Kohl-Sessions amendment would overturn the 130 years of precedence and have a national standard, a one-size-fits-all approach. That reminds me of a lot of other Federal Government programs. I am sure it rings true with other Americans because that is the Federal approach: One size fits all. We do not need one size fits all. For 130 years, we have not had it. 
   In this country the States have done very well in setting their own homestead exemptions--what works for them, what works for the elderly in their States, what works for families in my State of Texas--and they do not want to take homes away from the elderly who are most susceptible to having health crises. That would take away their savings. That might put them into financial difficulty. They do not want to throw the elderly people out of their homes, 
   even if their homestead might be valued at over $100,000, the median value. 
   Secondly, what if it is a young family where the wage earner gets into financial difficulty? Do we want to put a family out on the streets? This has been sacrosanct in my State and in many other States; that whatever we were doing to try to make people pay their debts--and we do want people to pay their debts--we don't want to make them wards of the State. We want their families to be able to continue to have a roof over their heads while they are working out of their financial difficulties.  
   I support the concept of this bill. I commend Senator GRASSLEY for working hard to improve the bankruptcy laws in our country. But the amendment that is before us today would take away 130 years of preemption by the States to create their own homestead exemptions, especially rural States where farms may have a bigger valuation. They don't want to make people who are in financial difficulty wards of the State. 
   Let me show two very important letters from the State leaders of our country. The National Governors' Association, in a letter signed by Governor Jim Hodges and Governor John Rowland, wrote:  
   We also urge you to resist efforts to impose a uniform nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. The ability to determine their own homestead exemptions has been a long-standing authority of states. Furthermore, the median price of a single family home varies widely from state to state. A one-size-fits-all approach is simply not appropriate when the median home price may be more than two-and-a-half times as high in one state as it is in another.  
   The second letter is from the National Conference of State Legislatures. It says:  
   The [National Conference of State Legislatures] is concerned, however, that an amendment may be offered during Senate consideration that would preempt state laws by setting a cap of $100,000 on homestead exemptions, thus forcing debtors with over $100,000 in homestead equity to sell their homes and farms. Recent real estate trends have shown that in all but four states, the median price of a single family home is well over $100,000. While state legislators believe that the bankruptcy code should strongly encourage consumers to pay their debts to the extent possible, my colleagues and I would be equally concerned about the disruption to family life, particularly the harsh impact on the children of debtors that may result by the establishment of such a limit on homestead exemptions.  
   We have the National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' Association speaking for the State leadership saying this is an area that should be left to the States. It has been left to the States for 130 years. We do not need to overturn 130 years of laws that are working in individual States. 
   I hope we can pass this bill. I certainly will support the Kohl amendment, if we have the State ability to opt out. That is the key. I think if we can have that kind of accommodation, then it will be a good amendment. Let the States decide for themselves if $100,000 is right for them. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified in 5 minutes because I have two other speakers who have asked for time. I know we are running the clock down now. 
   Let me just refute a couple of the points that have been made. First of all, for over 100 years in this country, States have been able to determine what the homestead exemption would be. In some States a homestead would be valued at $15,000 while in other States it might be $215,000. California and Florida have higher valuations on homesteads. So I think a one-size-fits-all approach is not in anyone's best interests. 
   The Senator from Alabama, who is my friend, talks about a $50 million mansion. I do not know of anyone who has a $50 million mansion on one acre of land, because the standard in Texas happens to be on the number of acres rather than on valuations. That was put in our Constitution. 
   This would be overriding our Constitution. It would override the Kansas Constitution. There are other States that believe so strongly in the right of a person to be able to keep a homestead for children or for an elderly person that they do not put in a dollar valuation, they put in an acreage valuation. In Texas, it is one acre. That is for urban homesteads. I think you can talk about a $50 million mansion, but that is not reality here. 
   What I think we ought to do, when we are making policy that is this important, is say: How much damage are we going to do to people who are trying to restructure their lives in order to get a few people who may abuse the system? We have had GAO studies, we have had all kinds of studies, that have showed that maybe 1 percent of the people are not doing right by the system. But we have taken one important step to stop that abuse, which will apply in this bill if it is passed, and that is that you cannot declare a homestead exemption on a home that is bought within 2 years of declaring bankruptcy. 
   So the idea is if someone is going to leave all their debts in Florida and move to Alabama to buy a house and claim bankruptcy, there are safeguards against that by requiring that the person live there 2 years before they can declare bankruptcy. So they cannot flee bankruptcy to go buy a homestead and be protected. And, second, the bankruptcy laws today and in the new law always provide for fraud, that you can go after someone who has fraudulently transferred assets. I do think we have fraud addressed in this bill. 
   We get down, though, to the bottom line. That is, this has been a States rights issue for 132 years. People in Alabama may do it differently from people in Florida. People in Wisconsin may do it differently from the way they do it in Texas. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with people in Idaho having the ability to set their own standards for homestead exemptions? What is wrong with a rural-dominated State having a different standard from an urban-dominated State? This country was formed with the thought that States would have the right to make State laws where they are closest to the people. Only a very few laws are made at the Federal level. I think that is a good standard. I think it is good the Federal Government has allowed the States, for over 132 years, to set homestead exemptions. 
   I hope we will keep that 132-year precedent. I think it has worked. I would love to support this bill. I want debtors to have to pay the people they owe. I have been in a small business, and I have had people stiff me. I know what it is. I know what it is to have to pay my workers regardless of the fact that I am not being paid by people to whom I have supplied products. 
   I will not support this bill unless we allow the States the right to have the homestead exemption be set State by State. I want to tighten up the laws. I think that is the right thing to do. But we do not have to preempt the States rights in this area. I think it will be a better bill if we do not. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say, the Governors of our country have written a very powerful letter saying: Do not do this. Do not set a Federal standard for homestead exemptions. The Governors wrote very clearly: 
   We urge you to resist efforts to impose a uniform nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. The ability to determine their homestead exemptions has been a longstanding authority of States. Furthermore, the median price of a single family home varies from State to State.  
   This is not something that should be a Federal approach. It has not been a Federal approach. Every Governor in our country is saying: Let us handle it. 
   If the people of Wisconsin do not like the way they handle it in Texas, that does not hurt the people of Wisconsin. That should be a decision made at the local level based on local value, local traditions, and local law. 
   Secondly, the National Conference of State Legislatures has written a letter along the same lines saying they are concerned that setting a law that would preempt State laws on homestead exemptions would not be in the best interest of the American people. 
   I hope our Members will not break 130 years of precedent in this country to set yet another one-size-fits-all Federal solution. This is something very important to States, so important that some States have put it in their constitutions, and today voting against the Hutchison amendment for the Kohl-Sessions amendment will most certainly damage our ability to let the States make these determinations. 
   Senator BROWNBACK, Senator GRAHAM of Florida, and Senator Rod GRAMS from Minnesota are cosponsors of this amendment. Many people are very concerned about this 130 years of precedent being overturned. 
   I yield 2 minutes to Senator GRAMS.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Domenici substitute for the Kennedy amendment because I think it strikes the balance we need to have. We have a strong economy today. We want to make sure it stays strong. We are talking about a minimum wage increase that is $1 over a period of 3 years. This should not be a shock to the small businesses, the farmers, and the ranchers who are concerned about having base costs go up--not even people who don't pay minimum wage but people who are concerned about paying at the higher levels and increasing the potential for inflation. I think stretching it out over 1 more year makes sense. 
   I also think we need to look at the small business tax cuts we tried to give to small businesses in the tax cut package the President vetoed. We have brought some of those back. It provides a balance of adding more to the working person, especially the part-time worker, but also giving a little bit of tax help to the self-employed and small business people who might get hit by having the whole wage scale increased. What we are looking for is balance. 
   I will talk about a few of the tax cuts with which we are going to try to help small business. First is an amendment from a bill I introduced that is called the Bonus Incentive Act. Today, employers can give a performance-based bonus to a person who is exempt, a salaried employee, and that person will be able to take that bonus, pay their withholding taxes, and go on their merry way; an employer can't do that for an hourly employee. If they give a performance-based bonus to an hourly employee, the employer has to go back and figure the whole year's wages and refigure any overtime pay that has been given to that employee. Many employers say it is just not worth the trouble, or they try to disguise the bonus as something else. 
   Employers have come to Congress and testified they want to be able to reward hourly employees for good service. At the House Education and Workforce Committee, Pam Farr, the former senior vice president for Marriott Lodging, recently testified that Marriott used game-sharing plans for customer service personnel that rewarded employees for friendly treatment of customers. Cordant Technologies, which makes solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle, rewards their workers for reaching goals, for workplace safety, indirect cost reduction, and customer satisfaction. Many employers are concerned about all the paperwork  that would have to be prepared if they gave this employment bonus. In other testimony from a human resources director, it took 4 people 160 hours to calculate the bonuses for 235 employees. 
   What has been incorporated into the Domenici amendment makes it easy for employers to give performance-based bonuses to hourly employees. There is no reason we should have a big, mumbo-jumbo set of regulations that make it difficult. We want to make it easier for those employees to be rewarded for merit. 
   Other tax relief in this bill is an above-the-line real deduction for health insurance expenses for individuals who don't have health care coverage. I know people who don't have insurance who have huge medical bills. Why shouldn't they be able to deduct all of their medical expenses if they don't have employer-provided insurance coverage? It also provides 100-percent deductibility for health care insurance for the self-employed. 
   I think it should be the goal of everyone in this Chamber to encourage employers to be able to give health insurance to their employees and for the self-employed or the individual to buy health insurance. Why wouldn't we give incentives for people to buy health care insurance? We have been talking about that for the last 5 years. Why don't we put our incentives where they can make a difference? 
   It also accelerates an increase in small business expensing. This is particularly helpful for farmers with direct expensing and accelerating the expensing, especially for small businesses. It reduces the Federal unemployment tax that small businesses pay from 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent. It makes permanent the work opportunity tax credit. This is a very important tax credit that is an incentive for people to hire people off welfare. It gives a tax credit of up to $2,400 for wages paid to employees who are hired right off the welfare rolls. We think this is a wonderful opportunity to give the people whom we want to give a chance at contributing to their families, coming off welfare, to have that incentive for the employer to hire the person off welfare and give that person that first chance to be a contributing member of society. 
   These are some of the tax relief parts of the bill I think are so important. 
   There is one more area I want to talk about because it is my amendment. This is an amendment I have introduced before. It was in the bill the President unfortunately vetoed. In fact, I introduced this bill 2 years ago. It allows women over 50 to have makeup payments to their pension plans. How many women do we know who have left the workforce to have their children or to raise their children until they go into elementary school, or perhaps they stay home and raise their children all the way through high school; then they come back into the workforce. Perhaps they lose their spouse and they don't have a good source of income. They go back to work, and they are penalized in their pension systems and their stability in their retirement years because they lost all those years that would allow them to start building that pension plan. 
   Women who leave the workforce to raise their children and then come back are penalized in this society. These are the people who need retirement stability the most. These are the people who live the longest and who don't have the same opportunity for a pension plan because they haven't been able to establish a pension over the years because they have stayed home and raised their children. 
   Senator DOMENICI's amendment allows women over 50 who are coming back into the workplace to make up the payments they have lost when they left the workplace. The Domenici amendment is a good amendment. It is a balanced amendment. It provides a minimum wage increase over a 3-year period, and it gives help and relief to the small businesses of our country that are going to be hit by the minimum wage increase. This will offset it. 
   These are good reliefs. It is relief for health insurance coverage. It is relief for people who have medical expenses, who don't have health care coverage. It is relief for small business expensing, relief for women who are discriminated against in the pension systems when they leave the workplace to raise their children and then cannot continue to contribute to their retirement systems. 
   It reduces the Federal unemployment tax that is a huge burden on small businesses, and it makes permanent the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, the credit that gives a $2,400 tax credit to people who hire people off welfare. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this balanced approach, giving help to the workers, giving help to the small business people who may be affected by this added expense in their business. It is a fair approach. It is a balanced approach. I think it will have the best chance to keep our economy strong by keeping the people in business who are creating the jobs that keep this economy going. We want more opportunity for more workers, and that is what this amendment will do. 
   I urge support for the Domenici amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bonus Incentive Act of 1999. I am joined in introducing this bill by my colleagues, Senators NICKLES, BROWNBACK, VOINOVICH, ASHCROFT, CRAIG, ENZI, and THOMAS. This important legislation will give America's hourly wage workers the same ability to receive performance-based bonuses that salaried employees currently have. 
   Mr. President, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers who give performance-based bonuses (usually at the end of the year) must go back and recalculate each employee's hourly base rate of pay and thus any overtime pay they received must be adjusted accordingly. Often, the employer must spend many hours of accountants' time for relatively minor adjustments in overtime pay. 
   This unnecessary and overly burdensome requirement discourages many employers (those who even know about this obscure provision) from providing a performance-based bonus system to their hourly wage employees, while salaried or ``exempt'' employees can enjoy such bonuses. Other employers attempt to comply with the law by reclassifying bonuses as not being performance-based. The net result of this law has been to hamper the productivity of the American worker and to trap unwary employers with unnecessary paperwork and even fines. 
   My legislation, the companion of which has been passed by the House Education and Workforce Committee, would allow performance-based bonuses to be paid to employees without the need to recalculate overtime pay, provided that employees are made fully aware of the requirements of receiving such bonuses and provided that such bonuses are not used as a substitute for hourly pay. 
   Mr. President, when the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted in 1938, over 60 years ago, employers typically rewarded only their management personnel for the level of their achievement with performance-based bonuses. Such bonus programs for employees were very rare. But times have changed, and so has the American workplace. With the rise of the service-sector, post-industrial economy, increased competition from overseas, and the growing importance of workplace productivity and efficiency, ``gainsharing'' and other performance-based bonus programs for workers are commonplace. 
   Such programs are as varied as they are common. The model that comes first to mind is a bonus based on the number of items a factory worker produces in a month, quarter, or year. But gainsharing programs are equally effective in the service sector. Pam Farr, former senior vice president for Marriott Lodging and now president of the Cabot Advisory Group, recently testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee that Marriott used gainsharing plans for housekeeping and customer service personnel that rewarded employees for the cleanliness of rooms, and customer service evaluations. Cordant Technologies, which makes solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle, rewards its workers for achieving goals involving workplace safety, customer satisfaction, and indirect cost reduction. 
   Whatever type of gainsharing arrangement an employer may have, there can be no doubt that these programs increase workers' pay, productivity, and contribute to higher customer 
   satisfaction and better workplace relations. Studies have demonstrated that employees who participate in gainsharing arrangements on average receive about 5 to 10 percent more pay from such participation, and many bonus programs allow employees to increase their base pay by as much as 50 percent. 
   Employees who participate in these programs also report being more satisfied on the job and to have a more positive attitude toward their employer. A 1981 survey by the General Accounting Office found that over 80 percent of firms they interviewed reported improvements in labor-management relations from such programs. Grievances in such companies dropped 50 percent, and absenteeism by 20 percent when gainsharing was offered to workers.  
   Unfortunately, the majority of performance-based bonus programs are offered only to one segment of the American workforce: those employees who are salaried and therefore ``exempt'' from many of the strictures of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The other 70-plus million Americans who get paid by the hour are precluded from fully participating in these programs. Why is this? If performance bonuses work so well, why aren't they offered to more hourly wage workers? 
   The answer is that the 61-year-old FLSA requires that when such bonuses are provided to hourly workers, the employer must then re-calculate each employee's ``regular rate'' of pay, which in turn requires a recalculation of worker's overtime pay. This process of recalculating employee overtime can consume substantial administrative time, often for very little in the way of additional overtime pay. One human resources director testified before Congress that it took four people 160 hours to calculate the bonuses for 235 employees. 
   This requirement can be particularly burdensome for many of the nation's millions of small businesses that may not have computer hardware and software that can run these types of calculations. For employers who must try to do these calculations by hand, it can be such a headache that the employer will either drop the bonus program altogether or simply ignore the law, both of which are obviously undesirable outcomes. 
   The Bonus Incentive Act I am introducing today will alleviate this unnecessary and counterproductive requirement, and allow all employees to participate equally in gainsharing programs. In fact, by extending these programs to hourly wage employees who, on average, make less than their salaried counterparts, this bill could be a significant shot-in-the-arm to their take home pay. The Employee Policy Foundation reports that a median wage U.S. worker could earn between an additional $17,000 and $26,000 over a 20-year period by participating in a performance-based bonus plan. 
   Why would anyone oppose this bill, Mr. President? It is good for employers and employees alike. It means less paperwork and more pay, less bureaucracy and more productivity. 
   Some have raised the concern that employers may somehow attempt to disguise regular hourly pay as gainsharing bonuses. While it would take a very ambitious employer to make such a scheme profitable, particularly considering the impact such conduct would have on employee morale, there are protections in the bill against such a possibility. 
   First, the employer must provide all employees, in writing, a detailed description of what the requirements and benefits of the gainsharing plan will be. The actual formula by which the bonus is to be calculated must also be spelled-out. There can be no doubt about what the employee would be required to do and what he or she would stand gain. 
   Second, the employer is absolutely prohibited from using a performance-based bonus to in any way replace the hourly wage pay the employee would otherwise have received. In fact, the bill requires that the plan be ``established and maintained in good faith for the purpose of distributing to employees additional remuneration over and above the wages and salaries that are not dependent upon the existence of such plan.'' If an employer should violate this and, for example, but workers pay and substitute that for bonus pay, that employer would be subject to the same civil and even criminal sanctions as he would for any violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is vigorously enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. 
   But the truth is, Mr. President, that there is very little reason for employers today to abuse this provision, and every reason in the world to use it for the betterment of employees and to the long-term success of the company. If the tremendous economic revolution and growth we have witnessed in the last two decades has taught us anything, it is that wealth is not a zero-sum game. Our economy continues to outstrip that of the rest of the world not because we have more natural resources: other countries have more oil, gold, timber, and other resources than we. It is because the productive capacity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship of the American people is allowed to flourish under our system. 
   Outdated laws such as this must be revised if we are to continue to enjoy the growing fruits of our labor. The Bonus Incentive Act will help accomplish this goal, and I urge my colleagues to support and pass it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator STEVENS, the Child Support Enforcement Options Act of 1999. This bill will give parents the tools and options they need to made sure their children have the resources they need to get a good start in life. 
   This bill will provide local public agencies and private attorneys access to certain child support enforcement procedures and information not currently available to them. To obtain this access, however, a local public agency or private attorney would first have to obtain a certificate of registration from the Secretary of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and agree to certain federal requirements and procedures in using the enforcement tools. 
   Mr. President, in recent years Congress created a number of new information gathering and child support enforcement tools to enable some child support enforcement agencies to better enforce support awards. Unfortunately, these new tools are not available to hundreds of governmental and a growing number of private collection entities which many parents must use or choose to use. These so-called ``non IV-D'' entities have limited or no access to some new and effective federal collection tools. This legislation will extend these tools to so-called ``non IV-D'' entities that are properly approved and monitored by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   Specifically, the bill will allow non-IV-D government agencies and private collection firms to be able to submit cases for the interception of Federal and State tax refunds for the collection of unpaid child support, in accordance with Federal and State statutory guidelines; to seek passport sanctions against delinquent parents; to report unpaid child support to credit bureaus; and to obtain current location and asset information on parents who owe child support. In addition, the bill provides that unemployment compensation benefits would be subject to income withholding for child support obligations in all child support cases, not just those enforced by a IV-D agency, as current law allows. 
   Mr. President, my bill will cost the Federal Government minimal or no additional funds. Nor will it impose any significant obligation on state or local child support agencies, since all government agencies would be allowed under the bill to charge necessary fees to non-IV-D agencies with which they share this information. 
   What this bill will do is take a significant step toward collecting on the estimated $57 billion in overdue child support owed in this country. Many states and local child support agencies are simply overwhelmed and unable to effectively and timely enforce the tens of millions of child support awards in this country. Far from undermining their role in this process, the Child Support Enforcement Options Act will help them accomplish the mutual goal of making sure that child support is collected and delivered to where it is needed the most--to the children to whom it is owed. 
   Particularly for families on welfare or other public assistance, child support is often critical to make ends meet. It helps put food on the table, clothes in the closet, and gas in the car. When a non-custodial parent reneges on his or her obligation to provide that support, it is incumbent upon the government to help enforce that award, through whatever means are available to the struggling custodial parent. In my opinion, any other consideration is secondary, and I am hopeful and confident that my colleagues in the Senate will agree and will work to pass this important legislation.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the most amazing rhetoric on the other side. I am told by my colleague from Minnesota we have cut all the increases the Senate put in this bill. What is wrong is the facts. We haven't cut the increases. In fact, we haven't cut them out at all. We have increased in the areas where we have prioritized. 
   Education: $2 billion more than in last year's budget. What does a 1-percent cut across-the-board mean? It means $1.8 billion more than we spent last year. 
   NIH: We are committed to giving NIH double the funding for medical research in this country. We are keeping our promise. We are increasing NIH $1.8 billion over last year. 
   Head Start: We increased it $600 million. A 1-percent cut means we are increasing it $594 million. 
   We are keeping a promise. We have said the most important thing we are going to do in this Congress is keep our Social Security surplus intact. We are doing it by making sure we do not go into that surplus. We are making a 1-percent across-the-board cut in increases because we have given so much more than we did last year. 
   Let me talk about what happens in a 1-percent decrease. Any person who has ever run a corporation or an agency or even an office knows a 1-percent cut does not go in the programs. We are not going to lose teachers. We are not going to lose people who are getting veteran benefits. They are going to cut travel budgets, office supplies; they will cut in the bureaucracy; that is, if they have the responsibility to make the right decisions. 
   We are going to keep our promise to keep social security intact. We are going to do it in a responsible way so they can take cuts in travel budgets, they can take cuts in their bureaucracies to make sure the programs are funded at the increased levels that Congress is requiring them to do. 
   This is the most responsible act Congress has taken. I am stunned the other side will not step up to the plate and do what they promised also; that is, keep Social Security intact. 
   I yield my remaining time to Senator DOMENICI.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the bill as a whole. There is going to be a joint effort between two subcommittees on the Appropriations Committee--my subcommittee, the D.C. appropriations subcommittee, on which Senator DURBIN is the ranking member, and then the Labor-HHS spending bill, which has Senator SPECTER as the chairman and Senator HARKIN as the ranking member. In addition, this bill contains the 1-percent across-the-board spending cut that is necessary for us to come into our budget caps and save the Social Security surplus intact. 
   First, I want to talk about the bigger bill because I think we should understand this is a very important achievement that we will make if Congress passes this bill and sends it to the President. 
   This bill marks, for the first time in 30 years, that we will pass all of our spending bills, and there will be no raid on the Social Security trust funds. The Social Security trust funds will be left intact so that people who have paid in will get back not only what they have paid in, but they will be given Social Security benefits after they are eligible. No longer will we dip into the Nation's retirement fund to pay for today's spending needs. This is a significant achievement. 
   For the record, this bill will be voted on on Tuesday. We will debate today and Monday. On Tuesday, I hope we will send this bill to the President, and I hope the President will sign it. 
   Some have complained about the across-the-board spending cuts. I think we can afford one penny of savings on every dollar to preserve the retirement needs of America. I do not think that is too much to ask of this Congress. After all, there is a little waste in Federal Government. 
   The inspectors general within the Departments across Government have already identified $16 billion in funds that have been misspent. The Governmental Affairs Committee, working with the General Accounting Office, has identified nearly $200 billion in savings in Federal overpayments, erroneous payments, and wasteful practices. 
   With this waste, I believe we can take a 1-percent cut to preserve the integrity of Social Security to cover the programs that are worthy and use our taxpayer dollars more efficiently. With $216 billion in waste, we can cover the programs that need to be covered if our administrators have any integrity and if they are, in fact, competent. I hope they are. I do not think it is too much to ask. After all, when any family sees it is not going to meet its income and its spending needs, what does it do? It does not just spend anyway. Hopefully, it does not borrow. It sits down and determines where it can cut. I wager most families in America have had to make more than a 1-percent cut in their budgets when they have run into an emergency and do not have the funds to spend. 
   I now turn to the provisions in the District of Columbia portion of this bill. This is our second attempt to get a District of Columbia funding bill the President will sign. I believe we have reached a solution that is acceptable to all the relevant parties. 
   Senator DURBIN has been very productive; he has been responsible; he has been a real player in this process. In  our negotiation, we came to terms that allowed both of us to be comfortable that we are doing the right thing for the District and that everyone has given a little bit without sacrificing principle. 
   No bill is perfect. I am the first to say that. We all have had to sacrifice a little, but this is a bill the President will sign and it is important we have a bill the President will sign because every day this bill is not signed is a day our Nation's Capital is without important new initiatives that will make this a better city for our citizens and visitors. Despite our differences on other issues, let's look at what is good in this bill. 
   We have provided $17 million for college scholarships for D.C. students. We have provided funds to fight the war on drugs in the District of Columbia, including money to combat open-air drug markets. We have $5 million for commercial revitalization. We have funds to clean up the Anacostia River, to promote 
   adoptions, and to help the Children's Hospital. 
   On marijuana legalization, the ban is retained. Medical marijuana use will not become law in the Nation's Capital. 
   On needle exchanges, there has been a great deal of misinformation. In this bill, we continue the ban on Federal and local funding for needle exchanges. I believe needle exchanges do not work. The drug czar of the United States, who represents the President of the United States, believes needle exchanges do not work, and not one penny of tax dollars will be used to support needle exchanges in the District of Columbia. 
   Any suggestion that tax dollars from the Federal Government or D.C. Government are being used is simply wrong. What the bill does allow is for clinics that have privately funded needle exchanges and do other worthy projects will not be prohibited from Federal funding for other worthy projects. But it is very clear there will be no Federal and no local money spent on needle exchanges in the District of Columbia. 
   On the voting rights lawsuit, I believe strongly this is a constitutional issue. It is a legislative prerogative to deal with it. This lawsuit has named officers of the Senate, the House, and even the President as defendants. The taxpayers of our country are spending money to defend against the lawsuit. We provide the District with 2 billion Federal dollars. Those funds should not be used to sue the Federal Government on an issue that is squarely a legislative prerogative. 
   In my view, no public money should be used for this suit--not local money, not Federal money. Our bill permits the D.C. Corporation City Counsel to review and comment on legal briefs in private lawsuits. This is a limited role for their attorneys, but that is as far as this bill goes. There will be no public money spent on the D.C. voting rights lawsuit or to provide statehood for the District of Columbia. 
   Finally, on legal fees in school disability cases, we retain the $60 cap, up $10 from a $50 cap, but the cap will be removed if local officials develop a joint agreement--the school superintendent, the Mayor, and the control board--on a new cap. 
   These are the changes we have made to our bill since it went through the Senate. We have White House support for these changes, and we have the support of the Democratic side for these changes. 
   I want to mention one other very important part of the bill that has remained intact, and that is the Mayor asked for the ability to spend more of the D.C. funds. The District does have quite stringent requirements for a surplus as well as a rainy day fund. That is sound because we are just beginning to get investment grade bonds for the city which lowers the interest rate they will have to pay, and that, of course, means it lowers the cost of borrowing for the city. 
   I thought it important to keep the reserve requirements intact. That will keep the city on a secure basis. I believed if they were going to spend money out of the surplus, that half of the surplus above the basic reserve requirement should be spent only for paying down debt, while the other half could go to new programs. That was a compromise the Mayor welcomed. He believes they will be able to address some of the infrastructure issues that they have not been able to address in their budget, while at the same time I will be satisfied that they will begin to pay down their long-term debt so they will have a more correct debt-income ratio. 
   That will give them a higher bond rating. It will lower the amount of debt they are carrying and I think will put the city on a very firm financial footing in the very near future, which, of course, would then allow the city to go forward with a lower interest rate, a higher bond rating; and our capital city, I hope, will be able to flourish. 
   So this is an excellent bill. I hope the President will sign it. 
   With respect to the Labor-HHS part of the bill, I think this also contains a number of positive provisions and should not be vetoed. Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN have worked very hard on this bill. No one should be led to believe this bill is underfunded. It is $6 billion higher than last year's bill. In fact, it is $600 million above the President's request. This bill contains $2 billion more for education than last year; $300 million more in funding for the Department of Education than the President even requested. So if anyone tries to say we have underfunded education, the facts do not bear that argument out. 
   The National Institutes of Health will receive nearly $18 billion. This is the funding for research, for medical research, for quality-of-life improvements in our country. It is a $2 billion increase over last year's bill and $2 billion above the President's request. 
   The Head Start program is increased by $600 million. 
   So despite our goal of keeping funds intact for Social Security, we have still funded important priorities. If the bill is vetoed, it will not be vetoed because we have not addressed the correct priorities. 
   With that, Mr. President, I conclude and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is now my intention to allow Senator SPECTER to take the floor. As I said, we have two bills together--the D.C. bill, which I chair, and the Labor-HHS bill, which Senator SPECTER chairs. Senator SPECTER has been very helpful, very cooperative to allow his very major bill to be put together with mine. He is very much a greater than equal partner in this bill. I have to admit, his bill is much bigger and much more important from a national standpoint, although the District of Columbia is very important. Nevertheless, Senator SPECTER's bill affects the lives of people all over our country. 
   It is my pleasure to yield the floor to Senator SPECTER for such time as he may consume.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President Clinton's veto of the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. I am very concerned about this veto. It was a very difficult bill. There is no question about it, given the budget caps that both Congress and this administration adopted and agreed they would adhere to. 
   Still, the bill provides the resources needed to continue our strong efforts to fight crime, enhance drug and border enforcement, respond to the threat of terrorism, and help women and children who are victims of family violence. A key component of our crime-fighting effort is stopping drugs at our borders. Thanks to Senator JUDD GREGG and Senator FRITZ HOLLINGS, this bill provides for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents to guard our borders. 
   The President's decision to veto the bill makes clear that funding for these critical matters is not a priority to the President. Despite our budget constraints and our need to preserve Social Security, this bill provides nearly $3 billion more than last year's bill. This bill is not a cut; it is an increase. 
   The President said he vetoed the bill because it didn't fully fund his COPS Program. The reality is that Congress provided funding for 100,000 police for our cities all over America 2 years ago. In fact, we have provided funding for 115,000 police. The President says he wants 30,000 to 50,000 more, but the irony is he hasn't even met the first goal. We still don't have more than 60,000 police on the streets. Yet he is vetoing the bill when the funding is there. The full funding was given by Congress with the excuse that he wants 30,000 to 50,000 more when he has 40,000 that are fully funded that he has not been able to fill. 
   I am concerned because this is not the only law enforcement initiative in which the President has failed. This administration was under direction from Congress to hire 1,000 new border guards in 1999. It failed when only 200 to 400 were actually hired. Yet every penny of the money that went to the 1,000 has been spent. Yet this year in the budget that the President has just vetoed, the President didn't ask for one new Border Patrol agent. 
   I ask, what is the role of the Federal Government? Is it to put police on the streets of our cities or is it to guard the sovereignty of our Nation, the borders of our Nation? I think the President of the United States is not fulfilling his responsibility when Congress comes forward and says we are going to guard the borders of our country; we are going to provide for police on streets as requested, and he vetoes the bill and asks for no new Border Patrol agents. 
   Our border is a sieve. The distinguished chair and I both represent States on the Southwest border. There is no other way to describe it when an estimated $10 billion in marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and other drugs crossed our border last year, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. These drugs find their way to cities and school yards all over America. This is not just the Southwest. It is not just Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California. These illegal drugs go all over the country. They end up in the school yards, preying on our children. We are a gateway, but we are not the stopping point. They are coming in record numbers. In 1998, there were over 6,000 drug seizures along the Southwest border. The total value was $1.28 billion. Our drug czar, General McCaffrey, has argued we should have 20,000 Border Patrol forces to stop the flow of drugs across our border.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Women's Business Week, a series of national events held recently to recognize and celebrate women entrepreneurship. 
   Women now own 38 percent of all businesses in this country, and it has been reported that half of all new businesses started today are started by women. In my home state of Texas alone, there are now 627,300 woman-owned businesses employing 1.8 million people and generating $222 billion in annual sales, a growth of 157 percent over the last seven years. 
   As a former small business owner, I know it is no easy feat to develop a business plan, generate the necessary start-up and operating capital, and make a payroll when you start a business. As if all those economic hurdles were not enough, small business owners in this country must comply with literally hundreds of local, state, and federal licensure, regulatory, and tax laws and requirements. 
   That tens of thousands of small businesses do get started in this country every year is truly a testament to the vision and hard work of so many Americans, especially American women.  Women like Patricia Pliego Stout, owner of the Alamo Travel Group, headquartered in San Antonio. Ms. Pliego Stout has grown a small travel business into the fourth largest agency in San Antonio. In recognition of her achievements and, as importantly, her encouragement and support of other women entrepreneurs in Texas, Ms. Pliego Stout was recently appointed to the National Women's Business Council, which promotes the goal of woman business ownership. 
   There are countless other success stories, as well. Unfortunately, there are also far too many stories of lack of access to adequate capital, of inability to break into established government and contracting networks, and other problems that continue to hamper women as they seek to become financially independent and to contribute to their greater economy and community. 
   As a United States Senator, I have worked hard to break down some of these barriers, and to open more opportunities to more people of all backgrounds and talents. In particular, I was proud to have been able to lead the effort in Congress to establish a 5 percent federal government-wide contracting goal for woman-owned small businesses. In addition, I have worked to expand such successful federal efforts as the Women's Business Centers program, which helps women with those critical first steps of starting a business. In addition, of assistance to all small businesses, including a disproportionate number of woman-owned businesses, I have worked to limit the federal government procurement practice of ``bundling'' contracts, which can also leave newly-formed firms out of the contracting game. 
   Mr. President, I again congratulate the women in Texas and across the nation who every day continue to overcome obstacles and who create success, jobs, and wealth through their sheer determination and energy. The events and activities of National Women's Business Week are evidence that women business ownership is alive and well, to the betterment of us all.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to end this session of this week by once again remembering our colleague, John Chafee. We started this week, Monday morning, with the tragic news of the passing of clearly one of the most beloved of all Senators sitting in this Chamber. 
   During the week, Senator Chafee's desk has been draped in black with flowers on his desk. We have all talked in this Chamber about this wonderful man. We have all related so many of the great deeds he did, from his service in World War II to his service in the Korean war as a marine who truly exemplified what ``Semper Fi'' means. We have talked about what a wonderful human being he was and I think have renewed our efforts to make this a more civilized Senate because of him. 
   Today the people of Rhode Island began to pay their respects to their  former Governor and their three-term Senator. He is lying in state as I speak in the capitol he loved so much. All of us remember when he announced that he would not seek reelection. He simply said: ``I want to go home.'' John Chafee is home.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a friend, an athlete, a scholar, a lawyer, a Governor, a Secretary of the Navy, a Senator, and a marine--not necessarily in that order. 
   The Senate and our country have lost a great man with the passing of John Chafee. He exemplified everything that is so good and decent and honorable about our country. A man born to privilege, he also recognized a duty and an obligation to serve his country. As a young freshman at Yale, he was moved to action by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He became a marine because he wanted to fight, and they promised him he would do just that in the Pacific. 
   So many of our World War II generation, called by Tom Brokaw ``our greatest generation,'' did exactly what John Chafee did. They left their ivy league campuses and their State universities, their jobs and their families, and they saw it as their duty to serve. 
   The Marines delivered on their promise; they gave John Chafee a chance to fight. Soon after his initial training, he found himself as a young private on the beach at one of America's bloodiest battles, at Guadalcanal. Several years ago, at a program at the Smithsonian, Senator Chafee joined a group of World War II veterans who discussed their memories of the war. John Chafee related that the lesson he carried with him was that there was no rhyme or reason to who lived and who died in combat. 
   He said he learned that it didn't matter how good a marine you might be, the incoming artillery rounds and the enemy bullets did not discriminate among good and bad marines and that if one survived it was not though personal merit but by the grace of God. He came away from that experience with a commitment to live honorably and well because he recognized that every day was a gift and because he owed that to those who he left behind on those fields. 
   He went on to receive a commission as a lieutenant and the Marines continued to provide those opportunities to fight in other bloody battles in the Pacific theater including Okinawa. 
   When the war ended, he took off his uniform, returned home, and picked up where he left off. He graduated from Yale where he distinguished himself as a collegiate wrestler and captain of the Yale wrestling team. Although a supremely modest man, the one honor for which he was always very proud and willing to talk about was his induction several years ago into the Collegiate Wrestling Hall of Fame in Oklahoma. 
   After Yale, he went on to Harvard and graduated in a class filled with many other veterans with similar war records including Senator TED STEVENS. But soon after graduating from law school, John Chafee learned the Marines weren't done with him and their promise to give him a chance to fight. 
   In fact, John Chafee related this experience to me when we were driving together in a car to see the mustering out of one of my favorite aides, my legislative aide Dave Davis, whose wife happened to be John Chafee's personal assistant. We were going out together because this was a big day for Dave Davis. He was going to leave the Army and to come with me full time. I must say it was a great day for me. John Chafee said: You know, I left after World War II, and I thought I was finished. I didn't sign any papers saying I had left the service; I didn't think it was necessary. And all of a sudden, one day during the Korean war, I get a notice from the U.S. Marines saying you never left the marines, and we are going to send you to Korea. He said: My gosh, I was so surprised. 
   He was no longer an 18-year-old who was looking for a place to fight. He had a wife and child. He had just graduated from Harvard Law School with a bright future ahead. John Chafee said: I still have a commitment and I am going to keep it. 
   He said he had a responsibility to young marines to teach and tell them what he knew from his own combat experience because he knew that would be helpful. He answered the call without complaint and once again distinguished himself as a marine company commander in battle against the Chinese in North Korea in the mountains of Korea. 
   One of his young lieutenants in that company in Korea was the novelist and writer James Brady. Brady wrote a book about his experience in the Korea war entitled ``The Coldest War'' and John Chafee is the hero of that story. Brady writes.  
   That's how it is in the Marine Corps. There are rules and a subtle understanding some of them are to be broken. Colonels broke rules, I suppose generals did, enlisted men broke them, I broke them whenever I could with circumspection, but Chafee never. Captain Chafee kept the rules. Not that he was prissy. It simply did not occur to Chafee to cut corners.  
   Brady also writes about not having a chance to tell John Chafee how much he meant to him in a way in which many of us in the Senate can identify with today.  
   There was so much I wanted to say: what his confidence meant to me, how I admired him, how much he'd taught all of us. He was the only truly great man I'd met in my life, and all I had the time to do was say thanks. Maybe he understood.  
   We all know his incredible achievements after returning from battle. He continued to serve his native Rhode Island well as a three-term Governor and then Senator for 23 years. He also continued to serve his beloved Marine Corps as the Secretary of the Navy. 
   He kept faith with all those marines who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Pacific and in Korea by living a good life and representing them well. He was always Semper Fi to the Corps. 
   One story recalled by another member of the platoon years later at a gathering of Korean war veterans told of how John Chafee's Marine company was moving across snow-covered ground that was believed to be covered with landmines. No one in the company was eager to march through the area so Captain John Chafee, showing no fear, took point and led his men through the snow. When the marines reached the top of the hill, someone looked back and observed that the entire company had left only one set of tracks as each marine had carefully stepped exactly in Captain John Chafee's footprints. 
   This lieutenant observed nearly 50 years later that he and the others were still trying to follow in John Chafee's footsteps. 
   As did his marines so long ago, many of us are trying to follow in John Chafee's footsteps, setting a standard of decency, civility, and kindness, remembering how to disagree without rancor. This is something all of us in the Senate need to remember when we think of John Chafee. It is the lesson all of us could relearn as we are going into some very tough times in the Senate. He loved this institution. He loved what it meant. We have all been enriched and blessed by his presence. 
   I hope his legacy will be that all of us will be better for John Chafee having been here because he is known as one of the kindest, most civil, and absolutely great Members of this body by everyone who knew him. I have never heard anyone say John Chafee was not a superior person. Whether or not you agreed with him on the merits of an issue, you could never say he wasn't the best of us. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleagues, Senators NICKLES, DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI, and BREAUX in a discussion of the important issue of Federal oil royalty valuation. 
   Yesterday the House and Senate both passed the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations conference report. Contained within that bill is a provision addressing proposed new rules of the Minerals Management Service on establishing the value of oil from Federal leases to determine the royalty owed on that oil. 
   On September 23 of this year 60 Senators voted to break a Senate filibuster and vote on the Hutchison-Domenici amendment to prevent the MMS from going forward with its misguided and unworkable new valuation system. Our amendment passed, and it passed because a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate recognized that blocking the rule was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do because it protected the American consumer, who is increasingly at the whim of foreign oil markets as America's oil production dwindles. And it was the right thing to do for the American taxpayer, who entrusts the Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, with the decision of whether or not to raise taxes in this country. 
   But despite our victory on the floor, it became apparent during the conference negotiations between the Senate and the House, that this provision in the Interior appropriations bill may be used by the President as an excuse to veto the entire bill. Because there are so many important programs funded in this bill, from national parks to energy conservation programs, I, Senator DOMENICI, and the other sponsors of this amendment, offered a compromise, which is reflected in the bill, and I wonder if my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, who has been my partner on this issue for two years, could explain that compromise?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for that explanation, and for his leadership and hard work on this issue. I think he will agree that while this provision is certainly less than we would have liked and is less than the moratorium passed by the Senate, and, I might add, passed by the Congress and signed into law by the President on no less than three previous occasions, it is a step in the right direction. 
   I would also like to get the comments of my colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, who has been a stalwart supporter of reasonable and workable royalty valuation rules on his assessment of this issue.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their guidance and continuing interest in this regard. Finally, I believe my colleagues would agree that it would be useful if the MMS would repropose its oil valuation rule. It has been nearly 2 years since the agency put forward its last complete proposed rule. The DOI has received voluminous comments since that time, including detailed recommendations by industry at three public workshops on the rule earlier this year. It also re-opened the comment period for a month earlier this year. In trying to resolve this matter, it would be helpful if all the parties could understand the agency's current thinking on the contentious issues my colleagues have described. Reproposing the rule would be the best way to achieve that result and I strongly encourage the agency to do so.

   If America does not form a nuclear umbrella to protect world peace, who will? To whom will our allies look to protect them from an incoming ballistic missile? Only America can do that, and there are only two ways we have to deter a rogue nation from lobbing a nuclear missile into some other country. The first is a missile defense system which belatedly we are now deploying. It is not yet ready, but we are on the way. That is No. 1. No. 2 is the ability to be sure we have a safe and secure and viable nuclear arsenal. 
   This is not a treaty that has been debated for 20 years. It is not the same treaty that preceding Presidents negotiated. It is different in this respect: Every other President held firm for the United States to test at a low level. President Clinton gave that up. That is part of the reason this treaty is before us and why the other countries came in because the low-level testing is not able to be detected. No other President gave in on that issue. 
   Secondly, no other President gave in on the issue of permanence. The idea that we would unilaterally disarm ourselves in perpetuity is irresponsible. 
   I do not like the fact we are taking up this treaty now. I do not want to send a bad signal. But most of all, I do not want to leave ourselves and our allies unprotected from some rogue nation that has nuclear capabilities, and we know there are many. 
   I want to go back and look at the record, and let's talk about peace through strength. It was not peace through weakness and unilateral disarmament that stopped the Cold War. It was peace through strength. We cannot let that go away by signing a treaty that is not in our interests. There are other avenues. There is renegotiating the treaty so we can test at a low level, so we will be able to say to the world: We have a nuclear arsenal, so do not even think about lobbing a nuclear missile at us or any of our allies. We could renegotiate the treaty so it has a term or a timetable. There are alternatives. I hope we will not be rammed into doing something that is wrong for our country because there are alternatives.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues across the aisle for allowing me to go forward. 
   This is such an important debate. It is an important issue for our country but also for the world. There is no question the cold war ended with communism in full retreat and democracy on the rise throughout the world largely because the United States maintained an awesome military capability that deterred war. 
   No American should forget that our stockpile of safe and reliable nuclear weapons has deterred nuclear conflict for these past 50 years. When Saddam Hussein threatened to use weapons of mass destruction prior to Desert Storm, it was the certain knowledge that the United States would respond overwhelmingly that prevented Saddam Hussein from unleashing his own chemical and biological weapons. 
   This is a question of whether or not we, as a nation, intend to maintain our nuclear deterrent capability--so vitally important to us over the last 50 years in maintaining peace in the world--or if we intend to unilaterally disarm. Make no mistake, that is the question before us. 
   Our founders purposely made it hard to enter into treaties and required a two-thirds majority in the Senate for ratification. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``We had better have no treaty than a bad one.'' 
   I am afraid this test ban treaty is a bad one and it would be better not to have it. A treaty is permanent. It requires great vision and caution. Ratification of this test ban treaty would ultimately endanger our national security. I hope our citizens are paying close and careful attention. 
   There are really two questions before us: First, if we ratify this treaty, will the United States be able to maintain a safe, reliable, and credible nuclear capability? Second, will we be able to verify that this treaty is being enforced by other countries that have joined us? Unless both questions can be answered ``yes,'' then we cannot possibly ratify this treaty. 
   On the issue of reliability, nuclear tests are the only proven method to assure confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons. We have heard testimony to this effect from scientists and other experts. They worry that as we make advances in material science and component technology for these very complex weapons, the inability to test these advances through actual detonations will leave us with doubt about whether they will work if used. 
   This treaty prohibits all nuclear tests, even of the lowest yield. The new diagnostic tools are still unbuilt and unproven. Scientists admit with humility that actual tests have often radically altered their chalkboard theories drawn out in the laboratory. At this point, anything short of testing is not sufficient to assure reliability and safety. Reliability of our weapons means they will work as intended. So it is clear that reliability is key to our national strategy. 
   My second concern is that once the United States ratifies this treaty, we will stop testing our weapons because we abide by treaties, but rogue nations will not. Several countries that signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, agreeing not to produce nuclear weapons, violated the treaty. They built the nuclear weapons anyway. Now we are expecting them to sign this treaty and agree not to test. 
   I agree with Dr. Kathleen Bailey of Lawrence Livermore Labs, who noted in testimony before the Armed Services Committee that this treaty expects nations to ``agree not to test weapons they previously agreed not to acquire.'' 
   The Secretary of Defense has acknowledged in his own testimony that ``we would not be able to detect every evasively conducted test.'' 
   In fact, I pursued this direct line of questioning with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, in Defense appropriations hearings on March 5, 1997. He was the Joint Chiefs Chairman at the time, and he did his best. But even then, he could not say he would guarantee the safety. 
   General Shalikashvili said, ``With each year that goes by and we are further and further away from having done the last test, it will become more and more difficult. That is why it is very important that we do not allow the energy budget to slip, but continue working on this science-based stockpile verification program and that we get this thing operating. But even then, Senator, we won't know whether that will be sufficient not to have to test. What we are talking about is the best judgment by scientists that they will be able to determine the reliability through these technical methods.'' 
   I then asked him, ``Do you think we should have some time at which we would do some testing just to see if all of these great assumptions are, in fact, true?'' 
   General Shalikashvili responded, ``I don't know. I won't pretend to understand the physics of this enough. But I did meet with the nuclear laboratory directors and we talked about it at great length. They are all convinced that you can do that. But when I ask them for a guarantee, they cannot give it to you until all of the pieces are stood up.'' 
   He continued, ``Obviously if we stand it up and we cannot do that, then we will have to back the President and say we will have to test. Hopefully it will work out. But we are still a number of years away before we will have that put together so that we can tell you for sure it will not work or it will.'' 
   I said, ``Well, mark one Senator down as skeptical.'' 
   General Shalikashvili responded, ``Mark one Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff joining in that skepticism. I just don't know.'' 
   Mr. President, ``just don't know'' is being unsure. Close is not good enough. It is not good enough when you are talking about a permanent treaty and when it comes to nuclear safety. 
   The recent letter to the majority and minority leaders from six former Secretaries of Defense of both parties was even more chilling. This letter from six former Secretaries of Defense from both parties:  
   As the Senate weighs whether to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), we believe Senators will be obliged to focus on one dominant, inescapable result were it to be ratified: over the decades ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent.  
   They go on to say:  
   The nuclear weapons in our nation's arsenal are sophisticated devices, whose thousands of components must function together with split-second timing and scant margin for error. A nuclear weapon contains radioactive material, which in itself decays, and also changes the properties of other materials within the weapon. Over time, the components of our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety and reliability of the weapons. The shelf life of U.S. nuclear weapons was expected to be some 20 years. In the past, the constant process of replacement and testing of new designs gave some assurance that weapons in the arsenal would be both new and reliable. But under the CTBT, we would be vulnerable to the effects of aging because we could not test ``fixes'' of problems with existing warheads.  
   I think it is clear from the experts, from former Secretaries of Defense and from former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs that they cannot give us a guarantee. 
   We are talking about nuclear safety. We are talking about the major tool we have for deterrence. We are talking about the security of the United States of America, and we have a treaty before us that is permanent. 
   How could we go forward with a treaty such as this with these kinds of questions? Close is not good enough when we are talking about permanence, and when we are talking about our own national security. 
   In fact, when it came to a test-ban treaty, President Reagan and other  Cold War Presidents supported a ban only on high-yield nuclear tests. These tests would be of sufficient explosive power to be detected and identified by the sophisticated equipment designed to monitor underground explosions. 
   Under that proposal, lower yield tests would be permitted, to help ensure that our weapons were reliable. It makes sense not to ban low-yield tests because they're too small to detect and identify with the monitoring equipment. That was a sensible approach that has unfortunately been discarded by the Clinton Administration. 
   In fact, just last month, it appears the Russians may have conducted low-level nuclear tests at an Arctic test site. I say ``may have'' because the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that seismic sensors and other monitoring equipment simply can not provide the data needed to know for sure. 
   Supporters of the treaty say it will result in a more extensive monitoring program, including inspections by experts. But a more extensive inspection system is not going to increase our capability to detect violations in advance. And having the right to request on-site inspections of test facilities doesn't give any added assurance of verification either. Let's face it: We've had that right in Iraq for the last eight years, and it's not worth the paper it's printed on. 
   Look at recent events in North Korea as an example of this Administration's policy of buying compliance with treaties and agreements. That policy has actually promoted nuclear and missile proliferation. 
   When the administration became convinced North Korea was building a nuclear device, in violation of their commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it threatened a variety of sanctions. 
   The North Koreans responded that sanctions were tantamount to a declaration of war and soon we were at the negotiating table with this rogue nation. Prior to their possession of a nuclear weapon, it had been a tenet of our foreign policy for over 40 years that the United States would not negotiate directly with the North Koreans without our South Korean allies at the table. 
   However, once it became clear that North Korea was trying to enter the nuclear club, we began to negotiate. We set a lavish buffet of incentives--cash transfers, fuel, helping them build safer nuclear reactors. This began a dangerous cycle in which the North Koreans threaten to act badly and we bribe them not to. 
   After that pattern, despite our warnings and threats, Pakistan soon thereafter tested a nuclear weapon and claimed membership in the nuclear club. 
   As former Majority Leader Bob Dole has pointed out, ``We refer to states as rogue regimes because they regularly violate international law and refuse to be held accountable to international norms. The best way to deal with them is to deter them.'' 
   This treaty will not end nuclear testing. A ``feel good treaty'' doesn't make the world a safer place. The world is safer only when America is strong. A critical element of our military strength is a credible nuclear capability. This treaty will not result in a nuclear weapons free world. It will only result in a nuclear weapons free America, and that would be a much more dangerous world. 
   I urge my colleagues not to go forward with this treaty that we will have to abide by, on a permanent basis, not knowing if we will be able to keep our arsenal up to date and safe. This is a chance we cannot afford to take as the stewards of the national defense of our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this treaty if it does come forward. 
   Once again, Mr. President, I thank Senator ALLARD from Colorado, Senator LEVIN, Senator DORGAN, and all who have allowed me to speak.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment I hope to provide in the ESEA authorization that is going to take place either later this year or next year would allow public schools the option of offering single-sex classes or single-sex schools in the public arena. 
   We all know that the hallmark of America is that we have a public education system that would give every child an equal opportunity to fulfill his or her potential. Many of us acknowledge that the public school systems throughout our country are failing the test today. What we are trying to do is give more options to public schools to acquire the necessary tools to provide each child the nurturing and the special attention they need to succeed. 
   My amendment would clarify existing Federal law by allowing Federal education funds to be used for single-sex public schools and classrooms as long as comparable educational opportunities are made available for students of both sexes. Remember, there is an option. It could not even come into being unless a school district and the school itself and the parents wanted this option. 
   Due largely to the fear that many schools throughout our country believe the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights will not allow single-sex education efforts, most schools and school districts are reluctant to use even their own money on same-gender education programs, much less Federal funds. Ask almost any student or graduate of a same-gender school, most of whom are from private or parochial schools, and they will almost always tell you they have been enriched and strengthened by their experience. 
   Surveys and studies of students show that both boys and girls enrolled in same-gender programs tend to be more confident and more focused on their studies and ultimately more successful in school as well as later in their careers, particularly if they have something to overcome in the way of either rowdiness, shyness, or something of that sort. Girls report being more willing to participate in class and to take difficult math and science classes they otherwise would not have attempted. Boys report less fear of being put down by their classmates for wanting to participate in class and excel in their studies. Teachers, too, report fewer control and discipline problems, something almost any teacher will tell you can consume a good part of class time. 
   Study after study has demonstrated that girls and boys in same-gender schools, where they have chosen this route, are academically more successful and ambitious than their coeducation counterparts. 
   Single-sex education has benefited students such as Cyndee Couch, an eighth-grader at Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem, NY. Cyndee and the other students at their school, located in a low-income, predominantly African American and Hispanic section of New York City, have an attendance rate of 91.8 percent, significantly above the city average. They also score higher on math and science exams than the city average. In fact, 90 percent of the school's students recently scored at or above grade level on the standardized public school math problem-solving tests. The citywide average was 50 percent. 
   Last year, Cyndee bravely appeared on the television show ``60 Minutes'' to talk about why she likes this all-girls public school, one of the very few in the nation. She told host Morley Safer ``..... as long as I'm in this school and I'm learning, and no boys are allowed in the school, I think everything's going to be OK.'' 
   Unfortunately for Cyndee and for the other students in fledgling same-gender public school programs across the country, everything is not OK. Opponents of same-gender education have sued to shut down the Young Women's Leadership School and other schools like it around the country. 
   I cannot imagine why they would do this when the success has been proven. We want to give the options to public schools that private and parochial schools now have. 
   It is not a mandate. It is an option. We want to pursue this so public schools will succeed in giving every child his or her full educational opportunity.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for cosponsoring this amendment with me and for being willing in the committee to work on getting it included in the reauthorization. 
   This is an option, not a mandate. Coed education is better for a number of students. However, when students have a problem with not being willing to speak up in class or have a particular problem in math and science where it is indicated that they would do better in a single-sex atmosphere, let's have this option open for public school students, students who may not be able to afford the option of private school or parochial school, so that our public schools will be the very best they can be, offering every option they can offer to the public school students so every child in this country will have the same opportunity to excel. 
   I hope we can approve this amendment. The last time it was offered we adopted it in the Senate by a vote of 69-29. It was very bipartisan and very strong. I know Members on both sides of the aisle who have attended single-sex schools and who believe this is an option that should be allowed will fight for this amendment for every public school child to have this option without the hassle and threat of being sued that might deter the opportunity for them to have what would meet their needs.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is an excellent point. In fact, I think it should be pointed out for the RECORD that, on March 18 of this year, the Senate voted 71 to 29 to protect our States' settlement funds by defeating an amendment that would have directed that states spend at least half of their settlements according to whatever specific list of programs the Secretary of Health and Human Services designated during any given year. Thus, the Senate rejected the notion that the federal government should have an annual veto over more than $140 billion of state funds. I think it is also worth noting that the Hutchison/Graham legislation we introduced this year to protect these state funds from federal seizure had 47 cosponsors, including substantial bipartisan support. The legislation was signed into law by the President on May 21, 1999.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. In fact, I would like to point out that, of the roughly $1.8 billion that Texas is spending during the present budget biennium, virtually every dollar is going toward health care. For example, the state is allocating over $200 million for a permanent endowment for children's cancer research; $200 million for smoking control and research activities; $100 million for emergency and trauma care; $180 million to expand health insurance for low income children; and over $1 billion in various permanent endowments for many of our state's public and teaching hospitals. I am proud of what Texas is doing, and I am proud that you and I and so many of our colleagues had the courage to stand-up for the right of our states to pursue those priorities and programs that best meet the needs of their residents.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, along with Senator LOTT, I am introducing the Environmental Protection Partnership Act of 1999. By introducing this bill, I am suggesting that the Federal Government take a cue from the States regarding environmental protection. Many State governments have passed laws that allow for voluntary audits of environmental compliance. These laws encourage a company to conduct an audit of its compliance with environmental laws. By conducting the audit, the company determines whether it is in compliance with all environmental laws. If it is not, these state laws allow the company, without penalty, to correct any violations it finds so it will come into compliance. 
   What the bill does is let the Federal Government do the same thing. It lets the Federal Government say to companies all over America, if you want to do a voluntary audit for environmental compliance, we are going to let you do that. We will encourage you but not force you to do it. And we are not going to come in and threaten you with the hammer of the EPA if you, in fact, move swiftly to come into compliance when you find that you are not in compliance. 
   I believe this is the most effective way to clean up the air and water. Our air and water are invaluable natural resources. They are cleaner than they have been in 25 years, and we want to keep improving our efforts to guarantee their protection. This bill will ensure this protection, in the same fashion as many States have done. It does not preempt State law. If State laws are on the books, then the State laws prevail. But this offers companies all over our country the ability to comply with Federal standards in a voluntary way, to critically assess their compliance and not be penalized if they then take action to immediately come into compliance. 
   My bill will ensure that we continue to increase the protection of our environment in the United States through providing incentives for companies to assess their own environmental compliance. Rather than playing a waiting game for EPA to find environmental violations, companies will find--and stop--violations. Many more violations will be corrected, and many others will be prevented. 
   Under the bill, if a company voluntarily completes an environmental audit--a thorough review of its compliance with environmental laws--the audit report may not be used against the company in court. The report can be used in court, however, if the company found violations and did not promptly make efforts to comply. By extending this privilege, a company that looks for, finds, and remedies problems will continue this good conduct, and protect the environment. 
   In addition, if a company does an audit, and promptly corrects any violations, the company may choose to disclose the violation to EPA. If the company does disclose the violation, the company will not be penalized for the violations. By ensuring companies that they will not be dragged into court for being honest, the bill encourages companies to find and fix violations and report them to EPA. 
   This does not mean that companies that pollute go scot-free. Under this bill, there is no protection for: willful and international violators; companies that do not promptly cure violations; companies asserting the law fraudulently; or companies trying to evade an imminent or ongoing investigation. Further, the bill does not protect companies that have policies that permit ongoing patterns of violations of environmental laws. And where a violation results in a continuing adverse public health or environmental effect, a company may not use the protections of this law. 
   Nor does this bill mean that EPA loses any authority to find violations and punish companies for polluting. EPA retains all its present authority. 
   At the same time that EPA retains full authority to enforce environmental laws, I propose to engage every company voluntarily in environmental protection by creating the incentive for those companies to find and cure their own violations. This frees EPA to target its enforcement dollars on the bad actors--the companies that intentionally pollute our water and air. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator LOTT, Senator HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as well as the rest of my colleagues in the Senate on this bill, which will pave the way to increased environmental compliance.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today over one-third of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxable. This chart shows the average price of gasoline, around $1.20; crude oil is 64 cents, the light part of this chart; taxes are 56 cents. 
   Now, what the Senator from California would do is raise the price of gasoline for every working American by raising the taxes to go up and up. In fact, that is what has been happening over the last 10 years. From 1990 to 1997, the average per gallon motor fuel tax has gone from 27 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon. The retail price net of taxes has stayed approximately the same, going down from 95 cents to 88 cents. It has actually gone down, but taxes have gone up. Therefore, the price of gasoline in 1990 went from $1.21 to $1.29 per gallon in 1997. 
   What the Senator from California would do is add taxes on expenses. We have always taxed at the wellhead. Today, we would tax the expenses, the transportation expenses, that you have to make to get the oil to its destination, the marketing expenses. Can you imagine the concept of taxing advertising being done by an agency without congressional approval and raising the price of gasoline for every working American? That is what blocking this amendment will do. We have 60 votes to go forward; 60 people out of 100 in the Senate are saying we should go forward and have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to do what is right and let us have an up-or-down vote so that we don't raise the price of gasoline at the pump for every working American. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New Mexico.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Louisiana. I think she said it very well. The idea that we would in any way impugn the integrity of anyone in the Senate on this issue is wrong. I do not believe that was meant, but I do think that it came across that way. 
   I am glad she spoke from her heart. I will, too. I had much the same experience. I had not remembered it because I do not count contributions, but I was not supported in the early stages when I first ran because I was running against an incumbent. That did not make any difference; I am representing all the people of Texas and doing what I think is right for America. 
   What I think is right for America is to keep jobs in America. Oil jobs are good jobs. Oil jobs are supporting families all over this country. What we are seeing is more and more jobs moving overseas. They are being lost by Americans and American families. That means we are not only losing jobs in the oil sector, but we are also, unfortunately, depending on imports for more and more of our basic oil needs in our country. We are getting ready to go into winter, and the last thing we need is higher prices on oil. The last thing we need is higher prices on gasoline at the pump. Yet if we do not pass this amendment, that is exactly what will happen. That is exactly what will happen. Every person in America is going to pay higher gasoline prices if we do not pass my amendment. 
   So I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her leadership, and her colleague, Senator BREAUX, for his leadership, in showing how important it is. 
   Senator BREAUX earlier made a point that I think is very important. It is shown by this chart. We all would like to have a simpler and fairer oil royalty tax on the oil industry so there isn't a dispute. 
   All the lawsuits that are being discussed are about disputes on how much is owed by oil companies. None of us want oil companies to cheat the American schoolchildren or the Indian tribes--none of us. We want the oil companies to pay their fair share. Part of the dispute is because it is so complicated. We would like to see a simpler system. 
   Unfortunately, what the Mineral Management Service has preliminarily proposed is this kind of trying to set oil royalty rates. Not only are they making you have to go through all these hoops, but they do not put out any kind of ruling letter that would allow an oil company, an independent producer to know what the precedent is. So that independent has to spend thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars every time there is a dispute to determine what they owe to the people of our country. 
   Now, Mr. President, I would like to----

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding that time to Senator GORTON, but I hope we will not need it. I hope the Senator from California will not continue to hold up the Senate in passing the very important Interior appropriations bill that is important to her State, to my State, and every State in our country. 
   We are now into dilatory tactics. We are now into prolonging something that is already accomplished. It is a matter of letting the Senate do its will. Sixty people in the Senate believe we need an up-or-down vote on this amendment. We are going to have an up-or-down vote on the amendment. I do not see a purpose, other than after an hour or so of legitimate debate--which I think the Senator has already received--of prolonging this. Particularly, I hope there will not be an attempt to prolong it with irrelevant and nongermane discussion. 
   So I am going to go back to the bill because I think it is very important. 
   Our amendment seeks to simplify the rulemaking by the Mineral Management Service. This is what is proposed. Who can figure it out? No wonder there is a dispute between the oil companies and the Federal Government or the State government. If this is what the Federal Government is putting forward, it is not a precedent for anything. I do think we need to simplify. 
   The question is, Do we want to raise gas taxes? That is what the MMS would propose to do in this circuitous route. 
   I want to talk about where we are on the price of gasoline at the pump. Every American who fills up their tank knows that the price of gasoline has gone up. It is estimated that today the average price of gasoline in our country is about $1.20 a gallon. Of that $1.20, the light part of this chart shows how much is taxes--I am sorry, the light part shows how much is crude oil. The light part is 64 cents. That is the cost of crude oil in a gallon of gasoline. But the dark part is 56 cents, and that is taxes. 
   If the Senator from California succeeds in defeating my amendment, gas taxes are going to go up, because the MMS, with the circuitous route they are proposing, in fact, is going to tax the price of gasoline, not at the wellhead, as it has always been and as is the standard in the industry, but instead, after it goes through the marketing process and through the pipelines, after it is transported, all of those costs will be included in what is  taxed. Basically, what the MMS is doing is raising taxes on every gallon of gas that is bought at the pump by every hard-working American. That is the essence of what will happen if my amendment fails. 
   The policy of taxing expenses in business is also something very new. I don't think a Federal agency should be able to change tax policy so we now start taxing expenses because that is exactly what happens. If we have the requirement that oil be marketed and transported and we raise the price accordingly and we tax that expense, we are talking about a whole new era. Instead of a Federal excise tax on a Beanie Baby being made when the Beanie Baby comes out of the manufacturing shop, it will be taxed on the retail shelf. That means every Beanie Baby that is marketed in this country and transported by truck to a building, where it can be sold at retail, is going to be taxed. You are going to have to pay the added tax in the price of that Beanie Baby. 
   The price is already going up. We are talking about a whole new concept that the MMS is trying to start with the oil industry, to set a precedent--no vote of any Member of Congress. Then we will see that start happening in other industries as well. It is a very dangerous precedent. 
   This chart shows what has happened to the price of gasoline at the pump in the last 10 years. 
   In 1990, the price of gasoline was about $1.21 per gallon. That was the average price in 1990. Of that, 26 cents was gasoline taxes and 94 cents was the cost of the crude oil in that gasoline that was bought at the pump. Move down to 1997; the retail price has moved up to $1.29. Look at what has happened to the costs. The costs have actually gone down. The cost of the oil in that gallon of gasoline has gone from 94 cents per gallon to 88 cents per gallon. So if that is the case, why has the price of gasoline at the pump gone up? It is because taxes have increased from 26 cents per gallon to 40 cents per gallon. That is why oil prices have gone up in the last 10 years. 
   The Senator from California wants to defeat my amendment, which will have the effect of raising the taxes on oil, which means every American is going to pay a higher tax than 40 cents per gallon. It is going to go up by however much MMS says. But if we start taxing the expenses of marketing and transportation, we could see 50 cents a gallon going into the price of gasoline at the pump and we could start looking at $1.39 being the average price of gasoline per gallon. 
   I think it is very important that we look at where the price of oil has gone up and what is causing Americans to pay higher prices at the pump. Because we import 57 percent of the oil from foreign countries and because OPEC has now limited what they are going to produce, the price of the imported oil is also going up. So put added taxes, which defeating my amendment will achieve, with the higher price of imported oil--you cause oil companies to stop drilling in America because it is now so expensive to do so, and it is going to be more expensive if my amendment fails--and you have the triple whammy. You have our jobs moving overseas, our dependency on foreign oil rising to 57 percent and continuing to go up, and the hard-working American paying higher prices for gasoline at the pump. 
   That is not a good solution. We should not be allowing Federal agencies to raise the price of gasoline at the pump by raising the price of oil, by taxing it at a higher rate, without so much as one vote by a Member of Congress who is accountable to the people. 
   If the Senators who want to defeat my amendment want to pass a tax increase up or down based on the principles they are espousing from the MMS, let them do it. Let them do it on a straight-up vote. Let them come to the Senate floor and defend raising gasoline taxes on every hard-working American. That is what the effect of defeating my amendment will be. 
   Why not do it straight up? I call on the Senators who are trying to defeat my amendment to say: OK, I want higher gasoline taxes; I want hard-working Americans to pay not $1.20 or $1.29 at the pump; I want them to pay $1.39 or $1.49. If that is their goal, let's address it straight on, because that is the effect of defeating the Hutchison-Domenici amendment. 
   I hope we can have a debate that is based on the issues affecting this amendment. Let's talk about raising gasoline prices on hard-working Americans who are seeing prices go up already. Let's talk about what will happen if we have a crisis in the Middle East and we have 5-hour gas lines and we have to pay higher prices to get the gasoline for which we wait 5 hours to fill our tanks. Let's talk about the real issue here, which is raising the price of gasoline at the pump on hard-working Americans. 
   I don't think that is what Congress wants to do. I think that is why 60 Members of Congress said let us have an up-or-down vote. That is the issue today, Mr. President. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Talking about education, along the lines of what the Senator from Idaho was just saying, we have another double standard, and that is, the Senator from California led the effort not to allow drilling offshore in California that is estimated to have cost the schoolchildren in the school districts of California over $1 million a year. That is a California decision. 
   But the fact is, you cannot talk about losing money for schoolchildren by raising the taxes on oil companies on the one hand and then on the other hand say: But we are not going to allow drilling offshore that would put $1 million into the coffers for the schoolchildren of California. 
   Don't you think there is a relationship here and perhaps there are the same issues but just people taking different sides?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico because we have talked earlier about taxing expenses. That is exactly what he is talking about. The idea that we would introduce into tax policy in this country the taxation of expenses is, A, outrageous, and, B, if it is going to be done, let us do it straight up; let us let Congress pass a law saying we are going to tax expenses. It won't just be oil companies; it will be other companies as well. 
   Of course, I think that is a bad policy because I can't imagine we would do something that would hurt our economy anymore. Nevertheless, if we are going to do it, it certainly shouldn't be done by a Federal agency that isn't accountable to anyone. I don't think Congress would be doing its responsibility if we allowed that to happen without our imprimatur. 
   I thank the Senator from New Mexico for clarifying the duty to market. 
   It is a very important technical point that is just one more showing of why this is so unfair and why we must do something to correct it. 
   I want to make a quick announcement, and then I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to the senior Senator from Louisiana. 
   For the information of all Senators, the Senator from California and I have talked about how much longer this debate would go. It appears that we have an agreement that we would be looking at two stacked votes between 6 and 6:15 tonight, one on the Hutchison amendment, and one on final passage of the Interior appropriations bill, which has been so ably led by the occupant of the chair. 
   With that, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, who has been a great ally in this fight. There is nobody who understands the importance of oil jobs to our country and the stability of energy in our country than the senior Senator from Louisiana.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana because he has made a very important point from the independent producers' standpoint. We have seen independent producers go out of business at a greater rate than ever in the history of our country in the last year because oil prices were so low they could not keep their employees and they had to go out of business. They could not afford to drill because their costs were higher than the price they could get. 
   The Senator from Montana so ably represents that small businessman, that small businesswoman who is out there in the field, working so hard to make ends meet, trying not to let his or her employees go in a bad time. 
   Now we have a situation where we could be putting the last nail in the coffin of those who are left. So I am very pleased he talked about the independents and small producers. I am going to talk a little bit more about that because it has been said in this debate that we are only talking about 5 percent, the big oil companies. But that is not the case. 
   In fact, the small oil companies, the independent producers, have written letters to us, to me, saying: Please do not let this happen. This is going to affect our ability to say the price we are actually getting at the wellhead will not actually be what we are taxed on. That is what the new rule would do. It would say to the independent producer that it doesn't matter what you actually are getting at the wellhead, if someone pulls up and takes their oil right out of the ground. You have to pay a tax on what we say is the market price. We are going to go to the New York Mercantile Exchange to determine the price. We do not care if it is Odessa, TX. If we say the 
   price is $22 and you are getting $21, you are going to pay a tax on $22. Is this America? My heavens. 
   These are the companies affected by this new MMS rule, and it is 100 percent of every company drilling, every company, small and large, that is going to have second-guessing of the prices, that is going to have indexing to the New York Mercantile Exchange, regardless of where they are, in Arkansas or West Virginia or Texas or Arizona.  They will not be held to the determinations they make. So a small, independent producer who doesn't have a staff of lawyers isn't going to be able to say: OK, we have sold for $21 at the wellhead in Odessa, TX, and therefore, anyone else selling at the wellhead in Odessa, TX, take your chances. We may or may not say it is the same price. So every independent is affected. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Montana pointing that out. Now I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes at this time to answer what questions were asked by Senator GRAHAM from Florida. First of all, he asked: Why are we calling this a tax? This is really a lease payment, a condition for a lease. 
   What I am concerned about is that he is willing to say we will change the terms of the lease during the term. If that is not an increase in a tax, I don't know what it is. It is a tax increase during the term of a lease. It changes the conditions of the lease, and it will raise the costs to oil companies. Who is going to pay the increased costs? Who always pays the increased costs on business? I am always amazed that people talk about taxing business and making business pay their fair share. When the business is going to sell the product, the business has to have a certain margin in order to stay in business and keep the jobs that it is creating. 
   Of course, they have to raise the price of the product. That is exactly what is going to happen. 
   This is the chart about which the Senator from Florida spoke. There is no question that the taxes at the top of the chart are 56 cents for a gallon of gasoline, and the oil is 64 cents. If you add more to the taxes, you are going to add more to the price of gasoline. 
   This is a tax increase on the people who are going to pay for gasoline at the pump.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have 5 minutes under a unanimous consent. I didn't interrupt the Senator from Florida, and I would like to finish my 5 minutes, if I can. 
   The Senator from Florida talked about the ``rabbit warren'' of regulation. 
   I want to put that chart up because it is a valid question. 
   Is this the same as, or any worse than, the regulations that we have today? In fact, this whole segment of this chart isn't there today because today, if oil is sold at the wellhead, the Federal Government recognizes that is the price. Under the new regulation, we have this theory of procedures that would be required for a person who is selling at the wellhead to prove that was really the price because the Mineral Management Service reserves the right to second-guess the price that is actually paid. 
   I say that there is a good case to be made that this is actually more complicated than it is today. I hope that we will not allow that to go forward. 
   The third area that was mentioned by the Senator from Florida is, why is this coming up in this bill? He said: Why don't we have hearings? Why is this coming up in this bill? 
   It is coming up in this bill because the Federal regulators are spending taxpayer dollars to perpetrate a tax increase on the hard-working people of this country who buy gasoline at the pump, and they are doing it with the appropriations that we are passing tonight. 
   Of course, if we are going to have any say, if we are going to have the ability to exercise the responsibility of Congress to set tax policy in our country and determine that we are going to raise gasoline prices at the pump, we must act on the bill that gives them the money, and direct them as a Congress to not raise taxes on the people of America who buy gasoline for their cars every day. 
   Last but not least, the Senator from Florida raised the question: Are we living up to the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt? I think it is important that we look at the money that we are spending to preserve our wildlife and preserve our natural habitat. I think that is a valid question. My answer is yes. That is not an issue in anything we are talking about tonight because if these companies don't agree to take care of the environment and clean up anything that might be built, then they will not get the lease. 
   That is part of the least arrangement. So protecting the environment is not an issue, and, of course, we want to protect the legacy that we have been given by our forefathers and mothers of this wonderful country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I am a member of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, and I know the severe funding challenges faced by Senator BOND, our chairman, and Senator MIKULSKI, our ranking member. 
   They and their staffs have done an outstanding job in meeting the many priorities of this bill: critical health care services for veterans, homeless assistance funding for continued research in space, and funding for important environmental infrastructure projects along the United States-Mexico border. 
   I can't adequately describe the pride I feel in the committee's decision to make veterans programs the highest priority in the bill. The committee provided $1.1 billion above the President's budget request for medical care for veterans. This increase will help address newly emerging health care challenges, such as the high incidence of hepatitis C among veterans, emergency care, technological advances in medicine, patient safety, and long-term and end-of-life care. I appreciate the commitment and sacrifices made by the men and women who served our country in wartime. This increase is worthy of them and worthy of the Senate.  
   I am proud of the committee's decision to fully fund NASA at $13.6 billion. The House dealt NASA a devastating blow in their VA-HUD bill, cutting the programs by almost $1 billion. The funding provided in this bill underscores the Senate's ongoing support for exploration of the final frontier, including the space shuttle and the international space station. 
   The international space station is the most ambitious scientific project ever undertaken. The efforts and resources of 14 nations are involved in the design, construction, and operation of the orbiting laboratory. Assembly of the international space station has already begun. We expect the international space station to provide unparalleled scientific research opportunities. It will enable advances in medicine, materials science and earth observation, new technologies developed in a microgravity environment, and accelerate the technology and engineering in Earth-based industries. Quite simply, the space station will maintain U.S. global leadership in space science and technology. 
   And its successes will be felt by all of us here on Earth. The space shuttle's capabilities and versatility are unmatched by any spacecraft in the world. The space shuttle has been, and will continue to be, a critical element in space exploration well into the 21st century. The shuttle is also the vital transportation link in the assembly and utilization of the international space station. With plans, upgrades, and improvements by both NASA and industry, the space shuttle will continue to play a major role in future space exploration. 
   Finally, we are providing the ongoing support of the Senate for the poorest part of our Nation, the United States-Mexico border. This bill provides $50 million for critical water and wastewater projects on the southwest border, most of which will be administered by the North American Development Bank. 
   As an aside, when I first came to the Senate, I brought up the critical issue of environment and diseases on the border. It was at that time when the now ranking member, Senator MIKULSKI, was the chairman of the subcommittee and she said, ``This is outrageous in America and we are going to do something about it.'' That was the first funding that we got for the colonias on the border, where citizens of our country are living in filth. I appreciate that. We have added to that $50 million every year since I have been in the Senate, and now under the leadership of Chairman BOND. 
   Washington, DC, is a long way from the border. Recently, I visited colonias--these colonies--along our border that have no infrastructure. I visited colonias near Laredo and McAllen, TX. On rainy days, the unpaved streets in these colonias wash out, making it impossible for schoolbuses to enter the neighborhood. Children walk to school on mud-filled streets and yards, sometimes flooded with human waste that is overflowing from inadequate septic systems. Texas has nearly 1,500 of these subdivisions, with a population of nearly 350,000 people. The numbers in the other southwest border States are equally as staggering. 
   The $50 million we provide in this bill, added to the $300 million that has accumulated in years past, continues the commitment we have made to end this national shame. No person in the United States should live as do the people in these colonias. I appreciate Senators BOND and MIKULSKI working with me to give this matter the proper attention in our subcommittee. 
   I also want to mention we are working on another amendment that would deal with the phase II stormwater sewer regulations that are so important to our smaller counties around the country. I hope the EPA will work with us to try to make sure we don't put regulations on these smaller counties that they can't possibly accept and do not have the funding to do. 
   The VA-HUD appropriations bill is good for our Nation. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work and sensitivity to the critical issues in this bill. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend Armed Services Committee Chairman Senator JOHN WARNER and Ranking Member Senator CARL LEVIN for bringing this important bill to the floor. With the passage of this bill, we will begin to seriously address our military readiness problems. It is a good start. This bill includes many of the provisions of S.4, one of the first bills introduced in the Congress back in January and passed February 24, 1999. With the military having its worst recruiting year since 1979, the Congress needs to send a strong message of support to those who serve. The bill does just that by: Increasing pay for our service members by 4.8 percent, increasing and creating special incentive pays, improving retirement benefits, and improving benefits and management of the military health care program. 
   In am particularly pleased this bill includes two provisions I offered. The first concerns military health care and the second the current high operations tempo of our forces. 
   In February we emphatically recognized our commitment to these dedicated men and women when we passed 100-0 my Military Health Care Improvement Amendment to S.4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marine's Bill of Rights. 
   The message is loud and clear from my constituents: The military care benefit is no longer much of a benefit. I have no doubt my colleagues in the Senate have also heard equally valid complaints about access to care, unpaid bills, inadequate provider networks, and difficulties with claims. The promise seemed fairly simple--in return for military service and sacrifice, the government would provide health care to active duty members and their families, even after they retire. But of course it's more complicated than that. In the past 10 years, the military has downsized by over one third and the military health care system has downsized with it. While hospitals and clinics have closed, the number of personnel that rely on the system hasn't really changed. Today, our armed forces have more married service members with families than even before. In addition, those who have served and are now retired were promised quality health care as well. The system these individuals and families have been given to meet their needs is called ``TRICARE.'' TRICARE is not health care coverage, but a health care delivery system that provides varying levels of benefits depending largely on where a member of the military or a retiree lives. Unfortunately, what we find in practice is that the TRICARE program often provides spotty coverage. 
   The point I want to make clear is that regardless of the complications, the promise remains and we must deliver on the promise. When we passed my amendment 100-0, we sent a signal that we care and that we will be vigilant in pursuing this issue. Our purpose is not to throw out the TRICARE system but to fix the problems and improve the health care benefits under the TRICARE program. I am happy to report that the Authorization bill before us today addresses all the issues that were in my amendment to improve access to health care and management under the TRICARE program. These include: Minimizing the authorization and certification requirements imposed on 
   beneficiaries, reducing claims processing time and providing incentives for electronic processing, improve TRICARE management and eliminate bureaucratic red tape, authorize reimbursement at higher rates where required to attract and retain qualified providers, compare health care coverage available under TRICARE to plans offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), allow reimbursement from third-party payers to military hospitals based on reasonable charges, and reporting to Congress on each of these initiatives. 
   One of the promises that we made to our forces is to provide quality medical care to those who serve and their families. General Dennis Reimer, the former Chief of Staff of the Army, spoke at the most recent conference on military health care. General Reimer provided a soldiers' perspective of how important health care is to those who serve. He said, ``this is about readiness and this is about quality of life linked together. We must ensure that we provide those young men and women who sacrifice and serve our country so well, and ask for so very little, the quality medical care that is the top priority for them ..... we must help them or else we're not going to be able to recruit this high quality force.'' 
   During the past year I visited our troops in the Balkans and toured every single military installation in Texas. The visits provided marvelous snapshots of our armed forces today and the many challenges they face. At each stop I met with our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and their leaders and discussed their concerns. Health care for them and their families was at the top of their list. We have some truly wonderful young people serving in the armed forces who are very patriotic and ask very little of us in return. But frankly, we haven't done enough for them. I am pleased that the Senate Leadership and the Senate Armed Services Committee have made this a top priority this year. 
   Mr. President, the health care provisions in this bill will go a long way toward breaking down the bureaucracy that exists in the current system. I know that there is no single solution or quick fix to this problem, but we must begin now to ensure we honor our commitments. This is a critical issue to recruiting and retaining qualified people in the military--which is critical to the security of our country. 
   My second provision addresses another issue, which we passed as part of our Defense Authorization Bill. Pay and benefits increases are an important beginning, but we cannot ignore the high operations tempo and its impact on our readiness. Recently the Center for Strategic and International Studies completed a survey of over 11,000 military personnel from the Army and Coast Guard on the subject of military culture in the 21st Century. I participated as an advisor on this study and was just briefed on some of the key findings. 
   The really good news is that those surveyed told us: They were proud to serve, they believe the military is important in the world and the jobs they do are important to the mission, they have a deep personal commitment to serve, they believe the military is right to expect high standards of personal conduct off-duty, and they are prepared to lay their lives on the line. 
   Those responses are indicative of the kind of wonderful young people we have serving today in out armed forces, and we have a duty and an obligation to provide them with the equipment and the training and the quality of life they deserve. 
   But they also told us they felt strongly that: Their pay is inadequate, their unites have morale problems, units are often ``surprised'' by unexpected missions, they are ``stressed out'' from the frequent deployments, and they often don't have the resources they need to do their jobs. 
   These responses from soldiers in the field should not come as a surprise to anyone here. We know our troops are dedicated and committed and we also know they are stretched too thin. Secretary Cohen admitted as much last Spring in testimony before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee when he said ``we have to few people and too  many missions.'' That fact is beginning to show in wear and tear on our forces and equipment. 
   There are too many deployments that never seem to end. We have troops coming home from a short tour in Korea and heading straight to Bosnia. At Fort 
   Bliss recently one sergeant told of coming off a one year tour in Korea and then spending three short deployments of 5 months, 3 months and one month in Saudi Arabia ..... all in less than two years and she is now scheduled to return to Korea for another one-year tour. Fortunately this young sergeant was single and was not leaving a spouse and children behind, but for others these frequent deployments mean they must choose between the army and their family. The military has a saying--``you enlist a soldier--you reenlist a family.'' We are having a retention crisis because the families aren't reenlisting. And no wonder. They are jerked from one place to another because we are trying to do it all. 
   We will soon begin the fifth year of our supposedly ``one-year'' mission in Bosnia. U.S. troops have just spent their eighth summer in the deserts of southwest-Asia, we have troops in Kosovo and now East Timor. Thankfully, the mission to Haiti will soon end. 
   But these frequent deployments are having a devastating impact on our military readiness and jeopardizing our ability to respond where our national security interests may be threatened in Southwest Asia or the Koran peninsula. 
   We are seeing the effects of this over deployment on our equipment as well as on our forces. We hear of Air Force planes sitting idle for lack of spare parts. Navy ships that deploy without full crews. The Army and Marine Corps are forced to cannibalize equipment to field front-line units. These are not isolated incidents, these problems point to a larger readiness crisis affecting our military forces. 
   the recent Center for Strategic and International Studies' survey tells us that our military is comprised of dedicated and committed young men and women who tell us they are willing to lay down their lives for their country. We in the Congress must ensure that the missions on which they are asked to serve are important national security interests and represent the best use of our forces. 
   To begin to help us meet this responsibility, my provision included in this bill says it is a sense of Congress that the readiness of our military forces to execute the national security strategy is being eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and expanded missions. It says to the President that we must have a report that prioritizes ongoing global missions. It must distinguish low-priority missions from high-priority missions. That is the basis to effectively manage our commitments, shift our resources, consolidate missions, and end low-priority missions. 
   It is time to assess where we are in the world and why, and to ask the President to prioritize all of these missions. Then Congress can work with the President to determine if we need to ramp up our military personnel strength or ramp down the number of deployments that we have around the world. The testimony of Secretary Cohen and the other Chiefs matches what I have seen and heard myself from our dedicated troops. The answer is one or the other, because the current situation is overextending our armed forces. 
   I am pleased to support this bill and acknowledge the effort and hard work of the members of the Armed Services Committee and their staff in bringing this bill to the floor. It is my hope that this bill will represent a turning point in arresting the decline of our military readiness.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleagues Senators ABRAHAM, BENNETT, ROBERTS, BURNS, and HAGEL, the American Hospital Preservation Act of 1999. 
   Mr. President, the single biggest Medicare dollar issue facing hospitals today is a recently enacted reduction in the annual inflation adjustment for inpatient hospital payments. Prior to 1997, Medicare provided an annual inflation adjustment for the PPS (prospective payment system) payments it makes to hospitals, according to the patient's diagnosis. The inflation update is calculated using the projected increase in the hospital market basket indicator (MBI), which is just a way to calculate the overall inflation rate for hospital costs. 
   To achieve savings in the Medicare program, the 1997 balanced budget agreement between Congress and the President included a tightening of the MBI to ensure after-inflation savings in Medicare. 
   The bill I am introducing today will ease that tightening somewhat to reflect the savings we've made beyond our original estimate. Specifically, the bill will restore .5 percent of those scheduled reductions in the MBI for FY '00 through '02. 
   This restoration will bring inpatient reimbursement rates closer in line to actual health care inflation, which is necessary given the significant reductions in government and private health insurance plans that providers are increasingly experiencing. The bill will also serve to help hospitals and other institutional providers to adjust to new outpatient payment systems as well as greater than anticipated costs stemming from Y2K compliance, prescription drugs, and blood supplies. Y2K compliance alone is estimated to cost hospitals between $7 billion and $8 billion. To make matters worse, the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) has been making cuts in its payments to hospitals and other Medicare providers that are even beyond the savings Congress originally called for. 
   My bill will provide a temporary shot in the arm to hospitals already hard hit by overall Medicare provider reimbursement cuts, and particularly cuts in outpatient services. As hospitals learn to adjust to the new reimbursement system for outpatient services, continuing to receive inflation adjustments might just mean the difference between disaster and survival. 
   This bill also reflects the recommendation made by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to provide the 1/2 percent restoration to the inpatient MBI. 
   This legislation is particularly justified considering that, far from the $115 billion originally envisioned to be saved through FY '02, the Medicare system is now projected to be in about $200 billion better shape than anticipated. Savings in Medicare from hospitals alone are estimated to be $20 billion more than first estimated. 
   Mr. President, rural hospitals, and all hospitals for that matter, operate on very slim margins yet manage to bring cutting-edge medical care to the communities they serve. But changes in Medicare payments to hospitals have put many institutions in a bind. Others are fighting for their lives. 
   Rural communities across Texas have felt the impact of hospital closures for more than a decade now. When a rural hospital closes, local residents lose access to routine, preventative care, not to mention emergency services that can save life and limb. Doctors and other highly trained professionals move away. Then people must drive a hundred miles or more in some cases 
   to get the care city dwellers take for granted. Local economies suffer when jobs are lost. Existing businesses may have to move, and new businesses won't locate in places where health care is unavailable. Hospital closure can be a death-kneel for struggling towns. 
   Other rescue efforts are moving forward to preserve the ability of our nation's hospitals and other Medicare providers to provide adequate health care to their patients. I am cosponsoring a number of bills that have been introduced to strengthen hospitals' financial position. one would limit hospitals' losses under the new outpatient reimbursement system; another would  increase the reimbursements made to rural hospitals for seniors in Medicare Choice-Plus (managed care) plans. 
   Finally, my successful effort to ensure that states' tobacco settlement funds stay in our state and out of the clutches of the federal government has meant that many hospitals across the country are receiving a financial boost. As a result, hospitals across Texas and health care systems across the country are in line to receive the lion's share of $246 billion in state tobacco settlement payments over the next 25 years and beyond. 
   America's hospitals aren't out of the woods yet, but first aid is on the way. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to support and pass the American Hospital Preservation Act of 1999.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to bring to the Senate floor the conference report making appropriations for the Government of the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000. The conference report endorses the District's $5.3 billion operating budget and its $1.4 billion capital budget, as adopted by the mayor, the District council, and the financial authority. 
   The conference report appropriates $429.1 million in Federal funds. In fact, having worked out this legislation with the House, the conference report is actually $18.3 million more than the President's request. This is a good bill for the residents of the District of Columbia and for the people of America, whose capital this is. 
   Let me list some of the positive provisions. 
   For education, we have provided $17 million in funding for a new and unique tuition program that will allow D.C. students to pay instate tuition rates at universities. The District is home to only one public university. This legislation will allow D.C. students the opportunity to attend universities outside the District of Columbia without  having to pay exorbitant out-of-State tuition rates. This is a major advancement for D.C. students. 
   We have also provided equal funding for charter schools in the District of Columbia. Charter schools are holding great promise to improving education in the District. Just this week, I visited the Edison Friendship Charter School, less than a mile from the Capitol. This is a school that has school uniforms, teaches Spanish in kindergarten, provides take-home computers by the third grade, and every student there has doubled their test scores in 1 year. There are 700 students in the school, with 900 on the waiting list. I have to tell you, that was one of the most fun experiences I have had, seeing those bright, inquisitive kids who really love where they are. I asked one young girl, as I walked in, if she liked the school, and she said, `` `Like' is not the right word.'' I said, ``Do you love this school?'' She said, ``I love it.'' 
   Good education in the District is possible. We just have to allow good parents, teachers, and principals the flexibility to provide it without the top-down interference of the entrenched bureaucratic rule. 
   This conference report also addresses the issue of crime in the District. No one doubts that there is a drug problem in the District. At the request of Senator DURBIN, our bill provides an extra $1 million for the District police to wipe out open-air drug markets in the city. 
   The conference report also provides funds for drug testing people on probation in the District. We know from studies that when people on probation return to drug use, they also return to criminal behavior. This bill will get them off the streets if they flunk the drug test. 
   Another important part of the bill is continuing on a path of fiscal discipline for the city. The city's finances used to be a disaster. In fact, it was the reason the control board was created. There was a time when the city's debt was rated ``junk'' status by the bond-rating agencies. With the leadership of Mayor Anthony Williams, the control board, and the city council, working together, this situation has changed dramatically. I want to keep it that way. In fact, I want to make it better. The city's bond rating is still the lowest rank of investment-grade quality. I think it can be higher. The 
   conference report provides that the District budget maintain a $150 million reserve--a true rainy day fund. 
   We have also required the District to maintain a 4-percent budget surplus. But we have provided the flexibility above that surplus to pay down the debt and spend more on services, should the District have funds. The triple combination of a strong reserve, a surplus budget, and the requirement above that surplus that half must go for debt reduction and half for increased spending will increase the bond rating of the District and reduce debt costs in the long run. 
   The economic revitalization of this city is also an important priority for me. For years, the city has lost population and many areas of the city have fallen into disrepair. In this conference report, I have included a program that I believe will be helpful for the District--a $5 million fund to be used for commercial revitalization. I have introduced legislation similar to this in Congress for other cities, and I believe it will provide an incentive to rebuild and refurbish blighted areas in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, helping clean them up and make them more safe for the children and people who live there. 
   For the environment, the conference report provides $5 million to clean up the Anacostia River. It has been a polluted river. Cleaning it up will be a significant environmental advancement for the people of the District. 
   Finally, the conference report includes a provision that will allow the D.C. Superior Court to spend $1.2 million in interest from its fiscal year 1999 appropriation to pay the District's defense attorneys for indigents. Payment to these attorneys was halted by the Superior Court this week. 
   Until the conference report is signed into law by the President, these attorneys will not be paid salaries they have earned representing the District's indigent clients and children. 
   The administration has signaled Congress that the President could veto this bill because of certain riders. I hope the President will look at all of the provisions and realize that all of the so-called riders have been part of past D.C. appropriations bills he has signed. 
   This is a good conference report. It supports and strengthens the Mayor's new administration. It supports the council's tax cut provisions. It funds the District of Columbia Resident Tuition Support Program and it adds $18.3 million over and above the President's request for the District. It does not allow the legalization of marijuana, it does not allow needle exchanges, and it does not allow city expenditures to sue the United States for voting rights for Senators and Congress representatives. 
   I think it is a good bill. I hope the President will not choose to veto the bill because it doesn't allow for the legalization of marijuana and needle exchanges. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report so the District will have the funds in time to begin the new fiscal year. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to highlight the points the Senator from Illinois raised and try to give the view of the majority on those points because I think there are some clear differences. 
   I appreciate the working relationship that Senator DURBIN and I have had on this committee. In the main, we have agreed on this bill. I think the very positive parts of the bill that I outlined earlier were agreed to and enhanced by our ability to work together. I do also want to thank the members of his staff, Terry Sauvain and Marianne Upton, for working with our staff, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim Hyland. 
   I think our disagreements have been very open and honest. I will address the points the Senator made. I think it should be understood why we are doing some of the things that are called riders in this bill. 
   The District of Columbia belongs to every American. This is our Capital City. Every American taxpayer pays for the upkeep of the city. We all point to this city, hoping that it represents the best that America is. The buildings in this city rival any, anywhere in the world. I am proud of the city. That is why, when I was chosen to be the chairman of the D.C. Subcommittee, I readily agreed because it is important to my constituents in Texas, just as much as it is to the people who live here full time. I think we do want to have standards that every American believes are the right standards for our Capital City. 
   Let me take the points that Senator DURBIN said he believes the President may veto the bill over because these points are in disagreement. 
   First, the needle exchange program. Yes, it is true we do not allow for Government funding or city funding of needle exchanges for clean needles for drug abusers. Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar of the United States, who is the President's appointee, said the following about clean needle exchanges:  
   [General McCaffrey has] strongly objected to needle exchange programs.  
   In his words:  
   The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. The focus should be on bringing health to this suffering population, not giving them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.  
   That was in the Orlando Sentinel on March 13, 1996. 
   Janet Lapey, in the New York Times magazine, said this was probably not in the best interests of the people who are suffering from addictions. We do put a lot in the District budget to help people with drug addictions. We try to take the hard line on drug addiction so people who are doing criminal acts in addition to using drugs, some of which also are criminal acts in themselves, do not prey on innocent citizens. 
   In most of the drug needle exchange programs it has been shown that it has increased the use of illegal drugs. I think it would be a tragic mistake in our Capital City to have a federally funded or locally funded needle exchange program that gives any indication that we want to foster this habit. We want to help these people get off drugs, not make it easier for them to do it with clean needles. 
   Second, on the issue of marijuana, it is true this bill does ban legalization of marijuana in the District of Columbia for any purpose. I think it is important that we not have this 
   become a haven for marijuana use, even for medicinal purposes, because I don't think we should take an illegal drug and allow it to be legalized in our Capital City. The majority on the conference committee agreed. 
   Last but not least, the other issue I think we have a legitimate disagreement on is the voting rights in the District. In the District of Columbia, the people do elect a city council and a mayor. We work with them because the Federal taxpayers do fund a good part of the District of Columbia budget. I think because this is our Capital City and because it was provided that the city not be in a State, but, rather be overseen by Congress in our Constitution, that most certainly we need to take those steps. 
   But the issue of having two Senators and a Congressman from the District of Columbia should not be decided in a D.C. appropriations bill. That is banned, using city funds for that purpose. I stand by that. 
   Mr. President, I think the time has expired.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this vote. I think it is important that we fund the District at a responsible level. I hope the President will look at the merits of this bill and let the District have the additional funding that is included. I think the vast majority of the people in the leadership of the District realize this is a giant step forward not only for the people of the District but for every American whose capital this is.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of one provision within the bill. As we all are aware the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to reduce the levels of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel. I note that the bill before us recognizes this new proposal and urges the Department of Energy to continue research on biocatalytic desulfurization technologies to assist the refining industry in meeting these new requirements. Was it the Committee's intent that the Department continue to support the ongoing gasoline biodesulfurization project in the Industries of the Future program in an effort to ensure that the technology is available to the refining industry to meet the new EPA rules?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we directed the MMS to simplify the oil royalty payments so that companies would know what their fair share is. This is what MMS has come forward with as a simplification. 
   Companies still do not know what they will owe. They want to pay their fair share. I want them to pay their fair share. Whether they have in the past is not an issue. We are trying to have a fair setting of taxes. 
   The question is: Who makes tax policy in this country? Is it Congress or is it unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to the people? We are talking about a 1-year moratorium so that this can be worked out in a way that is acceptable to Congress. 
   The Senator from California says this only affects 5 percent of the producers. I have a letter from the California Independent Petroleum Association, representing 450 independent oil and gas producers, which says:  
   It is false to claim that this rulemaking only affects the top 5 percent of all oil producers. It affects every California producer on Federal land.  
   Madam President, I urge a vote for cloture so we can have a fair up-or-down vote on this amendment so that Congress will set the policy of this country.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think it is very clear that the Senate has seen through all of the rhetoric, through all of the hyperbole, and they have made the right decision on this amendment. I am very proud tonight that if everyone had been here we would have had 60 votes for cloture. As it is, we had 55 votes. The clear will of the Senate is to do the right thing on this issue--not to be led down a path, bringing up issues that are unrelated in order to make a point that isn't relevant to what we are talking about today. 
   The Senate voted, overwhelmingly, to come to closure and take control of the tax policy of this country. After all, if the Senate doesn't make the tax policy along with our colleagues in the House, are we going to let unelected bureaucrats make decisions that will affect our economy, the jobs of thousands of people, possibly sending them overseas for foreign jobs instead of American jobs? Our Senate colleagues tonight said the Senate of the United States is going to speak on oil and gas tax policy. We spoke very clearly that we want a 1-year moratorium. We hope MMS will do the right thing in giving a simple and fair tax that will be paid by the oil companies for the right to drill on public lands. That is the issue here. 
   There has been a lot said tonight. First of all, the quote was made from a USA Today article saying that this would be like a lessee saying: I'm not going to pay $500 a month for this apartment; I'm going to pay $400 a month even though I agreed to pay $500 a month. 
   Actually, it is just the opposite. The oil companies have a contract with the Federal Government. They have met all the criteria that the Federal Government has put down in order to drill on Federal lands. What the Senator from California has asked that we do is to allow the Mineral Management Service to raise the rent on the apartment in the middle of the month. They are breaking a contract and saying: We are going to raise your taxes right in the middle of the contract. 
   If we allow that to happen, who will be next? Who is the next person who is going to have a contract and have the price increased in the middle of the contract? Contract rights are part of the basis of the rule of law in this country, and we seem to be blithely going over it as if, ``It's a big oil company; we can run over them.'' That is not the rule of law. We should not be raising taxes in the middle of a contract. It is not right and I hope in the end the Senate will prevail and we will make the tax policy for this country. 
   No. 2, the Senator from California keeps saying only 5 percent of the oil companies are going to be affected by the MMS-proposed rule. In fact, every company that drills on public lands is affected by this ruling. I want to put in the RECORD the letter that was received on September 13, 1999, by the California Independent Petroleum Association.  
   Dear Senator HUTCHISON: 
   The California Independent Petroleum Association represents 450 independent oil and gas producers, royalty owners, and service companies operating in California. We want to set the record straight. The MMS oil royalty rulemaking affects all California producers on federal land. It is false to claim that this rulemaking only affects the top 5 percent of oil producers. 
   How are California independents affected? The proposed rulemaking allows the government to second guess a wellhead sale. If rejected, a California producer is subjected to an ANS index that adjusts to the wellhead set by the government. Using a government formula instead of actual proceeds results in a new tax being imposed on all producers of federal oil.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD the very people who are affected are from the home State of the Senator from California, the small producers, the independents who do not have the luxury of big margins. They are very much affected and very concerned about this rule and what it would do to somebody who has a contract, who says: Pull your truck up and I will sell you 1000 barrels of oil. Here is the price, $12 a barrel. 
   And the Government says: No, we will not accept the $12 a barrel, even though they are picking it up right there. 
   That is exactly what the MMS rule does. So every independent is affected and it is the independents who are having to lay people off in this industry because the oil prices have been so low over the last year that they have not been able to stay in business. 
   Do you know what happens when somebody shuts down? Every family that is dependent on employment from that small producer no longer has a job, and they may live in a place where it is not easy to find another job. The big oil companies just chose to move overseas where they know what the regulatory environment is. They know it is stable. They do not want to create foreign jobs, but that is what they are forced to do because it is so hard to do business in the United States and especially when an unelected bureaucracy is able to change the taxes in the middle of a contract. That is just not the American way. 
   I am very proud the people of the Senate spoke clearly tonight, very clearly; 55 Members of the Senate voted to make the tax policy in this country. 
   Congress did hope we could simplify oil royalty rates. We asked the Mineral Management Service to come forward with a simplified system so everyone would know exactly what the price  would be to drill on Federal lands. Simply, they have failed so far in the proposed rule. 
   This is the diagram of what will happen if this rule goes into effect against the wishes of Congress that we simplify it so oil companies will know what they owe without question. By the time you go through all of this, how could anyone know for sure what they owed? 
   Furthermore, the MMS will not allow the ruling for one company on oil royalty rates and the basis for those rates to apply to any other person who is drilling, unlike the IRS, which will give you a ruling letter so you will know this is the precedent, this is the way the IRS will treat this particular fact situation so anyone else with the same fact situation can rely on the precedent and can give IRS that ruling document and know they will be treated the same. That is not the case. The MMS refuses to be bound by the precedents they set themselves, even if the facts happen to be the same. That is not sound policy. That is not fair treatment for the taxpayers and the people doing business and creating jobs in our country. 
   The Senate has clearly spoken. The question is, Will the Senator from California let the majority rule? Will the Senator from California say 55 Members on both sides of the aisle have voted for Congress to set tax policy and to require the oil companies to pay a fair price for drilling on public lands? That is the question. 
   The Senate has voted 55, with 5 Members missing--according to the votes that have been taken it will be 60 votes if everyone is here and voting. So we have the vast majority to invoke cloture, and the question is, Will the Senator from California do the honorable thing? She said earlier in this 
   debate she wanted fair treatment of this amendment. Fair treatment means an up-or-down vote on the amendment. So the question is, in the face of the overwhelming majority of the Senate who want to do the right thing, who want fair taxation of our oil and gas industry, will she let the majority rule? She said, in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on September 9:  
   Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for being so gracious in preserving my rights. My friend from Texas and I feel equally strongly on the point, just on different sides. I think each of us wants to have justice done on the amendment.  
   If the Senator from California will stick with her commitment that we would have justice done on the amendment, she will allow the majority to rule. The majority has heard the debate on this issue; they have seen through the rhetoric; they have seen that lawsuits are not a part of making a fair rule. They have seen it is the responsibility of Congress to set policy because we do have accountability. We are accountable to the people. 
   So if the Senator from California means to do justice by the amendment, as she stated on September 9 in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, she will let us have an up-and-down vote on this amendment and let the majority rule in the Senate.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the explanation of the Senator from Louisiana because he is getting to the real point. 
   This chart shows what the MMS is proposing to do under the new rule. As the Senator from Louisiana said, the mandate to MMS was to simplify the rule so the Federal Government and the taxpayers of America get a fair share of the oil royalties. This is what they have come up with. 
   I believe if we can have a 1-year moratorium that MMS, which has a new leader, will come forward with a reasonable plan. It is not going to tax costs. No other industry has a tax on their transportation costs and their marketing costs. It is going to be a fair return. That is what we are after. 
   I want to make one other point before I yield to the Senator from New Mexico. 
   We keep hearing about this former ARCO employee and all of the oil companies settling. But the Senator from California fails to mention that 2 weeks ago, there was a verdict by a jury in California saying that Exxon did not cheat the taxpayers of California. That is the oil company that didn't settle because it didn't believe it had cheated. The former ARCO employee who has been referred to by the Senator from California testified in the case and was found uncredible. 
   So I think it is very important that be in the debate. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on my behalf, and in addition to Senator SHELBY, Senators DOMENICI, LOTT, NICKLES, BREAUX, MURKOWSKI, and LANDRIEU. 
   This amendment will continue an existing provision that will prevent the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, MMS, from implementing an overreaching and unwise new oil royalty valuation system. This moratorium was adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee and continues the same restrictions that have been passed by the Senate and the House and signed by the President three times previously. 
   I add that it has been bipartisan, and the initial moratorium and its subsequent extensions have been supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle, and the same is true on the House side. This will be the fourth time that Congress will have to act to stop this action by the Minerals Management Service. I regret that, and I wish there did not have to be a first time. But this moratorium is absolutely necessary in order to stop the MMS from overriding its regulatory authority by imposing a backdoor tax on the production of oil from Federal leases. 
   We have heard about judges legislating from the bench. This is, I think, legislating from the cubicle. This new rule violates both the language and the intent of Federal law governing the assessment and collection of Federal royalties from oil and gas drawn from Federal lands in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Everyone agrees the existing rules are too complex and burdensome, and Congress and the industry groups had welcomed a revision of the rules. But the proposed rule 3 years ago which MMS announced without prior notice to Congress could impose even more costly regulations on oil producers and effectively enact a royalty rate hike or tax increase which the agency simply does not have the authority to do. While the larger oil companies might be able to absorb these costs, hundreds of small independent producers probably will not. This new rule hits them at a time when they are still reeling from the historically low oil prices we have seen lately. 
   Anyone who has any kind of oil production in their States knows that hundreds of thousands of oil-related jobs in our country have gone out of existence in the last 6 months. We all know that oil prices went down to $10 a barrel. We have not seen that in this country for 40 years. We know that small independent producers had to go out of business, thus throwing hundreds of thousands of people off the payroll. 
   In addition, there are two recent developments that justify more than ever before the extension of the moratorium. First, the MMS itself says it needs more time to review its rule; second, a serious ethical and legal question has recently been raised about the rulemaking process. 
   Earlier this year, the Minerals Management Service did reopen the comment period for their rule for 30 days. During that period of time, they received extensive comments dealing with the many facets of this issue, and they have not yet finished reviewing and considering those comments. 
   Because they have held workshops and various oil industry representatives and others interested in this issue have been able to meet together, it is going to take time for the agency to digest the input they have. I hope there is a window in which the Minerals Management Service will be able to sit down and come up with something that is fair and will not put more of our oil industry jobs off the books and into foreign countries. 
   Remember, today we import more than 50 percent of the oil needs of our country. We are certainly not doing anything to help our own oil industry keep oil jobs in America, and it is a security risk to any country that cannot produce 50 percent of its energy needs. 
   I think everything we can do to keep this industry strong is a security issue for our country, and it is certainly a jobs issue. 
   Unfortunately, extending the moratorium through the next fiscal year is the only way we are going to be able to get this agency to produce a workable  rule that stays within the bounds of the law. That is what we are trying to do. 
   In fact, I want our oil industry to pay its fair share of royalties to the people of our country. Our taxpayers deserve that. That is exactly what we are trying to do with the MMS. But the MMS has been very heavy handed, and they act as if businesses going out of existence is preferable to having a fair royalty rate in which the industry would pay its fair share and we would keep jobs in America. 
   Several of my colleagues and I strongly urged MMS to sit down with Members of Congress and industry representatives to discuss these issues. It did so last year. Some progress was made, and I thought we were coming toward a compromise. Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior brought the progress to an abrupt halt. The only way we will be able to sit down with the agency is if there is a moratorium until there is a satisfactory resolution of this issue by the MMS and the Members of Congress who are interested in keeping oil jobs in America. 
   In addition, I and other Members of Congress only recently became aware of a situation that, frankly, calls the entire rulemaking process into serious question. This spring it was revealed that a self-proclaimed government watchdog group called Project on Government Oversight, or POGO, gave $350,000 each to two Federal officials: One at the Department of the Interior and the other at the Department of Energy, apparently in connection with their work on the royalty valuation issue. 
   This matter is presently under criminal investigation at the Department of Justice, and it is the subject of an investigation by the Department of the Interior's inspector general. Until these investigations are complete, the prudent course would be for the Interior Department to take a voluntary action to suspend its plan to finalize the new royalty valuation rule. Unfortunately, the Department has indicated it is not willing to do this. I can't imagine an agency that has admitted or at least acknowledged that one of its employees in this rulemaking process took $350,000 as part of a payment in a lawsuit from this government watchdog organization, and the agency is not even willing to say we should call a moratorium on this whole process until we get to the bottom of this. That is why, when things such as this happen, people don't trust their Government. 
   I can't imagine the Interior Department not volunteering to take this action and sit down with us and make sure that this rulemaking process has integrity. 
   The Interior Department's proposed rule defies the law and the intent of Congress. This disregard for the law is what is at the heart of our objection to the proposed new rule, not the $11 million the Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposed rule will generate in new income for the agency. 
   Federal law requires for purposes of royalty payments the value of oil drawn from Federal land is to be assessed at the wellhead; that is, when the oil is drawn from the ground. The MMS, however, continues to try to assess the value of the oil away from the wellhead, after the oil has been transported, processed, and marketed, each of which must occur before the oil can be sold. In effect, the MMS is trying to get a free ride on these costs rather than allowing companies to deduct them from the price they ultimately receive for the oil. So you are asking people to pay a tax on their cost of doing business. That does not make economic sense. It certainly doesn't pass the fairness question. 
   There isn't any question that the existing system of computing Federal oil royalties is overly complex. No one disputes that. Under the current system, oil producers are often unclear as to what their royalty payments are supposed to be, and even the MMS is often at a loss as to what they are owed. But rather than propose a simpler method of ascertaining royalty payments, the MMS has proposed an even more complex and protracted litigation over just what the new rule requires. 
   While the proposed rule could bring in increased Federal revenues, the increased payments could also be eaten up by the need to hire an army of new Federal auditors to ensure compliance with the complex new system. Furthermore, if companies decide not to go forward with their drilling because they can't make any kind of profit, there will be no revenue to the schoolchildren in our country because there will be no oil royalty extracted from those companies. So the new rule is going to be a regulatory thicket that really is not going to help the situation, which is the problem of a too complex regulation today. 
   Let me also emphasize this amendment has nothing to do with the entirely separate issue of whether or not any particular oil company has paid the royalties it owes under the existing system. 
   I have heard a lot of rhetoric on this issue. I have heard my colleagues talk about the lawsuits and the settlements and companies that haven't paid their fair share. If any oil company has not paid its fair share under the existing regulation, I want it to be prosecuted. I want it to have to pay. That is not an issue in this regulation. The only issue before us today is what is going to be the oil royalty valuation process and is Congress going to have the right to raise taxes or is an unelected bureaucrat who is not accountable going to have that right. 
   Federal land and the mineral resources within that land belong to us all. Proper royalties must be paid for the right to extract those resources. Since 1953, those payments have totaled over $58 billion. That is what we have collected in oil royalties. But enforcement of the law and writing the law are two separate things. The MMS seems to have forgotten that it is the responsibility of Congress, not the government bureaucrats, to determine what the royalty is. That is why we must continue this moratorium until Congress says this is the right approach. 
   The new rule imposes upon Federal lease producers a duty to market their oil without allowing the cost to be deducted. Oil does not sell itself. There are overhead costs associated with listing the oil for sale, locating buyers, facilitating the sale, and then ensuring that the oil is delivered to that buyer. Federal law and existing regulations only require that the lessee place the oil in marketable condition; that is, that the oil is ready to be sold by removing water and other impurities from it. But lessees are allowed, under current law, to deduct the costs associated with transporting and marketing the oil. 
   The new rule, as contained in the MMS' own explanation, states that the producers must market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor. This, then, would mean producers would no longer be allowed to deduct these costs in order to arrive at true wellhead value, as called for by Federal law. There is no other way to slice it. This constitutes a backdoor royalty rate hike; in effect, a tax increase on Federal lands producers. 
   Secondly, the MMS rule would not allow for the proper deduction of transportation costs. Oil producers typically have to bear the cost of transporting the oil to the buyer, either by pipeline or truck. Presently, those costs are determined by using a methodology recognized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has regulatory authority over interstate oil pipelines. So the new MMS rule would actually reject the Federal Government's own cost guidelines and impose a new, untested system for determining transportation costs. 
   So it comes down to a simple decision: Do we want unelected bureaucrats enacting policy with regard to our Federal lands, or do we want Congress to establish these policies? There have been other bills introduced that would deal with this issue. I hope we can come to an agreement. But I don't think we can forget what has happened to the oil industry over the last 2 years. In fact, this is coming at a time when oil and gas production in our country is at an all-time low. In March of this year, we saw oil prices in parts of our country going down to even $7 or $8 a barrel. 
   While the price of oil has since begun to come back up--and today stands at about $20 a barrel--the impacts of a year and a half price crash are reverberating throughout the United States. Since the price of oil first fell in late 1997, over 200,000 oil and gas wells have been shut down. Most of these, of  course, were the low-yield marginal or ``stripper'' wells that will never again be opened because it is not economically feasible to do it. 
   In March of this year, crude oil production in the lower 48 States fell to 4.8 million barrels per day, the lowest level in 50 years. The number of oil rigs in service in the United States fell to just over 100 for the last week in July, the lowest number in service since records have ever been kept. 
   During this time, foreign oil imports rose steadily and now account for 57 percent of consumption, well above the 36 percent import level we saw during the 1974 oil embargo that nearly shut down the American economy. 
   The oil crisis has also had a devastating impact on American jobs. Since November 1997, we have lost over 67,000 jobs just in the exploration and production sectors of this industry, which represents 20 percent of the total number of jobs in this field. In January 1999 alone, 11,500 oil and gas jobs were lost. If one looks back to 1981, the numbers are even more alarming: Over half a million good-paying American jobs have been lost in the oil and gas industry. 
   There are those who would say this is going to hurt our schoolchildren, that they are not going to get the revenues from our public lands. This is very important in my home State. There are dozens of school districts that rely heavily on oil production; property taxes fall with the price of oil. Statewide school districts will collect an estimated $154 million less in revenues this year than last. That is $154 million worth of teachers' salaries, books, computers, you name it. That is what we are talking about in Texas when we talk about the impact of oil on education. 
   So if we are going to hit the oil business again, what is it going to do to the schoolchildren of our country? Is it going to take another $154 million hit in my State? Do you know that they had to let teachers off in midyear in many counties in Texas because they didn't have the money because of oil companies going out of business and having no income whatsoever? 
   So when my colleagues say the schoolchildren are going to lose $60 million, perhaps, in California alone, I point my colleagues' attention to the fact that we have lost $154 million this year in Texas, and we are cutting teachers off in midyear and shutting down schools because our oil industry is on its knees. 
   During 1998, while the average yield for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a positive 18 percent, the yield for oil and gas stocks was a negative 36 percent. So what does that do to the elderly investor, or the person who is investing in mutual funds? What does that do to an industry that is very important for the retirement security of millions of our citizens? 
   For companies inclined toward exploration and production, earnings and stock values have fared even worse. The yield on independent refiner stocks, down 40 percent. The yield on exploration and production stocks, down 63 percent. The yield on drilling stock, down 64 percent. These stock values reflect huge losses by oil companies over the past year and a half. Corporate earnings of the 17 major U.S. petroleum companies fell 41 percent between the first quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999. Fourth quarter losses for 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 were some of the largest witnessed in industry history. Some companies have lost over $1 billion during each of these quarters. 
   So we are not just talking about the loss of revenue to our schoolchildren. We are not just talking about the stability of the retirement pension plans of millions of Americans. We are talking about flat bad policy. We are talking about cutting off an industry that is essential to our security, essential to the retirement security of individuals in this country, essential to job security for thousands of workers; and we are talking about blithely saying let the bureaucrats who aren't accountable increase the taxes without congressional responsibility. 
   Congress didn't say that last year, they didn't say it the year before, and they didn't say it the year before that. They said: No, you will be accountable because we do care about the schoolchildren of this country, we do care about the people living on retirement incomes in this country, and we do care about those who have mutual funds that include oil industry stocks; we want them to be stable, we want them to pay their fair share, and we believe their fair share includes not paying taxes on their expenses. It is economics 101. 
   So I am asking my colleagues, for the fourth straight time, to come forward and vote to keep this moratorium so Congress can exercise its full responsibility, so that we will not put people out of business because the margins are so low and because they have been hit so hard over the last year and a half. 
   We are joined by many groups who care about the economic viability of our country: Frontiers of Freedom, the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Alliance for America, People for the USA, Sixty-Plus, the Blue Ribbon Coalition, the American Land Rights Association, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Center for Public Policy Research, Rio Grande Valley Partnership. 
   The moratorium that I am proposing to extend will force the Department to take the time to craft a rule that works and accurately reflects the will of Congress--a rule that will be fair to the schoolchildren of our country, a rule that will be fair to the taxpayers of our country, a rule that will make the oil industry pay its fair share, but a rule that will not make the oil industry pay an increased tax on their expenses. That is unheard of in economics in our country, nor good business sense. It is confiscatory taxation, and we will not stand for our retirees having their investments obliterated by taxes that are unfair. The buck stops here. 
   It does not stop on the bureaucrat's desk; it stops here, because we are responsible for keeping the jobs in this country. We are responsible for fair taxation policy. We are responsible for the schoolchildren of our country. And the way to keep these companies paying their fair share, creating the jobs, and creating safe retirement systems for the people of our country is to keep the moratorium on and force the Department of the Interior to do the will of Congress, which is what it is supposed to do. If we don't stand up for our responsibility, who will? Who will stand up for Congress' responsibility if the Senate doesn't? 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment which has been adopted three times before, and which I hope will be adopted again, so that we will keep the oil jobs in our country, so that we will keep the retirement security of the mutual funds that depend on oil companies being stable, so that we will keep the schoolchildren of our country having the ability to get revenue that is fair, and to make the oil industry pay its fair share. That is what this amendment does. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may say so, I appreciate that this is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment. Sometimes it is Domenici-Hutchison because we both have worked so hard on this issue over the last 3 years. I appreciate the leadership of my colleague from New Mexico who feels the loss of oil jobs just as my State of Texas does. It is a team effort. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to address some of the issues and some of the facts that were misstated by the Senator from California because I think it is very important that the RECORD be set straight. I attempted to correct the Senator from California while she was speaking, but she preferred to continue to speak, so I want the RECORD to be very clear on some of these important facts. 
   First, the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois made much of the testimony of a former executive from Arco who had testified, they said, under oath that oil companies had in fact misstated and actually tried to hide the value of the oil and not pay their fair share in oil royalties to the State of California and the City of Long Beach. 
   In fact, I am very pleased that they brought that up because the case has actually been settled just in the last couple weeks. In fact, the Senators from California and Illinois mentioned that several oil companies had settled because they, for whatever reason, did not want to go forward with the costly litigation. But Exxon decided not to settle, and the Arco employee did testify in the Exxon case, under oath, that the oil companies were misstating the value of the royalties they owed to the State and to the City of Long Beach. 
   This case went to a jury, a jury in California of 12 citizens. The jury found that the Arco employee was not credible. The jury of his peers determined that the Exxon Corporation had not cheated the taxpayers of California or the City of Long Beach, and they threw out that suit from Long Beach and the State of California. Exxon showed that it had not undervalued its oil. This was a suit for $750 million. 
   So the Arco executive who testified under oath was in fact discredited in the court, and the jury found that the Arco executive was not persuasive. I say that because so much was made of it, as if the case had gone the other way. But 12 citizens in California got together and the jury verdict was in favor of Exxon. 
   But having said that, I have said from the very beginning that the lawsuits are not an issue. If any oil company did not value correctly under the present law or regulations, they ought to pay. So it has never been an issue. You would think, from the rhetoric of the Senator from the State of California, that this amendment had something to do with companies not paying their fair share under the present law. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   In fact, what we are talking about is changing the valuation of oil royalties. We are talking about unelected Department of Interior employees, who have no accountability, usurping the rights of Congress to set tax policy in this country and affect oil jobs to a huge extent. 
   The fact of the matter is, what we are trying to do with the amendment, with the Hutchison-Domenici amendment, is we are saying we want it to be fair, we want to continue the moratorium until the Department of the Interior has a fair valuation that accedes to the wishes of Congress, because Congress makes the laws. That is the prerogative of Congress. That is the responsibility of Congress. And it is further the responsibility of Congress to stand up when they delegate authority to a Federal agency to make a rule and that Federal agency does not do what Congress intended for it to do. 
   Only Congress can step forward and say: No, we did not intend to raise oil royalty rates the way you intend to do it, so we are going to put a moratorium on your rule until you do an oil royalty  rate that is simpler, fairer, will be right for the citizens of our country and right for the oil industry that is very important to this country. So that is what we are talking about today. 
   I did not like the tone of the rhetoric that ``oil is bad,'' that ``big oil is worse,'' that ``everything about oil companies is bad.'' I thought I was back in the 1960s when it seemed that ``business was bad.'' Well, business is people. Business is jobs. Business is people. 
   My heavens, why wouldn't we want business to be successful in America so that we have jobs in America? Sometimes when I hear people talking about the ``big bad oil companies,'' I think: Do you want more foreign oil, more foreign jobs, rather than American jobs and American revenue? 
   I think we have a choice here. Those ``big bad oil companies'' are the basis of the California teacher retirement system pension plan. They are a very important part of the stability of retirement for California teachers, and Texas teachers, for that matter, and probably Illinois teachers as well, because the big oil companies have been a stable source of dividends for maybe 100 years. 
   I don't know when the big oil companies first started, but they have been good citizens for our country. They are the basis of pension plans and retired people's security all over our country, and they do create thousands of good jobs. 
   So I do not think we have to beat up on oil companies. They are part of our economy and they are part of the security of our country. And, oh, by the way, since 1953 they have paid more than $58 billion for the right to drill on the people's land--$58 billion in oil royalty payments. 
   If they did not pay their fair share, I want them to pay their fair share. So talking about settlements and lawsuits is not really an issue, even though a jury of their peers in California did find that Exxon had not cheated in any way. 
   That isn't the issue. The issue is, we want them to pay. In order for them to pay a fair share, they need to be able to know exactly what they owe, and that is why we hope the MMS will simplify the regulation. In fact, the MMS refuses to even abide by its own previous rulings. So an oil company that is trying to do the right thing goes to a previous ruling on how oil is valued in a particular place, in a particular way, and the MMS says: No, we are not going to be bound by what we did in another case. 
   That walks away from the value of precedent that is the hallmark of our judicial system and the regulatory system in our country. In most instances, the IRS most certainly abides by its previous rulings. They give opinion letters that people can rely on so they can pay their fair share of taxes. Courts set precedents with rulings every day so people will know what the law is and what they must do to comply. Not the MMS. They have one opinion here and one opinion there. Congress asked them to make it simpler, and they have gone far beyond what Congress intended. It is our responsibility to make sure they do what is right for the taxpayers of America. That is what the Hutchison-Domenici amendment will assure they do. 
   This is not an industry that has had an easy time in the last year and a half. In fact, oil prices have been lower than ever in the history of our country, adjusted for inflation, $7, $8 a barrel, a lot of that because of the glut of imported oil on the market. We have lost half a million jobs in the oil industry in the last 10 years. We are importing 57 percent of the oil in our country. If we have bad oil royalty principles, it also affects natural gas, which is the most important substitute fuel in many of our coal burning areas. Natural gas is much cleaner, better for the environment than coal. So when you start tampering in a negative way with the oil royalty rates, you also are going to affect the price and availability of natural gas, because natural gas, of course, is a byproduct of drilling for oil. If you discourage our American companies and our American people from being able to get our own oil resources, you are also cutting back on our supply of natural gas. That could be dangerous to our economy and dangerous to the people who live in our country who depend on natural gas to heat their homes. 
   I think it is important we put this in perspective. It is important we look at what we are talking about. Senator BOXER said the new rule would only affect 5 percent of the oil companies, and it would be just the big oil companies. She said she supports small oil companies. Well, I hope she will, because if she will, she will support the Hutchison-Domenici amendment because it is the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that will keep our small producers in business after the devastating effects of low oil prices from the last year. 
   In fact, every single oil company is affected. There are 2,400 producers with Federal leases. Only 70 of them are not classified by the SBA as small businesses. All 2,400 are opposed to this new rule that will require them basically to pay taxes on their costs. The small oil companies that the Senator said she would support are very opposed to her position. They are for the Hutchison-Domenici amendment because they don't want a new rule that would second-guess sales of oil at the wellhead and make fuzzy exactly when the oil should be valued. They don't want a new duty to market and incur the costs of marketing 
   and selling the product and bear the cost without any allowance. They are very concerned about this. 
   If Senator BOXER believes that the small oil companies are against the Hutchison amendment, I hope she will talk to them. They will assure her that this is going to put one more chink in their ability to create jobs and continue to drill oil and natural gas in our country, rather than choosing to go overseas where it is much cheaper to do it and where you don't have to pay as much as we pay in America. 
   I hope very much that she will reconsider, knowing that all of the small companies are affected by this new ruling. 
   I will read from some of the letters of people and groups that are supporting the Hutchison-Domenici amendment. 
   People for the USA writes:  
   Dear Senator HUTCHISON: We support your fight to simplify the current royalty calculation system. On behalf of 30,000 grassroots members of People for the USA, I want to thank you for your diligent efforts to bring common sense to royalty calculations on Federal oil and gas leases. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has suggested that domestic oil field workers look to opportunities overseas. Senator, an administration that talks about kicking American resource producers out of the country has a badly skewed set of priorities.  
   That is signed by Jeffrey Harris, Executive Director. 
   The National Black Chamber of Commerce writes:  
   Dear Senator HUTCHISON: The efforts of MMS are, indeed, ludicrous. Collectively the national economy is booming and the chief subject matter is ``tax reduction,'' not ``royalty increase,'' which is a cute term for tax increase. What adds salt to the wound is the fact that despite a booming economy from a national perspective, the oil industry has not been so fortunate and is on hard times. We need to come up with vehicles that will stimulate this vital part of our economic bloodstream, not further the damage.  
   That is signed by Harry Alford, President and CEO, National Black Chamber of Commerce. 
   Citizens for a Sound Economy:  
   The 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act included moratorium language concerning a final crude oil valuation rule, with the expectation that the Department of Interior and industry would enter into meaningful negotiations in order to resolve their differences. Unfortunately, more time is still needed for government and industry to reach a mutually beneficial compromise.  
   It is signed by Paul Beckner, President. 
   Citizens Against Government Waste:  
   Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations bill will provide the time necessary for the MMS and the industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule benefiting both sides.  
   It is signed by Council Nedd II, Director, Government Affairs, Citizens Against Government Waste. 
   Frontiers of Freedom:  
   In a misleading letter dated July 21, 1999, detractors of the Hutchison-Domenici amendment allege it will cost taxpayers, school children, Native Americans and the environment. That is not so. It is time to set the record straight. This amendment does not alter the status quo at all. This amendment says to Secretary Babbitt, spend no money to finalize a crude oil valuation rule  until the Congress agrees with your proposed methodology for defining value for royalty purposes.  
   That is signed by Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform; George Landrith, Executive Director for Frontiers of Freedom; Patrick Burns, Director of Environmental Policy, Citizens for a Sound Economy; Fred Smith, President Competitive Enterprise Institute; Al Cors, Jr., Vice President for Government Affairs, National Taxpayers Union; Jim Martin, President, 60 Plus; David Ridenour, National Center for Public Policy Research; Adena Cook, Blue Ribbon Coalition; Bruce Vincent, Alliance for America; Chuck Cushman, American Land Rights Association; and Malcolm Wallop, Chairman of Frontiers of Freedom.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from California throwing around numbers such as this has cost the taxpayers of America $88 million already, or $60 million already.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this shows there would be a proposed difference in income of $11 million. In addition to putting that in the RECORD, I want to say that we have offset that $11 million. I have to say I think it is ludicrous that you would say we think that in the future you won't get $11 million and, therefore, we need to make up that proposed lost revenue for a tax that has not even been put in place. Nevertheless, that was the ruling we were given, so we did offset with $11 million. But it is ridiculous to say that you have to offset the tax that hasn't been put in place because you don't know what businesses are going to pull up stakes and say: It is too expensive to drill with this kind of royalty rate. We are going to go overseas and we are going to take our jobs with us. 
   So I am not sure that it would be $11 million, or anything at all. My hunch is that we are going to lose jobs and we are going to lose income, and the schoolchildren of this country are going to suffer because the oil business has not yet recovered from the crisis. 
   Mr. President, on that note, I have to also say that I think it is very important that when we are talking about a proposed rule that hasn't been put in place and we are already saying how much will be missed, clearly, there is no concept of how business can work and make a profit and continue to create jobs. So I am concerned that if we raise this royalty valuation, which is a tax on the oil industry, at a time when many of them are on their knees anyway, we are not going to have income of $11 million, or $60 million, or anything else. In fact, I think we are going to go into negative income, which is exactly what has happened in Texas in the last year and a half, where schools have had to shut their doors and close down and consolidate classrooms because they could not make their budget because of the oil income not coming in. We lost $150 million just in the last year in oil royalty revenue in Texas alone. So this is not the time to raise rates. 
   Let's talk about the kind of taxes. We are talking about fairness. In fact, we are talking about what we tax. Today, the oil is valued as it comes out of the ground, after it has been cleaned up and is ready to be sold. You take out the contaminants and it is clean and that is where it is valued. But what the Government and MMS are proposing to do is say, no, we want you to go out and get a buyer for the oil and incur the cost of buying; and then we want you to put it in a pipeline and take it to where it is going to be picked up by the buyer, and we are going to value it there. That is taxing the cost. That just doesn't make sense. That is like saying to McDonald's, whatever you spend in advertising, we are going to tax you that amount. We are going to tax you on your advertising for McDonald's hamburgers. 
   Mr. President, that concept will not fly. It doesn't happen in any other industry. Whenever would the Government expect taxes on expenses? It just doesn't make sense. But sometimes I think people I hear arguing on the Senate floor have never been in business. If you have never been in business and have never met a payroll, then you don't really understand how hard it is to make a profit and create new jobs and do right by your employees. I have been in business. I have met a payroll. I know how hard it is, especially in a small business. And when the prices are $7 or $8 a barrel and the costs are $14 a barrel, 
   you can't stay in business very long. And if you can't stay in business very long, there are a lot of people and families who don't have jobs; and if you have to lay off people  who are working at the well, then you also have to lay off people in the oil fields service industry and the oil supply industry because you aren't going to need the supplies if you are not drilling. And if it is too expensive to drill in America, you are going to go somewhere else, and you are going to create jobs in a foreign country. 
   Mr. President, I guess the last thing I will say in refuting the arguments I heard from the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from California is that it always seems the tack is to say, well, they don't really care about this issue; they are supporting big oil because big oil has contributed to their campaigns. I don't go around looking at whether trial lawyers give to other Senators and, therefore, they don't vote for tort reform. I don't accuse people of not representing the interests of their States. Of course, I have oil workers in my State. I hope I am supported by people who work in my State and live in my State. But I would not do anything that would hurt the people of my State. The idea that that is connected to campaign contributions I just think is cynical, and I don't think it adds integrity to the debate. 
   You gauge that against a most incredible statement when you accuse people who want to keep jobs in America, who want fair pricing, fair taxing, and fair payment of taxes--you accuse people of having some kind of other motive, and then you pick up a magazine called Inside Energy and the Department of Interior communications director says on November 2 of 1998, regarding the Hutchison-Domenici amendment that would require them to have a fair valuation:  
   We are sticking to the position we have taken. It gives us an issue to demagog for another year.  
   Mr. President, I think we have heard a lot of demagoguery on this issue. I have heard the most outrageous debate and arguments that I have heard on just about any subject on this issue, trying to make it seem as if oil companies that are being sued are somehow connected to whether or not we have a fair royalty valuation, trying to mesh those issues. That just does not make sense. 
   It does not add to the debate. But to have the kind of demagoguery that we have heard on the floor and then to have the Department of the Interior admit that what they want is an issue to demagog, I have to say I think the Los Angeles Times editorial proves they did get a demagoguery editorial. I think some of the network television bought into it. I think there has been some very unfair coverage because we are talking about Congress standing up for its right to tax. If Congress doesn't stand up, who will? Who is accountable at the Department of the Interior? It is a matter of fairness. 
   I am not going to walk away from that responsibility. I know what I am doing is right because I know we can have fair taxes of royalty. We are talking about an industry that paid $58 billion in the last 40 years in royalty rates. They have given a lot back to this country. They have given jobs. They have paid royalty rates. I want them to pay fair royalty rates. I would never stand up and say they shouldn't, or if they haven't that they shouldn't be fined. I think they should. But we are talking about people. We are talking about jobs. We are talking about the American economy. We are talking about retirement plans that depend on stable oil companies and the oil industry. 
   I think fair taxation is the responsibility of Congress. That is what the Hutchison-Domenici amendment will assure--fair taxation intended by Congress. 
   We will have some more debate on this. I certainly hope in the end my colleagues will not be susceptible to rank demagoguery--to rhetoric that is harsh and not in any way fair. It may be fun to ask questions back and forth on the Senate floor indicating that people's motives are not the right motives or are not pure, but that doesn't add to the debate. It is our responsibility to make policy. We are going to do it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before I leave, I want to take a moment to also talk about one other issue. That is the issue of what is happening in Indonesia. 
   All of us have seen atrocities and read of atrocities in many parts of the world--most recently in Indonesia where we have seen the people of East Timor vote for independence, and they were told by the Government of Indonesia that vote would be respected. Now we see bands of militia-type people that, it is said, could be connected with the Indonesian Government going in and committing terrible acts. This is a terrible thing. It is horrible. We hate to see it. 
   I think there are many things that can be done. 
   First and foremost, we must call on Indonesia to do what they said they would do and respect the right of the people of East Timor in their independence. 
   I also think we should be supportive of those who are volunteering to go over there if necessary. This is where I think we can show some leadership from the United States. I would call on the President to do that. That is not to all of a sudden start talking about sending American troops into East Timor. 
   I think by beginning to start bandying that around, all of a sudden you are going to start seeing people depend on American troops. I don't think we have to start talking about American troops in East Timor. I think it would be harmful if we did that because of the vast commitment we have in the Balkans right now as well as the DMZ in Korea, as well as in Japan, as well as in Europe, and other places in the world. 
   No one would ever walk away from the responsibility that America must shoulder as a superpower. But Australia has stepped up to the line to try to help bring an end to the chaos that I hope is temporarily erupting in East Timor. I think we should help them do that by offering logistical support but letting people volunteer. 
   This is a time when we can look at the areas of the world that have regional conflicts, and we can let the sophisticated countries that have quality military operations be the main part of a force in those areas. 
   In fact, it appears that Australia, New Zealand, and many others are volunteering to take this policekeeping mission. I think it would be wise for us to let them do that. Let them take that responsibility and offer our logistical help if they need it. But don't start bandying about the possibility of U.S. troops going in on the ground when our troops are stretched so thin--when we have had the worst recruiting year and the worst retention year since the early 1970s because our troops are in mission fatigue. They are not able to stay in top training because they are stretched so thin. 
   I hope the President will take this opportunity to set a U.S. policy and to work with our allies to have a division of responsibility that is fair. 
   If we do that, then America will be able to do what only it can uniquely do, and that is the air power that we have shown that we have in the last 6 months. Let us keep our role to responding where only we are able to keep the peace--in the Middle East, in Korea, in Japan, and in parts of Europe. Let's work with our allies for a fair responsibility sharing that will set a precedent so that we will all have the staying power to provide the critical needs in regions as they occur. 
   I hope President Clinton will take this opportunity to be a leader and to represent the United States and our national security issues and our national security stability. If he will do that, I think you will begin to see a foreign policy that will evolve with all of our allies sharing and keeping all of us strong by not overburdening any one of us to the detriment of all. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak about why I am going to vote against the Holbrooke nomination. I start by saying, I have never put a hold on this nomination. I thought the process should go forward in due course. I think Richard Holbrooke is a principled man. I think he is a committed public servant. I admire his tenacity, his dedication. I have nothing personal against Richard Holbrooke. 
   I am voting against him because I disagree with the policy that he has put forward in the Balkans. I just can't, in good conscience, vote for someone who I think is taking our country in the wrong direction. 
   This is his policy: that the United States should spend billions of dollars, wear and tear on our equipment and our troops, stretching our military for a goal that I believe is not achievable. 
   I would commit our military immediately if I thought the goal and the mission were the correct one, but I believe our policy in the Balkans is to force factions to live together in an American model, when the circumstances are different from any we have ever had in our country. I don't think we can put American requirements into the Balkans with any chance to succeed. 
   We have had a policy that the United States could use force of vast proportions without strategically assessing what would be more proportional responses in line with our own security threat and our other responsibilities in the world. Richard Holbrooke did not allow the United States, through his policies, to lift the arms embargo on one faction in Bosnia, so one group was unarmed against two groups that were armed. I think if we had lifted the arms embargo 3 years before the Dayton accords, those people would have had a fair chance. I don't think we would have seen the mass slaughter of the Moslems that we did. I disagree with that policy. 
   We never looked at the opportunity for self-determination in the Balkans. We never looked at the opportunity to let these people form governments within their ethnic groups. They are 98 percent in ethnic groups now in Bosnia, but we are still trying to force them to have a coalition government. If we walked out today, I think every expert would agree the fighting would continue. 
   The Washington Post yesterday had a headline, ``NATO Losing Kosovo Battle.'' This was not a headline 2 months ago. It was yesterday. 
   The reason is, we have a policy in the Balkans that I think is going to hurt our own national security by overdeploying our military troops, by wear and tear on our equipment, by not having a sense of proportion in looking for other options, not looking at all of our commitments in the world, but instead trying to force an American model that I think is unrealistic today. 
   I think there are other options to try to help the people in the Balkans create stability with self-determination and then, eventually maybe, they would be able to live closer together in harmony. 
   Mr. President, I want to say I am only voting against Mr. Holbrooke on his foreign policy principles, not on him as a person. I will say again that I think he is a committed public servant. I think he is tenacious in his beliefs, and I admire that in a person. I just believe that our foreign policy is going in the wrong direction in this country. I think we are going to pay a high price for it, and I think Richard Holbrooke is one of the architects of this policy that I believe is quite erroneous. So, for that reason, I will vote against Richard Holbrooke. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for giving us tax relief for the hard-working American family. 
   We have heard a lot of debate in this Chamber in the last few hours, but it comes down to a very simple issue, and that is whether we are for giving the people who earn the money the right to decide how to spend it. It comes down to one basic issue. We are for tax cuts, and I think the question is, Is the President for tax cuts? He campaigned saying he was for tax cuts for middle-income people, but the President has not supported tax cuts yet. 
   In fact, the major area of tax policy that the President gave us was the largest increase in the history of America. We are trying to cut back on those tax increases because we have a surplus and because we believe that the surplus should be shared with the people who gave it to us in the first place. 
   A lot has been said about Social Security and whether we are going to maintain the stability of Social Security. The answer is emphatically, we are; $2 trillion will come in over the next 10 years in Social Security surplus. The Republican plan that is before us today totally keeps that $2 trillion for Social Security stability.  
   The other $1 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years is in income tax surplus, withholding surplus, people's hard-earned money that they have sent to Washington in too great a quantity. It is that $1 trillion that we are talking about. We are talking about giving 25 cents per dollar of that trillion back to the people who earn it, and we think that is not only fair; it is required. 
   I worked very hard with Senator ASHCROFT and Senator BROWNBACK to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. This bill does it. We double the standard deduction so that people will not have a penalty because they get married. And, most of all, the people who need it the most are going to have total elimination of the tax on marriage. That is the schoolteacher and the nurse who get married and all of a sudden are in a double bracket, from 15 percent to 28 percent. One earns $25,000, the other earns $33,000, and together they go into the 28-percent bracket today. This bill eliminates that from the Tax Code forever, period--gone. 
   The President has said he is going to veto that tax relief, and I don't understand it. 
   Let me talk about what it does for women. Of course, the marriage penalty tax hurts women. But we also know that women live longer and they have smaller pensions. They have smaller pensions because women go in and out of the workplace, and they lose the ability to have that growth in geometric proportions in their pensions. That has been an inequity for women in our country. We eliminate that in this bill, or at least we try. We help by allowing women over 50 who come back into the workplace to be able to set aside 50 percent more in their pensions to start catching up. So where most people--all of us--have a $10,000 limit on a 401(k), a woman over 50 who comes back into the workforce after raising her children will be able to have a $15,000 set-aside in her 401(k). We also give help on IRAs. 
   It is very important to a woman who is going to live longer to have equal pension rights because she is more likely to have children, raise her children, maybe through the 1st grade or maybe through the 12th grade. We want to make sure we equalize that and recognize it. We have done that. Yet the President says he is going to veto this bill. 
   We have tax credits in this bill for those who would take care of their elderly parents, or an elderly relative, because we know one of the hardest things families face is how to take care of an elderly relative who doesn't want to go into a nursing home. Families would like to keep them. Sometimes they don't even want to do that, but long-term care is so expensive that they can't afford it. So we have credits for long-term care insurance, and we have credits for those who would care for their elderly parents. 
   So this bill lowers capital gains, lowers the death tax; it gives a benefit to everyone. The working people of this country deserve it. I hope the Senate will pass it. I hope the President will sign it and make good on all of our pledges to give the working people of this country relief. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Then you see the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works who says: Excuse me, but this is my jurisdiction, and I would like to address it. And he is, as Senator DOMENICI said, one of the most distinguished of our Members. 
   I say to Members, do this: MTBE should be looked at. It is a way to clean the air. It is an additive to gasoline to meet the clean air requirements of EPA. 
   We should not have a sense of the Senate that holds up the Agriculture appropriations bill. I hope Members will vote to table this sense of the Senate and give Chairman CHAFEE the opportunity to look at this issue to determine if there is something wrong with MTBE, which I think is very much a question. 
   But to have something like this continue to hold up this bill, when our farmers certainly need the relief this appropriations bill is going to give us, I think is the wrong approach. 
   I urge Members to table this sense of the Senate.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will finish on my statement. 
   Something very important is happening. What is important is, we are apparently going to pass overwhelmingly the only amendment that will have passed on this bill. On this very important tax cut measure, we are going to add certainly the first amendment, and maybe the only one, that says the marriage tax penalty is not going to be allowed to stand in the United States of America. That is what we are doing today. The bill provides for marriage tax penalty relief in 2005. I applaud the committee for doing that. But I thought we should address it earlier. That is why Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, Senator DOMENICI, Senator ROTH, and Senator BAUCUS have come together and said that is right. The people of this country who want to get married should not have to pay $1,000 in taxes just because they got married. We are going to end it today because we are sending a signal that is joined by the House that this is our first priority. 
   So a high school football coach and a schoolteacher can get married and not move into a bracket that is almost double just because they got married. It hits our middle-income taxpayers the most. They are the ones who are trying to save for a new house or a new car or to do something special for their new baby. We are going to send a signal out of the Senate, along with the House, to the President, saying: Mr. President, we are going to have $1 trillion in income tax surplus. Are you serious in saying you would veto this bill that gives marriage tax penalty relief to our country, that gives pension relief to the women who go in and out of the workforce who are unable to have the same pension capabilities as those who never leave the workforce? 
   Is the President serious about vetoing a bill that provides for Social Security, that provides for Medicare and education, and, yes, the marriage tax penalty relief? 
   Mr. President, we are making a statement with this amendment. I am proud the Senate is going to take up and I believe overwhelmingly pass a  priority of eliminating the marriage tax penalty in this country once and for all. I urge my colleagues to give a unanimous vote for the married people who have been living with a penalty that is not warranted. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to address some of the issues I just heard from the Senator from South Carolina. The first is quoting of Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I believe Dr. Greenspan's comments have been taken far out of context. Because if you look at what he said, plainly it is if the choice is more spending or tax cuts, I will take tax cuts. 
   It is true he said he would be very cautious.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Dr. Greenspan said: If it is a choice of tax cuts versus spending, he takes tax cuts. Paying down the debt is exactly what the Republican plan does. So I think it is very important we keep Dr. Greenspan's comments in context. 
   If you look at the President's plan, he takes $1 trillion and spends it. The Republican plan takes the same $1 trillion and gives $792 billion back to the people who earned the money, and we have a cushion for spending on issues such as Medicare and education in the rest of the $1.3 trillion in surplus that comes from income tax withholding. 
   The Republican plan takes all of the payroll taxes that we heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about and puts that into Social Security reform and stability. So when we are talking about a lockbox, we are saying all the payroll taxes for Social Security that people pay in will be set aside for Social Security. That is $2 trillion. That is exactly what the President's plan sets aside for Social Security. 
   It also has the effect of paying down debt by about 50 percent, according to the estimates. So you pay down debt and you stabilize Social Security with $2 trillion that is set aside from the payroll taxes that people pay in. 
   But for the other $1 trillion we are looking at that comes from income tax withholding, we have very different plans. The President would spend it. The Republicans would let the people who earned it keep it, and we would hold the rest in abeyance for spending on Medicare, education, national defense. 
   Why do we want the people who earn this money, who work so hard for it, to be able to keep it? Because we believe the people who earn it need the relief for their own purposes--for them to decide how they want to spend their money. The typical American family is paying more in income taxes in peacetime than ever in our history--38 percent in income taxes. A 10-percent across-the-board tax cut is fair to everyone. Because when people paid their taxes last year--they know what they paid, and they can take 10 percent off that. That is the most fair of all tax cuts, to let people keep more of what they earn. In fact, our tax relief package is less than the tax 
   increases that President Clinton put in place in 1993. At that time, President Clinton said he was going to tax the rich and he put in that category people on Social Security who earned $34,000 a year. That is what he declared as rich. I think these people deserve a break, and that is what we are trying to give them. 
   We are giving marriage tax penalty relief. This morning at my constituent coffee, I met a schoolteacher and a football coach. I am going to estimate they earn about $35,000 and about $40,000 apiece. They get hit right square between the eyes with the marriage penalty because when you put their incomes together, they go into a new bracket. They are earning, then, $65,000 to $70,000 for a family of four. 
   That is wrong. We should not tell people because they get married that they owe more in taxes, just because they got married.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri and Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas. 
   This is an amendment that, very simply, moves the marriage penalty provisions from taking effect in 2005 to giving an early effect starting in 2001. By beginning to phase in the doubling of the standard deduction, we give married couples relief from the marriage tax penalty that I have to say I think is the most unfair part of the Tax Code in the Internal Revenue Code that we have in our country. 
   It isn't that anybody ever meant to have a marriage tax penalty. Congress didn't enact one. But it was a consequence that was unintended and unexpected when there were changes in the brackets in the Tax Code. We are going to correct it with this amendment. We are going to do it earlier than is in the bill. 
   I think Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN did a terrific job. They had a very difficult time, particularly because they were quite responsible in saying we were not going to have tax cuts except as we have a surplus that comes from income tax deductions.  
   The first decision the Finance Committee made was to say: We are setting aside Social Security. We are not going to touch it. 
   If we were to spend the Social Security surplus, we could have a lot more tax cuts a lot faster. But they were right. They said: No, we are not going to do that. Social Security was off the table. 
   We have smaller tax cuts in the early years because we are dealing with income tax deductions that should go back to the people who earned it. They sent too much to Washington and we want to return it to them. 
   The question is, What is the most important of the tax cuts and the least we can give? Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, and I believe the marriage tax penalty is the highest priority for relief. 
   We are offering this amendment by delaying a few of the other tax cuts until later. We don't change any of the tax cuts in this bill. We do not eliminate any of them. I support all of them. But we say the highest priority is the marriage tax penalty relief and everything else can be delayed a little bit to give hard-working American families that relief. 
   We are talking about a schoolteacher who makes $33,000 a year and a football coach who makes $41,000 a year. They are paying taxes, when they are single, in the 15-percent tax bracket. They get married. Guess what. They go into the 28-percent tax bracket at a time when they need their money the most. 
   We have almost doubled their tax bracket just because they have gotten married. Not only that, we don't even give them double the standard deduction. Instead of $4,300, and $4,300 when they were both single, they now together get $7,200. All we are going to do is phase in $8,600 in the standard deduction right up front. We are going to delay a few other things to let that happen. 
   In 2005, the real marriage tax penalty kicks in because that is the first time we have the money to let people file as singles when they are married. That is the best marriage tax penalty reduction of all because it eliminates it. That is simply what the amendment does. 
   I commend Senator ROTH for all of the effort he took to be responsible with this tax cut bill. This tax cut bill has across-the-board rate reductions that help every taxpayer in America, expands the tax brackets for middle-income taxpayers, and a number of positive pension provisions that are particularly helpful for women. 
   I spoke to Senator ROTH about the inequity for women in the workplace, because women have children and they have to lay off a few months. Some choose to lay off for six years until their children go to school. Some choose to lay off 18 years. 
   Women live longer. They are in and out of the workplace more--that is a fact--and they get penalized not only in their working years, but they get penalized in their retirement years. That is not fair. 
   This bill attempts to give them catchup provisions for their pensions. It is a great part of this bill. I support it totally. 
   We also have increases in charitable giving. This is a provision of mine that was put in this bill by Senator ROTH. It allows a person to roll over IRA contributions to charities without tax consequences. If a person has saved and done the right thing and sees that they are not going to need their IRA money, they can give it to charity without tax consequences. That is in this bill. 
   We are helping farmers with risk accounts in this bill, so that farmers will be able to plan and put aside money tax free until they need it in bad times. Heaven knows, the farmers of this country have seen bad times. 
   We have $12 billion in education tax relief. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is a balanced bill. It has marriage tax penalty relief, but it is in 2005. That is my only real concern about the fairness of this bill. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, Senator BROWNBACK, and I want to phase in some of the other tax cuts a little bit further down the road and say to the 40 million American married couples who are being penalized because they are married, we believe it is the highest priority to give relief. That is what we are saying in our amendment. 
   How much time remains?

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Kansas that we can do income splitting down the road as well because, in fact, it is very important that we give every married couple the best shake we can give them; that treats them totally fair. Whether they are a two-income-earner couple or a one-income-earner couple, we want them to have the same treatment that they would have under any other circumstance. 
   So I do support income splitting. I think after we get the money accumulated in the surplus we will be able to give them much more relief, real relief, in fact elimination of the penalty. That is the goal of all of us. 
   I yield 12 minutes also to Senator ASHCROFT. Senator ASHCROFT has been fighting along with Senator BROWNBACK and myself, side by side, on this issue. Ever since he came to the Senate it has been one of his highest priorities. I am so appreciative that he has been the stalwart soldier on the marriage tax penalty that he has because I think we are going to win this victory in the end. 
   I yield 12 minutes to Senator ASHCROFT.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate the fact that the committee made a priority of the marriage tax penalty. The real marriage tax relief is in the bill in the year 2005 in the responsible timeframe. That was actually the first year you could do it because you cannot phase that in. I appreciate the effort that was made. 
   My amendment just doubles the standard deduction earlier. The Senator from Delaware has been working with me on the floor, as has Senator BAUCUS. I very much appreciate their helping me work through this so that we are going to have the early relief on the standard deduction now in the year 2001, starting the phase-in to 2005 when we are going to give the real relief, which the chairman had in the bill originally. I give him the credit for that, and I appreciate his remarks very much.

   The bottom line is, by delaying a few other very important tax cuts, we have been able to put at the top of our priority list $6 billion more in marriage tax penalty relief for the 43 million people in this country who are suffering just because they are married. That is not right. We have been needing to correct this for years. You should not have to choose between love or money in America, and yet 22 million American couples are doing just that. 
   This amendment will take part of the marriage tax relief and put it up, starting in 2001, so there will be immediate relief phased in to give couples that opportunity to save more of the money they earn to spend as they choose because, in fact, if they were not married,  they would be paying that much less in taxes. But they are married. We want to encourage them to do that, if that is what they want to do, and we certainly should not be penalizing them. 
   Tomorrow I will talk about what is in the amendment, what it does, but tonight I want to say thank you to Senator ROTH and to Senator BAUCUS for working with us. This is a significant improvement in the bill because it will give married couples throughout our country the relief they deserve. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I recognize the remarkable achievements of Lance Armstrong, winner of the prestigious Tour de France bicycle race. On Sunday, July 25, less than 3 years after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, he sprinted to an inspirational victory in Paris. Lance Armstrong is a Texan who is an example of strength and courage to all cancer patients and athletes. He is only the second American in history to win the Tour de France, one of the world's most grueling athletic contests, and he is the first cancer survivor to achieve the feat. 
   Lance Armstrong was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in nearby Plano. He first competed in athletics as a swimmer and took up the triathlon, which includes swimming, running, and cycling, at age 14. At 17, after his potential was recognized by the U.S. national cycling team coach, he switched to cycling full-time. Lance Armstrong  trained and competed at the highest level in the world, and began focusing on distance bicycle racing in his early twenties. Then, in the fall of 1996, when he was just twenty-five years old, Armstrong was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer, which had already spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. He was given a fifty percent chance of survival and underwent two operations and twelve weeks of chemotherapy. Throughout his fight with the disease, Lance Armstrong never gave up. After each one-week cycle of chemotherapy, he would ride 30 to 50 miles per day on his bicycle. By the summer of 1997, Armstrong had conquered cancer and began to pursue bicycle racing with new determination. 
   Lance Armstrong dominated this year's Tour de France and after three weeks, 2,290 miles, and two mountain ranges, he won cycling's most prestigious and rugged race by more than 7 1/2 minutes. Lance Armstrong dedicated his victory to other cancer survivors, whom he hoped would be inspired by his success. He was motivated by his determination to encourage other cancer patients and said upon winning, ``I hope this sends out a fantastic message to all survivors: We can return to what we were before--and even better.'' 
   Lance Armstrong is one of the success stories in our ongoing fight against cancer. After overcoming the disease he dedicated himself, not only to cycling, but also to fighting cancer by founding the Lance Armstrong Foundation, whose mission is ``Fighting Urological Cancer through Education, Awareness, and Research.'' 
   Unfortunately, Lance Armstrong is not alone in his battle with cancer. Rates of testicular cancer have increased sharply over the past thirty years, especially among young men. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 7,600 new cases of testicular cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. But due to advances in early detection and treatment, many of them the result of research funded by the National Institutes of Health, U.S. statistics show a 70% decline in death rates from testicular cancer since 1973. As our commitment to cancer research continues to grow hand-in-hand with advances in the fight against cancer, and as more and more courageous Americans like Lance Armstrong show cancer can be beat, I am increasingly confident that we will beat this dreaded disease. 
   I am proud that Lance Armstrong is an American and a Texan. His athletic victory and personal triumph make him a role model, not just to cancer survivors, but to all Americans. His remarkable achievements and inspirational influence on others can be simply summarized in the words written on a banner which was flown along the course of the Tour de France on Sunday: ``Victory is sweet. Living is triumph. Where there's a will, there's a way. Thank you for showing us a winning one.''

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for talking about the tax cuts and why we need them because we heard a lot of debate this morning about that very issue. 
   I think we are getting down to the core issue between how the Democrats on their side of the aisle would spend taxpayer money and how the Republicans would spend taxpayer money. 
   I think you can tell right off the bat what people are going to think about tax cuts by how they describe them. When they talk in terms of: How much is it going to cost us to give tax cuts to the American people, right away you know they believe the money you earn belongs to them. 
   We believe the money you earn belongs to you. We do not think we have a choice to take that money and go spend it on some program that you may or may not like. But if you had the choice of whether to spend $500 to take your children on a vacation or to make a car payment or to save for a downpayment on a home, or a program that may or may not affect you, most people would rather make the decisions themselves. 
   So let's talk about some of the issues that have been raised this morning. 
   First of all, if I heard ``reckless'' one time, I heard it 100 times this past weekend. Let's talk about ``reckless.'' We have $3 trillion estimated as our surplus. Let's talk about how we are going to spend that, and let's see if it seems reckless. 
   We are going to set aside 75 cents of every dollar of the surplus for paying down debt, for strengthening Social Security, for spending on Medicare, education, and other sources. That will be 75 cents on the dollar to pay down debt, strengthening Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and other spending items. 
   And 25 cents of every dollar is going to be given back to the people who earned it. So 75 percent to pay down debt; 25 percent given back to the people who earned it. 
   We are not a corporation. We do not have a choice of what to do with profits. We take just as much money as we are going to need to fund legitimate Government programs and services. That is what governments do. Anything left over goes right back to the people who earned it. 
   Right now, the people of our country are paying more in peacetime taxes than ever in our history. They deserve to have some of that money back. Many families have two income earners just to cover the taxes so they can keep their quality of life for themselves and their children. We want them to have the quality of life they choose, not by taking taxes from them but by letting them decide how they spend the money they earn. 
   I am reading a headline in the Washington Post that says: ``Clintons Plan Appeal to Women on Tax Cut.'' They make the argument that we are not going to do anything for Medicare, and if we do not strengthen Medicare it is going to hurt women the most because they live longer. 
   I agree with the premise that women live longer, and cutting Medicare so that it is not there for them would hurt women the 
   most, but that is not what the Republican plan does. The Republican plan does set aside the money for Medicare. 
   I would ask the President, when he is talking about strengthening Medicare, why he chose to disregard his own Medicare trustees and the bipartisan plan they supported that would have strengthened Medicare on a bipartisan basis and would have given prescription drug help to those who need it that was agreed to by both sides of the aisle in Congress; and yet the President walked away from that Medicare reform. Today he is saying our plan does not help Medicare, when he had a chance to help Medicare and he walked away from it--a bipartisan effort of Congress to save Medicare. 
   I do not think the President can have it both ways. 
   Let me tell you what our tax plan does for the women of our country. 
   No. 1, we eliminate the marriage penalty tax. If a policeman marries a schoolteacher, they owe $1,000 more in taxes to the Federal Government because they got married. The highest priority the tax cut plan has is to eliminate that penalty. I would say that is very good for the women of our country because they are often the ones who are discriminated against with the marriage penalty tax. We are going to correct that with our tax cut plan. I think that is good for the women of our country. 
   No. 2, I have introduced a bill for the last 3 years that would allow women who leave the workplace and have children and decide to raise their children, either 6 years before they start school or even 18 years if they decide to, when they come back into the workforce they would be able to buy back into their pension plans as if they had not left. 
   You see, women are discriminated against in our country, in the pension system especially, because they are the ones who live the longest and they have the lowest pensions. They have the lowest pensions because women are the ones who have children and who stay home to raise them for at least part of the early years, and they never get to catch up under the present system. 
   I commend Senator ROTH for making that a priority in the Senate tax cut bill, that we would stop discrimination in the pension plans of women in the workforce by allowing them to catch up. 
   So I think we have done a lot for women. We are setting aside the money to strengthen Medicare; $500 billion over 10 years for added spending on Medicare, education, defense. We need to have that cushion--$500 billion. 
   In addition to that, we set aside all of the Social Security surplus--every single penny. We fence it off for Social Security because that is the No. 1 concern, and it is the No. 1 stabilizing force for the elderly in our country. That is the first priority in our whole plan. Also, $2 trillion goes directly to Social Security reform and stabilization. That will be fenced off. 
   The other $1 trillion we want to divide among spending increases and tax cuts. We believe it is a balanced plan. We believe the American people deserve to have back in their pocketbooks the money they earn in order to make the decisions for their families. Also, we have been especially attentive to trying to bring equality for women back into the system. 
   It is the Republican Congress that gave women the right to contribute equally to IRAs. Before we had our tax cut plan 2 years ago, women who didn't work outside the home could only set aside $250 a year for their retirement security; whereas, if you worked outside the home, you could set aside $2,000 a year. That has gone away. We have equalized women who work outside the home and women who work inside the home with our IRA spousal opportunities. 
   Now we have to go back and help them on pensions, too. That is where the lion's share of the stability is for our retired people. It is in their retirement systems. That is where women have been hit the hardest because it is women, by and large, who have the children and who will stay home and raise them. I applaud the men who do this, and I appreciate them, but by and large, it is the women who do it. When they come back into the workforce, they are penalized by not being able to have the opportunity to buy back into their pension system so they will have stability when they retire. 
   Our bill does target women. It is a balanced bill. It saves Social Security. It contributes to more Medicare. It allows for added spending, and it gives tax cuts to the working people who earn this money. We don't own this money. The people who earn it own it. That is the difference I ask the people of our country to look at as we go through this debate. 
   Listen to how people talk about tax cuts. If they talk about what it costs the Federal Government, then they don't think your money belongs to you. If they talk about it in terms of how do  we best give it back to the people who own it, then you know we are looking out for the hard-working American who owns the money and wants to do his or her fair share to contribute to government but isn't looking to finance a landslide.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I will answer that question because the Senator from California raises a good point. You have to look, in an across-the-board tax cut, at what people are paying in taxes. A family of four who makes $30,000 doesn't pay taxes. I am glad they don't.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Actually, I think the Senator from California is overlooking the fact that everyone gets an across-the-board tax cut. In fact, in the Senate plan, it is weighted toward the lower levels because you only have the 1-percent decrease in the 15-percent tax rate. 
   The average person who pays hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes is going to receive about $400 in tax relief in the Senate plan. The House plan is different. The House plan gives 10 percent across the board based on how much you pay, which I think is fair. I think everyone should get the benefit according to what they have paid. 
   The Senate plan is very heavily weighted. I am surprised the Senator from California would oppose something that does help people at the lower end of the scale.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would mandate to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that Border Patrol agents who are in the field, who have experience, not be capped at a GS-9 pay level, as they currently are but go to a GS-11 level after they pass the test that the INS, of course, would have in their rating system. 
   I appreciate very much Senator GREGG's and Senator HOLLINGS' support for the efforts to increase the number of Border Patrol agents. But the problem is that recruitment has not been successful. One of the reasons the recruitment has not been successful is that we have capped the pay of Border Patrol agents at a lower level than Customs agents who are working side by side with our Border Patrol agents on the border. So it is no wonder people are going to Customs and DEA and other very good Government agencies and not coming to the Border Patrol. 
   This amendment will require that we go to the GS-11 level so that we can recruit and retain our best people for the Border Patrol and we can get on about the business of making sure the borders of our country are secure. 
   So, Mr. President, I urge that this amendment be accepted. Both sides of the aisle have looked at it. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is meant to close a gaping loophole we found in INS's sharing of information that allowed the serial killer, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, whose real name is Angel Maturino Resendiz, to get through our borders, even though he already had a criminal record, because there was not enough communication in the identification system between the INS and the other Justice Department agencies. So we didn't catch this serial killer. 
   This is an amendment I have worked on with Senators KYL, ABRAHAM, HATCH, and LEAHY that would require the Commissioner of the INS, within 90 days, to develop a plan for coordinating and linking all relevant INS databases with those of the Justice Department and other Federal law enforcement agencies to determine the criminal history and the record of prior deportation and, upon the approval of the Judiciary Committee and Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, will implement a plan by fiscal year 2000. 
   I am counting on the committees to come through on this because if we can get the plan in 90 days, we need to implement a plan that will identify criminal aliens in our country so when they try to enter again, they will be stopped. 
   I ask that the amendment be accepted and that we move forward to try to close this loophole that allowed this serial killer to fall through the cracks or slip through our fingers, however one wants to say it, and cause havoc in our country for about a month.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. If there comes a time when the Senator from New Hampshire needs to break in, I will be happy to yield. 
   I rise in support of the bill that is before us. It has been a tough bill. It is more than $888 million less than the appropriations bill that we enacted in last year, but it does provide sufficient resources. I believe Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS and their staffs have worked very hard to make sure we address the priorities for the Commerce, State, and Justice Departments and the very important issues with which they are dealing. 
   I have passed two amendments to the bill tonight. There will be another amendment that has already been accepted that will allow the INS Commissioner to provide a language proficiency bonus for people who are proficient in Spanish to be hired in the Border Patrol. Of course, if people are already proficient in Spanish, it will save the money it will take to train them in the second language. That amendment has been cleared on both sides. I appreciate it because I am looking for every way I can to increase the capability to recruit new Border Patrol agents who will be able to hit the ground running and help stop the influx of drugs and illegal immigration into our country. 
   I cannot imagine that we have continued to tell the INS that we want these Border Patrol agents to come on board, and we have not had the cooperation of the administration in either recruitment or retention. Certainly, I hope with this bill, which is  much more narrow in its requirements, the Border Patrol will do what the Congress has mandated they do, and that is recruit and retain more Border Patrol agents so we can stop the influx of drugs into this country. As a matter of fact, $10 billion in marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines crossed our border last year. How in the world can we say that we have a handle on the sovereignty of our borders when we have $10 billion of illegal drugs flowing in in 1 year? 
   I am very pleased that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, went to the Arizona border with Mexico during the Memorial Day recess. He was stunned at what he saw. I hope more Senators will go to the border so they will see the problem we are facing. 
   During the markup of the bill that is before us today, Senator STEVENS said: God forbid that the day comes when we have to have fences and walls between the United States and Mexico. 
   I share his view. Mexico is our neighbor. They are strong cultural and historic ties between our two nations. I seek a border that is as open as possible, allowing people, goods, and services to move across the 2,000-mile-shared border quickly and efficiently. I am committed to putting in place the infrastructure, the bridges, the facilities, and the inspection personnel necessary for this to happen. I wish the President and this administration would work with us. 
   The realities are otherwise, however. In Texas and along the border, we are witnessing a lawlessness that we have never seen since the days of the frontier. It is important to put the drug threat in its proper context and to understand its full dimensions. 
   On March 24, 1999, Administrator Thomas Constantine of the Drug Enforcement Administration testified before our subcommittee. He said:  
   Most Americans are unaware of the vast damage that has been caused to their communities by international drug trafficking syndicates, most recently by organized crime groups headquartered in Mexico. At the current time, these traffickers pose the greatest threat to communities around the United States. Their impact is no longer limited to cities and towns on the border. Traffickers from Mexico are now routinely operating in the Midwest, the Southeast, the Northwest, and increasingly in the Northeastern portion of the United States.  
   Make no mistake: Drugs coming across the border are ending up on the streets of Manchester, NH; Columbia, SC; Baltimore, MD; and Denver, CO, and they are coming across in record numbers. In fiscal year 1998, there were 6,359 drug seizures along the Southwest border. The total value of these drug seizures was $1.28 billion, nearly $150 million more than last year. Nearly $1 billion of the drugs seized last year were on the Texas border, in the Border Patrol sectors there. 
   Drug-related violence along the Texas border continues to increase. Ranchers in Maverick County, 150 miles southwest of San Antonio, reported that armed traffickers in black, wearing camouflage clothing, passed through their properties after walking across the Rio Grande River. The situation is no better on the immigration side. More than 1.5 million illegal immigrants were apprehended along the Southwest border just last year. 
   Conservative estimates suggest that only one in four illegal aliens is apprehended. But the numbers hide the dark, evil side of this issue of alien smuggling, violent assault against migrating women, and other suffering. 
   I commend to my colleagues an article that appeared recently in the New York Times. Rick Lyman reported on a disturbing development where infants and young children, some possibly kidnapped and others who are rented, are used to trick border agents. INS has no facilities to house families, especially babies. So illegal aliens are simply released and asked to report for a later court date. The borrowed children are then shuffled back and forth across the border to be placed in the hands of others to make yet another treacherous, illegal crossing. 
   These examples highlight conditions along the border. They underscore that we have a moral obligation to provide the necessary resources to secure our border. That is why I find it incomprehensible that this administration has requested no new Border Patrol agents, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, or Customs agents in its budget recommendation to Congress this year. The 8,000 men and women serving in our Border Patrol are our Nation's first line of defense in the war on drugs and illegal immigration. Understanding this, Congress required, under the Illegal Immigration Act of 1996, that the Attorney General in each of the fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, shall increase the Border Patrol by not less than 1,000 full-time active duty Border Patrol agents within the INS. Unfortunately, our Nation's top law enforcement officer, Janet Reno, and the President opted not to abide by the law and put these agents in their budget. 
   This is not the first time the administration has not complied with this law. In 1997, the administration only requested 500 new agents instead of a thousand. Thank heavens, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS have kept their commitment to secure our Nation's borders and provide $83 million in this year's budget to hire 1,000 agents. 
   Mr. President, this is so very important to fund these agencies. Again, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS have gone a long way to pushing INS toward getting the 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. I have heard from every Border Patrol chief along the Southwest border, and all have told me that, yes, they can use better equipment. Better equipment helps them and it gives them a range much longer than one of them can cover. But what they need most, first and foremost, is manpower. They cannot operate the equipment, they cannot get to the places they need to be if they don't have enough Border Patrol agents, and they are woefully short. 
   So after talking to our drug czar, General McCaffrey, it is clear that we need more Border Patrol agents. He has said we need 20,000 Border Patrol agents in order to stop the flow of drugs across our Southwest border.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues with regard to the issue of funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). SCAAP is a vital reimbursement program for states like mine that assists in the significant cost of incarcerating criminal aliens. 
   Although securing the border is the responsibility of the federal government, states and localities have had to bear the costs associated with incarcerating aliens should they enter the criminal justice system. In previous years, Congress has recognized their burden and worked to secure as much as $585 million for this critical program. Even at that level, less than 40% of Texas' costs of criminal alien incarceration have been reimbursed. Cutting SCAAP by over 80% as proposed in this measure would result in a reimbursement of only about 7% of the total cost to the State of Texas. It is estimated that the State of Texas would receive less than $7 million, and Texas counties would share in less than $3 million. Dallas County would receive less than $200,000 despite enduring costs of over $2.5 million; the County of El Paso, with costs exceeding $2.6 million, would be reimbursed only about $200,000; and Harris County, with costs nearing $14 million, would receive less than $1 million. Mr. President, this is the same Harris County that last week took custody in its county jail of the accused railway murderer, Angel Maturino-Resendez. In this case, Harris County is forced to assume the costs of detaining Maturino-Resendez, who is alleged to have repeatedly entered this country illegally and further alleged to have committed a string of stunningly violent murders across the United States. There could not be a more graphic illustration of why we need to support the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, so that our cities, counties and States are not left alone to pay the costs of the Federal government's failure to protect the border. 
   I pledge to work with the chairman to see that adequate funding can be restored to this vital program and appreciate the Senator from California bringing this important matter to the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator EDWARDS of North Carolina to offer legislation very important to those members of our Armed Forces who are deployed in defense of our nation's interests around the world. Our bill will provide for federal tax exemption to those serving in hostile areas not officially designated as combat zones. The current restrictions on this exemption to formally designated combat zones--which do not include many of our peacekeepers who face daily threats to their lives--are a half-century old relic of the Korean War that do not address the realities of the military missions in our post-cold-war world. 
   Today there are two combat zones as designated by the President in Executive Orders. One is in the Middle East, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, the Gulf of Aden, as well as Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. This area has been a combat zone since January 1991. The other combat zone is the Kosovo Area of Operations including the Federal Republic of Yugoslvia (Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the Adriatic Sea, and the Ionian Sea. This combat zone has been in effect since March 1999. Members serving in those areas get a tax exemption. 
   Yet, today there are 17 areas considered so dangerous that our troops there get a special allowance known as Imminent Danger Pay that do not receive the same tax relief that those in a designated combat zone get. In fact, combat zone tax provisions did not apply to our troops in Somalia, where we lost 18 Rangers in one bloody gunfight. 
   Our bill argues, in effect, that if a location is dangerous enough to earn the allowance reserved for imminent danger, then it's dangerous enough to get favorable tax treatment, too. This would include troops that are in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, including Algeria, Burundi, Pakistan, Sudan, and Yemen. 
   When our troops are deployed in harm's way anywhere, there should not be a discrepancy in tax benefits from one location to another. This is an administrative distinction that matters little to the brave young Americans who are out there defending us. These determinations are made after careful study by the Secretary of Defense, based on the inherent dangers in a foreign area. 
   The Senate expressed its support for addressing this inequity in a resolution we passed as part of the FY2000 Defense Authorization Bill. Not only is this the right and fair thing to do, but during these times of increased deployments and personnel shortages, it is in our national interest to continue to show our dedicated service members that we appreciate their sacrifice and commitment. 
   I commend the Senator from North Carolina for his leadership on this issue and urge other Senators to join us in this effort.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate concurrent resolution intended to focus the attention of Congress on the current plight of Medicare beneficiaries who receive home health care. Specifically, the resolution calls for increased Congressional oversight with regard to home health care of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which has responsibility of implementing the federal Medicare program. 
   Home health providers, or ``agencies'' as they are called, are being decimated by overly burdensome and complex regulations issued by HCFA. Ostensibly issued to implement the Medicare preservation provisions of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, these regulations instead have ignored or conjured Congressional intent and in the process have driven thousands of home health agencies out of business and left tens of thousands of homebound seniors scrambling to find care. 
   Mr. President, my home state of Texas is very rural. Despite the fact that there are now almost 20 million people living in Texas, most areas of the state remain rural, even isolated from major population centers. Many of these areas are medically very underserved. There are counties in Texas without a single hospital, and several without so much as a clinic for people to go to find basic health services. It's not unusual for a Texan in some parts of the state to have to drive 100 miles or more just to see a doctor. 
   When Congress created the home health benefit within the Medicare program, it dramatically extended Medicare's reach to senior citizens and disabled persons living in these rural areas. Home health also offered to bring much needed health services to many who, although they may reside in a city, nevertheless may live an isolated existence because they are homebound. 
   Because of the tremendous need and demand for home health care, the program began to grow rapidly. This growth began to alarm some who felt that the cost of the program would soon outstrip the Medicare system's ability to pay for it. There were also a growing number of reports of abuse and fraud within Medicare generally, and specifically within the home health program. 
   So in 1997, as part of a broader Medicare package, Congress acted to make the home health program more efficient and to crack-down on fraud and abuse. While these reforms were intended as a wake-up call to inefficient and fraudulent home health providers, they were not intended to pull the rug out from under the entire home health industry, and the 4 million patients nationwide who depend on the services home care provides. Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened. 
   Home health agencies have been besieged on all sides. Implementation of the Interim Payment System (IPS) has caused immediate cuts in payments to agencies by upwards of 60 percent. In many cases, these cuts are being implemented retroactively, resulting in many agencies being slapped with ``overpayment'' demand notices for hundreds of thousands of dollars. In some cases, these payment demands exceed the agency's annual payroll. Moreover, the manner in which HCFA has chosen to implement the IPS has caused the most efficient agencies to suffer the most severe cuts. Agencies that were less efficient, and thus were paid more in the past, are ironically given higher reimbursements under the IPS. 
   At the same time, home health agencies have been hit with many new, complex, and burdensome regulations, some of which seem to have no real purpose other than to generate more paperwork and administrative costs by home care agencies. 
   For example, home health providers are now required to keep track of and report their time in 15 minute increments. Many visiting nurses and other home health providers report having to use a stopwatch while they administer care to their patients in order to comply with this new requirement. Another example is HCFA's implementation of a sequential billing policy, wherein an agency cannot bill Medicare for services provided to a patient until all previous claims for that patient are resolved, even if those earlier claims are held-up by the Medicare bureaucracy. 
   Across the nation, and particularly in my home state of Texas, the combined results of these payment cuts and new regulations have been nothing short of catastrophic. In Texas alone, an estimated 700 home care agencies have already gone out of business since 1997, and many more are on the verge of collapse. Nationwide, upwards of 2200 agencies have reportedly shut their doors, representing about a third of the total number of home care agencies. 
   Mr. President, it seems that everywhere I travel in Texas, and I travel to some very rural areas, the one health complaint I hear consistently from my constituents concerns changes in the Medicare home health benefit. I have heard numerous instances of home health beneficiaries, particularly those with complex illnesses and demanding health needs, who have been left high and dry by the closure of their home care agency. Many of these individuals have been forced into hospitals or nursing homes. Others simply get no care, or must rely to the extent they can upon what care family or neighbors can provide. 
   I and many of my colleagues have communicated with HCFA in an attempt to soften the blow of their regulations, with only very limited success. And while HCFA has been largely unresponsive to Congress, it has been even more insulated from the comments, suggestions, and complaints from the home health community. In many cases, payment system changes have been enacted with virtually no public participation or comment. 
   Mr. President, our nation's homebound senior citizens deserve more. 
   This resolution seeks to bring attention to the plight of home health beneficiaries under HCFA's cumbersome implementation of the reforms Congress enacted. It calls upon Congress to take a more active role in overseeing the Health Care Financing Administration with regard to home health care and HCFA's implementation of its home care regulations. Most importantly, the resolution calls upon HCFA to adhere more closely to Congressional intent in administering the Medicare home health benefit to ensure that the program is not further eviscerated.  
   This resolution is certainly not the only solution to the current home health crisis. Just this month I joined with Senators COLLINS, BOND, and others, many of whom are original cosponsors of this resolution, in introducing substantive legislation that will repeal some of the most severe applications of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. While these changes cannot turn back time to restore the agencies and services that have been lost, it can help prevent even more providers from going out of business and even more homebound patients from being medically stranded. 
   Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support this resolution, as well as the substantive legislation just introduced by my colleague, Senator COLLINS. But most importantly, I call upon my colleagues to recognize the real and ongoing health care crisis facing America's homebound seniors and disabled individuals.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the National Youth Science Foundation and the 99 outstanding high school students who have been chosen to represent their states in the sciences. The National Youth Science Foundation honors and encourages excellence in science education. Since its inception in 1963, the National Youth Science Camp has brought together thousands of outstanding high school students who excel in the sciences. I want to congratulate the two students chosen from my state for this high honor, Melissa Corley from Dallas and Jason Simon from Highland Village. These students are selected from the program through a competitive process in each state that stresses scholastic excellence, scientific curiosity, and leadership in their schools and communities. These students will participate in a four-week summer forum where delegates exchange ideas with leading scientists and other professionals from academic and corporate worlds. Lectures and hands-on research projects are presented by scientists from across the nation who work on some of the most provocative topics in science today--topics such as fractal geometry, the human genome project, global climate change, the history of the universe, the fate of our rain forests, and robotics. Delegates to the Science Camp are challenged to explore new areas in the biological and physical sciences, arts, and music with resident staff members. 
   This week my constituent Bill Conner, of Nortel Networks, and an alumnus of the National Youth Science program, will speak at a luncheon in the Senate honoring this year's National Youth Science Camp participants. Bill Conner is an excellent role model for the young scientists who will be honored this week. 
   The National Youth Science Foundation, Nortel Networks and Bill Conner have like-minded visions. America has much to lose if we do not nurture young scientists and engineers who have the skills, vision and enthusiasm to lead us into the twenty-first century. It gives me great pleasure to recognize the National Youth Science  Foundation and thank all those who support America's educational system.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize a day that is certainly going to be remembered, as we go into the next millennium, as symbolizing this century. Each century has one or two things that define it. It is what schoolchildren remember. It is what adults remember. Everyone remembers where they were when certain events happened, whether it was President Roosevelt saying on the radio that the war was over, whether it was the assassination of President John Kennedy, or whether it was Neil Armstrong taking one giant leap for mankind. 
   I believe July 20, 1969, 30 years ago, was clearly one of the defining moments of our century, although it would be very difficult to choose which moment had the most lasting impact. The day Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon, the spirit of America was rejuvenated. It also was the culmination of years of discoveries, of scientific missions, of behind-the-scenes scientific experiments that were all a big show on July 20. I think it is important for us on a day such as today to recognize what all of those scientific experiences did and what we have gained from the space program. 
   In fact, when we look at the cost of the Apollo project, it cost about $25 billion. In 1990 dollars, it would be about $95 billion. It was an investment. The good news is, because America was willing to go for it, because America said the Moon is there and we can do it, we have had a 9-to-1 return on every dollar we have invested. 
   What is the 9-to-1 return? It is the newly created products and technologies and the new jobs that have come about as a result of those technologies that is the return on our investment. What space has given to our economy is a 9-to-1 return on our investment. 
   There have been 30,000 spinoffs from our space research. Let me tell you a few. 
   Satellites: Satellites are part of our daily lives. We now get instant access on the news anywhere in the world because of satellites. We can see press conferences anywhere in the world live because of satellites. We see satellites as part of our defense. A defense system for an incoming missile is going to result because we have satellite technology. 
   Computers: The microchip--how has that made a difference in our lives? Who can even ask the question about what computers have done. We see people with laptops in the airports, on airplanes. It is just phenomenal. This started with space research, not on the Senate floor, Mr. President. 
   High-quality software, high-performance computing, fiber-optic networks, water purification systems, Teflon--Teflon has improved the quality of life for all of us in this country who have spent even 1 minute in the kitchen. Digital watches, cordless tools, and, most notable, in my opinion, is space explorations' contribution to medical science. CAT scans and MRIs are revolutionizing our ability to detect tumors early enough so we can save lives. 
   Our quality of life has significantly improved since Neil Armstrong took the giant leap for mankind. It was to that moment that all of us related what America had accomplished. That happened 30 years ago today. 
   I congratulate Neil Armstrong, the Apollo 11 crew, and all those at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, who contributed to the giant leap for mankind and the quality of life that all of us live, because those brave astronauts were willing to take the risk and the chance. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator FRIST for his leadership in this area. Certainly all Members look to the one doctor in our body to give us advice, not only on what we need to do to make patient care better but to know the system well enough to know what will cause more harm than good. I appreciate the steady level-headedness of  the Senator from Tennessee. We are fortunate to have a physician in our midst. 
   Our Nation has the highest quality health care anywhere in the world. There is no question about that. In my home State of Texas, in our largest city of Houston, the biggest employer in the whole city is the health care industry, the Texas Medical Center. It contains world-class hospitals, including the renowned University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which is the finest cancer treatment center in the world. Baylor College of Medicine, too, is a world leader in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Houston is the home of the fathers of modern heart surgery: Dr. Michael DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley. 
   In the city of Dallas, TX, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School has four Nobel laureates. They are doing research that is changing the quality of health care for our future. They are doing it because we have a system that allows for the investment in research. It allows for the treatment that is the best for diseases. 
   We don't want to break something that isn't broken. We don't want to try to fix something that isn't broken. We want to make sure we are giving better quality health care, that we are going to continue to have research and be in the forefront of research and technology as we go into the next millennium, trying to make sure we are doing the right thing. 
   There are problems. We have too many uninsured. Too rapid growth of HMOs and other service providers has caused some to be left behind. We must address these problems. Are there problems with HMOs? Absolutely. Do we need to increase the number of insured Americans? Of course. 
   If the American people remember the health debate we had in 1993, this Nation soundly rejected an outright Federal takeover of health care. That bill went down once America realized that their doctor, their hospital, everyone involved in the health care industry in this country would have to answer to a massive bureaucracy in Washington, DC. 
   Under global cost limits, total health care spending in this Nation would be capped by Washington. Any way you slice it, what the administration offered was Government rationing of health care. 
   Today, we are considering legislation that would impose 350 new Federal mandates and regulations on our Nation's health care system. There has been discussion about the cost of these mandates, whether they will cost as much as a Big Mac or a McDonald's franchise. Either way, there will be increased costs, and more Americans could lose their insurance. 
   Once a mandate becomes law, a Federal agency here in Washington will issue regulations or interpretations of that mandate. We have only to look as far as the Health Care Financing Agency to see what a total disregard of congressional intent can do in the health care industry. While Congress did mandate more efficiencies, they did not mandate the cuts that HCFA made in our hospital industry and to our health care providers, such as physicians and home health care service agencies. We can see what Federal control of a health care 
   industry does by looking at what HCFA is doing to the health care providers in this country today. 
   I think we need to move very carefully into the arena of more Federal regulations of our health care industry. We do need to do something more than we are doing right now. However, I think we need to be very aware that we could go too far and throw out the baby with the bathwater. 
   I believe Democrats and Republicans want to make sure patients have basic rights when they and their family members need health care. It is wrong for an HMO to deny coverage for medically necessary treatment. It is wrong to allow a patient to get lost in red tape and unnecessary delays. 
   Both of our bills seek to empower patients when they are dealing with their health care industry and their insurance companies. However, there are three major differences in the way in which Democrats and Republicans are approaching the issue of managed care. 
   First, we believe that cost matters and that higher costs will translate into more Americans losing their coverage. 
   Second, Republicans recognize that the Federal Government and a Federal bureaucracy should not impose a one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring quality care. 
   Third, we believe good health care is better than a good lawsuit. 
   With regard to costs, the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Democrats' plan will cause health insurance to increase in price by 6 percent above the current rate of inflation. By some estimates, that could lead to an estimated 1.8 million Americans losing their health coverage. 
   Mr. President, 1.8 million people is a city the size of Houston relying on free clinics or charity coverage. That is what the Democrat bill will do. 
   The new mandates in the Democratic bill will also cost an estimated 190,000 American jobs and additional out-of-pocket costs by the average family of $207 a year. This is not acceptable. The average cost per family for employer-provided health premiums has already more than doubled over the last decade from $2,530 in 1988 to $5,349. 
   The provisions of the Republican bill will also cost money, but the total cost of our bill as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office is less than 1 percent in increased health premiums. These increases are more than offset by the provisions in our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus that will make health care more accessible and affordable for all Americans. 
   For the self-employed, our approach will make 100 percent deductibility of health insurance available next year--not in 5 years, as currently envisioned. Next year, every small business owner, every stay-at-home parent with their own business, will get exactly the same tax treatment for health insurance that corporations presently enjoy. This is long overdue. 
   The bill will allow employees the so-called flex plans or cafeteria plans to roll over to the next year up to $500 in unused funds to health insurance premiums or other out-of-pocket health costs. 
   Under the present use-it-or-lose-it flex plans, they are not able to keep the money they have not spent. We want to encourage them not to spend money they do not need to spend by allowing them to roll it over. 
   The second major difference between our two bills and our two approaches is that the Democratic plan assumes Washington knows better than individuals, States, and health care providers what is in their best interest. We heard so much this week about how some of the provisions of the Republican bill do not apply to all private health care insurance. That is true. For those health plans that are now regulated exclusively by the Federal Government, we ensure that patients have their rights, such as direct access to OB/GYNs, direct access to pediatricians, access to specialists, and access to emergency room care. But, for the vast majority of Americans with health care, it is the States that have jurisdiction over their plans. This has been the case for several decades, ever since there has been health insurance in our country. Since the advent of HMOs, more and more States have acted to regulate managed care plans to ensure that the residents of their States enjoy the same protections we are proposing for the federally regulated plans. Every State in America has some regulation of their managed care companies today. 
   There are wide differences in approach by various States, but there are wide differences among the States. Why should there not be wide differences if the States are acting on behalf of their own constituents, which they know better than we do? Who is to say the patient protections and regulations in New York are the same that the citizens of Texas would want? I do not want to take responsibility for deciding that New York should be doing something because Texas likes it. 
   The Democratic bill is too federally centered and heavyhanded in other areas as well. We have heard much discussion of medical necessity. The Democrats say they only want to allow physicians to do what is medically necessary. That sounds fine, but what do they mean by medical necessity? It goes to an agency that will have 250 pages of regulations about what is a medical necessity. And there we have it again, one-size-fits-all. 
   By trying to do this in Federal law, the Democratic plan empowers a Federal Government employee to make those decisions, not your doctor talking to you about your needs. Under our  system, we let an external review board of professionals, who are not associated with the HMO, decide who is right in making the call for the care. If the HMO says they are not going to cover a certain procedure, and the patient and the doctor decide that is not the right decision, the patient can internally appeal within the HMO, within a short period of time, and then appeal again to an outside panel of experts not associated with the HMO. That is the system we have in Texas, and it is working. 
   In 1997, Texas enacted an innovative and broad set of managed care reforms, including a host of patients' rights that are included in our bill today. The Texas plan includes the right to both internal and external appeal if the HMO denies a claim. In fact, in Texas, before you can even think of suing your HMO in court, you must exhaust your administrative remedies, and because the State tried to apply its external review provisions to federally regulated as well as State regulated HMOs, a Federal court has struck down part of the 
   State law. But it was working very well. 
   The State recently acted to revive the external review section of the law. Now the system is voluntary. But, surprisingly, HMOs and other health plans are still willing to participate and be bound by the external review process in Texas. And it is working. 
   The Republicans' Patients' Bill of Rights Plus establishes a national, internal, and binding external appeals process using the Texas statute as a guide. It is a good system. I think it will work for the federally covered plans as it has worked in Texas. In fact, in Texas it has worked so well that, of more than 300 appeals heard under the external review system, only one lawsuit has emerged, and the appeals have gone about 50-50 in favor of both patients and health plans. 
   This brings me to the third major difference between the Democrat and Republican approach, and that is they believe lawsuits are the answer to better care, and we disagree. Good health care is prospective. A lawsuit is retrospective. An adequate external review process helps ensure that HMOs will not arbitrarily deny coverage for benefits. It will make them want to improve the quality of the care and services they provide in the future. A lawsuit, on the other hand, only seeks to shift money around long after the fact, to try to determine who was at fault and how much they owe. At that point, patient care is obsolete. We are talking about fault. I would rather focus on what we can do to give that patient the care when the patient needs it. 
   All one needs to do, if the suggestion is that more lawsuits are the answer, is to look at our current medical malpractice tort system. Many physicians in this country may be upset with the growth of managed care, but most of them are far more concerned with the tidal wave of lawsuits against doctors and other health care providers that we have seen in recent decades. These lawsuits, costing hundreds of billions of dollars, have done little to improve the practice of medicine in America. In fact, I wonder if they do not cause more defensive medicine rather than better care. In fact, in some ways, I think they have alienated the doctor-patient relationship. 
   So look at the range of views here. The Washington Post said last year that expanding lawsuits in this area was probably wrong. The Post wrote:  
   There appears as well to be an impulse among congressional Democrats to make insurers and companies that self-insure liable for damages. The impulse is understandable but the threat of litigation is the wrong way to enforce the rational decisionmaking that everyone claims to have as a goal. The proposed appeals system should be given a tryout. ``First do no harm'' is the rule of medicine. It should be the rule on legislating as well.  
   Mr. President, I know my colleagues across the aisle are trying to address complaints they have heard from their constituents. But rather than again mandating new rules that will drive up the cost of health care, the American people would be much better served with a carefully tailored approach that respects the ability of patients, professionals, and State regulators to make their own decisions about what is best practice in their States and within their communities. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus does just that. It makes sure that HMOs are accountable, without scaring employers away from even offering insurance to their employees. It gives patients rights without encouraging inflationary rises, and empowers health care providers to provide the care their patients need but without Washington having to look over everyone's shoulder. It is the right answer, and it is the right time. 
   Mr. President, I thank the leadership, Senator FRIST, and Senator COLLINS, and those who have worked closely on the task force to make sure we do provide the rights to patients in an affordable way that will not drive up costs and drive people out of the system. That should be our goal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it seems to me in watching the debate yesterday and today, both sides of the aisle want access to better care for every American who is in some form of an HMO or managed care plan. I think we should acknowledge that we do have different approaches on how to get there. 
   We can summarize the differences in three ways: 
   No. 1, we are looking at the costs. Many Members are concerned that if we raise the cost of a premium, a family has worse than a Hobson's choice as our colleagues have complained we are giving them with regard to floor debate. If the cost of health care rises too much, millions of Americans will have no choice at all when they lose their coverage. That has to be a consideration. 
   No. 2, on the issue of who defines the standards, our amendments and our underlying bill put the emphasis on the patient and the physician. They give the patient the right to have an internal appeal and then an external appeal to make sure they get the quality of care the physician believes is best for that patient. 
   No. 3, it is a matter of access to lawsuits. We have to make a fundamental choice: Do you want good care or do you want good lawsuits? That is going to make a big difference in the longevity of the HMOs and their ability to continue to give health care service. 
   Do we need better service? Absolutely. I don't know anyone who hasn't had a complaint about an HMO. That is why I think our approach of an internal review with a time limit, an external, binding review process, again with strict time limits, by medical experts outside of the HMO is far preferable to costly litigation that can take years to resolve. 
   This has been tested. It has been tested in my home State of Texas. We passed an internal and external review process in Texas that has worked for over a year. Part of it has been struck down by a Federal court because they said it was a Federal law that takes precedence over the State law. Some of it has been knocked out. But it was working, and, on a voluntary basis, still is. People were satisfied they had the right to a quick appeal to get the care they needed. About half of the appeals were won by patients and about half by the health insurance companies, which tells me it was probably a pretty fair system. Most people want to have the quality care and a fair, quick system to redress their complaints rather than the ability to sue. Our bill would establish a national system very similar to that passed in Texas, but without creating new incentives to sue. 
   Quality care is prospective; a lawsuit is retrospective. If a person wants good care, they are not as interested in a lawsuit later. They are interested in getting the access that the patient and the physician is seeking. 
   The Snowe-Abraham amendment is a good amendment. It does add to the Robb amendment from yesterday. I think it is a better approach. Our approach, saying we are not going to have any arbitrary time limits on how long a woman can stay in the hospital if she has a mastectomy or a lumpectomy, is a good approach. Everything I have read says the quicker a patient can go home and be cared for at home, the better off they are and the more likely they are to have a quick recovery. However, if you have a problem, a complication in your surgery, we don't want an artificial time limit on the length of the hospital. That is what the amendment of Senator SNOWE and Senator ABRAHAM provides. 
   Secondly, we have heard a lot of discussion this week about whether an OB/GYN would be primary care physician designee for a woman. The underlying Republican bill provides that both OB/GYNs and pediatricians will have direct access to a woman, in the case of the OB/GYN, or for the parent and the child, in the case of a pediatrician. That is very important. 
   We have direct access. It is unnecessary to go through a gatekeeper in the Republican bill to see an OB/GYN physician for an OB/GYN problem; nor does a child who needs to see a pediatrician have to go through a gatekeeper. I think that is very important. 
   I do know a number of women who only go to an OB/GYN and don't have regular checkups, although I have tried to talk my friends into getting regular physical exams. I think it is important to have a full checkup. Nevertheless, many women don't do it. So at the very least, our bill assures that they will have direct access to their OB/  GYN, without going through a gatekeeper. 
   We are approaching this from different standards, there is no question about that. I think our approach is better. They think their approach is better. But I think we need to argue these points based on the merits. I think the Snowe amendment is a good amendment. 
   The issue of clinical trials will come up again. I believe there should be access to clinical trials to be paid for by HMOs, I really do. There is going to be an amendment on that. It will be somewhat different in approach. Again, the difference is going to be on who defines and what the standards are, and I think Senator MACK will have a good amendment that will be better than the Dodd amendment. Just as Senator SNOWE's amendment and Senator ROBB's amendment are very similar, but the differences are real, I think people will be able to make a choice. I think we are going to provide a very strong women's health care amendment with the Snowe amendment that will strengthen women's ability to have direct access to their OB/GYN and have the care they need based on consultations with their physicians, not a Federal rule that would have a one-size-fits-all approach. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator BROWNBACK. 
   Senator ASHCROFT from Missouri, Senator BROWNBACK, I, and many others have been talking about the marriage penalty tax for two sessions, and even a session before that. 
   We were stunned when we discovered 44 percent of married couples in the middle-income brackets--in the $40,000 to $60,000 range--were paying a penalty just for the privilege of being married. 
   We have introduced legislation to cut the marriage tax penalty. In fact, both the House and Senate have tax cut plans that we will be discussing over the next few months to try to determine what we can give back to the hard-working Americans who have been sending their money to Washington to fund our Government. 
   When we start talking about how we are going to give people their money back, I think we have to step back and talk about the basic argument, which is: What do we do with the surplus? And are tax cuts the right way to spend the surplus? 
   I will quote from a Ft. Worth Star-Telegram opinion piece by one of the editorial writers on that newspaper, Bill Thompson, from June 30, 1999. 
   He says there is only one question to ask about the budget surplus, and that is:  
   How should we go about giving the money back to its rightful owners? 
   And the rightful owners, surely even the biggest nitwit in Washington can understand, are the taxpayers of the United States of America. 
   The federal government is not a private business that can do whatever it wants to with unexpected profits.  
   Because, in fact, we are more of a co-op. We are not a business that is trying to make a profit and then decide what to do with the profits.  
   ......[T]here should be no discussion about the fate of the money.......  
   If there is money left over, we give it back to the people who own that money. We in Washington, DC. do not own that money. The people who earned it own it. It is time we start giving them back the money they have earned. 
   We are doing what we should be doing. We are cutting back Government spending, so people can keep more of the money they earn. If we do not give it back to them, we will be abusing the power we have to tax the people. We are talking about giving the money back to the people who earn it, and the first place we ought to look is to people who are married who pay more taxes just because they are married. If they were each single they would be paying lower taxes, but because they got married the average is $1,400 in the marriage penalty tax. That is unconscionable. 
   Since 1969, we have seen the marriage tax penalty get worse and worse and worse. It was not meant to be that way. Congress did not intend to tax married people more. But because more women have gone into the workforce to make ends meet and to do better for  their families, the Tax Code has gotten skewed and the deductions have become unfair. So today we are saying the first priority should be to eliminate the tax that is more on married people than it would be if they were single. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to Senator ASHCROFT, who is working with me on this very important issue. We will give the taxes that people are paying to the Government back to them because it does not belong to us. It belongs to the people who earn it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment about Reverend Lyons, who just opened our Senate session with a prayer, because he is a very special person to me and to the State of Texas and really to all Americans. 
   A little over a year ago, a heinous crime was committed in the small town of Jasper, TX, when James Byrd, Jr., was brutally murdered simply because of his race, dragged to death by three men in a pickup truck. The senseless killing riveted the Nation and many feared the outbreak of civil disorder. But Rev. Kenneth Lyons helped still the troubled waters. He is pastor of Greater New Bethel Baptist Church where James Byrd's family worshipped every Sunday. 
   Pastor Lyons spoke fearlessly to people of all races. He said, ``This must have been a divine wake-up call to the consciences of men. You can't fight fire with fire.'' He urged not vengeance but harmony and peace. 
   Reverend Lyons' wise leadership personified Abraham Lincoln's call to the ``better angels of our nature.'' He helped unite the people of Jasper, TX, in their commitment to equality and justice, to rise above hatred and despair. 
   Millions of Americans watched that small town of Jasper, TX, as it came together because of Reverend Lyons' plea for redemption and healing. Because of his faith and eloquence, we are better people.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope we will be able to allocate the $50 million in the Kyl-Hutchison amendment for the hiring of new Customs agents. 
   We have a terrible situation. I understand the position of Senator CAMPBELL and Senator REID in having to allocate this money. I think they have done a yeoman's job working within the budget constraints. 
   The fact of the matter is, in any budget, any family has to set priorities. This administration has refused to set a priority of protecting our borders from illegal immigration and illegal drugs coming in. The fact is, they asked for no new Border Patrol agents this year, even though Congress has allocated 1,000 new Border Patrol agents every year for 5 years starting 2 years ago. 
   They didn't even hire the allocation in this year's budget. We authorized and paid for 1,000 Border Patrol agents in this year's budget, and this administration has only been able to hire 200 to 400 agents. Since we lose so many, we are worse off than we were when we started this fiscal year. 
   Now we come to Customs agents who are, once again, on the front line, particularly for illegal drugs because they are the ones responsible for searching trucks and cars that come in through the border. Once again, we have a request from the President for zero new Customs agents. The Customs Office itself asked for 617 new Customs agents. Look at what these Customs agents are doing. More than $10 billion in drugs flow across the U.S.-Mexico border each year. Last year, the Customs Service seized 995,000 pounds of marijuana, 148,000 pounds of cocaine, and 3,500 pounds of heroin. 
   We are talking about not fully funding new agents, to not give these people on the front line the help they need in stopping the flow of illegal drugs into our country. In Loredo, TX, the biggest commercial port of entry on our southern border, there were over 1 million truck crossings last year. There are routine waits of 4 to 6 hours. At El Paso's Bridge of the Americas, the hours of operation are from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., but because the Customs Service can't afford to pay overtime, they have to close at 4 so that they will be able to actually finish the people in the pipeline by 5. Trucks entering an import lot after 4 have to wait until 6 the next morning just to have their documentation cleared. This is hurting not only our ability to curb illegal traffic, but it is also hurting trade and free trade and ratcheting up the cost of goods coming in from the border. So it is very important that we look at Customs agents as the front line for getting illegal drugs stopped at our country's borders.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, I was thinking as we were talking about this, and as the Senator was making his point, perhaps we could look for offsets within Customs' budget, as well as some of these other areas. We would like to pass the amendment, but we also would like to maybe look for other ways that Senator KYL and I could set priorities within the Customs Department budget and maybe work something out that would not hurt another agency as much but we reprioritize within the budget.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate floor the bill making appropriations for the government of the District of Colombia for fiscal year 2000. This bill is largely the result of the cooperation between Mayor Williams, the city council, and the Financial Control Board. As a result of the hard work of locally elected officials, the Congress and the Financial Control Board, we begin to see signs of a healthier financial picture in the District. 
   At the end of fiscal year 1998, the District boasted an annual surplus of $445 million. This surplus allowed the District to eliminate the accumulated deficit. 
   Having paid that off, the District still realized a $112 million positive fund balance. The District is projecting a $282 million fund balance by the end of this year, which is 6 percent of the gross budget. The District's healthy fund balance and improved economic forecasts have helped the District achieve investment grade bond ratings on Wall Street, which will save the District millions in borrowing costs. One of the important provisions in the committee bill creates a mechanism that will help improve this situation even more. I am looking toward a higher bond rating for the city than the level at which it now rests. 
   While the economic condition of the District is improving, service delivery in our Nation's Capital still has a way to go. The public school system is still in serious condition. Chief among these concerns are recent reports of convicted felons walking away from district-run halfway houses and committing violent crimes. The District government will not be able to attract new families, middle-class families, to the city unless its streets are safe, the schools are effective, and its tax 
   structure is competitive with surrounding jurisdictions. 
   Despite these problems, the budget moves the city in the correct direction, and I think we are making great progress. The subcommittee has adopted the District's consensus budget with a few modifications. These are the few: 
   We have again required the District to hold a $150 million reserve fund, and there are tight restrictions on the use of the reserve fund. It can now serve as a true ``rainy day'' fund for the city. In addition, we require the District to hold a 4-percent budget surplus. The combination of the reserve and the required surplus will give the District a solid financial cushion that is slightly above what other major cities hold, but it is appropriate for the District in order to improve its bond rating. Any funds above the 4-percent surplus are directed to be used in this manner: No less than half for debt reduction, no more than half for spending on nonrecurring expenses. 
   Currently, the District spends 13 percent of its budget servicing its debt. The highest normal ratio for a city is 10 percent. The reforms envisioned by this bill would bring this more in line with other cities. 
   The city's debt was at one time so bad that it was not even rated by the major agencies. The city's bond rating is now investment grade, although it is the lowest rank of investment grade. I think this budget will start the process by which that rating will be upgraded. This is so important for the District to save millions in borrowing costs in the future. 
   In addition, our budget has education reform. The committee has provided $17 million for the D.C. College Tuition Assistance Program, subject to authorization. I will wait and talk about that a little more when Senator DURBIN discusses it as well. 
   We have also addressed the issue of charter schools in the city. Many believe that charter schools are an important force for improving education in the city. Our bill adopts the D.C. City Council program to ensure that pupils in both public schools and charter schools receive the same amount of funding. This way, charter schools will remain an education alternative for students in the District. 
   Everyone knows crime in the District is still too high. We have provided $5.8 million for drug testing of people on probation. This has worked in other cities and we hope it will bring down the crime rate in the District of Columbia as well. We provided $1 million to the D.C. police to combat open-air drug markets. This was a special concern expressed by Senator DURBIN, and I think a correct one. These are dens of criminal activity that ruin a neighborhood and spread drugs to children. This money we hope will be used to start wiping out those open-air drug markets. 
   We have also permitted the District to use economic development funds that we appropriated last year to be used for local tax relief for commercial revitalization. Rebuilding or refurbishing a blighted neighborhood is the most important thing we can do to bring it back into the economic mainstream and keep it safe. The District has found just recently, as the landlord of a number of abandoned properties, that such properties are a magnet for crime and drug use. So these funds can be used for revitalization and public/private partnerships. 
   The committee tried to address the concerns of the mayor and the council. We certainly intend to improve the education system in the District. We are not where we want to be to make 
   the Capital City the very best city in the whole United States, the beacon for what America is, but we are heading in that direction. It is the goal of Congress to make sure that our Capital City is one that all Americans feel they own and they can be proud of. 
   I am pleased the Appropriations Committee reported this bill unanimously and look forward to working through the conference with Senator DURBIN, my ranking member, who has been very cooperative and helpful in getting a bill through that will address the needs the District has and provide for those needs.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to Senator DURBIN's arguments on his amendment, and I have to say I am pleased that he is withdrawing the amendment, because I think his amendment is absolutely flat wrong. 
   Let's talk about what would give kids a chance in the District of Columbia. A better education system would give kids a better chance in the District of Columbia. We are funding health care for children in this District with the Federal programs that are available throughout our country. We are providing better support for education--well, we are not providing it; in fact, I think the District is providing it, and I think they are doing a good job. They are saying that charter schools should be given a chance, that if a child cannot be given a good public education in this system and that child chooses to go to a charter school, they will have an equal allocation of resources as if they were going to a public school--which a charter school is. 
   So the District is addressing education, because they want their kids to have a chance. We are putting more in crime prevention in this bill, in crime control, because we do think it is important to clean up neighborhoods. But a very important part of cleaning up neighborhoods is the tax cuts the District consensus budget envisions. 
   Now, the Senator from Illinois refers to these as giving away $59 million. Well, first of all, I don't think income tax cuts are giving money away. They are letting people who earn the money keep more of what they earn. Now, why would we support the District's decision to do that? Because the District is trying to clean up the neighborhoods, to do exactly what the Senator from Illinois wants to do--that is, have safe and clean neighborhoods throughout the District of Columbia. 
   The way they are doing this is with, I think, a quite balanced tax cut program. The tax cuts for business will attract business into the city. This city needs more business investment. It is a government city. There isn't much commercial activity. The commercial activity will clean up property. It will provide jobs. It will have economic viability. But it will also have more investment in beautification of the city. 
   Attracting business through tax cuts is something that is being done all over this country by cities that are trying to be progressive and improve their quality of life. 
   The tax cuts on the income tax side are so modest that I don't see how anyone could possibly disagree with them. People in the District who make $10,000 pay 6 percent in income taxes, and it would be lowered to 4 percent. It also gives breaks to the middle-income families that we want to be able to live in the District. 
   We want to have a full range of families able to live in the District, and we are trying to support the District's efforts to do exactly that--to make this a family-friendly city. 
   That is why it is so incredible that we would have any opposition to the tuition assistance plan, because one of the factors that a family uses to choose where it lives is the higher education potential for their children. I have had people tell me that it is like getting a $25,000-a-year pay raise to move to Texas because in-State tuition at Texas University is so low. I mean, it is ridiculously low. It is about $1,000. 
   So a person moving to Texas getting a first-rate education from the University of Texas, Texas A&M, all of our colleges, and universities that are rated in the top 10, top 20, in many fields, have a good bargain. 
   But what about a child who is growing up in the District of Columbia? They don't have a State university where they have an equal opportunity to go with in-State tuition because people are paying taxes to that State. This bill gives them that equal chance. This bill will equalize out-of-State tuition costs for D.C. students. So if they qualify to go to the University of Maryland, or the University of Virginia, or I hope the University of Texas, they will be able to have that added tuition they would have as an out-of-State student with these tuition assistance programs. 
   I think it is part of the overall strategy of the District to make this city family friendly. They are making every attempt in the budget they presented to us to give them a better chance for education at the grade school, middle school, and high school level. This bill gives them the chance to have out-of-State tuition lowered to in-State tuition, where they would qualify anywhere in the country. 
   This bill gives them more in crime prevention, more in crime control, and it says to businesses: We want you to come to the District, we want you to make an investment in the District, because we want to clean up the neighborhoods; and we know it is going to take a public-private partnership to do it. 
   But I think this bill is quite balanced. I think the District has done a terrific job in trying to use the money it has--both the Federal budget side and the local budget side--to do what is necessary to attract families back into the District to live, and to keep the families that are here living 
   here. If they don't do something about the income tax rate, they are never going to attract people, because the income tax rates on either side of them in Maryland and Virginia are half of what they are in the District. 
   I think the Mayor and the council should be commended for saying: We are going to make our city attractive, we are going to do it in a balanced way, and we are going to meet the needs of the children in the District. But every city in the country is looking for ways to make their cities attractive. 
   I am going to support the District in their efforts to make this city attractive for families. I am going to continue to work with Senator DURBIN to try to make sure we are funding crime control in open air drug markets. I am going to continue to work with the District in trying to give charter schools a chance, if public education isn't serving the needs of individual children. 
   Let's give competition a chance. I think the District has been quite progressive in doing that in their budget. 
   I defend the tax cuts. I defend the tuition assistance program, which has bipartisan support, and the support of the President and the support of the District. I think we are going to see this city turn around. 
   I am going to support the council in every way I can when I think they are going in the right direction. I think they are going in the right direction with tuition assistance. I hope Congress will authorize this program so we can put it into effect for the next university year. 
   I think we will see a lot of activity in the District with people wanting to come here, stay here, and raise their families here. That will be good for every American, because a safe city, a clean city, and a city that has a low crime rate is going to be a city that every American wants to bring their families to visit as our Capital City. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think that was a very special statement made by the Senator from West Virginia, and I appreciate very much that he loves this Capitol and the seat of Government for all Americans. The fact that he spent 7 years on the Appropriations Committee chairing this subcommittee means that there was a lot of attention and a lot of care paid to this city. 
   I think he is right. I think we need to make sure this is a job well done. This is every bit as important as what I do for my constituents in Texas, because this is part of what I do for my constituents in Texas, and that is to make this the city that we all want it to be. 
   I am very pleased the Senator recognized Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. I was going to do that as well, because Delegate NORTON is so interested in everything that applies to the District and she is always there, making sure that her constituents are represented. I have been very pleased to work with her and talk to her about these issues that affect her constituents. I hope she knows that all of us look at this Capital City as all America's city, which does give it a very special place in everyone's heart and means that all of us are going to take a special interest in making it a great city.

They have done a wonderful job making sure that all the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted and the agreements are made and the agreements to disagree are put on the table. They have done a wonderful job. 
   On my staff, my legislative director Jim Hyland and Robb Woodson, who is the legislative assistant who has done so much to try to make sure that this is a very good and solid bill supporting the District of Columbia. 
   With that, Mr. President, I thank everyone for a job well done and appreciate once again Senator DURBIN's cooperation. We have had a great relationship. We have agreed to disagree on some issues, but I think he speaks from the heart, and I understand, even when we disagree, that we want the same goal. For that reason, I know we will have a good bill to come back out of conference for the Senate to adopt, and then we will continue to work with the District government to make sure our views are implemented and their views are implemented. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. 
   I appreciate Senator BROWNBACK giving me a little time to talk about this, because I think it is a very important issue. There are a number of American investments being made in Azerbaijan right now. There are a number of American jobs that will be dependent on our keeping a good relationship with Azerbaijan. 
   I have been able to visit Azerbaijan. I was there at the same time as the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. He knows this issue very well. 
   I look at this a different way. I talked to the President of Azerbaijan while I was in his country and then when he visited our country to sign agreements with several American companies to do business in his country. It is of utmost concern to him that we are beginning to make investments in his country. He welcomes us. He wants to do business with us. Yet we have sanctions on his country because of internal conflicts. 
   This is not a policy that is evenhandedly put forward by our country. We do business with other countries where we don't agree with the way they are treating certain people within their own country. There are border disputes with other countries, but we don't put sanctions on them in order to impose our will. 
   I hope Senator BROWNBACK's amendment will pass, at least this part of the amendment, because I think it is important that we send a message to the President of Azerbaijan and to the people of Azerbaijan that we want to be partners with them, that it is an important relationship to this country, and that we should continue to be able to help them work out this internal problem. But I don't think imposing our will on them is the right thing to do. 
   Senator BROWNBACK is trying to give the President the ability to maneuver in the interest of the United States. I think it is a reasonable request. It is a good amendment. I hope that the Senate will support it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to vote for this bill but I can't. I want to because I think part of the steel industry has a legitimate case. But I can't because voting for this bill would make it worse than the relief they seek. 
   We have GATT. We have WTO. We have NAFTA. We have access to accountability. However, the administration is not allowing that to go forward. We have to stay within the system. We have to play by the rules. 
   The reason we are debating this is because we haven't had the administration firmly coming forward and saying the steel industry has a legitimate gripe. They do. 
   I support the Finance Committee approach to it which says we are going to stick by the rules, and we need to enforce them vigorously.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for allowing me 2 minutes. I was introducing a judicial candidate and was not able to come earlier. 
   I thank the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the committee, for the great help he has given to many of us who particularly have strong water needs in our States. 
   I particularly want to mention the Port of Houston. The Port of Houston is the second largest port in the Nation, and it is the largest in foreign tonnage. It is the largest container port. We have the largest petrochemical complex in the entire world. 
   It is very important that our port be competitive. This bill will fully fund the dredging of that port, which is the last port in America that has not gone under 40 feet. This will take us to 45. 
   It is a very important bill. 
   I think both Senator DOMENICI and Senator LEAHY have done a great job on this bill, but particularly I appreciate the support for this great Port of Houston and the efforts that were made to continue this dredging project that will help us in trade and help us remain competitive in the world market. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   This amendment requires that the President and the Department of Defense come forward and report on the missions we have throughout the world. 
   One thing that has become very clear to me as I have visited with our troops--whether it is in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, whether it is in Bosnia or in Albania just 2 weeks ago--is that our troops are overdeployed. 
   Secretary Bill Cohen said in testimony just last week to the Defense Appropriations Committee that we have either too few people or too many missions. The fact is that this is beginning to show the wear and tear on our military. Between 1986 and 1998, the number of American military deployments per year nearly tripled at the same time that the Department of Defense budget was reduced by 38 percent. There is no question that our military is stretched. No one disagrees with that. 
   The Department of Defense is asking for help. Congress realizes that this is a problem and has continually tried to increase the military spending, including pay raises for our military to give them more chances to live a quality of life. But the fact is that we have to do something about either overdeployment or too few numbers. In fact, our present military strategy is to deter and defeat large-scale cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in an overlapping timeframe. 
   We have the deterrence of Iraq and Iran in southwest Asia and the deterrence of North Korea in northeast Asia. That represents two such potentially large-scale cross-border theater requirements. In addition to that, we have 120,000 troops permanently assigned to those theaters and 70,000 in addition to that assigned to non-NATO, nonspecific-threat foreign countries. The United States has more than 6,000 in Bosnia-Herzegovina and many others around the world. What we need to do is to start to prioritize where our missions are and where American troops should be deployed. 
   On May 27 of this year, the Secretary of the Air Force announced a stop-loss program that places a temporary hold on transfers, separation, and retirement from the Air Force. This is a decision that is normally reserved for wartime or severe conflicts. And, yet, we now have in place that no one can separate from the Air Force. 
   My amendment says it is the sense of Congress that the readiness of our U.S. military forces to execute the national security strategy is being eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and expanded mission. It says to the President that we must have a report that prioritizes ongoing global missions, that the President shall include a report on the feasibility and analysis of how the United States can shift resources from low-priority missions in support of high-priority missions, and consolidate the use of U.S. troop commitments worldwide, and end low-priority missions. This is a report that the President would make through the Department of Defense to prioritize these missions. 
   I believe the Department of Defense has been looking for this type of opportunity to prioritize and to say we are going to look at the wear and tear on our military and we are going to have to make some final decisions. 
   I think when we get this report we will be able to see if, in fact, we need more military and we need to ``ramp up'' the military force strength in our country or whether we can prioritize the overseas missions and stop the overdeployment and the mission fatigue that so many of our military people have. 
   I am very pleased to offer this amendment. I think it is a step in the right direction. It is a positive step toward relieving our very stretched military. Certainly, as we are watching events unfold in Kosovo and we are seeing more and more of our military being called up, I think it is time for  Members to assess everywhere we are in the world and ask the President to prioritize those. Then Congress can work with the President to determine if we need to ramp up our military force structure or ramp down the number of deployments that we have around the world. 
   I ask that the amendment be agreed to.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator LAUTENBERG. The purpose of this amendment is to encourage the Secretaries of each military department to give due consideration to providing a higher priority to the officers from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for attendance at our military schools and training programs. Our professional military schools and training programs including the service academies, the senior service colleges and the command and general staff colleges provide an outstanding opportunity for these officers to become fully immersed in our military doctrine and develop a deeper understanding for the American military culture. As new member nations of NATO, it is important that the officers of these countries become fully integrated as quickly as possible. The professional friendships and the mutual understanding which results from attendance at these courses is invaluable for both American officers and for foreign military officers. 
   I recently led a Congressional delegation to the Balkans. In Budapest we met with Hungarian Chief of Defense Staff, General Ferenc Vegh, who was proud to inform the delegation that he was a graduate of the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. As a direct result of the professional association gained as a student at the War College, General Vegh has been key in directing Hungary's rapid integration into NATO. His story is simply one example among many of how the United States and the NATO Alliance has reaped an enormous benefit by providing the opportunity for foreign officer attendance at our military schools. 
   Attendance at our service academies on a priority basis will also provide an outstanding opportunity for future officers from our new NATO allies to foster long-term relationships with future U.S. military leaders. Historically, the relationships fostered through attendance at the Military Academy, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy among American and foreign cadets over the four-year curriculum at the service academies have formed the basis for closer long-term military-to-military relations. Numerous foreign cadets who have graduated from our service academies have gone on to serve at the very highest levels as military and civilian leaders, including many heads of state. 
   It is my expectation that this legislation will encourage the Secretaries of our military departments to give the officers and cadets from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, our new NATO allies, a priority for attendance at our professional military schools and academies.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this resolution, submitted by Senator FEINSTEIN and I, commemorates the Tenth Anniversary of the National Race for the Cure. We are pleased to be joined by over 40 other Senators, including Majority Leader LOTT and Minority Leader DASCHLE. 
   Mr. President, on June 5, 1999, the National Race for the Cure will take place in Washington, D.C. This will be the Tenth Anniversary of this Race--that has drawn national attention and thousands of volunteers and runners. 
   All are united by one goal--to eradicate breast cancer from our lives. 
   The Resolution we are introducing today will designate June 5th as National Race for the Cure Day. 
   This Race has very special meaning for me. The Race for the Cure was started by the Susan G. Komen Foundation which is located in my hometown, Dallas, Texas. 
   The Susan G. Komen Foundation was founded in 1982 by Nancy Brinker. The Foundation honors her sister, Susan Komen, who tragically died of breast cancer at the young age of 36. Nancy promised herself that she would fulfill Suzy's plea to help others confronted with this disease. 
   The mission of the Foundation is to eradicate breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing research, education, screening and treatment. 
   Nancy Brinker's pledge to her sister has grown to be a major factor in fighting breast cancer. The Foundation has 35,000 volunteers and 106 offices across the United States. 
   The Komen Foundation's Grant Program is regarded as one of the most innovative in funding breast cancer research today. The Komen Foundation has financed 325 grants at 72 institutions in 25 states. 
   The Foundation's most public event, however, has become the Race for the Cure. The Race for the Cure has become the largest series of Five Kilometer Runs in the world. 
   The Race series stated as one event in Texas with 800 participants. But, this year, there will be 98 races across the United States with over 700,000 people participating. 
   The Komen Foundation and the Race for the Cure have raised over $136 million for breast cancer research. 
   On June 5th, the National Race for the Cure will celebrate its tenth anniversary. It is the largest of the Races across the U.S. In fact, there are more than 50,000 entrants already signed up for this race. 
   This resolution commemorates the Tenth Anniversary and it designates June 5th as National Race for the Cure Day. 
   Mr. President, I think it is fitting that the Senate recognize this unique day. 
   Breast cancer is the leading cause of death of women between the ages of 35 and 54. A woman in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer every three minutes, and every 12 minutes a woman will die of breast cancer. 
   The Race for the Cure is one day, when Americans of all walks of life, can come together united in a great cause to wipe out this terrible disease.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. 
   I thank the Senator from Kansas for pursuing this, because I do think it is a very important amendment. I think it is very important that we ask the President to come forward and tell us if this new Strategic Concept we have all been reading imposes a new commitment or obligation on the United States. 
   The original NATO treaty, the whole treaty, is very clear. It is a defensive alliance. That has never been questioned until what is happening today in Kosovo, which is clearly not defensive. It is offensive. NATO has started airstrikes on a sovereign nation that is not a member of NATO. So I think it is, before our eyes, evolving into a new Strategic Concept for NATO, and I think we most certainly must have the right to approve it. It is an addition to a treaty obligation that was made 40-plus years ago. 
   Now, I am not necessarily against NATO having an offensive part of a treaty obligation, but I am absolutely certain that the Senate must approve this kind of added obligation and that we not walk away from the very important concept that a treaty sets out certain obligations and it is required to be ratified by Congress. And most certainly, we must ratify the changing of a treaty obligation from a defensive alliance to an offensive alliance. 
   There is no question that the founders of our country chose to make it difficult to declare war. They chose to make it difficult to declare war by giving the right to Congress. They could have given it to the President, but they were going away from the English system, where the King declared war and implemented the same war. They wanted a division of responsibility, and they wanted it to be difficult to put our troops in harm's way. Indeed, every President we have had has said that it should be difficult to put our troops in harm's way; perhaps until this President, that is. 
   So it is important that we pass this amendment and that the President certify that we either do have a new obligation or we do not. I think we do, and I think we need to debate it. 
   As I said, I am not against NATO having some offensive responsibilities. I do question that they have in our NATO treaty the right to do what they are doing right now. I think we need to debate it, and I think we need to clarify exactly what would be in a new offensive strategy that would be a part of a NATO treaty obligation of the United States of America. 
   I can see a role for NATO that would declare that we have security interests that are common and that we would be able to determine what those common security interests are and that we would fight them together, stronger than any of us could fight independently. I do not know that Kosovo meets that test, but I think others certainly do believe that. I do believe that a Desert Storm does meet the test or Kim Jong-Il, with nuclear capabilities, does meet that test. 
   Mr. President, I support the amendment, and I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment. I think it is incumbent on the Senate to stand up for our constitutional responsibility and that is what this amendment does. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the emergency appropriations bill because it is an emergency, it is necessary. I have been reading all of the press reports about the bill and criticisms of the bill because it is too large or perhaps too much money has been spent on one area or another. But the fact is, we have emergencies in our country that are not covered by the budget. We have had more emergencies in our agriculture area than we ever could have foreseen. You can't pick up the paper that you don't read about a terrible tragic tornado, and we are coming into hurricane season. So we are putting more money into FEMA. We have had floods in my home State. We must deal with these as they occur, and clearly on an emergency basis. 
   A good part of this bill is for agriculture. We are also helping our neighbors in Central America who were ravaged with a terrible hurricane and tornadoes. We are trying to do the things we have promised we would do. But since we started this emergency appropriation, we have also had a new emergency, and that is the situation in Kosovo. We are seeing, every day, what is happening there. 
   Mr. President, it is no secret that I have spoken out strongly against the way we got into this Kosovo operation. I have spoken out against going into an operation when we didn't have a good contingency plan. I have spoken out against so much of our policy in the Balkans. I just came back from the Balkans, just over the weekend, and I met with our soldiers on the airfield in Albania, the ones who are going to be supporting our humanitarian effort and, hopefully, be part of our defenses there, whatever we may do. I went to Aviano, Italy, and met with the troops who are doing so many of these air operations that we are seeing day after day after day. And, of course, there is no question that our troops are doing a great job. They don't make the policy; they just do the mission they are  given. Nobody can question their sincerity, their great attitude, and their commitment to our country. You will never meet a young man or woman in the military who isn't there because they love our country. 
   So when I think about this supplemental appropriation--and I know I have spoken against the mission itself, the way it has come about--and I remember looking into the eyes of the young men and women who are on the front line, I think, now, can I vote not to give the money to them to have the equipment they need to do the training they need, to have the incentives that they need to be doing a very tough job in a very tough neighborhood? Well, the answer is no, I can't vote against paying for their security, because they are the security for me and my family and for every one of us who is lucky enough to live in the greatest country on Earth. 
   So they have volunteered to give their lives so that we may live in freedom. Do you think for one minute I would vote not to give them the equipment they need to do that job? It would be unthinkable. So while we debate how we pay for it or who is responsible, in the end, I am going to vote for this bill, because I am going to support the troops who are in the field. 
   I am going to continue to argue with the administration 
   that we need to learn the lessons about how this operation has been handled, and I think we will. I think there is a glimmer of hope that perhaps Mr. Milosevic has seen that we are going to win and prolonging it will only hurt his own people. So there is a glimmer of hope, and a glimmer of hope is better than total darkness. I think we need to seize on that glimmer of hope and try to come to the first agreement that we must have from Mr. Milosevic--that he will stop the atrocities against the people of Kosovo. 
   I just visited with the people of Kosovo. I visited with them in Macedonia. I visited with them in Albania. Those people have been through more than any one of us will ever know or understand. What I want now is the atrocities to stop for the ones who are still there. The ones we met with are in refugee camps. They are not comfortable, but they are safe. I want to try to help the people who are still in Kosovo, and the atrocities on them to stop so that we can then allow the people who have fled their country in terror to be able to go back in and rebuild their homes, rebuild their economy, so that they will be able to have a livelihood, so that they will be able to raise their children in their homeland without fear of a despot who would commit the atrocities that there is no question in my mind have been committed in the last 6 months and, indeed, for many years in this part of the world. 
   So, Mr. President, while we are debating policy, while we are debating from where the money is going to come all of which is legitimate debate, while we are talking to each other about our principles, which is our right to do, but at the end of the day, it is most important that we have the emergency appropriations which would give our kids who are on the front line and their commanders everything they need so as to know that we are not going to pull the rug out from under them, that they will have the equipment, they will have the airplanes, they will have the helicopters for their own security while they are protecting yours and mine. 
   So let's talk policy. Let's talk about never going into an operation like this again without a contingency plan. Let's talk about the treasure we have spent in this country to try to solve this problem. And let's not stop with Kosovo, because the money and the troops that we have put in harm's way cannot be lost for us to put a Band-Aid on Kosovo. Let's finish this job now. 
   But when we have stopped the atrocities and when the Serb troops have started leaving Kosovo, and when an international peacekeeping force moves in, let's take the opportunity, let's seize the moment to do something bigger than putting a Band-Aid on Kosovo. Let's look at the Balkans and do what we can to try to help them form areas of government that have to change so that those people will be able to have jobs, start farming their land, to live in security. That is what I want for the Balkans. 
   But continuing to say we can amalgamate the Balkans as if they were America is not going to have a long-term chance for success, because we don't understand what they have just been through in the last 5 years. We don't understand what it would be like to force people to live next door to each other when their mothers have been raped, when their fathers have been brutally murdered, when their families have had to flee in terror. 
   Let's start today by supporting our troops. Let's start today by keeping open the glimmer of hope for peace. And then let's take one step at a time to try to help these people become a contributing part of Europe so that they can do what every one of us wants to do; that is, live in peace and freedom, to have jobs, to support our families, and to give our kids a better chance than we have. That is what the Kosovar Albanians want. It is what the Serbs want. They are the good people of Serbia--not President Milosevic. That is what the Moslems in Bosnia want. That is what the Croats want. It is what the Albanians want. And they should be able to have it. That should be our goal. 
   I am going to support this bill. I am not going to say there are not legitimate differences about certain parts of it. Sure there are. That is why 100 of us are elected independently to represent the views we have--the views of our States. But we are required to come together. I hope the Senate will do the right thing and come together to do what is right for the farmers who are hurting, for the people in Central America who are hurting, for the people in the Balkans who are hurting, to help promote peace in the Middle East, and to continue to appreciate that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. We need to make sure we keep the security and the freedom of our country on our watch. 
   It is our responsibility to pass this bill and talk about the policy and talk about our differences, and our Constitution that provided that we do this. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senator DURBIN, the IRA Rollover to Charity Act of 1999. This legislation has the support of numerous charitable organizations across the United States. The effect of this bill would be to unlock billions of dollars in savings Americans hold and make them available to charity. 
   Mr. President, the legislation will allow individuals to roll assets from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) into a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring any income tax consequences. Thus, the donation would be made to charity without ever withdrawing it as income and paying tax on it. 
   Americans hold well over $1 trillion in assets in IRAs. Nearly half of America's families have IRAs. Recent studies show that assets of qualified retirement plans comprise a substantial part of the net worth of many persons. Many individuals would like to give a portion of these assets to charity. 
   Under current law, if an IRA is transferred into a charitable remainder trust, donors are required to recognize all such income. Therefore, absent the changes called for in the legislation, the donor will have taxable income in the year the gift is funded. The IRA Rollover to Charity Act lifts the disincentives contained in our complicated and burdensome tax code and will unleash a critical source of funding for our nation's charities. This is a common sense way to remove obstacles to private charitable giving. 
   Under the legislation, upon reaching age 59 1/2 , an individual could move assets penalty-free from an IRA directly to charity or into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan--e.g. charitable reminder trusts, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In the latter case the donor would be able to receive an income stream from the retirement plan assets, which would be taxed according to normal rules. Upon the death of the individual, the remainder would be transferred to charity. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Senate will join in this effort to provide a valuable new source of philanthropy for our nation's charities. This legislation has the support of numerous universities and charitable groups, including the Charitable Accord, an umbrella organization representing more than 1,000 organizations and associations. 
   Mr. President, I have just returned from the Balkans. I have seen first hand the wonderful work that is being done by charitable groups in dealing with the massive refugee crisis that has occurred there. As terrible as this crisis has been, it would be worse if not for the great work that is being done by charitable groups. Our bill will help direct additional resources to those charities and thousands of others. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, the Domestic Energy Production Security and Stabilization Act. This bill represents a necessary and workable proposal to ensure that the United States does not lose even more of its energy independence. 
   Mr. President, the oil and gas industry in this country is in a state of unprecedented crisis. Over the last year-and-a-half, oil and gas prices have been a historic lows. This has led to the closing of over 200,000 domestic oil and gas wells, has brought new exploration to a virtual standstill, and has cost an estimated quarter of a million American jobs. 
   Not only is this an economic issue, it is also a national security issue. We are importing more oil than we produce. This is not a healthy situation for shaping our foreign policy agenda. If our domestic industry is to survive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax incentives to encourage energy production in America. 
   To reverse these trends and increase our energy independence, I have worked on a bipartisan basis to develop the Domestic Energy Production Security and Stabilization Act. The bill provides tax incentives in our significant areas to ensure that our domestic energy infrastructure is not decimated during prolonged periods of low energy prices. 
   First, the legislation would provide a $3 dollar a barrel tax credit, on the first three barrels that can offset the cost of keeping marginal wells operating during periods of critically low oil and gas prices. Marginal wells are those that produce 15 barrels a day or less. There are close to 500,000 such wells across the U.S. that collectively produce 20 percent of America's oil, more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia. 
   Second, the bill would provide some relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT), again during prolonged periods of low energy prices. In a time of financial crisis for the oil and gas industry, this tax has had the effect of exacerbating the impact of low commodity prices and driving even more producers out of business. The AMT was enacted to ensure that companies reporting large financial income paid at least some level of taxes. Unfortunately, for the oil and gas industry, the AMT has only served to make a bad situation worse. 
   Third, Mr. President, this legislation would change the net income limitation on percentage depletion by eliminating the 65 percent taxable income limitation. Carried-over percentage depletion could also be carried back ten years. This would enable companies to fully utilize their percentage depletion allowance, which many have not been able to do since the onset of the oil and gas crisis. 
   Finally, Mr. President, this bill brings the U.S. Tax Code in line with the present-day realities of the oil and gas industry by allowing oil and gas exploration (geological and geophysical) costs to be expensed rather than capitalized, and by allowing delay rental lease payments to be deducted in the year in which they are paid, rather than when the oil is actually pumped. Even the Treasury Department has tacitly endorsed these proposed changes as making for sound economic and tax policy. 
   Taken together, these four major tax provisions will help the job-creating oil and gas sector of the economy to withstand the volatility of the international oil and gas markets. We simply must not allow our nation to become even more dependent on foreign oil. Nor can we afford to shut-down our domestic gas production capability, particularly since natural gas consumption is expected to grow rapidly in the near future, and, unlike oil, natural gas is not imported. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue, and I appreciate the support of Senator BREAUX and my other colleagues who are cosponsoring the bill. Most importantly, I urge my other colleagues, particularly those from non-energy producing states, to join with us in supporting this effort. America simply has too much at stake to stand by and let our domestic oil and gas industry jobs and infrastructure be lost to the whims of the world markets.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I, too, thank my colleagues, Senator MCCAIN and Senator BIDEN, for having principle, for stating their principle very forcefully, even though I disagree with what they are trying to do with the resolution that is before us today. 
   I think every Member of this body has the responsibility to address this issue, to say what we think, and to back that up with action. In fact, I have to say that I was stunned, after the House action last week, that some Members came forward and said, ``Oh, this is partisan.'' 
   Madam President, this is not partisan. There are Members from both sides of the aisle who have very differing views on this. I would never say that someone who does not vote with me is partisan or is coming to this debate with anything other than their own conscience. 
   So I am going to speak from my conscience and my heart. I am against this resolution. I am not against it procedurally; I am against it on the merits. I respect everyone who is on either side of this issue, and I think we need to have the debate. I think we need to take an action that would turn us in a different direction from the course we are on in Kosovo today. 
   Madam President, I have to take a moment of personal privilege and say that I was stunned to pick up my paper on Saturday and read that one of my constituents, Larry Joyce, had died on Friday. Friday night, when I was speaking to a group, I was talking about Larry Joyce--not knowing that he had passed away--because Larry Joyce is one of my heroes. He has had an indelible impression on me. 
   He was watching this debate and this issue very closely, because Larry Joyce was a decorated Vietnam veteran who lost his son in Somalia. Sergeant Casey Joyce was one of the great Army Rangers who lost his life in his first mission as an Army Ranger. When Larry Joyce told me his story, I invited him to come and testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have to say, he gave the most compelling testimony that I have heard in all of my time on that wonderful committee. 
   Larry Joyce was a hero. He was a patriot. He was very concerned about this Kosovo issue. I wish he were alive to see this issue all the way through, because he certainly had a lot to say that was important. 
   This resolution is wrong for a lot of reasons. It is the wrong time--through no fault of the authors of the resolution because they could not have known, when they introduced this resolution in the Senate, that we would have the release of our American prisoners over the weekend. 
   Of course, all of us were so thrilled when on Saturday we heard that President Milosevic had agreed to release the prisoners, and then on Sunday, when many of us were waking up, we heard the news that they had already been released. 
   I was proud to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales in my home State of Texas on their way to Frankfurt yesterday, and there weren't two more relieved people in the whole United States of America than they were. 
   This release does give us a narrow window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution. I think it is wrong to pass a resolution on the floor of the Senate saying escalate the intensity of this campaign. That is the wrong message. Instead, I call on President Clinton to take bold action, open a door for discussion with President Milosevic, set a timetable, require that there be immediate cessation of any hostilities toward Kosovars of Albanian extraction, and ask Mr. Milosevic if he will agree to come to the table and talk about a peace. 
   This is a window. If it fails, what have we lost? Set a timetable, 5 days. Do you think we could lose 5 days in bombing to save maybe hundreds of lives, maybe thousands of lives, maybe years of conflict? I think it is worth a try. I call on the President today to do just that, take a bold step. This is the opportunity for President Clinton to see if President Milosevic is serious. If he is, talking does not hurt, and it just may help. 
   The resolution is wrong for other reasons. Those who offer this resolution believe it is necessary because Congress has a responsibility to act. I don't think this resolution is an exercise of responsibility. I think it is an abdication of responsibility. It tells the President, in so many words, don't bother us anymore with this war. Congress doesn't want to know what your plan is. We don't want to know what it is going to cost. We don't want to know  from you what the exit strategy is. Congress doesn't want to authorize the use of ground forces. In short, we are saying, President Clinton, go fix it and don't bother us, send us the bill. 
   I reject that view of taking responsibility for Congress. I think we do have a responsibility to say what we think. If we have learned one lesson from Vietnam, it should be that Congress must take the responsibility that is given it by the Constitution and not let something go on and on and on, when we know we are going in the wrong direction. 
   In 1964, the Senate passed what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. That resolution urged President Johnson to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression in Southeast Asia. The debate on the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was much of the same debate we are hearing today--concern about whether our allies were dragging us into a war that wasn't ours; concern about whether they would accept enough of their responsibility; concern about cost; concern about whether we were actually declaring war, but being too timid to do it; and there was concern about escalation. 
   We know what happened. Over the next 10 years, every one of us can tell what happened. Congress abdicated its responsibility. They let the war go on and on and on, and we lost 59,000 Americans because Congress did not stand up and say, wait a minute, we are going in the wrong direction, let's do something about it. 
   I am not going to abdicate my responsibility. If I were the only vote in this body, I would vote against this resolution on the merits right now. That is not to say that I would not welcome the President coming to Congress and telling us what he wants, but he has not asked for more force. He has not submitted a plan. He has not stated goals with which I could agree. 
   Why would we take an action that would give him more authority to use more force at exactly the wrong time? The President had not submitted a plan when the Senate voted to authorize the air operation, and that is why I voted no. At the time, we were told 
   the operation would deter President Milosevic from hurting the Kosovar Albanians. When the bombing began, we all know that he escalated the atrocities against those poor people. That is not our fault. I would never blame us for that. But it is our fault that we didn't have a contingency plan. 
   I would never compound that problem by giving the President more authority to send our troops in on the ground and put them in harm's way with no contingency plan. He has not come to Congress; he has not asked for more authority. The last thing we ought to do is give a blanket authority when we do not know the plans. It would be an abdication of our responsibility to do that. 
   I think the administration has been all over the lot on the policy that we say that we want to solve this problem. Do we want an independent Kosovo? The administration says no. Do we want to drive Mr. Milosevic from power? The administration says no. Do we want to encourage European democracies who are very strong and stable right now to assume more responsibility for European security? The administration says yes, but the crisis is demonstrating the opposite. 
   Do we want a strong NATO with a clear sense of purpose and the ability to defend a united Europe? The administration says yes, but I think this Balkan policy is going to tear the alliance apart. It goes far beyond what 19 countries can agree to in a consensus. 
   We are learning that you cannot fight an offensive war by committee. What we want in Yugoslavia, according to the administration, is a multiethnic, multiparty democracy. We seem to be prepared to impose it on both sides, neither of whom are ready to accept our terms. 
   We have tried an experimental Balkan policy in Bosnia. It is not workable. Thousands of American troops are there with no end in sight. The head of the international observer group has fired elected officials and canceled sessions of parliament because opposition parties oppose what we are doing in Kosovo. People vote in elections and then cannot stay and serve where they are elected. 
   I do not think that is an example of a democracy. I think it is a collection of countries trying to force their will on the people of another country. 
   I certainly do not think we should try to do this in Kosovo with Bosnia as an example. Are we going to require the Kosovar Albanians to live under Milosevic? Surely no one could seriously take that as a goal, but that is the goal stated by the administration-- 
   an autonomous region within Serbia that is protected by a NATO force with no end in sight. 
   So, Madam President, I think it is time for us to look for a responsible force that has a chance to succeed. With the glimmer of hope that we have with the release of our prisoners, I urge the President to seize the opportunity to seek a diplomatic solution, try to bring Mr. Milosevic to the table, bring in the other parties, and look for a region-wide solution. 
   I think the United States should go back to its role in the region of being a friend to all and an enemy to none. As the world's greatest superpower, we do not have to take sides in ethnic conflicts if we are going to be the neutral party that can bring them together. We should be able to bring the powers together to work out a solution that would have a long-term chance to succeed, one that recognizes the open, gaping wounds of all the parties in the Balkans. It would require much more energy than was put into Rambouillet. It would require President Clinton to take a personal interest and an investment in the solution. And he can do that. The effort would be worth it. We should bring Russia back to the brink to forge an alliance with the West, not push them further away from us. We should provide people in the region self-determination so they can create countries that have a chance for longevity. 
   It would keep the United States from devoting incredible resources for its open-ended commitment in the Balkans, because our ability to fight elsewhere in the world is being jeopardized by this operation. We are now talking about blockading Yugoslavia. That will take more ships than we now have allocated to this mission. It will hamper our ability to operate in the Persian Gulf. We have already seen that it is diverting military resources from as far as the Asian theater. 
   Madam President, as much time as we have put in on this Balkans issue, I think we need to come out with a solution that is not a ``Band-Aid'' for Kosovo, but something that will settle down the Balkans for a longer term and give them a chance to live as neighbors, side by side, to have stable economies, to get their people back in their respective countries, to be able to live and have self-determination; and then, hopefully, they could become trading partners and friends. 
   Madam President, I don't think that any strategic planner in the world ever thought, as the cold war ended, that we would propose a new strategic concept for America that would include tens of thousands of troops dedicated to the Balkans in perpetuity, but that is exactly what is happening. I have listened to the arguments that are being made. The basic argument seems to be: I don't really like how we got here, but now that we are here, we have to win. We are in it, so we must win it. I keep hearing that over and over again. That is like saying when you are going in the wrong direction, keep going and speed up. 
   I don't think the Senate ought to say that. I think we ought to be a partner with the President in trying to say, wait a minute, Mr. President, we don't agree with what you have done, so let's try to take a different course. I am suggesting tonight that that course be that glimmer of hope that we can have a diplomatic solution, which would be much bigger than just a ``Band-Aid'' on Kosovo. 
   I have heard the argument that the credibility of NATO is at stake. Now, that is a good argument. I want the credibility of NATO to remain intact. But what kind of alliance, with a mistake staring them in the face, would keep going down the same road and say that, in order to remain credible, we have to go down the same road, at any cost in lives, at the cost of any treasure of any of our countries, and we are going to gut it out even though everyone who has any little bit of awareness of what has been going on is bound to say this isn't working very well? 
   Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that, if NATO were under attack, we  could win a war? No, there is no doubt, because if one of our countries was under siege, we would go all out and we would win. We might use nuclear weapons if we had to, but we would win if one of us had a security threat. But the fact of the matter is, Madam President, we don't have a security risk. We have a humanitarian tragedy. So we are not in this full force. It is a ``gentlemen's war.'' We are doing strategic bombing. We are trying to be careful not to kill civilians, thank Heaven. We aren't going to put in ground troops. The President has said that. 
   This is not a war on which you can judge the credibility of NATO. If we wanted to win, we would win. We have the force to win, make no mistake about it. Nobody in their right mind would doubt it. But the problem here is the same as we had in Vietnam; we are not prepared to use full force to win, because it isn't a security threat. 
   To keep NATO strong, I submit that we don't keep going forward on a mission that doesn't appear to be very positive. To keep NATO strong, we should have a clear principle, a clear mission, and not an immediate reaction, but be slow to get into action. And when you go, by God, you go to win. That is what was wrong with Vietnam, and it is what is wrong today in Kosovo. It is not the credibility of NATO that we don't win a ``gentlemen's war.'' The credibility of NATO would be tested if we had a real security threat to one of our countries, and we would go in and we would win. 
   So I think the resolution today is meaningless, because we know we are not going to use full force. We are not going to use weapons of mass destruction, and we are not going to use ground troops. The President has said that. He hasn't even asked for it. And this operation should show us, and it should be a lesson for NATO, that if we are not prepared to go for a win, we should not take the first step. That is the lesson to keep the credibility of NATO. 
   If we are not prepared to go for a win and declare war on Serbia we shouldn't have started the bombing, and we shouldn't continue in this direction. That is why the resolution is wrong. 
   I am not ready to declare war on Serbia. I think they have a despot as a leader. But I don't think the American people are ready to declare war on a country that is not a security threat to the United States. I don't think we should start bombing another country if we are not ready to declare war. 
   Madam President, I don't think it is right for Congress to say go full force in the same direction you have been going. I think it is my responsibility as a Senator to say: I think we are going in the wrong direction, Mr. President. Let's take stock of the situation, and let's try to do something that would be a positive turn. 
   I was reading in the New York Times this morning a column by William Safire about the price of trust. The central question is, Do we trust the President to use all force necessary to establish the principle that no nation can drive out an unwanted people? And the answer is no. The distrust is palpable. Give him the tools and he will not finish the job. 
   Madam President, I don't want to give him the tools in that kind of atmosphere. It would be an abdication of my responsibility as a Member of the Senate to do that. The only responsible action for the Senate is to ask the President to come to Congress if you want to escalate this conflict. Come to Congress, and tell us why and tell us what your plan is. Tell us what the cost is. Tell us how many troops you need, and for how long. Tell us what the mission is. And what is victory? 
   How could we say that passing this resolution is an act of responsibility? I don't doubt for one minute that everyone who votes for this resolution is doing it because they believe it is right--because they believe in the Presidency. So many of the war heroes in this Senate believe in the Presidency. I think that is why they are standing so tall. 
   But, Madam President, I am a Member of the Senate. I believe in the Presidency. But I believe that when the President is doing something that is wrong--that I should stand up and say so. That is what I was elected to do. That is what the people of Texas sent me here to do. 
   I hope that we can have an influence on the President. I hope he will take bold action. I hope he will sit down tonight and decide that there is a glimmer of hope with the release of the American prisoners and it is worth a chance. 
   That is why I hope we will table this resolution--that we will take our responsibility seriously as Members of the Senate, and say: Mr. President, what we are doing isn't working, and I am not going to escalate it. I am not going to put our troops into harm's way, most assuredly, when you don't ask us to do it. And when you don't give us a plan, and when you don't give us a policy that we can decide if we support or not. The people who elected me to take the tough vote trust me to do what I think is right in my heart. I would never abdicate my conscience by giving a blank check to put our troops into harm's way in support of a policy that I haven't seen, and what I have seen I disagree with. No way. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation on behalf of myself, Senator MCCAIN, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee and Senator INOUYE, Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee ranking member. This legislation authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for the Maritime Administration. 
   The introduction of this bill demonstrates our firm commitment to our nation's maritime industry and our willingness to work with the Maritime Administration to provide effective leadership on a wide range of maritime issues. The bill was developed along with Administration officials and provides a base to build upon in coming weeks. 
   There are several aspects of this measure that will require interested members of the Senate to work together to come to a consensus. Therefore, this bill can be viewed as a starting point for reauthorizing the agency and making changes to U.S. maritime policy. I look forward to working with members of the Committee and the administration to find common ground for a final legislation. 
   The bill authorizes appropriations for the Maritime Administration [MarAd] for fiscal year 2000 and covers two appropriated accounts: (1) operations and training and (2) the shipbuilding loan guarantee program authorized by Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. 
   MarAd oversees the operations of U.S. Government-supported maritime promotion programs, such as the Maritime Security Program, the state maritime academies and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. I am a strong supporter of the state maritime academies, in particular, and want to ensure that they are adequately funded. 
   Title XI shipbuilding loan guarantee program is important to ensuring critical shipbuilding capacity in the United States. This legislation provides $6 million in loan guarantee funds for Title XI in FY2000. However, this program has received substantially more in previous years, and I look forward to working with the Administration to determine the appropriate level of funding. 
   This bill codifies the administrative process associated with Title XI. The measure provides the Secretary the authority to hold all bond proceeds generated under Title XI during the 
   construction period in escrow. Currently, the Secretary must administratively establish a separate construction fund with a private bond agent for a portion of the bond proceeds not captured in escrow. This will eliminate the cost associated with the establishment of the  separate construction fund and better protect the government's interest. 
   Futher, the measure provides the Secretary authority under Title XI to collect and hold cash collateral in the U.S. Treasury, under certain circumstances associated with a guaranteed transaction. This will relieve the obligors and the agency from spending the time and money associated with negotiating depository agreements and legal opinions in Title XI transactions. 
   Additionally, the bill amends Title IX to provide a waiver of the three year period bulk and breakbulk vessels newly registered under the U.S. flag must wait in order to carry government-impelled cargo. The waiver would be in effect for one year beginning on the date of enactment. 
   Finally, the bill would reauthorize the War Risk Insurance Program through June 30, 2005, change the requirement for an annual report to Congress by the Maritime Administration detailing its's activities to a biennial report, and make clear the ownership status of the vessel named the Jeremiah O'Brien. 
   I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my colleagues will join me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving this authorization through the legislative process.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator KYL for his leadership on this bill that we have just introduced. 
   Senator KYL and I, along with Senators DOMENICI, GRAMM, MCCAIN, and BINGAMAN, have been very concerned about the Border Patrol issue that faces our border States. In fact, we were stunned this week to learn that though Congress has authorized and authorized funding for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents that in fact only 200 to 400 are coming on line this year. 
   Mr. President, that is stunning. That is stunning when you consider that last year the Border Patrol apprehended 1.5 million persons illegally crossing the border, and fully half of those were at my State of Texas. In fact, the McAllen Border Patrol sector, which includes Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen, had the largest number of drug seizures of all Border Patrol Sectors in the United States--1,610 drug seizures just in that one sector. The drugs apprehended have a value of over $410 million. Two Border Patrol agents in the McAllen sector lost their lives last year in a raid of a drug trafficker's hideout. It was the first time Border Patrol agents had been killed during such a raid.  
   Senator ABRAHAM held a hearing this week, and the Chief of the Border Patrol told us that he has not been able to recruit and retain and, in fact, is losing 10 percent of the agents. For every one that we are bringing on, we are losing two, because our Border Patrol agents are capped at a journeymen-9 level. That translates to roughly $34,000 a year for an agent that has several years of experience. For an agent, that is certainly a job of law enforcement at its toughest. 
   Under the bill that we have just introduced, the agents would be eligible to be paid at a journeymen-11 level, which is approximately a $7,000 increase. 
   This pay raise is also consistent with the pay of other law enforcement agencies that work along the border. One significant problem for the Border Patrol has been that many agents go to work for the Customs Service, or the DEA when they reach the cap. So they get to their cap, their experience, and they go over to another Federal agency that pays better. 
   We must solve this discrepancy among Federal agencies in the same place that are doing similar kinds of tough duty work for hazardous pay. Yet, the Border Patrol is $7,000 less than Customs and DEA agents. We must correct this discrepancy if we are going to get control of our borders, which are a sieve right now with drugs moving through at an alarming rate. 
   This is not just a Texas-Arizona-New Mexico-California problem. The drugs that come in from our borders go right up into Ohio, Michigan, New Hampshire, Oregon--all over our country, because we don't have the proper control of our border. 
   Mr. President, there is not a higher priority for the Federal Government than to have the sovereign borders of the United States safe from illegal drugs coming into our country, and most certainly illegal immigrants that have not gone through the proper procedures so that we know who is coming into our country and what their record is so that we have the control that any sovereign nation would have. 
   Mr. President, this is an emergency. It is why Senator KYL and I have introduced this legislation today, because we are in a crisis. This is a war. It is a war on drugs, and we are losing. We are losing our young people in this country. Part of the problem is that we are not putting the resources into law enforcement. 
   I have to say, Mr. President, that I am disappointed to the maximum that our INS has money from Congress and authorization from Congress to hire 1,000 agents and they have only been able to come up with 200 to 400 agents this year. That means we are 600 to 800 short, as we speak, from what was allocated this year, and which was given priority by Congress. I think the INS needs to make this a priority. We are going to give them the pay increases with the bill that we have just introduced today. 
   Senator GREGG, who has been a strong supporter of our efforts to beef up the border, has said he will work with us to reprogram money from this year's budget for these pay increases so that we will hopefully be able to do this on an expedited basis by October 1 of this year. 
   Hopefully, we will be able to retain agents knowing that this pay raise is in the pipeline. But, Mr. President, it also takes an effort by the INS to make it a priority to fill these slots, because if they don't look at a little more creative approach to recruiting, the $7,000 increase is not going to be enough. 
   I am at my wit's end. Senator KYL, Senator MCCAIN, Senator GRAMM, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator BINGAMAN are at their wit's end, and certainly Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator BOXER are at their wit's end with promises made and not fulfilled by the Border Patrol to keep the illegal drugs out of our country that are preying on our young people. 
   This is a priority. It is an emergency. It is a war that we are losing, and we are going to try to fix it. But we must have the support of the INS to do it. We are going to give them pay raises. We are going to create another office in the Border Patrol for recruitment and retention to tell us what else we need to do, and we are going to fix this problem if we can have a hand-to-hand relationship with the INS and the Border Patrol. 
   It is inexcusable that they did not come to us earlier to tell us they were this far behind. We are going to fix this problem. We are not going to sit back and let the children of our country be absorbed in drugs that are illegally crossing the border and made available to young people who are not yet mature enough to know what to do when they are approached. 
   Mr. President, we are trying to do our part. I call on the INS and the Border Patrol and this administration to do their part, because we are not going to take it anymore. We are going to solve this problem. We are going to put the resources in it. If the INS will put those resources to work and be creative and innovative and dogged in their determination, we will make a difference, but we can't do it without their commitment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I, with Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce Committee; Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee; and Senator INOUYE, ranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee are introducing a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). 
   The Federal Maritime Commission is an independent agency composed of five commissioners. The Commission's primary responsibility is administering the Shipping Act of 1984 and enforcing the Foreign Shipping Practices Act and Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. By doing so, the FMC protects shippers and carriers from restrictive or unfair practices of foreign-flag carriers. Currently, the Commission is engaged in the implementation of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. The Act, which takes effect on May 1 of this year is the first major deregulation of international ocean shipping. This bill authorizes funding for the Commission to continue its important work. 
   Specifically, the bill authorizes $15.6 million for the FMC for fiscal year 2000 and $16.3 million for fiscal year 2001. The fiscal year 2000 funding is $385,000 above the amount requested by the President in order to fund the appointment of the fifth commissioner and his or her staff. 
   I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my colleagues will join me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving this authorization through the legislative process.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along with Mr. SANTORUM, and Mr. COCHRAN, the Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act of 1999. This bill is identical to the bipartisan and widely supported legislation I sponsored during the last session of Congress. 
   This measure will create jobs, expand economic activity, and revitalize the  physical structure and value of residential and commercial buildings in America's most distressed urban and rural communities. 
   The bill provides a targeted tax credit to businesses to help defray the cost of construction, expansion, and renovation in these areas, and in the process will generate billions in privately based economic activity in those areas that need the most help in our country. 
   As we continue to look for ways to combat the decay of our inner cities and to raise the standard of living in many of our rural areas, I believe, and numerous studies demonstrate, that reversing the physical deterioration in America's cities has numerous and far reaching economic benefits. Revitalization in decaying neighborhoods lifts the hopes and expectations of the residents of those areas that economic growth and opportunity is coming their way. Indeed, one of the key recommendations of a top-to-bottom review of law enforcement in this city, our Nation's Capital, was to improve the many abandoned buildings in Washington, D.C. that create an atmosphere conducive to crime and despair. 
   The Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act will build upon the empowerment zone/enterprise community program that is now unfolding over 100 communities in the United States. Texas has five of these specially designated areas: Houston, Dallas, El Paso, San Antonio, and Waco, as well as one rural zone in the Rio Grande valley covering four counties. Not only will these cities qualify for the credit under my bill, but so will the 400 communities in the United States that sought such designation but were not selected. State-established enterprise zones and other specifically designated revitalization districts established by State and local governments will also be able to participate. In all, over 1,000 areas will qualify for this credit nationwide. 
   Our bill contains the following principle features: A tax credit that may be applied to construction amounting to at least 25 percent of the basis of the property, in designated revitalization areas; qualified investors could choose a one-time 20-percent tax credit against the cost of new construction or rehabilitation. Alternatively, a business owner could take a five percent credit each year over a 10-year period. Tax credits would be allocated to each state, according to a formula, with States and localities determining the priority of the projects. In all, $1.5 billion in tax credits would be allocated under this tax bill. 
   Mr. President, with a minimum level of bureaucratic involvement and through a proven tax mechanism, this initiative will make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of families in need and for the economies of hundreds of distressed urban and rural communities across this Nation. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this sound and effective pro-growth initiative.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak to a resolution that has been introduced this morning regarding Congress taking an action about our troops in Kosovo and the whole escalation of the operation in Kosovo. The text of the resolution is that we would give the President all of the authority to use whatever force, take whatever steps he sees as necessary. 
   I certainly think we should have a debate on this whole issue of Kosovo. I think it is certainly something that Congress is going to need to weigh in on. But I think it would be vastly premature to take an action before the President has laid out a plan. The President has not asked us for ``all force.'' The President has not asked us, actually, for anything except funding on an emergency basis to make sure we have the ability to fund the operation that is going on in Yugoslavia without taking away from other national security interests. I am going to support the President in that request. The last thing I want to do is have our troops in harm's way, along with our allies', and run out of money or run out of equipment or have any of our national defense personnel anywhere else in the world be shortchanged. We are not going to let that happen. 
   When the President gives us the specificity that is required for the appropriation, I think there will be a resounding vote in Congress to give our troops and our military the leeway they need to spend the money to have the equipment they need to do this job. But I cannot imagine having a carte blanche given to an operation that clearly is escalating a mission and we have not seen a plan. We have not seen a plan. We have not seen a timetable. We have not seen a cost estimate for the long term. So I hope we will take a step back here, and rather than voting on the resolution that was put forward today we would be talking among ourselves, that we will be debating at whatever point is the right one, and that we would be having op-eds in newspapers, which I think certainly have added to the body of opinion on this issue. But Congress should not micromanage this war. The President should come to us and say what he needs, what he is going to do with the money, what kind of plan we have, what kind of troop commitment are we talking about, what is it going to do to the rest of our national defense operation. We need to have a full plan. 
   One of the things that has concerned so many of us is that perhaps we started an operation before we had a contingency plan. Perhaps we started the operation before we knew what we would need for the long term, before we knew the goal. I think the mission has actually changed several times. 
   We obviously have had a different result from this operation than we had hoped. There is no question about that. Whether this is a success is yet to be determined, and I do not think we should be jumping in, saying it has not been a success. But I think it is time for us to let the President take the lead, to let him come to us with his requests. He is the one who is supposed to be executing this operation. I do think it would be a mistake for Congress to put the cart before the horse. I do not think we should micromanage. I do not think we should tell the President what to do. I do not think we should put our opinions on top of his. And most certainly, when I hear our NATO allies saying they would not consider ground troops, the last thing I think we should do is encourage ground troops. I think the case has not been made, the base has 
   not been laid, and our allies are not in support. 
   So I think we need to take a step back. We need to be getting the administration to give us briefings at every point, asking our opinions. Let's debate this, let's talk about what kind of commitment we want to make. But I will not vote for troops on the ground in this operation as a carte blanche, a blank check, before I know what we are going to do. What will our responsibility be? What will our allies' contribution be? What is the timetable? What is the mission? Is it achievable, and what is it going to cost? And what is it going to do to the rest of our national defense? 
   These are questions that must be asked. We must get answers. We must have a full briefing. For Congress to have a vote before we have all of that would be irresponsible. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe everyone knows that today is tax day in America. I think we have been talking about it. And I think it is very appropriate that we have a budget resolution on the floor today that we can say will give tax relief because that is set aside in this budget. 
   The tax burden on Americans is too high. The average American family pays 38 percent of its income in taxes to some government--the Federal Government, the State government, and the local government. As a percentage of gross domestic product, taxes are higher today than they were at any time in this country since World War II. 
   That is why the budget resolution that we are going to pass is significant. The American people should know that on April 15 this Congress is going to pass a plan that provides a $770 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. There couldn't be a clearer message from this Congress about what our priorities are, and that is tax relief for hard-working American families. 
   There are some, including the President, who oppose our plan. They say that Washington will save money for working Americans. But we know that is not going to happen. We have heard that before. And we know that we haven't had a budget surplus nor tax cut in this country--until this Republican Congress was elected--for 40 years. So we know who cares about tax cuts for the American family. 
   I think we have chosen the right course. Giving the extra money to the Government would not ever get it back to the people. But we believe that people who earn the money have the right to it. And that is why we will have a tax bill when this budget is passed. 
   There are many tax proposals that come before the Senate, many of which I support. Certainly reducing capital gains taxes would be good for our country. Reducing or eliminating the estate taxes would be good for this country; and across-the-board tax relief, 10 percent across the board, so that when you are writing your check today, you can just take 10 percent of the check you wrote and know that would not be in your tax bill next year and you would be able to spend that money the way you think it is best for your family. 
   But there is one that is my priority, and it is to eliminate what I think is the worst transgression we have in our Tax Code. That is the marriage tax penalty. Right now, 21 million American families pay up to $1,400 on average more just because they are married. So we say to people, you have to choose between love and money in our country. 
   If you want to get married, start a family, and build up your savings to make a downpayment on a new home, we will make you $1,400 less able to do that. That is a lot of money to the hard-working couples who are hardest hit by this tax. 
   I have introduced legislation to eliminate this penalty. We could allow couples to split their incomes evenly or we could double the standard exemption to widen the tax brackets for married couples so they match those of single filers. We could also let people choose if it is better for them to file as singles or as married couples. That way, no one would pay a penalty for getting married. I hope it will be our highest priority with the tax cuts that are provided in this budget.  
   I read in USA Today an op-ed piece this morning on the marriage tax penalty. Their contention is that this only affects the higher-income couples. They say that the bulk of those suffering this marriage tax penalty are dual-income families at the middle-income level, $50,000. I have a legislative correspondent in my office and his combined family income is $50,000. He makes about $25,000 and his wife must work for them to be able to make ends meet. She makes about $25,000. They are a young couple. I don't think that people who make $25,000 a year are wealthy, and I most certainly think if they have to have two incomes in order to make ends meet that we are not increasing the standard of living in this country. To go forward and say two people who make $25,000 a year should owe Uncle Sam $1,400 more, I think is absolutely wrong, particularly a young couple that is trying to get started, to make a downpayment to buy a home. 
   I hope we can correct this inequity. I think two-income earners at the $25,000 level deserve some help. I am going to try to get it for them. 
   This is a red letter day. This is the day that we see how much it costs for us to support government. All of us want to do our fair share. I would never say we should have no taxes because we do enjoy good service--hopefully--for the taxes that we pay. However, 38 percent of a person's income in taxes is hard to explain. It is hard to explain that you are getting that much service for your dollars. I think you could get a lot less service and a lot more choice if we lower the taxes for everyone in this country so that hard-working Americans could see the benefits of working harder and doing better. That is the American dream. That is what made this country great--that we would say to people, if you work harder you can do better and you can give a little more to your family or your children. That is why adding on some of these taxes is so important. 
   Today, we are going to pass a budget resolution that will do that, that will say to the hard-working American that help is on the way. I just hope we can come to terms with the President so that we will be able to pass a tax bill that really will go to the hard-working American who is struggling to make ends meet. 
   I appreciate the leadership of Senator DOMENICI and Senator LAUTENBERG for putting this budget resolution forth. I think it is a good one. It is a responsible spending of our hard-earned tax dollars. Most important, on tax day, I hope people realize that we are going to try to cut that burden. This budget resolution is a start in the right direction. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1999. 
   My highest priority as chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee this year is to pass a re-authorization bill--one that provides some ability for shippers to obtain improved service and rates, while maintaining the ability of railroads to make a return and, indeed, grow. 
   The bill I am introducing seeks to improve competition and the procedures at the Board that shippers and carriers rely upon to adjudicate their rate disputes. At the same time, it recognizes the need for the railroad industry to maintain sound financial footing, capable of maintaining the railroad infrastructure. 
   Last year, at the behest of Chairman MCCAIN and me, the Board initiated a hearing process on competition issues and developed an extensive record on these issues. Specifically, the Board held two days of hearings and received testimony from 60 witnesses. It heard shipper complaints of inadequate service, higher rates, and concentration in the railroad industry. The Board also listened to carriers who stressed that, especially in a growing economy, capacity and infrastructure investment is the key to meeting their customers' needs. 
   In addition, the Board held a hearing in December at my request on the proposals offered by Houston shippers, the Greater Houston Partnership and the Railroad Commission of Texas. 
   As a result of these hearings, the Board has done what is within its authority to help shippers obtain some relief. It undertook two important rulemakings. One provides for alternative rail availability during a service failure. The other streamlines rail rate cases by dispensing with consideration of ``product and geographic competition'' in determining market dominance for rate cases. 
   I commend the Board for making these rules, and --frankly--for going no further. It's refreshing to find a regulatory body that does not attempt to develop a new policy in the absence of Congressional guidance. 
   This bill picks up where the Board's actions left off. First, it codifies the Board's decision to streamline the market dominance test and the procedure for providing alternative rail availability during a service failure. Second, it begins the process of reforming the procedure that small shippers use for rate cases. A recent GAO report highlights the cost, in time and money, of the current process. 
   This bill also sets into motion changes in the Board's revenue adequacy finding, making it a more helpful and real-world standard. It balances the bottleneck issue, enhances the Board's emergency powers and establishes an arbitration system that could lead to better-shipper carrier dialogue. Finally, it clarifies, in a balanced way and without dictating specific outcomes, that competition remains part of the rail merger and national rail policy of this country. 
   It is clear that Congress has a job to do in re-authorizing the Surface Transportation Board and addressing some of the difficult issues associated with it. This bill is a first step. I want to strongly convey that I do not see it as a final product. While I view it as fair to all parties, I am ready to consider changes to improve the bill and ensure its enactment. To that end, I encourage my colleagues to work with me toward the common purpose of reauthorizing the Board and making some common sense improvements.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment that is the regular order is my amendment on Kosovo. A lot has happened since I offered this amendment early last week, because my amendment actually asks the President to come forward and tell us what he was going to do in Kosovo. This assumed a peace agreement. It assumes that we would have a plan put in place before we would take action in Kosovo. 
   Unfortunately, time has bypassed this amendment. Unfortunately, the President made up his mind, I think, before he ever talked to Members of Congress that we would bomb Kosovo. I think we are taking a very important step and one that I hope everyone will take seriously. 
   Bombing a sovereign country that has not threatened the United States of America is a very serious step. I think we also need to look at the NATO mission. We are changing the mission of NATO without debate, without a vote of Congress. We are turning NATO from a defense alliance to an alliance that has now decided it is going to take an offensive action against a 
   country that is not in NATO. This is unprecedented. 
   So I do think the President needs to come to Congress with a plan. If we are going to take step 1, we need to know what step 2, 3, and 4 are. We need to know what could happen and what circumstances would cause us to have more commitments in the Balkans. 
   Mr. President, I think it is premature for us to be doing what we apparently are going to be doing. But I think my amendment has been bypassed by time. So I am going to withdraw my amendment and let the supplemental appropriations bill go forward on the promise from our leadership that we will take up a bill on Kosovo that will have teeth, that will have an up-or-down vote, as Congress is required to do when we have this kind of action by our military forces. 
   So, Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment. I look forward to the debate. I look forward to Congress exercising its responsibility under the Constitution that if there is going to be a war declared, that it will be Congress that will declare it.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the situation in Kosovo. We have been watching this situation unfold for days, actually months--actually, you could say thousands of years. But it is coming to a head in the very near future, perhaps in hours. As I speak today, Richard Holbrooke is talking to Slobodan Milosevic and trying to encourage him to come to the peace table. I hope he is successful, and I know every American hopes that he is successful. But what I think we must talk about today is what happens if he is not. 
   What happens if Mr. Milosevic says, ``No, I am not going to allow foreign troops in my country,'' and if he says he is going to move forward with whatever he intends to do in the governance of that country? I think we have to step back and look at the situation and the dilemma which we face, because there is no question, this is not an easy decision. What comes next? 
   Basically, the President has committed the United States to a policy in NATO to which he really does not have the authority to commit. The consequences are that we have to make a decision that would appear to walk away from the commitment he made without coming to Congress, and that is not a good situation. I do not like having to make such a choice, because I want our word to be good. When the United States speaks, I want our word to be good. Whether it is to our ally or to our enemy, they need to know what we say we will do. 
   But the problem here is, the President has gone out with a commitment before he talked to Congress about it, and now we have really changed the whole nature of NATO without congressional approval. We are saying that we are going to bomb a sovereign country because of their mistreatment of people within their country, the province of Kosovo, and we are going to take this action, basically declaring war on a country that should not be an enemy of the United States and in fact was a partner at the peace table in the Dayton accords on Bosnia. 
   So now we are taking sides. We are turning NATO, which was a defense alliance--is a defense alliance--into an aggressive, perhaps, declarer-of-war on a country that is not in NATO. Mr. President, I just do not think we can take a step like that without the Congress and the American people understanding what we are doing and, furthermore, approving of it. 
   There is no question that Mr. Milosevic is not our kind of person. We have seen atrocities that he has committed in Kosovo. But, in fact, there have been other atrocities committed by the parties with whom we are purporting to be taking sides. The Albanians have committed atrocities as well, the Kosovar Albanians. So we are now picking sides in a civil war where I think the U.S. security interest is not clear. 
   I think it is incumbent on the President to come to Congress, before he takes any military action in Kosovo, to lay out the case and to get congressional approval. What would he tell Congress? First of all, before we put one American in harm's way, I want to know: What is the intention here? What is the commitment? What happens in the eventuality that Mr. Milosevic does not respond to bombing, that he declares he is going to go forward without responding to an intervention in his country? What do we do then? Do we send ground troops in to force him to come to the peace table? And if we did, could we consider that is really a peace? What if NATO decides to strike and an American plane is shot down? What if there is an American POW? What then? What is our commitment then? 
   My concern here is that the administration has not looked at the third, fourth, and fifth steps in a plan. They have only addressed step 1, which is, we are going to bomb because they will not come to the peace table and accept the agreement that we have hammered out. I just say, before we go bombing sovereign nations, 
   we ought to have a plan. We ought to know what steps 3, 4, and 5 are, because I believe Congress has a right to know what this commitment is. How many people from the United States of America are going to be put in harm's way? What is it going to cost and where is the money going to come from? Is it going to come from other defense accounts, so other places in the world where we have troops are  put at risk? Is it going to come at the risk of our Strategic Defense Initiative? Just where is the money going to come from? Most of all, most important of all, what is the mission? How much are we going to be required to do and what is the timetable? 
   Mr. President, I would support a plan that would say when the two parties come to a real peace agreement, we would put our troops, along with our European allies in NATO, together in a peacekeeping mission of a short duration which would make sure that things settle down until we could have others rotate in and take our place. I would support a plan that went that far. 
   I would also support a plan of helping the Kosovars, but without putting American troops in harm's way. You know, the difference between the Clinton doctrine and the Reagan doctrine is that President Reagan would support freedom fighters with arms, with monetary contributions, with intelligence--many, many forms of support for freedom fighters--but he would never put a U.S. military person in the middle of a civil war. He would help, but he would not make that commitment. 
   Under the Reagan doctrine, therefore, we could help Afghan rebels and Nicaraguan freedom fighters. At the same time, we could also continue to remain strong in Europe and Asia because we could allocate our resources and we would not drain our resources in small civil conflicts in chosen places around the world. 
   What bothers me about what has been happening in the last 3 or 4 years is that we have been putting troops into civil conflicts in certain parts of the world but not all parts of the world. So every time we do it, it makes the decision not to do it somewhere else a little harder. We practically invaded Haiti and we still have 500 troops in Haiti today. 
   We had 18 Army Rangers killed in Somalia in a mission that was ill-defined and was actually mission creep. The original mission of feeding starving people had been accomplished, but we didn't leave. We decided to capture a warlord, something our military is not trained to do and, therefore, the miscalculation cost us the lives of 18 great young Americans. 
   We have inserted ourselves into places like Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia, but we have not inserted ourselves into Algeria, where there are just as many atrocities as there have been in any place in the Balkans. We have not inserted ourselves into Turkey, where there is mistreatment of the Kurds. We aren't getting involved in the Basque separatist movement in Spain. We didn't step into Iran when the Ayatollah took over from the Shah and was assassinating almost every military leader that couldn't get out of the country, plus the religious minorities that were still there and their leadership. It is very difficult, when you start choosing where you are going to involve yourselves, to extricate yourself when there is no clear policy. 
   That is why so many of us in Congress are concerned and why we realize the dilemma. We understand that this is not an easy black and white decision. We are talking about a commitment that the President has made. I do not like stepping in and saying that we shouldn't keep a commitment the President has made. Overriding that great concern is the consequence of not requiring the President to have a plan and a policy that will set a precedent for the future. I think we could explain it by sitting down with our European allies and saying, first of all, if we are going to change the mission of NATO, this must be fully debated and fully accepted by every member of NATO within their own constitutional framework. If we are going to turn NATO from a defense alliance into an affirmative war-making machine, I think we need to talk about it. 
   I will support some affirmative action on the part of NATO, if we are able to determine exactly what would trigger that and not go off on one mission without having a precedent for a different mission and, therefore, creating expectations among more and more people that we will step in to defend the autonomy of a country such as Kosovo or Bosnia. We must not allow the expectations to be such that we are drawn into every conflict, because we will not be able to survive with the strength that we must have when only the United States will be the one standing between a real attack from a ballistic missile or a nuclear warhead or an invasion of another country where we do have a strategic interest. We cannot allow there to be so many questions because there is so little policy. That is the responsibility of Congress, to work with the President. 
   We will work together. Congress will work with the President to hammer out a new mission for NATO. We will always do our fair share in the world. We will never walk away from that. We have to determine what is our fair share, what is our allocation. I submit that the United States will always be the leader in technology, and we will create a ballistic missile defense that will shield not only the United States and our troops wherever they may be in any theater in the world, but we also will protect our allies, if we have the strength to go forward. We will not have the strength to go forward if we continue to spend $3 and $4 billion a year on conflicts that do not rise to the level of a U.S. security interest. 
   We must be able to choose where we spend our defense dollars so that we will all be protected, ourselves and our allies, from a rogue nation with a ballistic missile capability that can put a chemical or biological or nuclear warhead on it and undermine the integrity of people living in our country. 
   Mr. President, the consequences are too great for us to sit back and let the President commit U.S. forces in a situation that I can't remember us ever having before; that is, to take an affirmative military action against a sovereign nation that has not committed a security threat to the United States. Before we would sit back and let the President do that, I cannot in good conscience say, well, he has made the commitment, even though he didn't have 
   the right to do it, so we have got to let him go forward. Perhaps if we aren't lucky and if Milosevic does not come to the table, we would have more and more and more responsibilities because of the potential consequences that could occur if he does not come to the table. 
   We must know what those consequences are and what we are prepared to do in the eventuality that an American plane is shot down, that we have an American prisoner on the ground or that we bomb and bomb and bomb and bomb and he still does not do what we have asked him to do. We have to determine what we do in that eventuality. I certainly hope that we will consult with the Russians so that this war does not escalate into something that we haven't thought about. If Russia decides to step in on the side of Serbia, we could have grief beyond what anyone is saying right now. 
   I hope the President will work with Congress to fashion a new mission for NATO that will have the full support of Congress and the American people. I believe we could do that, because I don't think we are far apart at all. We cannot do it on an ad hoc basis. We cannot all of a sudden attack another country on an ad hoc basis and call that a policy. 
   I hope the President will come together with Congress and have hearings. Let's hear from the American people on just what they believe is the role of the United States. Let's hear from Congress about what our commitments should be and what is a ready division of responsibility for keeping the world as safe as we can make it, given that 30 countries have ballistic missile technology, some of whom are rogue nations. Let us step back with our European allies and determine if this is the right decision to make, or are there other ways that we could be helpful to the Kosovar Albanians. 
   I remember hour after hour after hour, over a 2-year period, talking about letting the Muslims have a fair fight in Bosnia, because they didn't have arms when two of their adversaries did. We never took that step. Now there is a cease-fire in Bosnia, but there are also many years to go before we will know what the cost is and if it can be lasting, 
   because today, Bosnia is still as ethnically divided as it ever was because it is not safe for the refugees to move back in. 
   One can say there is disagreement on just how successful was the Bosnian mission. We do not see fighting, but NATO has just toppled a duly elected president of one of the provinces. It is pretty hard to understand. I think it is  tenuous that we would go in and forcibly remove an elected president while we are touting democratic ideals. 
   There was a way to go into Bosnia, but Kosovo is very different. Kosovo is a civil war in a sovereign nation. There are atrocities. There have been atrocities on both sides. We are picking one side, and we are doing it without a vote of Congress. I do not think we can do it. I do not think the President has the right to declare war, and under the Constitution, he certainly does not. And under the War Powers Act, it takes an emergency. This is not an emergency. We are not being attacked. United States troops are not in harm's way at this point. 
   We can take the time to talk about it, and the consequences are so great I think it is worth the time to set a policy that allows us to have some continuity for the next 25 years, so that our enemies and our allies will know what the greatest superpower in the world is going to do and they will not have to guess. 
   Mr. President, it is a dilemma, and I realize it is. I do not feel comfortable with the choice. I do not feel comfortable at a time when we have gone out on a limb, through our President who made a commitment for us, even though we were not part of it. Nevertheless, I would like to give the President that support, but it is worth it to take the time and do it right and ask the President to come forward to give us his plan, to tell us what happens when American troops are prisoners of war or on the ground or shot down. We need to know what we would do in that eventuality before we send them there. That is the least that we can expect. 
   I hope we can debate this resolution. I hope people will give their views. I have heard great debates already on it, not on the Senate floor, though. The time has come for us to have this debate, and let's vote up or down. There will be people voting on both sides in good conscience, seeing it a different way but with the same goal. So let's have that debate. Let's do it right. Let's don't haul off bombing an independent nation before the Senate and the House of Representatives has a plan and approves it or disapproves it. That is what our Founding Fathers intended when they wrote the Constitution, and it is more appropriate today than ever. 
   I hope we will do that, because then the American people will know what is going on and they will support it or not support it. If we are going to have a long-term commitment, which I hope we do not, but if we do, at least it will be with the support of Congress as Desert Storm was. That was a tough debate. People spoke from the heart on both sides. They took a vote, and Congress supported the President going into Desert Storm. That is the way it should be, Mr. President. That is the way it should be under our Constitution, under our democracy. That is the way our Government works. I hope it will again as we face the crisis today that could have very long-term consequences for our country and for every one of our young men and women in the field wearing the uniform of the United States of America. Their lives are worth a debate and a policy, and that is what we are going to try to give them in the next 24 hours. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. I just say to the Senator from North Dakota that I understand the concern about timing. And I could not agree with him more about the timing. But I will just point out that the amendment I offered was actually offered early last week as an amendment that I thought should be considered in a supplemental appropriations bill because, of course, it will require a supplemental appropriation. As you know, after the bill was laid down and other amendments were considered, this second-degree amendment was put on Friday. And now so much has happened in the last 48 hours that the timing is not perfect; there is no question about it. 
   I just say to the Senator from North Dakota that we have been trying to talk about this for quite a while. And the House took up an amendment 2 weeks ago that now is totally obsolete, because the Serbs have refused to come to the table. So I concede that the timing is bad, but I do not know when it gets better. We certainly are not going to influence Mr. Milosevic right this minute in that Mr. Holbrooke is talking to him right this minute. 
   But I do think that we have to have this debate, because if we do start an action before we have had this debate, and before the American people fully understand what the issues are and can weigh in, I do not think that would be acceptable, particularly if it is a long-term commitment. So I do not disagree at all with what seems to be very bad timing. I just do not know when it gets better.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is correct, it was laid down Friday. But this amendment does not prohibit the airstrikes. It just says that we must come to Congress first, that the President must come to Congress and present a full plan first. And I think that is warranted before this type of action would be taken in this 
   very unusual circumstance. 
   But as the Senator said, it is coming to a head very quickly. This amendment was offered last week. The second-degree was also offered last week. So we are trying to have a clear plan, certainly, before we get into a situation which could be very long term, with very dire consequences. And I think the full debate is what we are looking for, not necessarily a cutoff, but certainly having all the facts before us before we make such an important decision.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are now going to talk about the Kosovo situation. I think it is a very fluid resolution that we have before us but, nevertheless, I think it is very important that we begin to talk about the situation there, because, frankly, in the last 24 hours, things have changed greatly. When the Serbs refused to sign the peace agreement, that started a different dynamic. 
   Many Members of Congress have been in constant meetings with members of the administration, including the President, about just where we are now, where is NATO, what are the commitments and, most important, I think from all of the meetings, it has become very clear that many Members of Congress want to know what is the totality of the commitment. 
   We are beginning to have to address the issue of what kind of hostile possibilities will there be if the NATO forces, which includes the United States, go forward into any kind of a military intervention in Kosovo. 
   We do not know what Milosevic is planning. I believe if President Milosevic starts to take human lives, that is going to trigger a very swift response. 
   I hope the President of Serbia will realize that he could solidify this Congress in a way that nothing else would if he decides that he is going to embark on that course, because I think our forces are ready to stop something that would be the annihilation of innocent people. 
   Mr. President, I think many are not prepared to go into a full-scale altercation with a sovereign country until we have looked at the entirety of that commitment. We need to know the entirety of the commitment of our allies and what we ourselves are willing to do in light of our own principles and our own standards for when we would put American troops into harm's way, into foreign conflicts, and into a situation in which there is no peace agreement. There is even a question of whether it is a real peace agreement if that peace agreement is arrived at through bombing. 
   This is a watershed period for our country, and the Members of Congress who have been participating in the meetings are trying to put before the President and the administration and the people of this country exactly what are our options. 
   I believe it is going to be very important in the next week or so that we do know what our commitments are, if we are going to propose to take any kind of hostile action, that we know what is the end game, what is the strategy, what is the commitment of dollars as well as potential lives. The President of the United States must come forward and not only inform Congress, not only work with Congress on these plans, but inform and work with the American people to explain exactly what is proposed and what will be the end game if we get into this kind of conflict. 
   Mr. President, this is a sobering time. I am pleased that my amendment is the pending business. 
   I am pleased that Senator LOTT has now offered a second-degree amendment, because we now have two options. We have the option of an up-or-down vote on whether we are ready to send troops into Kosovo, or we have a second approach, which is, if we are going to do this, let's have a plan. Those are two options, and in the next 72 hours, I think it will become more and more clear what kind of approach we should take. 
   There is one thing that is certain today, and that is, the Congress of the United States has the power to declare war. I 
   suggest that means the power to send our troops into harm's way for a long period of time if we are expecting a conflict. If this is the case, then it is imperative we talk about this issue up front, we have a full debate in the Senate and House of Representatives, that the people of America know what the plans are, know what the potential liabilities are, and the people of America realize what is at stake. There is no substitute for this kind of planning and this kind of communication. 
   So I am pleased that we are now on this amendment. I look forward to working with all the Members of the Senate so that everyone can be heard and so that, hopefully, we will be able to come to an agreement, but if not, a clear agreement that there will be a real vote and that Congress will play its constitutional role in what happens next; because I believe that what happens in Kosovo and the rest of the Balkans in the decisions that will be made in the next few weeks will perhaps have consequences for years to come in our country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment is the worst of all worlds. It would require every State every year for 25 years to submit a plan about how it is going to spend its own money. What happens if a State legislature is not in session and the Secretary of HHS says, ``I don't think your plan meets my standards for tobacco cessation or health programs,'' and the State legislature is then in the position of losing Medicaid funds and having to call a special session to either change its programs to meet the requirements of the Secretary of HHS, or take the hit, or not serve its own people under Medicaid? 
   Mr. President, this is State money, it is not Federal money. There is no relationship between Medicaid in many of these State lawsuits. 
   I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we will have time tomorrow to speak on the amendment by Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN, but I think it is important that we understand what we are talking about. The Federal Government had nothing to do with the lawsuits that were brought by the States. In fact, the States asked for Federal help. They asked for Federal guidance, and they got none. 
   It was only after the States had settled with the tobacco companies and all States were covered that the Health Care Financing Administration decided that these suits were based on Medicaid and, therefore, the Federal Government should be able to take the average of the Medicaid expenditures from the States from these tobacco settlements. It came up with a figure of 57 percent. They are relying on the part of the law that says the States are responsible for recovering Medicaid overpayments or mistakes in billing; or if a person is covered with private insurance and they get Medicaid coverage, the States would go after the private insurance companies to pay these Medicaid costs. 
   The Health Care Financing Administration is using that law to say that the tobacco settlement should be covered for Medicaid, and they are coming in and saying to the States that the tobacco settlement that was made should not be allowed to be kept by the States and, in fact, they want to withhold 57 percent. 
   The amendment that is before the Senate today would take 50 percent and tell the States how to spend this money. It doesn't even tell the States that they have to spend it on Medicaid. We are not even now talking about what the Health Care Financing Administration had hoped to get in the first place, and that is help on Medicaid payments. They are just saying that big brother Federal Government is going to tell the States that they must spend the money on health care or tobacco cessation programs or helping tobacco farmers, and they are going to allocate 50 percent of the State's money for these purposes. 
   Let's take the State of Ohio as an example. Say that the State of Ohio has a legislature that meets every other year. They are not in session. All of a sudden we have a Federal mandate that the States spend 50 percent of their hard-earned money on these specific program purposes and the Secretary of HHS says to the State of Ohio, ``I'm very sorry, but your program doesn't meet my standard so I'm going to withhold your Medicaid money.'' The legislature is not in session, the programs are in place. Is the legislature going to have to come into special session to try to determine how they are going to change the program to meet this test? They are going to have to because no State can absorb the loss of their Medicaid money, and, most certainly, they are not going to leave people on the streets unserved by Medicaid. 
   This is going to be duplicated all over America if this amendment passes. Nobody is thinking about what happens after the Federal Government says, ``This is simple, this is simple. We will say you have to spend 20 percent on tobacco cessation and 30 percent on the health-related or tobacco farmer aid programs.'' They don't say what happens after we pass this broad general guideline. 
   But what happens is, we are going to have standards, we are going to have regulations, we are going to have certifications, and all of a sudden they have what always happens in Washington, and that is we are going to have the Federal Government encroaching on the States rights with the States' money, earned by the States; and we are going to have costly regulations and bureaucracy, and then we are going to have crisis after crisis after crisis in States that are not going to meet the test of Health and Human Services Secretaries for 25 years to come, who will be able to hold on to the Medicaid money if we don't keep the underlying bill intact. 
   The underlying bill is very simple. It just says that the Federal Government will not encroach on the States at all. The States are using this money for very different purposes. Most of the States--in fact, almost all of the States--did not sue on Medicaid, and if your purpose is to help Medicaid, this amendment doesn't do it. 
   So I hope that we can keep it simple. I hope that we can allow the States to do what they have sued to recover and achieve their purposes. Some States sued on health care. Some States sued on consumer fraud. Some States sued for RICO. There were a myriad of causes of action. But the fact of the matter is, it is the States that sued. 
   So I say to the distinguished chairman of the committee, if he wants to help Medicaid, this amendment doesn't do it. If he wants to help Medicaid, what he needs to do is add another amendment that requires the money go to Medicaid. He thinks that if we pass this amendment, it will keep the State budgets from growing. It won't keep the States' budgets from growing at all in Medicaid costs. What we are talking about here is 20 percent going for tobacco cessation programs and 30 percent going for health care or tobacco farmers. 
   So I hope, if the purpose is to give Medicaid money, that we will have a different amendment. The amendment that is before us today will be costly, it will cause more bureaucracy, more regulation, and it will cause crises in States if they don't meet the Secretary's test of what the program should be. And this Secretary of Health and Human Services will have a different interpretation, perhaps, than the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. So the States are going to fashion a program that meets Secretary Shalala's needs today, and 2 years from now they are going to have to fashion a new set of programs in order not to have the money jerked out from under their noses when they have counted on this money because their tobacco settlement was made by the States. 
   We have time to talk about this tomorrow. I hope Members will consider the havoc that this would wreak on the States and the fact that it will not help the Federal Government. It is putting a strain on that which has no relationship to the problem that is being alleged. If the problem is that we aren't going to share Medicaid, how are we going to help tobacco farmers and meet the Medicaid needs? It is not going to work. 
   This is not an amendment that has been thought through, and we have not thought of what is going to happen 2 years from now, and 4 years from now, and 6 years from now. I hope that Senators will understand that this will wreak havoc on our States. It is an encroachment on States rights, and it will not help the Federal coffers at all. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Cochran-Inouye Missile Defense Act because I think it is long overdue that this Senate take an action that is so very crucial to the security of our Nation. I commend Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE for trying so hard to get our Congress to move forward, to deploy this defense system in the face of opposition from the President of the United States. 
   I appreciate that they have twice come to the Senate and twice been filibustered and have been unable to set this very important national security policy. In fact, the question is, Shall it be the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective national missile defense capable of defending the United States against limited ballistic missile attacks? It is a very simple question, and most people in this country think we already have a defense to an in-coming ballistic missile. But in fact we do not. 
   We now know that Chinese missiles can reach our mainland. In a few short years, Iran, Iraq and North Korea could also be able to attack the United States. Today, we cannot defend the people of our country nor any place in the world where we have troops on the ground. 
   The Clinton administration said that we would have 15 years' warning for missiles from North Korea and Iran, but the Rumsfeld report said the danger could arise at any time. I commend former Secretary of Defense and former Congressman Don Rumsfeld for really delving into this issue in a very bipartisan commission. He had a very tough row to hoe. But he said we are going to get to the bottom of this and he did not stop until he had a unanimous report from his commission, some of whom were naysayers in the beginning, that said this danger is upon us and we better do something about it. He gave us the wake-up call, and we should be forever grateful to Don Rumsfeld for having the guts to get to the truth so we would have the facts to back up the need for this security for our country. 
   Unfortunately, U.S. espionage has shown that China has tremendously boosted its military space and missile capabilities. There is just no good argument against this resolution. 
   The bill has support from both sides of the aisle. It really shows that people are beginning to be aware that we have a security threat to the United States. This bill is not what many of the critics have said. It does not mandate a missile defense architecture. It does not authorize a particular funding level. It is not a production decision, and it doesn't lead to the signing of any contracts. Instead, it is a policy statement by the Senate of the United States. But it is an important step for our national security. 
   America, the innovative Nation that landed a man on the Moon, has built up an impressive array of antimissile technology. We have had a formal missile defense program since President Ronald Reagan launched SDI in 1983, and there were various antimissile technologies in research before that. An operational system is now within our reach. The experts say we could have one in 2 years, 3 years, perhaps 4. But because of misinformation, this promising system remains confined to the laboratory, and the Government has never taken the policy step that is illustrated in this bill. 
   As long as we continue to ignore this basic policy question, we won't have an antimissile protection for our country, nor an effective theater defense for our forces and allies abroad. We have a chance to take that first step, and it is time that we did this. 
   What do the opponents of a missile defense system fear so much that they will not even permit us to go forward to try to get the technology in place? The danger of ballistic missiles can no longer be ignored. The Clinton administration stubbornly sticks to the old ABM Treaty. 
   In a letter to Senator LEVIN on February 3, the President's National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger wrote:  
   ..... a decision regarding national missile defense deployment must also be addressed within the context of the ABM treaty and our objectives for achieving future reductions in strategic offensive arms through START II and START III. The ABM treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic stability.......  
   The letter promises a Presidential veto of this measure if it is passed in its present form. Our choice is clear. We deploy a missile defense system as soon as technologically feasible, or we hide behind a 25-year-old treaty with a country that no longer exists. In fact, many legal and treaty scholars believe that as a matter of international law, the treaty terminated when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. How anyone can believe that the ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability, when so many nations outside the treaty are flagrantly ignoring its principles, I do not understand, when nearly three dozen countries are building or transferring ballistic missile technology. How does the ABM Treaty protect us from high-tech missiles in North Korea, in Iran, in Iraq and in China? 
   In fact, Mr. President, the White House cannot even say who the treaty partner is right now. To solve that problem, the administration negotiated a new ABM Treaty, signed in 1997 in New York, that would make  Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan parties to the new treaty. It would also impose new limits on the most promising theater missile defenses, limits that were never envisioned in the ABM Treaty of 1972. The New York treaty would handcuff us, crippling our defenses. 
   Where is that treaty now? The Senate has gone on record on several occasions insisting that the new treaty be submitted for our constitutionally required advice and consent, but the 
   President has consistently refused to submit the treaty that would put new countries into it to the Senate for ratification. 
   Have we learned nothing from the Rumsfeld Commission report, from the test of a three-stage ICBM by North Korea that went right over Japan where we have thousands of troops on the ground, from the launch of Iran's Shahab-3, from China's own threats? Eight years after the fall of the U.S.S.R., we are still fighting the last war. We are basing our safety in the cold war strategy of arms control with Russia, coupled with deliberate vulnerability to missile attack. 
   Polls show that most Americans believe we have antiballistic missile protection. Can you imagine our country being vulnerable and not even taking the first step, the first step to a policy that says we are not going to leave ourselves open when countries are threatening that they have ballistic missiles that will reach our shores, based on an obsolete treaty that is not even in the best interest of Russia, which is the country that this administration says is the other party to the treaty? I think we would sit down with Russia, and it would be in both our best interests to have a defense for both of our countries from rogue nations that have already shown that they have ballistic missile capabilities, and some even have nuclear capabilities to put right on one of those ballistic missiles. 
   Mr. President, there is no responsibility any greater for the U.S. Senate than the security of our country. That we would not pass the Cochran-Inouye resolution immediately and go forward with a technology that would protect our country is unthinkable; it is unthinkable. Yet, we have seen a filibuster of this very resolution twice in the last year in the U.S. Senate. I urge my colleagues not to let one more day pass that this country is not in high gear, pursuing the security of our Nation and our forces in any theater in the field and our allies who depend on us for their protection as well. 
   Mr. President, we should not let another day pass or we will be walking away from one of the key responsibilities that Congress has, and that is to stand up to the President of the United States, to admit that the ABM Treaty is obsolete and no longer in the best interest of the former U.S.S.R., nor the United States of America, and to say we are going to protect the people of America and the troops that are fighting for our freedom wherever they may be in the world, that we would protect them from an incoming ballistic missile with nuclear, chemical or biological capabilities. That is the statement that we will be making if we pass the Cochran-Inouye bill. I urge my colleagues to do it, hopefully very soon, to start the first step. 
   This does not appropriate the money. It doesn't designate the authorization. It only says it is the policy of this country to go forward to make the technology something that will work and to put our very best minds on this issue. Then we will authorize it. Then we will appropriate for it. We cannot shirk this responsibility, Mr. President. 
   Once again, I thank Senator Cochran and I thank Senator INOUYE for being determined that on their watch we will do the right thing for the people of the United States of America and all of our allies, wherever they may need us in the future. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a point of important history in our Nation; that is, to commemorate this day 163 years ago, Texas Independence Day. 
   Each year, I look forward to March 2nd. This is a special day for Texans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day 163 years ago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great, great grandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of Washington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. The declaration stated:  
   We, therefore.......do hereby resolve and declare.......that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign and independent republic.  
   At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was hospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After declaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a constitution and organized an interim government for the newborn republic. 
   As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It would exact a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. For instance, when my great, great grandfather was there, signing the declaration of independence, and then, as most of the delegates did, went on eventually to fight the Battle of San Jacinto, he didn't know it at the time, but all four of his children who had been left back at home in Nacogdoches died trying to escape from the Indians and the Mexicans who they feared were coming after them. Fortunately, he and his wife, my great, great grandmother, had nine more children. But it is just an example of the sacrifices that were made by people who were willing to fight for something they believed in. That, of course, was freedom--freedom, in that instance, of Texas at that time. But that is something, of course, all Americans cherish greatly. 
   While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican troops were marching on the Alamo to challenge this newly created republic. Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis sent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. He knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he had only a very few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. Colonel Travis wrote:

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment later today which I hope can become a part of the bill and will be acceptable to the managers. I have been trying to work with everyone who is concerned about the military health care issue, and I look forward to having it be a part of this bill. 
   Today, I, along with one of my cosponsors, Senator EDWARDS from North Carolina, will talk about what is in this very important amendment. Both Senator HAGEL and Senator HELMS are also cosponsors of this amendment. 
   I have just finished touring every single base in Texas--Army, Navy, Air Force--and I have talked to young enlisted people, young noncommissioned officers, recruits. I went to Lackland and I talked to people who are in their first month in the Air Force. I talked to these young people, as well as people all the way up and down the line, about their concerns. Of course, we know that we are having the biggest retention problem that we have had in the military for a long time. In fact, for every pilot we keep in the Air Force, we lose two. We are also looking at tough recruiting. 
   We are looking for ways to say to our military personnel, we want you to come and be a part of our armed services because we are proud of the job that our armed services do; and we are saying to the experienced people in our military, we want you to stay because we need our experienced pilots and sailors and those who are on the ground. We need every one of you to stay in. 
   I talked about why they aren't staying in. First and foremost is pay. We are addressing that in the military bill of rights. Second to pay is health care. Health care is part of the package that we promised to our military personnel. It is part of the package that we say we are going to give to the military, to their families and to retirees. We say we will provide for your health care now and we will provide for it when you retire. That is part of the incentive for signing up for the military. 
   I became very concerned and started looking at the different military health care options. It differs around the country. TRICARE, which has been adopted by much of the military, is the system that really needs fixing. TRICARE says to community doctors, we will reimburse you to serve our military personnel. In fact, we have cut back on military health care facilities in the Base Closing Commission. There are fewer health care facilities, so we reached out into the community. 
   The problem is the bureaucracy. Getting a claim is causing the doctors to say, ``I don't need this, I can't deal with it. It is much worse than Medicare or any other government program with which we have worked.'' Doctors are saying, ``I'm not going to serve our military personnel.'' 
   If you are in the town of Abilene and you can't get a pediatrician for the children of the military personnel, this is a problem. 
   I, along with Senators EDWARDS, HAGEL and HELMS, have introduced a bill called the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 1999. This is the amendment that we are offering today. Basically, what the amendment does is require that benefits be portable across the regions established in the current system so that once you have a TRICARE coverage and you move--which we know our military personnel do every 2 or 3 years--you will be able to keep that coverage as you cross regions. That will make it much easier for our personnel to know exactly the kind of care they are getting. We would ensure that military coverage is comparable to the average coverage available to civilian Government employees, many of whom work side by side with our military personnel. We think it should be comparable. 
   Third, we minimize the bureaucratic red tape and streamline the claims processing. This is one of the big problems. It will not cost money to fix--and probably will save money. If we could streamline the claims processing, it will be easier for the Department of Defense, and certainly easier for the person who is getting this health care. It would increase reimbursement levels to attract and retain qualified health care providers. Now, this is an option with the Department of Defense, where they need to be able to increase the coverage. It would allow the Department of Defense to say, all right, as an incentive to get this coverage for our personnel in this area, we will increase the reimbursement levels. 
   Fifth, it would increase the revenues to military treatment facilities by permitting reimbursement at Medicare rates from third party payers. 
   Now, this is something that will be very important to our military hospitals, where they can get reimbursed at the Medicare level, or they can be reimbursed by Medicare through subvention. We want them to be able to do that. That will, in fact, help our Department of Defense get the same level of reimbursement into the military hospitals that anyone going to a civilian hospital would be entitled to. 
   So we are very hopeful that this amendment will just be accepted by the sponsors of the bill, because you can't have a military bill of rights that says we are going to deal with the biggest issues of recruiting and retention that we have in the military without addressing health care. 
   I want to commend the chairman and the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for getting this bill up and out as the very first piece of major legislation we are going to pass in this session. They are increasing the pay, and that is the key issue for most people in our military. And they are bringing the pension up to the 50-percent level. I applaud them for that. 
   I want to add a third element of the problems that our military are facing, and that is quality health care. We have more military families than we have ever had in the military before. Back in the old days, many of our people in the military, the personnel, were single. That is not the case today. Now most of them are married and most of them have families. So we must deal with that reality and make the military family-friendly if we are going to keep the good people of our country  who want to be married and have families, which is the normal thing that we would like for people to have the option to do. 
   So that is the crux of our amendment. I think it is a good amendment. I believe the Department of Defense will have a lot of latitude to work with this issue. But it must be addressed. We cannot have shoddy health care coverage that differs in different regions of the country, depending on what the military health care facilities are. If you don't have a military hospital in a city that has a military base, you have to provide for that health care. We want it to be good quality health care. 
   I will never forget when I was over in Saudi Arabia visiting an Air Force base with our personnel. We were talking to these fliers and asked, ``What is your biggest problem?'' One flier said, ``Senator, my biggest problem is that I called home yesterday and my wife was in tears because we have a sick baby and not a doctor in the city will serve our baby. That is the biggest problem I have.'' And I said, ``Wait a minute, that is a problem we can fix.'' 
   That is what the amendment that I and Senator EDWARDS and Senator HAGEL and Senator HELMS are offering today. We don't want one pilot in our military in Saudi Arabia or in Turkey or in Bosnia or in Italy or anywhere else to tell us that their biggest problem is that they called home last night and their wife is in tears with a sick baby who cannot get a pediatrician to see that baby. 
   So that is what our amendment will do. I appreciate the distinguished chairman of the committee allowing me to talk about this amendment. I really hope that he is going to accept this amendment because this could be the third part of the improvement that he is seeking, by increasing the pay, by increasing the pensions, and health care. I hope that we can do 
   this so that we can say truthfully to everyone that comes into a recruiting office that we are going to give you the health care, the pay, and the pension that will make this a great job, because we want you to serve our country and protect our freedom. 
   Thank you.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. I say to the distinguished chairman that we are obviously saying to the Department of Defense that we want to improve the TRICARE system if they find that it is feasible to do so. Obviously, they are going to have to find it feasible. But the priorities that are set will improve TRICARE and particularly allow immediately--well, when the amendment takes effect a year from now. But there will be no cost to allowing people to be able to go to another base and keep their TRICARE system in place. There is no cost in that.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to announce the cosponsors for whom I am offering this amendment. The cosponsors are Mr. EDWARDS, Mr. HAGEL, Mr. HELMS, Mr. FITZGERALD, Mr. COVERDELL, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. BINGAMAN, and Mr. SANTORUM. 
   Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think goes very well in the bill before us. This is a military Bill of Rights. This bill is going to try to help alleviate a very bad situation that we have with our military. Right now we are having a hard time recruiting. We have had the worst recruiting year in the Army for the United States since 1979. We are having a hard time retaining our best people. For every two pilots that we lose, we are only gaining one to replace those pilots. So you can see, if we are losing two pilots and gaining one, pretty soon we are going to have a pilot shortage in the Air Force, and the time has come. 
   It is also going to add to the expense of training the pilots in the Air Force. The Navy has had to lower its educational standards to recruit. This is not good. So many of us in Congress on a bipartisan basis said, What can we do? What can we do to make sure we are giving quality of life to those who are giving their lives to protect our freedom? What can we do to make it worthwhile for them? 
   The basic things we have heard that are a problem that cause us to lose personnel are pay, health care, and pension benefits. This bill, with our  amendment, will address all three. The bill before us today is a pay raise. It does increase pension benefits. But what it hasn't addressed until our amendment is health care. And when I go across my State or when I visit a base in Saudi Arabia, or Tuzla, Bosnia, I hear that people are worried about health care. They are worried that their families back home are not able to get the quality health care they need. 
   So the amendment that Senator EDWARDS and I are proposing today, along with all of our cosponsors, would reform the TRICARE system. It would require that benefits be portable across the regions that are established in the current system. 
   We all know that military personnel have to move every 2 to 3 years. We want them to be able to take the benefits of their TRICARE system with them when they go to another base. That costs nothing, but it certainly does help ease the transition for the military family. 
   We would ensure military coverage as comparable to the average coverage available to civilian Government employees. Many times on our bases we have civilian Federal employees working side by side with military personnel. We want them to have comparable health care. So within the bounds that the Department of Defense can produce, we want to try to make that comparable and equal if we can get it there. We want to minimize the bureaucratic red tape and streamline the claims processing. 
   One of the big complaints of the doctors who serve our military personnel from the community is that there is so much bureaucratic red tape that they can't get their claim, and it is not worth the hassle. So what happens? The doctor says, ``I'm not going to serve military families.'' 
   Well, we want to stop that right now. We would increase the reimbursement levels to attract and retain quality health care providers. Where a base city does not have the capability to attract pediatricians or OB-GYN or key areas of specialty to serve the military families, we want to authorize the Department of Defense to reimburse at greater levels in order to attract that service for our military families. That is what the amendment does. 
   We also allow our military treatment facilities, our military hospitals, to be reimbursed at Medicare rates from third party givers. This is not adding a cost. In fact, it will help these military hospitals to be reimbursed at a better rate so that they will be able to give better care to our military participants. 
   So that is what our amendment does. We think it is a good amendment, that the Department of Defense will be able to do some 
   of the things they have said they want to be able to do to get better health care in the TRICARE system, and our amendment will allow them to do it. 
   So I appreciate very much that the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee are supporting this amendment. I think it is essential to make a true improvement in the quality of life for our military to improve their health care benefits at the same time that we are giving them pay raises. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to the Senator from North Carolina, my cosponsor, Senator EDWARDS.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I really appreciate the one-on-one experiences that Senator EDWARDS has mentioned because that really brings it home, when that poor child started with a small rash and by the time she could get an appointment with a doctor the rash had covered her body. That is a terrible story, and I have heard stories like that as well. It is why I became interested in trying to fix a problem that was really hurting the military families and our ability to retain those military families. 
   Just last week I toured Lackland Air Force Base. That is the basic training base for all Air Force personnel. A young drill instructor came up to me and said, ``Senator, keep up the good work and fix TRICARE.'' I told him that we would. Certainly, this is the answer to that drill instructor, because he clearly was having a hard time getting care for his family. 
   In a letter that was written to me recently, a retired veteran explained the difficulties he was experiencing with TRICARE. But, he said, ``Senator,  please don't concentrate your efforts on my individual problems--this is a systemic problem *.*.*'' 
   It is a problem. We are losing access to care because of the nightmare associated with claims processing and the dismal rate of reimbursement for services. In fact, if you go to a smaller community that has a base, often you cannot see a heart surgeon because they just will not see a military person because they know the rate of reimbursement is so low. We cannot allow that to be the case for our military personnel. 
   General Dennis Reimer is the Chief of Staff of the Army. He recently said, ``This is about readiness and this is about quality of life linked together. We must ensure that we provide those young men and women who sacrifice and serve our country so well *.*.* the quality medical care that is the top priority for them *.*.*'' General Reimer said, ``We must help them or else we're not going to be able to recruit this high quality force.'' 
   When we are talking about readiness, we are talking about the high quality people that make up our Armed Forces and we are talking about keeping them. The last thing we want is a lot of great equipment but not people to run that equipment. 
   We have to realize that times have changed in the military. No longer are most of our military personnel unmarried. They are now married and they have families. They expect to have health care for those families and housing and good pay. That is what they expect, and that is what they deserve. We need to give it to them. 
   That is why our amendment is so important, to be part of adding to the quality of life of our military. We cannot allow the retention problems to continue to erode the powerful military that we have. Our military strength is based on people, good people, quality people, people who are dedicated, people who care about this country and want to protect it. They want to protect our freedom. If they are going to give their lives to protect our freedom, I think in return they deserve a quality of life for themselves and for their families that would make us all proud. 
   That is why Senator EDWARDS and I, Senator HAGEL, Senator HELMS, Senator FITZGERALD, Senator COVERDELL, Senator JOHNSON, Senator SANTORUM, Senator KENNEDY, Senator BINGAMAN, and Senator SESSIONS have come together on this amendment to try to add quality health care and improvements to the TRICARE system to the military pay raise and the pension improvements that are already in this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important resolution recognizing the Girl Scouts of America. 
   This year commemorates the 87th anniversary of the founding of this outstanding organization. On March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America became the first national organization for girls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress. 
   The Girl Scout Organization has long been dedicated to inspiring girls and young women with the highest ideals of character, conduct, and service to others to that they may become model citizens in their communities. 
   For 86 years, the Girl Scout movement has provided valuable leadership skills for countless girls and young women across the nation. Today, overall membership in the Girl Scouts is the highest it has been in 26 years, with 2.7 million girls and over 850,000 adult volunteers. I am proud to say that I, too, was a Girl Scout. 
   I am pleased to be joined by Senator MIKULSKI in introducing this legislation, which would designate the week beginning March 7, 1999, as ``National Girl Scout Week.'' I ask our colleagues to join us.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. If a university president, a minister or priest, general or admiral, or a corporate chief executive had engaged in a sexual relationship with an intern under his charge, he would lose his position, with scant attention paid to whether or not such a relationship were ``consensual.'' We place in certain individuals so great a measure of trust that they are seen as acting essentially in loco parentis. 
   The question before us today is: Should the President of the United States be held to a lower standard? 
   The answer is: No. To the contrary; we can bestow no higher honor than to select one individual to represent us all as President. In one person we endow the character of our nation, as the head of state and the head of government. 
   It's with great disappointment, but firm resolve, that I have concluded the President has not lived up to this high standard and that he should be removed from office. The House managers have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that, in addition to indefensible behavior with an intern, which was not illegal, the President engaged in the obstruction of justice and, as an element of that obstruction, committed perjury before a federal grand jury, which is. 
   This case began as an alleged civil rights violation of a young woman who came to the bar seeking justice. The Supreme Court unanimously decided to permit her case against the President to go forward. It was that case which led to the revelations regarding the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern. 
   Incredibly, an element of the President's defense is that we should take the long view. We are told by the President's defenders that we should not judge his actions toward one individual, in which he schemed to impede her ability to seek redress, because his overall actions on civil rights are so positive. We are asked not to judge his treatment of one woman, or two women, but to evaluate his policies that affect all women. 
   Would the President's defenders forgive a school teacher who molests a student, simply because the teacher's classes are popular and his students all go on to college? Should we ignore the police officer who personally enriches himself by accepting graft, so long as his arrest record is high? Would we look away from the corporate executive who illegally profits from insider information, as long as his shareholders are happy with the return on their investment? We would not sustain civil society for long with such moral relativism as our guide. 
   The President had it solely within his power to keep the country from the course on which it has been for the past year. First, of course, he could have chosen not to engage in the behavior in question. Having behaved as he did, though, and having been discovered, the President could have acknowledged his own actions and accepted the consequences. This could have been an honorable resignation, or an admission, contrition, and a firm resolve to take responsibility; with a request for resolution in a manner short of impeachment and trial. 
   Instead, the President chose to deny the allegations, and fight them with a coordinated scheme of manipulation and obstruction. He lied outright to the American people, to his close associates, and to his cabinet. An enduring image of this whole tale will be his finger-pointing lie to the American people, even after admonishing us to listen closely, because he didn't want to have to say it again. 
   Even in view of these actions, the President missed numerous opportunities to right this matter and get it behind him and the country. At virtually every opportunity, though, he chose an action that further prolonged the matter and led directly to his impeachment. 
   The President chose to impede the pursuit of justice by the Independent Counsel, who was given the authority to investigate this matter by the President's own Attorney General. 
   The President chose to construct a cover story with Ms. Lewinsky, should their relationship become public. 
   The President chose to direct his personal staff to retrieve items from Ms. Lewinsky that he knew were under subpoena in a federal investigation. 
   The President chose to seek the assistance of friends to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky, and to intensify that job search when it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky had become a target of the civil suit against him. 
   The President chose to lie to his staff about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky herself, with the expectation that these lies would become part of the public perception. 
   And, the President chose to lie before a federal grand jury about his actions with regard to some of the elements of obstruction of justice, including the concealment of the gifts that were likely to become evidence in the civil case against him. 
   As a result of these choices by the President of the United States, the Senate was left with no choice other than to confront the charges and hear the case pursuant to the President's impeachment in the House of Representatives. 
   In so doing, the Senate conducted a fair and expeditious trial. We rejected  the idea of an early test vote that would have truncated the process. We rejected the motion for an early dismissal. The Senate is fulfilling its Constitutional responsibility to hold a trial with a complete evidentiary record and a final vote on each article of impeachment sent to the Senate by the House of Representatives. 
   Through skillful use of the written record compiled by the Independent Counsel, videotaped depositions, and hard evidence, the House managers presented a compelling case. The case for perjury was difficult. The President's testimony before the Grand Jury was guarded. He was fully aware of the evidence the prosecutors had with respect to this case. He chose his words carefully. He admitted his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before the Grand Jury, but did so only after confronted with clinical evidence of its existence. 
   But he lied to the Grand Jury to deny other key facts. He perjured himself as an element of a broader attempt to obstruct justice. There are two false statements that are the most persuasive. First, when asked if he directed Betty Currie to retrieve gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, he stated unequivocally, ``No sir, I did not do that.'' 
   The facts are contrary to that allegation. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Betty Currie called her to suggest that Ms. Lewinsky give her the gifts. We have cellular telephone records that indicate a call from Ms. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky at about the time the gifts were picked up. It was clear that Ms. Currie initiated a retrieval of the gifts at the direction of the President, for this was the only source of information she had that there were gifts. The evidence is overwhelming that the President directed Betty Currie to retrieve these gifts. Thus, his statement is false. Not only is this perjury, it is obstruction of justice. 
   The President also lied before the Grand Jury about his conversations with White House aides regarding Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that ``I said to them things that were true about this relationship.'' We know this to be completely false from the testimony of Sidney Blumenthal, who stated directly and unequivocally that the President had lied to him about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
   The legal standard for perjury is high. Under Section 18 U.S.C. 1623(a), a person is guilty of perjury if he or she knowingly makes a false, material statement under oath in a federal court or Grand Jury. I believe these statements were false, intentional and material in that they attempt to put a false impression on key events in a series of attempts to obstruct justice. In effect, the President knew his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was shameful, but not necessarily illegal. But he knew his obstruction of justice was illegal--so he lied about it to a Grand Jury. 
   In many ways, obstruction of justice is even more corrosive than perjury to the machinery of our legal system. As the target of a grand jury and an independent prosecutor, the President has defended himself against charges of perjury by claiming he was caught off guard, was misinterpreted, was attempting to mislead but not lie. 
   Obstruction of justice, though, is a quite different matter. It is an affirmative act that occurs at the person's own initiative; in this case, the President. It involves actions taken that were not instigated by anyone else. 
   It has been said in his defense that the President did not initiate his perjury in that he was led to it by the prosecutor. But there is no similar argument regarding Article II, the Obstruction of Justice. Without the affirmative actions of the President, there would have been no Article II. 
   The President sought out Mr. Blumenthal to tell his misleading story about the nature of his relationship and the character of Ms. Lewinsky. 
   Separately, the President enlisted his personal secretary to further his obstruction of justice. He asked Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts. He summoned her to coach her testimony under the guise of ``trying to figure out what the facts were.'' He did so within hours after coming back to the White House on January 17th from his deposition in the civil sexual harassment lawsuit. He required a face-to-face meeting with her the next day, a Sunday. It couldn't be done over the phone, and it couldn't wait until Monday. It was clear he needed her to reaffirm his false testimony. This is obstruction of justice. 
   The edifice of American jurisprudence rests on the foundation of the due process of law. The mortar in that foundation is the oath. Those who seek to obstruct justice weaken that foundation, and those who violate the oath would tear the whole structure down. 
   Every day, thousands of citizens in thousands of courtrooms across America are sworn in as jurors, as grand jurors, as witnesses, as defendants. On those oaths rest the due process of law upon which all of our other rights are based. 
   The oath is how we defend ourselves against those who would subvert our system by breaking our laws. There are Americans in jail today because they violated that oath. Others have prevailed at the bar of justice because of that oath. 
   What would we be telling Americans--and those worldwide who see in America what they can only hope for in their own countries--if the Senate of the United States were to conclude: The President lied under oath as an element of a scheme to obstruct the due process of law, but we chose to look the other way? 
   I cannot make that choice. I cannot look away. I vote ``Guilty'' on Article I, Perjury. I vote ``Guilty'' on Article II, Obstruction of Justice.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill, along with 27 other cosponsors. The prime one is Senator BOB GRAHAM of Florida, who has worked very hard with me over the last year to make sure that the State tobacco settlements which our States have worked so hard to achieve will remain in control of the States because, in fact, the President's budget which was just released this week assumes that it will still seize $18.9 billion of the State tobacco settlement funds for Medicaid recoupment. Mr. President, that is just not right, and the bill I am introducing with Senator GRAHAM of Florida, Senator GORTON, and 26 others, on a bipartisan basis, will keep that from happening. 
   The bill is strongly supported by the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Conference of State Legislators, and several other groups.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, 46 States reached a settlement last November which added them to the other States that already had settled with the tobacco companies, making every State in America now in a settlement with the tobacco companies. These States have not just chosen to put the money that is coming in from the tobacco settlement on Medicaid and health care issues. There are myriad State issues that this money is going to be used for. But that is in limbo today because the President has given notice that he is going to seize this money from them. So everything is going to be held in abeyance until we settle this issue once and for all. 
   That is what our bill will do. There is no reason--no reason whatsoever--that we should take money from the Medicaid funds that go to the States which provide a safety net for the millions of low-income and disabled Americans who depend on Medicaid for their health care needs. We cannot allow that to happen, and we will not. 
   I intend to work with the cosponsors of this bill to find the first available vehicle to attach it so that we can make sure that this money that our States have worked alone to achieve, with no help from the Federal Government, will remain in their sole jurisdiction; that they will be able to make the choices on what their States need and not have dictated to them by the Federal Government what they will spend this money for. 
   Many States--I was talking to Senator ABRAHAM from the State of Michigan, and they are going to create scholarship funds for low-income students in Michigan, a very worthy cause. Other States are going to be doing education to try to encourage teenagers not to smoke. We don't want to substitute our judgment for the judgment that the States are making for their best and most important priorities. 
   So I am pleased to have the 28 cosponsors of this bill. I think we will pass it. I hope that we can do it quickly so that these States will have the freedom to spend this money on the much needed programs in those States. 
   I am happy to yield to Senator GORTON.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 1999. This bill is a first step to reform the military health care system known as TRICARE. We are trying to recruit and retain the best people for our nation's military. To do this, we must pay them better, maintain good retirement benefits and improve the health care we provide them and their families. 
   Mr. President, there is a growing perception among active duty military, their dependents and military retirees that the military health care benefit is no longer much of a benefit. We have not done a very good job of keeping the promise the government made to military personnel: That in return for their service and sacrifices, the government will provide health care to active-duty members and their families even after they retire. In the past 10 years, the military has downsized by over one-third, and the military health care system has downsized by one-third as well. While hospitals have been closed as a result of BRAC or downsized in the past decade, the number of personnel that rely on the military and the military health care system has remained constant. Today, our armed forces have more married service members with families than ever before. In addition, those who have served and are now retired were promised quality health care as well. 
   In place of the promise, these individuals and families have been given, instead, a system called ``TRICARE.'' TRICARE is not health care coverage, but a health care delivery system that provides varying levels of benefits depending largely on where a member of the military or a retiree lives. 
   Unfortunately, what we find is that the TRICARE program often provides spotty coverage. My offices and those offices of my colleagues in the Senate no doubt have received thousands of complaints regarding access to care, unpaid bills, inadequate providers and difficulties with claims. 
   For their part, the doctors who participate in TRICARE complain about a host of administrative problems including delayed payments and a very cumbersome claims process. Many doctors have simply left the program, and in some locations, there are simply no providers at all in certain specialties. This is unacceptable. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing this bill to improve the health care benefits under the TRICARE program by ensuring that the health care and dental coverage available under TRICARE is substantially similar to the health care coverage and dental care coverage available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. This bill will: 
   Raise reimbursement levels for TRICARE, the military health-care delivery system, to attract and retain more participating doctors to the program. 
   Expedite and reduce the costs of TRICARE claims processing, which has been a thorn in the side of both beneficiaries and providers. 
   Require portability of benefits between regions. This would make it easier for military personnel and their families to receive health care benefits when they travel to different regions. 
   Minimize the cumbersome pre-authorization requirements for access to care.

    Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the U.S. Energy Economic Growth Act. 
   Mr. President, the oil and gas industry in this country is in a state of crisis. In energy producing states, we are hearing daily from our constituents about this crisis. 
   This week the oil and gas rig count hit an all-time low of 588 rigs nationwide. This is down from nearly 5,000 rigs operating in 1981. Crude oil prices are at their lowest point in decades, and some think they will fall further. 
   According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, for every dollar drop in the price of oil, ten thousand Texas jobs are at risk. Last year, the energy industry lost 30,000 jobs in the United States. 
   Mr. President, not only is this an economic issue, it's a national security issue. We are importing more oil than we produce. This is not a healthy situation for shaping our foreign policy agenda. 
   To reverse these trends and increase our energy independence, I have worked, on a bi-partisan basis, to develop the U.S. Energy Economic Growth Act. 
   This legislation provides tax incentives in two significant areas to boost U.S. oil production. First, the legislation would provide a $3 dollar a barrel tax credit, on the first three barrels that can offset the cost of keeping marginal wells operating at a time of low prices. 
   Marginal wells are those that produce 15 barrels a day or less. On average, they produce two barrels a day. There are close to 500,000 such wells across the U.S. that collectively produce 20 percent of America's oil. To put this in perspective, we import 20 percent of our oil from Saudia Arabia. Texas, alone, has 100,000 marginal wells. Regrettably, 48,000 wells have been idled or shut in the past year. 
   In recent months, some marginal well producers report prices as low as $6 per barrel. If we don't act soon, these producers--and the thousands they employ--will go out of business. 
   These marginal wells can still be profitable for all of us. In 1998, these low-volume wells generated $314 million in taxes paid annually to state governments. 
   Second, Mr. President, the bill would provide incentives to restart inactive wells by offering producers a tax exemption for the costs of doing so. 
   In Texas, a similar program has resulted in 6,000 wells being returned to production, injecting approximately $1.65 billion into the Texas economy. 
   Mr. President, improving the production and flow from both marginal wells and inactive wells will do a great deal to improve our energy production. This is vital to improving the state of the U.S. oil and gas industry. 
   I am pleased that this legislation has 18 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle. I would invite all members of the Senate to join me as a co-sponsor. 
   This morning I testified before the Senate Energy Committee on this bill. Certainly that Committee recognizes the gravity of this situation. I would hope that, with the introduction of this bill, the Senate as a whole will begin to focus on this problem and we can begin finding solutions.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for talking about our very important congressional agenda. I was very pleased to hear the closing remarks from my colleague from Oklahoma, because I think one of the priorities of Congress has been laid right at our feet by the Senator from Oklahoma. And according to the Constitution it is the one major responsibility that Congress must perform--to provide a national defense for the United States and all of its citizens. That core responsibility has been jeopardized in the last 5 years because we have not kept up the investments needed to ensure that we keep and recruit the best people for our military. Equipment is deteriorating, and the big strategic defenses that are vital to our national security have not been deployed. Again, I am very pleased that the Senator from Oklahoma talked about defense, and I am going to add some things that I believe are necessary to regain and maintain a strong national in defense. 
   What we have seen with the President's State of the Union, and the congressional statement of priorities, are some places where we will be able to work together. While we can agree on some goals, I also believe there are some profound differences in how we get there. 
   The Republican plan is very simple while the President's plan is very complicated. It seemed like it was a new idea a minute. It was a shotgun approach to all of the major issues we face. I would like to take each one of those and show how we will be different and hopefully how we can come together. 
   Let us say, first and foremost, that our No. 1 priority is Social Security reform. I think that is also the President's first priority. How we achieve reform is going to be very different, because the President has opted for a big federalized plan whereas the Republicans in Congress are trying to say: We want people to be able to have their own retirement accounts. We want them to be able to make some of the choices in investing their Social Security taxes. And, most of all, we want people to be able to pass their retirement accounts onto their children. 
   This is a very important difference from the President's plan, which is to take 60 percent of the surplus and have the Government invest it in the stock market. While it might make Social Security more secure, I think it could have a disastrous impact on the stock market. The federal government could use its investments to micro-manage certain industries and markets. Free enterprise is the hallmark of our economy and having the government enter the stock market could pose a significant risk to the nature of our economy. 
   Tax relief. I think it is very important that we have simple, straight-forward tax relief for every working American family. Every working American in the Republican plan will get a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. In order to determine how this plan will benefit you, while you are figuring your taxes in preparation for the April 15th filing deadline, take 10 percent off of your tax liability; and that is what our tax cut will give you. Now, compare our tax cut plan to the President's very complex tax cutting proposals. His plan will add thousands of pages of new rules and regulations to an already burdensome and complex tax code. Only if you spend your money on his priorities will you get any tax relief. With our plan everybody wins. 
   Our plan puts more of the money in the pockets of the people who earn it, rather than giving it to ``Big Brother'' Government to decide how to spend the money you earn and you worked for. 
   Education: The primary difference between our education proposal and the President's proposal has to do with who is in control of the resources. Both plans seek to achieve the same goals, but ours would keep control with those who directly educate children--local school officials, principals, teachers, and parents. We have the same goals, but we will reach them in different ways. 
   The congressional plan is the right one for America. We are going to push ahead and hope that the President will work with us to reform Social Security and make it secure, to give tax cuts to hard-working Americans, and increase educational opportunity so that every child in America can get a good public education and reach his or her full potential.

   Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are finally getting to introduce bills today. This is, of course, the first day that we have had that option. I want to talk about the legislative priorities of the majority party in Congress as well as several of the bills that I will be introducing that I believe reflect those priorities. 
   The leadership of the majority in Congress has just had a press conference talking about the opportunity and the security that we are going to provide with our major bills and priorities this session. We are talking about Social Security reform, trying to make sure we have the security for those who have retired. We are going to add to that pension reform to give more Americans the opportunity to add to that Social Security base. Social Security is supposed to be a base, but every American ought to be adding savings, tax free, as an incentive to have retirement security. 
   We are going to address education as an opportunity, making sure that every child in America has a chance to succeed with a public education. By that, we are going to give more choices. I will introduce today a bill that I call Options for Excellence in Education, to try to replace the paperwork and bureaucracy of federal education programs with rewards for innovation, excellence, and choice.  
   In a bill that I will introduce today, the Options for Excellence in Education Act, we are going to give incentive grants to states and school districts that demonstrate exceptional educational progress and practices that translate directly into better student performance. The bill will also build upon a very successful program to place military veterans who wish to teach into schools where there is a need for qualified teachers by expanding the concept to include civilian professionals. Under the program, individuals with special skills and experience will be given stipend while they seek teacher certification under a streamlined state process so that they can translate those skills into benefits for students. We are going to give help to expedite certification so that if a retired military or civilian professional has the ability, for example, to speak Russian or French or has experience in computer science or math, and the school district has an unmet need for teachers with those skills, those professionals can enter the classroom much more easily and cheaply than they could otherwise. 
   And then we want to grade the ability of the schools through the ability of the children. If those schools that are in the bottom part of the achievement levels don't come up, we want to give more educational options for their students. States will be able under the bill to use federal funds for a variety of school choice options, including allowing students to attend another public school in their area, the expansion of charter schools, magnet schools, or even private school choice if that's what the state wants to do to give kids trapped in failed schools the chance to succeed. 
   Finally, the bill addresses the need for the construction of new schools that so many of our school districts are facing by giving tax incentives for the private construction or renovation of public schools in low-income and high-growth parts of our country. So that is what my Options for Excellence in Education bill that I am introducing today will do. 
   We in Congress must also address the issue of economic opportunity. More people in this country are paying more taxes than ever before in our peacetime history. Thirty-eight percent of the average American's salary goes to pay taxes to some government entity. Well, I want to give more of the money people earn back to them to spend as they wish. So one of our key priorities is going to be tax cuts. We are going to propose a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut for every American. 
   We are also going to supplement that by doing away with the marriage tax penalty. Why in the world do we have tax laws that say to people, if you get divorced we are going give you $1,400? That is essentially what we have today. Twenty-one million American couples pay $1,400 more, on the average, just because they got married. 
   So I am introducing two bills today to grant marriage tax penalty relief. The first will allow a married couple to split their incomes right down the middle, if doing so would be better for their bottom line tax liability. 
   The other option for married couples I am proposing to alleviate their tax penalty for having said their vows to just double the standard deduction. Today, the standard deduction for a married couple is $7,100. Instead, we would double the single exemption so it would be $8,500. These are things we can do to equalize the tax burden for those who choose to be married and those who choose to stay single. So certainly in the area of economic opportunity, tax cuts have to be our very first priority. 
   So we are going to try to do these things and also at the same time make sure that we have a strong national defense. Security for our country as a whole is the No. 1 responsibility of Congress. So we are going to immediately propose legislation to raise military pay. 
   I will also soon introduce a bill that will go beyond the important issue of pay, and address one of the critical quality of life factors facing our service men and women and their dependents--the quality of health care for military personnel and retirees. One of the biggest complaints that I get when I visit bases in Texas or bases overseas, when I am talking to our troops, is they worry about the health care of their families. They worry that their families are not getting the quality health care that they were promised, that they deserve, and that they must have. Beyond that, they worry about what will happen to their health care and that of their families if they make a long-term commitment and retire from the military. 
   So I am introducing a bill that will give more choices to our military families so that they can receive quality health care for themselves, and for their families, so that we can retain the best people in the military. We need to recruit better; we need to retain better. To do that, we must pay them a wage that is fair, more competitive with the outside civilian life, and we need to make sure they and their families have quality health care. 
   On top of that, we want to give them the equipment they need to do the job. 
   Senator WARNER, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is going to have a comprehensive bill that increases the spending on the equipment and on the technology for the future. The main technology that we want to deploy immediately is a missile defense system for our country. Senator THAD COCHRAN has introduced a missile defense technology bill in this Congress. Last year, he lost that bill twice by only one vote. He is going to be up front and center with an absolute priority for our missile defense technology, to go forward at the earliest moment that we can because we don't have a ballistic missile defense not only for our own country and our own shores, but we don't have an effective missile defense for our troops to protect them in the field wherever they might be in the world. That is not acceptable for the world's greatest superpower. 
   Mr. President, you can see that our priorities for this Congress are fairly simple: enhance the security and expand the educational and economic opportunities of all Americans. Security and opportunity. Security for America through a strong national defense. Economic security for every American to have more of the money they work so hard to earn, to give them more opportunities for retirement security, for better Social Security, and more pension options, and economic opportunity so that every child in America can fulfill his or her potential with a quality education. That is what sets us apart from every other country in the world--a universal, quality education system, which ensures that every child who works hard can reach his or her full potential. 
   We are eager to move forward with this agenda for security and opportunity for our country. We believe we have a solid agenda with good bills to back it up. And we are starting today. We are going to focus on the people's business. We are going to make sure that at the end of this year we can say we have given more Americans the money they earn back in their pockets, better retirement security with Social Security reform, and the feeling that they can be secure in the quality of both their national defense and educational systems. 
   I appreciate very much the opportunity to start talking about our agenda today, to introduce our bills, to get them into committee and to get started on the people's business.
