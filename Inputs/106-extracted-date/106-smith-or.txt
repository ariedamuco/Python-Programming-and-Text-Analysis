   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators MCCONNELL, TORRICELLI, FEINSTEIN, and ALLARD in the introduction of the Election Reform Act. I think this last election made it abundantly clear that the time has come to streamline and update our voting system's outmoded technology and procedures. As my colleague Senator MCCONNELL has pointed out, it is inexcusable that the world's most advanced democracy relies on voting systems designed shortly after the Second World War. 
   The Election Reform Act will combine the functions of the Federal Election Commission's Election Clearinghouse and the Department of Defense Office of Voting Assistance, which facilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into a single Election Administration Commission which will provide grants to states to modernize their voting procedures. It is important to note that the Commission will in no way usurp what is rightfully the responsibility of the states to determine the times, places and manner of holding elections. 
   The Commission will study Federal, State, and local voting procedures and election administration and will develop, update and adopt every 4 years, voluntary engineering and procedural performance standards for voting systems. In addition, the Commission will engage in ongoing studies of procedures and make periodic recommendations on the best practices relating to voting technology and ballot design. Another very important responsibility of the Commission will be to advise States regarding compliance with the requirements of the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act and develop, update, and adopt voluntary procedures for enhancing voting methods for voters, including disabled voters. It is imperative that, as we pursue improvements in the administration of our elections, we also have the most up-to-date information about new technologies to enable the elderly and the disabled to vote with the same degree of privacy and dignity enjoyed by other citizens. 
   Mr. President, I believe this legislation will go a long way toward restoring confidence in our voting systems, and I am hopeful that the Senate will pass the Election Reform Act very early in the new Congress. 
   Mr. SPECTER:

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Mrs. MURRAY, the Senator from Washington, for her kind words on behalf of our colleague and friend, Senator SLADE GORTON. 
   I am filled with conflicting emotions this morning. It is easy for me to come to the floor of the Senate to sing the praises of SLADE GORTON. It is hard for me to contemplate this place without him. As Senator MURRAY has detailed his history, I won't repeat it, but I do think it is significant that this good man comes from a family from New England but, like a delicious Washington apple, he is a product of Washington State. 
   SLADE often tells the story of Lewis and Clark coming down the Columbia River. They approached the Pacific on the Washington side. The first election that included minorities of African American, Indian descent, and female gender, took place on the shores of what we now know as Washington State. The decision before the party was whether to stay in Washington or whether to move to Oregon on the other side of the river. The vote was to move to Oregon. SLADE has always used that story as an example that the voters are not always right. 
   I have never shared the same conclusion with respect to that story, and I find it humbling to accede to the will of the majority in elections, as I do now, with the defeat of SLADE GORTON for another term. It is a hard decision, nevertheless, for me. 
   SLADE was also given to say that mountains divide and rivers unite. Truly, the Columbia River is one of many marvelous things that Washington and Oregon share together. It is the thing which has made of Washingtonians and Oregonians good friends for so many years. It is, perhaps, the greatest thing that brought SLADE GORTON and me together, a common interest in being good neighbors, a common interest in the values and uses of the river for both natural and human purposes. Oregon has lost a great friend at the end of the service of SLADE GORTON. 
   Time and again, I would appeal to SLADE in his powerful position on Appropriations to help the people of my State with appropriations that mattered to farmers, to fishermen, to foresters. He was always there, always anxious to help, always anxious to provide money for salmon restoration and for things that make the lives of all in the Pacific Northwest better.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to address concerns raised by a number of my constituents with respect to the Oil Pollution Act in the aftermath of the New Carissa incident. This legislation, the Fishermen and Aquaculture Oil Spill Assistance Act, is the first step toward ensuring that small businesses, such as the fishermen and shellfish producers in my state, who are impacted by these oil spills, are not victimized a second time by a lengthy claims procedure under the OPA. 
   For the benefit of my colleagues who are not aware of this incident, the New Carissa was a large wood-chip freighter that ran aground near Coos Bay, Oregon last year and leaked 60,000 gallons of oil. This devastated the coastal environment in that area, and temporarily damaged some of the important oyster beds for which Coos Bay is well-known in the seafood industry. In fact, we still have the ship's stern section sitting off-shore, marring the natural beauty of the Oregon coast. 
   Over the last several months I have heard from my constituents from that part of the Oregon coast, who are extremely dissatisfied with both the emergency response planning and the claims process under the Oil Pollution Act as it applies to aquaculture producers. With respect to the emergency response plans, the complaint has been that the concerns of shellfish producers are not necessarily taken into account in the development of these plans and that quick action in the early hours of a spill could protect the areas where the oyster beds are present. On the matter of the claims process, the complaint has been that there is little small businesses can do in the immediate term if the responsible party fails to make the interim payments to claimants required under the OPA. 
   This legislation addresses the concerns by authorizing the President to offer loans to fishermen and aquaculture producers who are mired in the claims process, but have not been receiving the required interim payments. This would help these small, often family-owned, businesses meet their most pressing expenses should the claims procedure become a drawn out affair. Secondly, this legislation calls upon the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study the claims process and the emergency response plans to determine if they adequately protect the interests of seafood producers and submit any recommendations to the Congress. Ultimately, my aim is to ensure that future oil spill incidents do not cause the same problems to others that oyster producers in Oregon have suffered following the New Carissa spill. 
   I am pleased that my friend from the Oregon delegation, Mr. DEFAZIO, intends to introduce a companion measure today in the House of Representatives. Over the upcoming holidays we intend to look over this matter again and reintroduce this legislation, after receiving further feedback from our constituents, early in the 107th Congress.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise as one Senator in this body  and as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to express the hope that by noon tomorrow the State Department will provide for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the document that it has rightfully requested so that it might know the truth with respect to the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement. 
   Since I have been a Senator these last 4 years, I have had occasion to meet with the Vice President and Mr. Chernomyrdin when they came to Capitol Hill to trumpet what was represented to us as the great successes of their relationship and our outreach to Russia and to help Russia in its transition to democracy. In every way possible, we have hoped to conduct our business with Russia on better terms than we have in the past. 
   I think it is appropriate for this Republican to say that, without question, no one should question the motives of Vice President GORE with respect to what he has tried to accomplish in this relationship. However, there is reason to believe that some of what has gone on with the best of motives may, in fact--I emphasize ``may''--have violated a law and a statute of this country, if not a constitutional requirement in article II of the Constitution that agreements be reviewed by appropriate congressional committees. 
   I am told that with respect to the Gore-Chernomyrdin relationship a House committee was informed. Congressman Hamilton said he received some information to that effect. DICK LUGAR, the Senator from Indiana, has said he knew in general terms what they were trying to achieve. 
   But then all of us were taken aback a couple of weeks ago by an article in the New York Times in which this agreement was specifically quoted. I do not know of any Congressman or Senator who has yet to say they have seen the particulars of this arrangement. That is the point of the Foreign Relations Committee's inquiry of the State Department. 
   Let me read briefly a sentence from that New York Times story that quotes what the Vice President pledges to do. He pledges to ``avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.'' 
   There is nothing in the Gore-McCain law of 1992 that allows the executive branch to unilaterally waive the law. Their duty under that law is to impose sanctions, and then to waive them if that is the judgment of the executive but not to do it in a way that keeps Congress in the dark and violates specific terms of American law. 
   Why should we care? Many of our friends on the Democratic side said this is all just about politics. You shouldn't be raising that now. 
   I point out to them that the Vice President, the executive, and the State Department have had 5 years to take this out of politics and to simply disclose, as is rightfully our right to know, those documents and those particulars as to agreements. 
   Some of my colleagues have said these aren't agreements; that these are understandings. If it quacks like a duck and waddles like a duck, to me it is a duck. 
   In my opinion, when you see specific responsibilities and considerations on both sides and end dates, folks, that is an agreement, and the Congress has a right--and particularly the Senate--to see this document, and in confidence if necessary. But we have a right to documents that have been requested of the State Department. 
   I hope that it exonerates the Vice President. But let me tell you why I am concerned that it may not. 
   The Washington Times, a week ago, ran a story in which a letter was leaked from the State Department--not by the Republican Party but by the State Department somehow to a reporter of the Washington Times--a letter from the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov. You have to read these words to, frankly, understand it and really believe it. I don't know how words can be any clearer that the administration is admitting to a violation of law. 
   This is what the Secretary wrote to the Russian Foreign Minister:  
   We have also upheld our commitment not to impose sanctions for these transfers disclosed in the Annex to the Aide Memoire. The Annex is very specific in its terms, and we have followed it strictly. ..... Without the Aide Memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws. This possibility still exists in the event the continued Russian transfers after the December 31 termination date.  
   Madam President, the Secretary of State has said here that they have violated the law. 
   What the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the majority in this party are asking for is to have the proof of the State Department's assurances to us that they haven't violated the law. That is all we are asking for. If they haven't, we will be glad to say that to the whole world. But 
   what we have received so far is their assurances that they haven't violated the law. 
   Guess what. I want to believe them. But I am entitled as a Senator to see the document so I might know that they have not violated the law as the Secretary of State has said. 
   Should we know that? I think we should. 
   Does that mean the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement isn't a good deal? I don't know that. It may be a great deal. 
   But it is not a deal where the means justify the ends to violate American law and treat the Senate with disrespect. It does not warrant that. We are a country of laws, and we need to obey them. 
   We are simply asking, as a signatory to this letter, that the administration comply with the law authored by the Vice President himself. 
   In addition to SAM BROWNBACK and myself, the signatories to this letter are the majority leader, TRENT LOTT, the majority leader whip, DON NICKLES, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, JESSE HELMS, JOHN MCCAIN, FRED THOMPSON, the chairman of Governmental Affairs, RICHARD SHELBY, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, JOHN WARNER, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and RICHARD LUGAR, who, by the way, wouldn't mind knowing the truth of what has been represented to him, too. He is curious about indeed what the facts are. 
   I regret that this is close to an election. I don't believe politics should be international. I think they should stop at the water's edge. But I think the responsibility lies with the administration to foster a bipartisan foreign policy. That is clearly not happening here. 
   We are entitled to know the truth. If the law has been complied with, this is over with. If it has not, then, frankly, that ought to be known by the American people as well. 
   Whether or not a Kilo-class submarine is a dangerous weapon, frankly, is a judgment the administration is entitled to make. But there may be other weapons on that, as the Secretary suggests, that were subject to sanctions. 
   We have a right to know whether or not we have been treated as mushroom farmers--keep them in the dark and shovel the manure on them. 
   That is not how it is supposed to work--not according to our Constitution, not according to our statutory law and various provisions. 
   We are entitled to know the truth. As one Senator, I plead with the State Department to show us the documents and this goes away. But you have to show us the documents. We are owed it. We deserve it. We are entitled to it. It ought to happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to speak to the important issue of conservation in agriculture. I am pleased to join with my friend from Iowa, the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator HARKIN, on the introduction of the Conservation Security Act. The introduction of this legislation represents the culmination of a great deal of work on the part of Senator HARKIN and his staff to explore new ways to address the needs of American farmers in the area of conservation. With the debate over a new farm bill on the horizon for the next Congress, I think it is important that we begin this dialogue now to consider how federal programs for farmers can be made more flexible and, frankly, more relevant, to farmers throughout the country. 
   As some of my colleagues know, I come from rural Eastern Oregon. In my part of the State, which is noted for its wheat farms, it is often said that every day is Earth Day for farmers. And every year, as more and more farmland is lost to development, people from both urban and rural America are starting to realize how much a friend to the environment our farmers are. Farmers have long recognized their direct dependence upon the land and the blessings of nature for their livelihoods, and, as a result, are some of the best stewards of the land in this country. I think you will find, Mr. President, that when it come to environmental stewardship measures, farmers are almost always willing to step up to the plate to do their part, provided that they can still make a living. Too often, I believe they are simply told through regulation what they can or cannot do with their land. Not enough attention is paid to the real impact of such regulation on the farmer's bottom line or on the relative competitiveness of U.S. Agriculture to foreign competition. What good does it do for the environment to drive farmers out of business only to trade farmland for strip malls? We all know there is a place for common sense environmental regulation, but I don't believe we have done nearly enough on the incentive side of the coin. 
   The Conservation Security Act is a bold step toward filling the gap in our current federal farm conservation regime. Simply put, this legislation offers compensation to farmers for voluntary conservation activities performed on land that is in agricultural production. Several aspects of this approach are significant improvements over the conservation tools available to farmers today. 
   First, this legislation recognizes that there are a number of things that are beneficial to the environment that farmers can do short of simply idling their land. Adopting an integrated pest management plan that reduces pesticide use, or using soil-conserving rotational crops are just two examples of environmentally sensitive measures farmers can take while their land is still under production. Most of our spending for conservation programs at the federal level is geared toward paying farmers to set aside environmentally sensitive land altogether, such as under the Conservation Reserve Program. While such programs serve an important need, they don't address the range of conservation activities that farmers can, and often do, on their land in production. The Conservation Security Act fills this need in conservation programming and offers farmers the flexibility of choosing from amongst three tiers of conservation measures. 
   A second significant feature of this legislation is its applicability to all farmers, not just program commodity producers. I come from a state that produces everything from blueberries to potatoes to hazelnuts and nearly everything in between. These specialty crop producers need to have conservation options too. I am pleased to note the Conservation Security Act is open to all farmers in the nation. It is critical that the next farm bill more effectively addresses the needs of specialty crop producers in this area. 
   Finally, I have to note the potential for this legislation to help address the current farm crisis that is affecting so many of our family farmers. Those of us from agricultural states know too well the difficulties our farmers have faced in recent years, with the cost of production often exceeding the price paid for their commodities. While I believe a number of unusual circumstances have contributed to this problem--such as the Asian economic crisis--I also recognize that we must develop a more effective income support mechanism that the ad-hoc emergency farm spending packages we have relied upon in recent years. An investment in conservation, such as outlined in the Conservation Security Act, could contribute to that end. 
   In summary, Mr. President, I believe the Conservation Security Act has great potential to address crying needs of farmers all across the nation, while encouraging enhanced environmental stewardship. These are goals I think we should all agree on when it comes to farm policy. Over the upcoming recess, Senator HARKIN and I will seek more input from the agriculture community  as well as other interested colleagues on this important legislation. The Conservation Security Act offers a serious attempt to address the conservation needs of farmers as well as the troubling overall decline of the family farm in this country. I urge my colleagues to give in their consideration over this recess and look forward to reintroducing this legislation at the beginning of the next Congress as the debate over the next farm bill begins in earnest.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Savage Rapids Dam Act of 2000, which is cosponsored by my colleague Mr. WYDEN. This bill would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide for the installation of pumps and removal of the Savage Rapids Dam on the Rogue River in the State of Oregon, and for other purposes. 
   Introduction of this bill follows months of negotiations between the Grants Pass Irrigation District, which owns the dam and has received water from it since 1921, federal and state agencies, and other stakeholders in the Basin. Removal of the dam, following the installation of modern electric irrigation pumps, will resolve the ongoing issues related to fish passage at the facility. 
   Early on, I made a commitment to help the District resolve the controversies surrounding the dam in a manner acceptable to the District and its patrons, and in a way that left the District economically viable. This bill achieves both those goals. 
   In December 1999, the board of directors of the Grants Pass Irrigation District adopted a resolution outlining the proposed settlement of disputes relating to the dam. The patrons of the district subsequently voted to adopt the settlement at the beginning of the year. The settlement supports dam removal, but only following the installation of irrigation pumps. The proposed settlement had several other components that have been addressed in the crafting of this legislation. 
   I realize that it is late in the 106th Congress to be introducing legislation. However, I felt that this was the most effective way to focus attention on this proposal. Despite our best efforts to communicate with all interested and affected parties, I believe introduction of the bill at this time will enable us to gain valuable feedback before the start of the next Congress. This will enable us to reintroduce the bill early next year. 
   I recognize that dam removal proposals can be controversial. This facility, however, is not a large multi-purpose dam. It does not generate electricity, and provides no flood control. It does not affect commercial navigation. There will be an impact on flat-water recreational opportunities, so the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the State of Oregon and the counties of Josephine and Jackson to identify and implement recreation opportunities. The bill includes an authorization of 2.5 million dollars for the federal share of these recreation facilities. 
   I look forward to working with the Grants Pass Irrigation District and the other stakeholders to bring resolution to the disputes that have gone on for several years now. This is an opportunity to restore salmon and maintain an agricultural way of life for the patrons of the District.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I will not speak but a minute, along with my colleague, Senator WYDEN. He and I come to the floor to celebrate what Senator CRAIG will do later this evening by unanimous consent, and that is passage of H.R. 4828. It has to do with the high Steens area of southeastern Oregon. It is a beautiful and pristine area. 
   What we have done is truly bipartisan and truly historic in that the Sierra Club and the Oregon Cattlemen's Association enthusiastically support it. They support it because this has been a product of dialog and not Executive dictate. This has come about because people of good will have said: How can we protect the environment and protect the people as well? We have accomplished that in this bill. We are creating 170,000 acres of wilderness and providing other places for people to pursue their ranching lifestyles, and we are preserving the economy of Harney County. 
   I thank all of my colleagues--my colleague in the Senate, Senator WYDEN; Congressman WALDEN; all of the Oregon Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike; and the Governor of Oregon as well; and Secretary Bruce Babbitt who worked with us in good faith to make this possible. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, moments ago, by unanimous consent, the Senate passed H.R. 4828, the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act. This bill, supported by the entire Oregon delegation, is a very unique piece of legislation to enhance the protection of Steens Mountain in Southeastern Oregon, while preserving the local ranching economy. 
   As the sponsor of the Senate companion bill, S. 3052, cosponsored by my colleague, Senator WYDEN, I am here to thank my colleagues for the swift consideration of the House-passed bill.This bill enjoys broad support, ranging from the local community officials and the Oregon Cattlemen's Association, to Oregon Trout and the Sierra Club. 
   For those of my colleagues who have not had the good fortune to visit this special place, the Steens Mountain area in southeastern Oregon is a unique geologic formation that is home to a wide diversity of flora and fauna. The Steens Mountain fault block stretches sixty miles. It rises to an elevation of 9,700 feet and drops 5,500 feet in three miles to the historic lakebed of the Alvord Desert. 
   The federal lands on Steens Mountain are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. There is significant private ownership in the area, with over 270 separate landowners controlling about one-third of the land. There are several large ranching operations that graze both public and private lands in the Steens Mountain area. 
   Faced with multiple landowners, and a wide range of views on how best to protect the land, we finally crafted a great bill that enjoys local and national support, and that the President has indicated he will sign. 
   Through this bill, we are going to designate over one hundred and seventy thousand acres of wilderness. We are permanently removing cattle from over a hundred thousand acres in the High Steens. We will permanently withdraw over 1.1 million acres, including the Alvord Desert, from mining and geothermal development. We are also creating innovative management tools, such as a Redband Trout reserve and a Wildlands Juniper Management Area, to respond to the diverse stewardship needs of the Steens and the wildlife that finds its home there. 
   Mr. President, it was no easy task to achieve such wide-ranging environmental protection in my state without decimating the way of life of an entire community, and without creating more distrust of federal land management policies. This solution, though, works for the land and the people, rather than trying to make the land fit an existing management classification. 
   The best way to preserve special places like Steens Mountain, with significant private ownership, is not to force people off the land or to buy them all out. It is to ensure that open spaces are preserved in private ownership, and to provide incentives for the preservation of these open spaces. After all, it is the stewardship of this area by the private landowners over the last one hundred years that makes Steens Mountain the special place that it is today. 
   For over a year now, the entire Oregon congressional delegation and the Governor have worked closely with the Secretary of the Interior and stakeholders to achieve one primary goal: the preservation of Steens Mountain for future generations of Americans while ensuring that the ranchers can pass their ranches down to their children and grandchildren. 
   At the risk of leaving someone out, I would like to take a moment to mention some of the people who have contributed to this landmark process. I want to thank all of the Members of the Oregon delegation, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, and all the dedicated staff members who worked on this bill--especially Valerie West, my Natural Resources Director, as well as Kurt Pfotenhauer and Matt Hill of my staff; Lindsay Slater, and Troy Tidwell in Congressman WALDEN's office; David Blair, Josh Kardon, and Sarah Bittleman in Senator WYDEN's office; Amelia Jenkins with Congressman DEFAZIO; Chris Huckleberry with Congresswoman HOOLEY; Michael Harrison with Congressman BLUMENAUER; and working on behalf of Governor Kitzhaber--Kevin Smith and Peter Green. In the Secretary of the Interior's office, I want to extend thanks to Molly McUsic and Laurie Sedlmayr. I also want to recognize the work of Mike Menge, David Dye, and David Brooks of the Senate Energy Committee, who helped bring this legislation before the Committee and to the floor of the Senate. 
   There are also many in Oregon that have been essential to this process. First and foremost, those who live in the shadow and beauty of Steens Mountain, and who will continue to act as its stewards: Stacy Davies, Fred Otley and Charlie Otley. There are also those who have represented the various environmental groups in Oregon: Bill Marlett, Andy Kerr, Sybil Ackerman, Jill Workman, and Jim Myron. 
   Mr. President, this bill is a historic achievement that will protect a mountain and a way of life that are deeply intertwined in the spirit of the American west, and I thank my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am very pleased that the distinguished Senator from Utah has recognized the need to address the important issue of post-conviction DNA testing at the federal level and am proud to join his efforts. Senator HATCH's Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement Assistant Act is an excellent bill that has the strong support from law enforcement officials. It will provide much-needed funds for law enforcement authorities to analyze convicted offender DNA samples and DNA evidence gathered from crime scenes. 
   However, it has become abundantly clear over recent years that funding is not the only problem in the post-conviction DNA testing debate. In determining guilt and innocence, our criminal justice system occasionally makes mistakes. It is our responsibility to take every reasonable measure to prevent miscarriages of justice. Perhaps the gravest injustice that could occur is wrongful imprisonment of an innocent person. Ensuring that all defendants have access to competent counsel would go a long way to minimize the risk of unjust incarceration. 
   Some will say that there is no problem, or that it is so rare as to be negligible, or that we do not yet know the true extent of the problem and should not introduce legislation until we do. I strongly disagree. Although officers of America's courts and law enforcement work extremely hard to ensure that the true perpetrators of heinous crimes are caught and convicted, there have been errors that have sent innocent men to death row--innocent people like you and me who did not deserve to be there. While some states, like my home State of Oregon, work hard to ensure that defendants are represented by competent counsel, other states clearly do not. Without a federal standard, there is a real risk that innocent people tried in states without adequate standards for defense counsel could be unjustly incarcerated, or in rate cases, even sentenced to death. Setting federal standards for competent counsel for all defendants is a very reasonable step to make sure that our system of criminal justice operates fairly regardless of where you live. 
   Senator LEAHY and I have introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which would address the vital issue of competency of counsel, among other things. Although the Criminal Justice Integrity Act, as introduced, does not address the issue of competency of counsel, Senator HATCH has promised to work with me and others to consider this issue when any post-conviction DNA testing legislation is considered in the Senate. I commend Senator HATCH for his interest in this matter, and for his willingness to work with me to produce a bill that will truly make a good system even better.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have listened to the debating back and forth on the issue of whether we do H-2A or H-1B. 
   I would like the American people to know that I think there is a lot going on behind the scenes. I think there is a lot that needs to happen behind the scenes, and quickly because both of these issues are legitimate issues. I believe America needs to make up its mind whether we want the high-tech industry to remain an American industry. It is vital to our economic good, and we are all proud of it. We all want to encourage it. We need to help the high-tech industry by raising the H-1B visas temporarily. Otherwise, this is an industry that is prepared to move to other shores. I would rather they remain on our shores because I think it does us an enormous amount of good. 
   In my State, and in the State of the Senator from Nevada, and so many States, we are seeing small businesses thrive with the development of this new technology. 
   But I also want to speak to the need that we not abandon the cause of the Hispanic and Latino workers. There are many proposals right now addressing their needs. 
   I happen to be a cosponsor of a bill, being argued by many on the other side of the aisle, which help these workers. 
   I think it is a crying shame that we have people living in the shadows of our society right now. These are people who are here; yes, many of them illegally, probably well over a million, and maybe as many as 2 million people who are working primarily in agricultural industries. These illegal workers have infiltrated many other industries as well. They have been here for a decade and more. Many people worry that if Congress addresses the worker shortage in agriculture, more illegal workers will come. I have news for them. They have already come. They are here. They live among us and contribute to our economy. They are contributing to our tax rolls, frankly, without the benefit of law. 
   I believe Republicans and Democrats ought to find a way as human beings to reach out to the illegal farm worker community. If it isn't with amnesty, there are ways we can allow them to be here legally. 
   A lot of people say we have no worker shortage in agriculture. I tell you that we don't if you include all the illegals. But we owe something better to these workers and something better to their employers than an illegal system. 
   It is a crying shame, and we ought to be ashamed of it in the Senate, and do something about. 
   I know Speaker HASTERT is working on this issue in the House. I believe our Senate leadership is working on it here. 
   But I am in a dilemma. I will admit it right here on the floor of the Senate. I want to help the high-tech industry by providing them with highly skilled temporary workers, but I also want to help the workers in the agricultural industry who contribute to our economy and deserve our attention as well. 
   I hope that our leadership will respond quickly to the needs of the agricultural industry, as well as the dignity its workers deserve. 
   I see our leader is on the floor. I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take this opportunity to thank  my colleague, Senator GREGG, for his leadership on this important legislation. 
   I rise today to lend my support to S. 2341, the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000. One of my top priorities as a United States Senator has been to provide equal access to high quality public education for all children, including those with special needs. My commitment to education for those with special needs began while I was a State legislator and worked with the Oregon Disabilities Council to ensure that children with special needs had equal access to a quality education. I have continued that work here in the Senate, but realize that we have a long ways to go. 
   This legislation takes a step in the right direction by funding the federal mandates put forth in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). These federal funds will free up state and local dollars that can then be used in the classroom for new textbooks, pencils and computers that are necessary for students to learn. 
   In 1954, the Supreme Court established, in Brown v. Board of Education, that all children are guaranteed equal access to education under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Despite this decision, it was estimated that one million children with disabilities were being denied access to public education. It was not until 1975, with the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, that equal access to education was extended to children with disabilities. 
   The purpose of the 1975 IDEA legislation was ``[T]o assure that all children with disabilities have available to them, a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet the unique needs, to assure the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.'' 
   With the passage of IDEA the federal government promised to assist states with 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for disabled children. Based on the national average per pupil expenditure for the year 2000, 40 percent of that average would represent approximately $2,500 per student. However, since 1975 the federal government has not met this commitment. In fact, the federal government gets an ``F'' in arithmetic in this instance, currently paying only 12.7 percent of the per pupil expenditure. 
   But, we are slowly working to improve this grade. In 1997, funding for IDEA was only $2.6 billion. In the last 3 years, the Republican-controlled Congress has nearly doubled Federal funding on IDEA to approximately $4.9 billion. Although Congress has allocated more money to IDEA, current funding levels are 3.1 times less than what is needed to fully fund the forty percent commitment. 
   The purpose of providing this additional funding to the IDEA program is to free up local and state dollars. Currently state and local education agencies have been forced to divert their precious resources to pay for the additional costs, due to federal mandates, of educating children with disabilities. 
   As a result, Washington has created an inappropriate and unfair conflict between children with disabilities and children without. We owe it to all children to live up to our responsibility and resolve this conflict. 
   This important legislation would take a step in that direction by authorizing funding for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to reach the Federal government's goal of providing 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure to assist states and local education agencies with the excess costs of educating children with disabilities. 
   By steadily working to increase IDEA funding to $2 billion each year annually until 2010, Congress would increase opportunity and flexibility for local school districts to fund the programs that they feel are best for their students, whether it be school construction, teacher training or smaller classrooms. 
   I was pleased to see that the House of Representatives passed similar legislation, H.R. 4055, on May 3, 2000 with a 421-3 vote. It is my hope that the Senate can follow the strong lead of the House and work for swift passage of this necessary legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise to express my support for S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. This bill, which authorizes numerous Army Corps of Engineers' programs throughout the Nation, is of vital importance to my state of Oregon. 
   Oregon has both coastal and inland ports that rely heavily on the technical assistance provided by the Corps' programs for their continued operation. Dredging and flood control activities are also important to the economic vitality of Oregon. The Corps also operates a number of dams in the Columbia River basin and the Willamette River basin that generate clean hydroelectric power.

   Mr. SMITH. I am very glad that you asked that question. First let me explain what subsection (h)(3) does. Subsection (h)(3) requires the issuance of programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved by guiding the implementation of the project implementation reports. 
   Confusion was raised due to the wording that we used in the bill as reported. In order to clarify section (h)(3)(B)(i), we deleted the words ``provide guidance.'' Despite the change in the manager's amendment, the report language for this section is still relevant, and reflects the committee's interpretation of this section. It is still the committee's intent that in developing the programmatic regulations, the Federal and State partners should establish interim goals-expressed in terms of restoration standards-to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan may be evaluated through the implementation process. The restoration standards should be quantitative and measurable at specific points in the plan implementation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was not intending to speak on education, but I want to respond to my friend from Nevada. I am a junior Member of this body, but the perception of what has gone on here with respect to education is utterly different than my observation. 
   My observation is that this side of the aisle is anxious to talk about education, not just to throw more resources at the status quo, not to put up roadblocks to real reform but to truly find out ways to make Washington less of a burden upon local education. 
   I have yet to go into a school district in Oregon and ask, ``Where are your problems?'' and they don't tell me it usually has to do with some Federal mandate. The truth is, what we are trying to do is empower local folks who understand about educating children and to lower the burden of Washington. 
   This idea of 100,000 teachers is great, but everyone should understand that is about sloganeering; that is about TV ads. That has nothing to do with educating kids. The truth is, we need an awful lot more than 100,000 teachers; We need 1 million teachers; but we ought to trust people locally to be able to make that judgment whether to build a school or to hire a teacher. We should not tie their hands. That is what has gone on, and the record should reflect that as well. This Republican is prepared to vote for a lot more resources, but he thinks we owe it to the parents of this country to give them reform as well. 
   Mr. President, I came here in morning business to try to interject myself into the debate on PNTR.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I say to the Senator, I do think we should debate it longer than we have. I grant you that. What I have observed, as a junior Member, however, is that every time we go to focus on amendments, we can't get time agreements. We can't get agreements on some reasonable amount of time. Look, I have already taken all the gun votes. I will take them. I am for background checks. I am for things that will protect kids in the classroom. But I do not know why I should be asked to vote on them two and three and four times. 
   How many times do you need a vote to run a political ad against me? The truth is, I have taken the votes. Let's get on to debating education. We have done the gun debate.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It seems fair to me, I say to the Senator. I will certainly encourage my leadership to accede to that. What I am afraid of is the comment I read in USA Today, where Senator DASCHLE said: We are not interested in getting anything done. We are interested in obstructing this place and creating a train wreck because we think that is good politics. That really concerns me. 
   I have to tell you, I am always optimistic, but I am discouraged by the windup scene I am seeing develop here. We owe the American people something better than this. I think we need to get on to some reforms. I, for one, am committed to a generous and bipartisan effort in that regard.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4444, a bill establishing permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China. 
   I strongly believe that permanent normal trade relations will have a substantial and long-term political, economic, and national security benefit for our country. I have long maintained that as China becomes a member of the global community, its government and its people will benefit from these changes and the United States will benefit from better relations and, eventually, I believe, from a more liberal and less oppressive government. 
   Much of China's recent past has been marked by progression and regression, starts and fits toward economic liberalization that impact all levels of society, only to be matched by periods of oppression, when the government feels  that things are getting out from underneath its thumb. This one-step-forward, two-steps-back pace shows how truly feared the market place is in a Communist country. And I believe that if you are a true Communist, you do fear the marketplace. For it is that marketplace--the private sector--that will eventually prove to be the downfall of the Communist system in any country. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I am genuinely and deeply concerned about human rights abroad. For that reason, I traveled to China last year to investigate the human rights situation and to determine the state of religious freedom in that country. WTO membership and normal trade relations with China will eventually improve the human rights situation and, I believe, religious freedom in that country. The past few decades' gradual opening of trade, investment, and cultural exchanges with China have led to positive steps in the area of human rights and religious tolerance. That is not to say that all is well. There is much work to be done in the area of human rights, but on balance a ``carrot and a stick'' approach is better than the stick alone. 
   Globalization is part of ``the carrot.'' It is globalization--the economic integration of their economy--that will introduce the Chinese people to new ideas and information. I believe that as a free market economy, we have a moral and ethical obligation to other nations to help them move toward free markets and into the global economy. Our own history shows the results of not pressing for this integration. During the late 19th century and also following World War I, our negligence in integrating both Japan and Germany had horrible results that reverberated through much of the 20th century. We must not make the same type of mistake with China. 
   The economic benefits to the United States of H.R. 4444 are great. Our markets to a great degree are already open to Chinese goods; this legislation will open their markets to our goods. This is good for America. And it is good for the people of my home State of Oregon. In the first year following China's membership in the global economy--economists predict trade will double with the United States. China is the sixth-largest market in the world for American agricultural products--and following WTO membership, that trade will account for one-third of the growth in exports over the next 10 years. In addition, according to the World Bank, China will spend an estimated $750 billion in new infrastructure over the next decade. 
   This is wonderful for the United States, but let me take a moment and tell you what it will do for Oregon. My State is the Nation's largest producer of solid wood products and an important agricultural exporter. China's accession to the WTO and normal trade relations will benefit: 
   Wheat.--Oregon is a large wheat-growing State and China's grain policies will become more market-oriented. In addition, the 1999 U.S.-China bilateral trade agreement resulted in more exports of Northwest grain. 
   Vegetables.--Oregon is a major producer of beans, corn, and onions. Under the new agreements, tariffs on vegetables will drop by up to 60 percent. 
   Fruit.--Oregon grows berries, pears, cherries, and plums. China will reduce tariffs by up to 75 percent for fresh and processed deciduous fruit; and tariffs on apples, pears, and cherries will fall from 30 percent to 10 percent. 
   Solid wood.--China is the world's third-largest wood importer and after WTO accession, it will substantially reduce its remaining tariffs on valued-added wood products within the next 4 years. 
   Much has been said on the floor of the Senate in these past few weeks regarding normal trade relations with China. I have to confess that I do not think the arguments against this legislation stand on their own merit. Most of what I have heard in opposition to NTR has reflected the desire to punish China, the need to sanction China or the need to block China. 
   Those opposing this legislation have formed their arguments around the conclusion that NTR is really just a great plum for China and benefits only China. Nothing could be farther from the truth. As I previously stated our markets are already open to the Chinese--we already buy Chinese goods. This legislation will open up their market and it is a vast pool of consumers, to our goods. It benefits the United States economy. This debate is about advancing American values halfway around the world. Ninety-nine years ago Teddy Roosevelt, speaking at a state fair, said: ``There is a homely adage which runs `Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far,' '' At that time, the big stick meant America's warships and a show of American might abroad. Now the stick means America's economic might and American values. Free and fair trade is the weapon--the economic weapon of the 21st century. 
   It is free and fair global trade that will strengthen the forces of economic and political reform in China. It is free and fair global trade that will bring greater prosperity to both the United States and the Chinese people. It is free and fair global trade that will bolster human rights and improve religious freedom in that country. America can advance its values and help China integrate into the world economy with the help of this important legislation. I call on my colleagues to send a clean PNTR bill to the President and ask for his swift signature.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak to the Senate today in strong support of S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-determination Act of 2000. As an original co-sponsor of this legislation, I commend Senator CRAIG and Senator WYDEN for their leadership in crafting a bill which brings all sides of the issue together. I want to take a minute to salute Oregon's county commissioners, who kept this issue on top of their priority list, and who made frequent trips to meetings in Oregon and here in Washington, D.C. to make sure this legislation moved forward. Oregon is a remarkably diverse state, but as I have traveled throughout Oregon, I hear the same thing in each of our 36 counties--and that's the fact that passage of S. 1608 is their number one priority. I also want to thank President Clinton for his statement that he will sign this legislation when it reaches his desk.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I am here today at the request of my leader. I am here today to talk to the people of Oregon and to the American people. 
   I am often asked in townhall meetings why it is that we don't seem to be getting much done. Every time people turn on C-SPAN they see Republicans and Democrats bickering. I have said to them: I know it is frustrating. I know you do not like it. I know it sometimes isn't pleasant. But, frankly, rather than criticize it, we ought to celebrate it because this is the way we go about the business of government of a free people--of exchanging ideas, and using words as our weapons and not actually bullets. 
   This contest between Republicans and Democrats is not an unhealthy thing. But I must admit to the American people and to the people of Oregon that what I see happening on the Senate floor right now is nothing to be celebrated. 
   I came to the Senate looking for solutions--not looking for a fight. I don't mind a good debate. I don't mind differences of opinion. I don't mind taking tough votes. Frankly, I have learned that the tough votes are sometimes the most memorable because they are difficult. They set you apart. They make you come to a choice. Like Senator BENNETT said, I have taken all of these tough votes that my Democratic friends have wanted me to take, and they have taken some that we wanted them to take. However, I have to say that now is not a moment to be celebrated because of what I have been hearing since I came back from this last weekend. 
   I have heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle that this session of Congress is essentially over, that right now politics is going to prevail over policy, and that there will be gridlock until the election so that the greatest political advantage can be made out of the Congress. 
   I am disappointed in that. I didn't come here for that. I didn't fight as hard as I did to win a seat in this body to just play that kind of a game. 
   I find on the Democratic side people of honor and good will. I hope they find that in Republicans. Frankly, I think we are allowing the worst of our natures to take over right now. I am disappointed. I am very disappointed. 
   I understand that the White House is now telling our leaders that unless we accede to every one of the President's demands, that we will be blamed for shutting the Government down because he won't sign any tax cut, he won't sign any appropriations bill. We are just going to be made the victims of this. I say to my friends in the White House, this is an overreach. This goes too far. 
   The American people will judge this for what it is. I think we owe the American people something better than that. I think we owe them the truth. I think we owe them our best efforts. I think the politics shouldn't be so blatantly transparent that it brings shame upon the Senate. 
   I am here with a heavy heart because I want to get something done. I have sat in the chair many times and begun to see this filibuster mentality build up among the minority that rails against these tax cuts that we have passed, to eliminate estate taxes, to eliminate the marriage penalty. They don't have to like it, they voted against it. 
   I will say why I voted for them. There is an overarching reason why I vote for tax cuts. I believe in times of surplus and prosperity there is a point when we can say we are taking too much and we believe it can do more good in the general economy and we will put some back. Tax cuts go to taxpayers. When it comes to specific taxes, for example, the estate tax, I will state why I voted to change the nature of that tax, to eliminate the incidence of debt as the tax, and to shift it over to the sale of an asset as the incidence of taxation. I don't believe it is any of the Government's business how my heirs receive my estate. I think that is about freedom. I think that is about people saying: I am going to work hard and I will accumulate what I can, and I want to determine how my sons and my daughters receive my estate. Then if my heirs are unwise, the marketplace will redistribute that income because of poor choices. 
   I don't think it is the Government's business to say we are going to determine how this money is redistributed. It is a difference of who you trust. Do you trust Government? Or do you trust freedom? Do you trust people? Or do you trust central planning? That is why I am on this side of the aisle-- not because I think there are bad people over there; I know otherwise. There are good people there. But we have a difference of belief in how the public is best served. I think they want more equality. I think we want more liberty. That is the context of the debate here. 
   I want the American people to know I will defend my vote to my own grave to eliminate the estate tax. I believe the way we have shifted it to a capital gains as the incidence of taxation is far more consistent with notions of freedom than reaching into somebody's grave and saying we are going to distribute it a new way, a Government way. That is not the America that I believe in.  
   When it comes to the marriage penalty tax cut, they are complaining again that too few people will benefit. You say it affects people disproportionately. But many married people will benefit. Again, it is hard to give tax cuts to those who don't pay taxes. I am not ashamed of voting to cut taxes for married people. Some people say that is unfair. However, I think we ought to incentivize marriage. It is a cornerstone of our society. Take religion out of it. Sociologists and psychologists will say for a child to have the best chance in life they need a mom, they need a dad. Those are the kinds of things we ought to be incentivizing--not penalizing. 
   Without any embarrassment, I am proud to have voted to end the marriage tax penalty and the death tax penalty. These are bad tax policies. We have voted to end them. If they don't like the 
   distribution of them, fine. But we have cast these votes. They voted one way; we voted another. We have taken their tough votes. As Senator BENNETT said, we have taken the gun votes. We have taken the votes on abortion. We have taken a whole range of votes. We have taken a vote against their prescription drug plan. 
   Let me go to prescription drugs for a minute. I am a member of the Budget Committee. I have sensed in the people of Oregon a real desire for a prescription drug benefit. I want to deliver for that. Because of that, I went into the Budget Committee when we created this template in the U.S. budget, determined to stand with my colleague, RON WYDEN, to accede the President's request for a prescription drug benefit. The President requested $39 billion. RON, OLYMPIA SNOWE, and I decided together we have a majority if the Democrats will vote with us. We felt strongly that we should deliver on this promise and this need. 
   We got the Budget Committee to exceed the President's request of $39 billion. We went to $40 billion. However, I was a little bit discouraged--even felt somewhat betrayed--when a few months later the President says, just kidding, we need $80 billion. Double? From where did the original $39 billion come? Why all of a sudden, $80 billion? Don't the American people want Congress to be responsible for this? I put everyone on notice, I am being told in the Budget Committee that $80 billion won't even begin to cover this. Now what we are looking at under the President's program, is a one size fits all plan. A Government bureaucrat will be in your medicine cabinet and making choices for your health. A plan, by the way, that doesn't even take effect when we pass it--3 years hence. How is that keeping faith with the American people? They cannot even begin to tell you what it costs. 
   This is not the way we should make these fundamental decisions about the health of the American people and the health of our Government's budgets. I hope everybody understands that. I am being told that come October 6, when we are supposed to sine die, if we haven't passed the President's version we are going to be put in a position that we are made to look as if we are shutting the Government down. 
   People of America, you do not want Congress making these fundamental irreversible decisions on such a basis. These are important issues. We should not be giving in to this kind of political pressure for expediency, for an election. We should do it carefully. We should do it right. When it comes to prescription drugs, I will spend what I have to make sure you have a choice, that it is voluntary, and that it is affordable. 
   Under the President's plan, I bet there is better than half of the American people who would be eligible for it, who would not pay less for prescription drugs, yet would be forced to pay more. Is that what we want? That is not voluntary. That is about Government central planning. That is about a bureaucrat in your medicine cabinet. That is a plan for which I will not vote. 
   I believe in the marketplace. I believe in freedom. I believe Government has a role. I believe we ought to have a safety net. But I don't believe we ought to be going to a system that says the Government knows best and a bureaucrat can tell you what pill you need to take. 
   I have talked about taxes. I have talked about the budget. I have talked about prescription drugs. 
   Let me end by talking a little bit about this other great frustration I hear from the people of Oregon and that is the cost of gas, the cost of energy. 
   There is plenty of blame to go around, I am sure. I am not defending big oil. I am not defending the Government, either. But what I am telling you is our country has an enormous trade deficit because we are spending over $100 billion per year on foreign oil. When President Carter was the President, we had gas lines and we had shortages. I remember waiting over an hour every time I went to get gasoline. When that occurred, our country was 36-percent dependent on foreign oil. We are 56-percent dependent now. Do you know why? Because in the life of this administration we have had over 30 oil refineries close; we have had leases canceled; we have had no development; and we have had an increasing dependence--not less--on foreign oil. I tell the American people, that is why you are paying too much. That is why you are paying more than you need to, because we are being held hostage to a cartel of foreign nations--many that wish us ill, many that would like to put us over an oil barrel and push us over. 
   I am saying I don't like drilling for oil. Every one of us drives a car and for a lot of us, the oil that drives that car is refined in Texas. Everyone of us likes the freedom of an automobile. Frankly, I would rather say to the American people: Let your sons and daughters drill for oil so they do not have to die for oil. We are setting them up to die for oil if we do not figure out some better balance between production and conservation. 
   Conservation is important. I vote for conservation initiatives. But it is not the whole answer. You have to produce something. A third of our trade deficit is due to foreign oil. If you want an independent country, if you want an independent foreign policy, you cannot be totally dependent, as we are becoming, on foreign oil. But there you have it. That has been the policy of this administration. 
   Finally, our Vice President said he wants to outlaw or get rid of the internal combustion engine. In my neck of the woods, we have the incredible benefit of hydroelectric power. We have low energy rates because of hydroelectric power. But, guess what, they are talking about tearing them down. They want to tear out the most clean, most renewable, most affordable energy supply that we have. Guess what happens when you do that. You lose--the recreation is gone, but, more importantly, you lose the irrigation for farmers, you lose the transportation of goods from the interior all the way from Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon to the Port of Portland and around the Pacific rim. You lose the ability to use this system of locks to move vast quantities of agricultural and other commodities. 
   I don't think we want to do that. I think it is very unwise. If you want to get rid of the internal combustion engine --let's examine this briefly. Right now, to move about a half a million bushels of grain, you need four barges that move through these locks. Four barges use very little energy. It just floats and makes its way to the Port of Portland. Get rid of the locks or dams, guess what, you have to truck them or rail them. How many railcars does it take to replace the four barges? It takes 140 jumbo railcars to move the same volume. 
   The tracks, the infrastructure is not there to do all the railing. So then you go to trucks, internal combustion engines. Guess how many trucks it takes: Four barges versus 539 large ``semi'' trucks. Guess what creates pollution. Guess what creates damage to your roads. That will do it. 
   I want to be fair about this. When we are becoming so dependent on foreign oil, so dependent upon foreign energy, so dependent as a superpower on others, I think it is very imprudent to begin tearing out our energy infrastructure. 
   So I will close, and I say again with a heavy heart, I think right now politics is prevailing over good policy. I think that is 
   too bad. But let me tell you, the real losers will be the American people if the Republican majority caves in to the kind of tactics that say if you don't take everything we want we are going to make you look like you shut the Government down.  
   There are a lot of us who are earnestly striving to do our duty, as is incumbent upon the majority, to move the business of the people while at the same time being fair to the minority. But how many times do we have to cast the same votes? Please, help us here. I plead with the President. Let's get something done. Let's deal in good faith. We don't have to let politics prevail. Because if we do, the legacy of this President and this Congress will be the words ``it might have been.'' 
   It ought to be better than that. But I, for one, believe in our Republic. I believe in our separation of powers. I will be very disappointed in my leaders if we cave in to a King. We cannot do that. We are not going to cave in to a King. We need to stand up for our institution. Moreover, we need to pay attention to the details of our policy. Because if we work it out with civility, we will work it out right for the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the Bryan amendment which proposes to cut funding for the Forest Service's timber sale program. Unfortunately, this amendment continues to assault on the statutory principle of multiple use of public lands. 
   While I don't take issue with the Senator from Nevada on the question of increasing funds for fire preparedness under the U.S. Forest Service, I must vehemently disagree with the proposal that the federal timber program should be slashed by thirty million dollars. As we all know, we are dealing with finite resources under the Interior appropriations bill, and I believe the managers of the bill have achieved a proper balance under these circumstances. In addition, I must remind my colleagues that just last week we all voted to dramatically increase funds for hazardous fuels reduction with the adoption of the Domenici amendment. 
   Year after year, opponents of logging on public lands allege that the Forest Service timber program is a subsidy for timber companies. The fact is, however, public timber is sold at competitive auctions at market prices. This is no subsidy for timber companies. Year after year, opponents of logging on public lands also claim that the Forest Service timber program is a money loser. Of course, their figures never seem to take into account the bureaucratic and statutory requirements created by a myriad of federal land regulations or recent accounting changes that front-load certain expenses, making more sales appear below cost. Unlike many private lands, National Forest System lands are managed for multiple uses--recreation, wildlife habitat, and forest products. If anything, the fiscal arguments used by proponents of this amendment only prove that, indeed, federal regulatory mandates are quite expensive. 
   Ironically, this amendment is actually counterproductive for the environment as well. We have well over sixty-five million acres of the National Forest System at risk of catastrophic wildlife, disease, and insect infestation. The high fuel loads created by a century of fire suppression, and eight years of passive forest management have set up our national forests for catastrophic wildlifes that threaten homes, wildlife, and watersheds. Mechanical removal through timber sales can be an efficient and economical tool to reduce these wildfire risks, and it should be available to the professional foresters of the Forest Service. 
   Despite its strong backing from environmental groups, the Bryan amendment will do nothing for global environmental stewardship as long as we, in the United States, continue to consume more wood products. During the assault on public lands industries under this administration, the amount of timber sold from our federal forests has dropped by nearly eighty percent. Predictably, our lumber imports have jumped by fifty percent over the same time. In other words, further cutting  our domestic federal timber program may be a feel-good move for some, but it will merely serve to encourage the shift of U.S. timber consumption to forests in foreign countries. Many of these source countries do not have the rigorous environmental standards we have in the U.S.--so we should ask ourselves whose environment we are really saving with this amendment, and at what cost. 
   What is particularly troubling for me about this kind of attack on the timber sale program is that Oregon has some of the best forests for timber production in the world. Certainly, Oregon forests are able to regenerate this renewable resource in a much more environmentally sound way than some of the foreign forests on which we have come to depend for our wood products needs. Yet in Oregon we have seen an even steeper decline in federal timber harvests than the nation as a whole during the Clinton-Gore years--more than ninety percent. Over a hundred mills have closed in my state and thousands of family-wage jobs in rural counties have been lost. Just last month, two more wood products facilities closed--one in Dallas, Oregon and one in Wallowa, Oregon. The Bryan amendment will just exacerbate the transfer of these jobs to foreign timber producers. 
   Mr. President, I'm not saying that there isn't a place for environment and recreational purposes on our federal lands--there certainly is. However, I believe strongly that we must manage our federal lands in a balanced way, so that we are good stewards of the land and meet some of our human needs for timber and recreation at the same time. Unfortunately, the amendment before us is just another attempt to export jobs and timber harvests overseas at the expense of rural America. I urge my colleagues to reject the Bryan amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, cosponsored by my colleague Mr. WYDEN, to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of  the Interior, to conduct feasibility studies in the Klamath basin. 
   The Klamath Project in Oregon and California is one of the earliest federal reclamation projects. The Secretary of the Interior authorized development of the project on May 15, 1905, under provisions of the Reclamation Act of 1902. The project irrigates over 200,000 acres of farmland in south-central Oregon and north-central California. The two main sources of water supply for the project are Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath River, as well as Clear Lake Reservoir, Gerber Reservoir, and Lost River, which are located in a closed basin. The total drainage area is approximately 5,700 square miles. The Klamath River is subject to an interstate compact between the States of Oregon and California. 
   There are also several wildlife refuges in the basin that are an important part of the western flyway. There are listed suckers in Upper Klamath Lake that require the lake to be maintained at certain levels throughout the summer. There are also salmon in the Klamath River for which federal agencies are seeking additional flow. It is my understanding that there will be significant additional flow requirements next year. 
   The Upper Basin has not been adjudicated by the State of Oregon, which is trying to use an alternative process to formal adjudication. The tribes in the basin are also seeking a resolution of their water rights claims. 
   In recent years, there has been growing concern about meeting the competing needs of various water uses in the Basin, including the needs of the farmers, the fish, the tribes and the wildlife refuges. There is a consensus in the basin about the need to increase overall water supplies in order to meet these growing needs and enhance the environment. 
   The bill I am introducing today is an effort to build on this consensus. I have discussed the concepts in this bill with a number of the stakeholders in the Upper Basin, and I am committed to a legislative process that will consider the views of the various interest groups in the basin. I know that there will be other issues that stakeholders will want considered, and I will endeavor to do so. 
   I believe it is vitally important, however, that we take the first step to enable the Department of the Interior to study ways to improve both the water quality and the water quantity in the Upper Klamath basin. There is significant private irrigation in the Upper Basin as well, and I am committed to a process that includes these water users as well.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the Senate's adoption of the Domenici substitute amendment to the Craig amendment regarding the President's Roadless Initiative. I was unable to be on the floor earlier today when the Craig amendment and Domenici substitute amendment were considered. 
   First, let me say that I was a cosponsor of the underlying Craig amendment and I continue to share his concern about blatant Federal Advisory Committee Act violations by this administration in the development of their Roadless Initiative. In any case, I don't believe ``one-size-fits-all'' proposals like the President's Roadless Initiative, hatched in the halls of bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., can be any substitute for sound land management policies developed in collaboration with people at the local level. Oregonians, if given a chance, have proven  time and again that they can be better stewards of the land than federal bureaucrats. 
   I understand that Senator CRAIG agreed to the Domenici substitute in part because this matter of FACA violations will be considered by the courts this August. I trust that the Congress will have an opportunity to review this matter this session if the courts fail to do so, and I praise Senator CRAIG for his continued leadership on this important issue. 
   With that said, I wanted to add my voice to those who spoke earlier in favor of the Domenici substitute amendment that seeks to address the growing threat of catastrophic wildfire in areas of urban-wildland interface. A century of fire suppression followed by years of inactive forest management under this administration have left our National Forest system overstocked with underbrush and unnaturally dense tree stands that are now at risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO recently found that at least 39 million acres of the National Forest system are at high risk for catastrophic fire. According to the Forest Service, twenty-six million acres are at risk from insects and disease infestations as well. The built up fuel loads in these forests create abnormally hot wildfires that are extremely difficult to control. To prevent catastrophic fire and widespread insect infestation and disease outbreaks, these forests need to be treated. The underbrush needs to be removed. The forests must be thinned to allow the remaining trees to grow more rapidly and more naturally. This year's fires in New Mexico have given us a preview of what is to come throughout our National Forest system if we continue this administration's policy of passive forest management. 
   I believe the Domenici amendment will help this reluctant administration to face up to this growing threat to homes, wildlife, and watersheds. I commend Senator DOMENICI and the bipartisan group of Senators who worked very hard to craft this compromise.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this week as the Forest Service has launched a series of meetings in my state and around the country to solicit comments on the Administration's proposed roadless initiative. I want to encourage Oregonians to send in their comments and attend these meetings to make their voices heard. 
   I am concerned that so many of my constituents will not take part in this comment period in part because they believe that this roadless policy is a foregone conclusion. Frankly, I don't think the Forest Service did much to change those feelings by including language in its draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which characterized loggers, mill workers, and people in the timber products industry in general as uneducated, opportunistic, and unable to adapt to change. Many Oregonians, not just those in resource industries, were offended by this. 
   I understand that the Administration has subsequently apologized, but I am afraid this incident only added to the feeling held by many Oregonians that the decisions about this roadless plan have already been made. So I want to take this opportunity today to outline some of my concerns about this roadless initiative and to encourage other Oregonians to take advantage of the remaining weeks of this public comment period to do the same. 
   Mr. President, the management of the roadless areas in our National Forest System has been the subject of debate for many years. We had the RARE I (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation) process in the early 1970s leading  to inventories and analysis of the large roadless areas in our National Forests. Then we had RARE II under the Carter Administration. 
   That process was followed by a number of state-specific bills, such as the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984, where roadless areas that were suitable for wilderness protection were so designated and other roadless areas were to be released for multiple uses. Despite the growth of the wilderness system in this country, the management of other roadless areas has remained controversial. 
   Now this Administration has proposed a roadless initiative that would permanently ban road construction from some 43 million acres of inventoried roadless areas. In addition, this draft EIS calls for each Forest, upon its periodic Forest Plan revision, to protect additional roadless areas, often referred to as uninventoried roadless areas. No one, not even the Forest Service, seems to know how many millions of acres that may ultimately be. So the President is proposing setting aside an additional 45 to 60 million acres of the National Forest system on top of the 35 million acres that are already designated as wilderness areas. Let me remind my colleagues that the entire National Forest System is 192 million acres and that there are numerous riparian areas and wildlife buffer zones that are also off limits to road construction. So we may well have more than half of our National Forest System permanently set aside and inaccessible to most of the public by the time this Administration is through. 
   What is even more alarming to me is the position of the Vice President on this issue. In a speech to the League of Conservation Voters last month, AL GORE said the Administration's preferred alternative does not go far enough. Perhaps Mr. GORE's ``Progress and Prosperity'' tour should make a few stops in rural Oregon so he can see first-hand the results of eight years of passive management of our federal lands--double digit unemployment and four day school weeks. As part of the Administration that is writing this rule and is supposedly keeping an open mind while taking comments from the public this month, it seems a bit premature for the Vice President to speak so favorably of an alternative that is ostensibly still being reviewed. I know the Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and the Chairman of the House Resources Committee have requested the Vice President recuse himself from the rest of this rule-making process. I agree with the Chairmen and hope the Vice President will try to restore the public's confidence that this rule-making is not predetermined and that it is open, as required by law, to the comments and suggestions of the public. 
   Mr. President, some of my colleagues may ask why new roads may be needed in the National Forest System. There are many reasons, but perhaps the most urgent purpose is forest health. 
   A century of fire suppression followed by years of inactive forest management under this Administration have left our National Forest System overstocked with underbrush and unnaturally dense tree stands that are now at risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO recently found that at least 39 million acres of the National Forest System are at high risk for catastrophic fire. According to the Forest Service, 26 million acres are at risk from insects and disease infestations as well. The built up fuel loads in these forests create abnormally hot wildfires that are extremely difficult to control. This year's fires in New Mexico have given us a preview of what is to come throughout our National Forest System if we continue this Administration's policy of passive forest management. 
   To prevent catastrophic fire and widespread insect infestation and disease outbreaks, these forests need to be treated. The underbrush needs to be removed. The forests must be thinned to allow the remaining trees to grow more rapidly and more naturally. While some of this work can be done without roads, roads are many times required in order to carry out this necessary work. Yet this Administration apparently wants to make it more difficult to address these problems, more difficult to stop fires like those in New Mexico before they start. And the Vice President wants to go even further than that. 
   Why else are roads needed in the National Forest System? Forest roads provide millions of Americans with access to the National Forests for recreational purposes. With the Forest Service predicting tremendous increases in recreational visits to the National Forest System in the coming years, shouldn't there at least be a thorough examination of how this roadless plan will affect the remaining areas of our National Forests, which will apparently have to absorb most of these new visitors? And what about the needs of seniors and disabled visitors? Compounding the problem, this Administration will be decommissioning many roads currently used by recreational visitors. In its rush to complete this sweeping rule, this Administration does not seem to have the time to examine seriously the impacts of steering more and more recreational visitors to a smaller percentage of the Forest System. 
   Mr. President, I am also concerned about how this roadless initiative is supposed to interact with the Northwest Forest Plan. 
   Last year, I came to the floor of the Senate and I expressed concerns about this Administration's forestry policies and its weak implementation of its own plan that was supposed to lay the groundwork for a cooperative resolution to the timber disputes of the early 1990s. Unfortunately, as our federal agencies scour the forests to survey for mosses, we continue to have gridlock in the Northwest, with none of the promised sustainable and predictable timber harvests in sight. So how much confidence does this Administration have in its own Northwest Forest Plan? By reading its roadless proposal, the answer is ``not much.'' Clinton's Northwest Forest Plan has thorough standards and guidelines for activities in the forests covered by the plan, including roadbuilding. This Administration had previously exempted the Northwest Forest Plan forests from its road building moratoriums because it was still clinging to the notion that its plan was the model for forestry policy in the future. Unlike those temporary moratoria, however, the Administration's roadless initiative makes no exception for the forests covered by the Northwest Forest Plan. To me, this suggests that even this Administration is acknowledging what many in the Northwest have said for some time: The Clinton Forest Plan is a failure. Rural Oregon already knew that. Now with this roadless proposal, this Administration will only make it harder for any future Administration to keep its promises under the Northwest Forest Plan. This fact is most obvious in the town of Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. Like many towns in the Northwest surrounded by federal lands, Klamath Falls was encouraged by this Administration to create jobs and economic growth through recreation and eco-tourism in order to compensate for the loss of the timber jobs. Of course, it is difficult to find substitutes for the family wage jobs that the timber industry once provided for these towns. Nevertheless, rural Oregon has tried to diversify its economy. 
   More than three years ago, developers and community leaders in Klamath Falls embarked upon the arduous process of obtaining a special use permit to launch a winter recreation area at Pelican Butte in the nearby Winema National Forest. Millions of dollars were spent and countless hours were invested by everyone from the local forest service, to the developers, to the local government and the community as a whole. A final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision are due next year. Now, due to the fact that Pelican Butte will require three miles of road in a currently inventoried roadless area, the Administration's roadless initiative will effectively kill the plan. In its zeal to complete this plan before leaving office, this Administration apparently does not want to take the time to make reasonable accommodations for proposals that have been in the pipeline for years. Never mind the fact that the Pelican Butte project will result in a net decrease in road mileage on National Forest lands. Never mind the fact that Oregonians were told by this Administration to go and find other means to develop their economy outside of timber. The message to Oregonians is clear: If the roadless plan is to be concluded before President Clinton leaves office, there is  no time to spare to consider the effort and good will invested by the people of Klamath Falls in the Pelican Butte proposal. The fact is that this Administration doesn't care how many rural communities are left in the dust by this regulatory juggernaut. 
   Mr. President, all of this is very discouraging for Oregonians who have a sense this Administration has already made up its mind on this roadless initiative. It is my understanding that many of my constituents have just received copies of this draft EIS in the last few days--with half of the brief comment period already expired. Nevertheless, from the floor of the Senate today, I am pleading with my constituents to get out there during this comment period and make their voices heard. This rulemaking is too significant for Oregonians to be silent. 
   Mr. President, I agree with this Administration that we need a long-term resolution to the management of our roadless areas. But common sense tells us that what is needed and appropriate for one area may not be sound stewardship for another. With this roadless initiative, this Administration is talking about setting aside in one broad stroke millions of acres that are supposed to be held in trust for all Americans. Even worse, this plan is being rushed through a truncated public comment process in order to accommodate an artificial political deadline. This isn't the way to manage our precious natural resources and this isn't the way to treat our rural communities. The management of these roadless areas is a complicated question, and it deserves more than the simple answer being force-fed to us by this Administration.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Kennedy-Smith amendment. I also rise to announce my support for the amendment offered by Senator HATCH. I ask my colleagues, in voting for Senator HATCH's amendment, to vote for Senator KENNEDY's as well. It is fine to study, but I think we know enough. We know that hate crimes are already committed in our society. 
   When I, as a human being, wake up to read headlines of a black man dragged to death and a gay man beaten to death, I want to do something. I believe in the separation of State governments and the Federal Government. I understand all of that. But doggone it, it is OK for the Federal Government to show up to work. It is time for us to say as Republicans and Democrats that we want to make a difference. We want our police officers to help not primarily but secondarily and to be there to teach, to prosecute, and to pursue those who commit the most malignant of crimes. 
   I say to my colleagues, there are two critical words, in my view, missing in Senator HATCH's amendment. The words are ``sexual orientation,'' as it applies to making it a Federal crime. I never thought I would be on the Senate floor saying this until I saw the report of Matthew Shepard's death. I began to ask myself what I could do. 
   Many in the Senate are reflexively inclined to vote no on the Kennedy amendment because of feelings of religious reluctance. I understand that because I shared those feelings for a long time. Then I happened upon a story in a book that I regard as Scripture. It is in the eighth chapter of John when 
   the Founder of the Christian faith was confronted by the Pharisees and the Sadducees of His day with a hate crime. A woman who was caught in the very act was to be stoned to death. What did He do? His response was to speak in such a way to shame the self-righteous and  the sanctimonious to drop their stones, and He saved her life. We should do the same. 
   I do not believe on that day He endorsed her lifestyle anymore than I believe anyone here will be endorsing any lifestyle if they vote for the Kennedy-Smith amendment. I believe what my colleagues will be doing is following an example that says when it comes to violence and hatred, we can stand up for one another. No matter our distinctions, no matter our uniqueness, no matter our peculiarities, no matter how we pray or how we sin, we can stand up for each other, and we can stand up against hate. 
   I say to my colleagues: Vote for Senator HATCH's amendment. It is fine, but it does not go far enough, in my view, and it is time to go far enough to include this group of Americans who are not now included in a current Federal law.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we have a chance to make a difference today, to vote for an amendment that will actually help a category of Americans who need our help. I believe we have a duty to stand up against hate. I believe the law is a teacher. I believe we can teach all Americans that we will protect all Americans. 
   I also believe those who feel reluctant to support this amendment for religious reasons, remember the example of the Founder of the Christian faith who when a woman caught in adultery was brought to Him spoke in a way that the sanctimonious dropped their stones. He spoke in a way that saved her life. He did not endorse her lifestyle, but He saved her life. 
   I believe the Federal Government ought to show up to work when it comes to hate crimes, even if it includes the language of ``sexual orientation.'' It is about time we include them. Even if one does not agree with all that they ask for, help them with this.

   Mr. SMITH of OREGON. Madam President, I wish to say what is in my heart and why I as a Republican stand here in support of a Kennedy amendment on hate crimes.  
   On June 7, 1998, when James Byrd, Jr., was dragged to death on a dusty Texas road, something happened to me. I was horrified beyond my ability to express it. 
   On October 12, 1998, when Matthew Shepard was beaten to death on a Wyoming prairie, hung to a fence to die, something happened to me. I, again, had no ability to express the outrage and horror that I felt of such conduct and wondered: What is it in the heart of humankind that could perpetrate such an action upon a fellow human being? 
   These were people who were murdered not for their property. They were murdered because of who they were. One was a black man and the other was a gay man. I think much of America felt the shock and revulsion that I did. Many of us began to look around and ask: What can I do in my sphere of influence? How can I help to see that this never happens again in my country? 
   So I was attracted to the whole issue of hate crimes. This is a very controversial thing with many Senators. It is controversial because, frankly, of one clause. It is controversial because it includes a new category: ``..... or sexual orientation.'' And many of my friends in the Senate believe that disqualifies it from consideration. But it seems to me that our duty as public officials is to help Americans help human beings however we find them; no matter what we may believe their sins are because all of us are sinful. 
   Many will say that to legislate favorably towards a gay man is to legitimize homosexuality for our society. I used to have that feeling myself, but I do not any longer. I truly believe it is possible to object to a gay marriage and yet come to the defense of a gay person when it comes to violence. And I believe we have a duty to show up to work in the Federal Government when it comes to the issue of hate crimes. Some people believe that, well, all crime is hateful; don't designate some types of crime. But I tell you that I have come to realize that hate crimes are different in this respect. Hate crimes are visited upon one person, but they are really directed at an entire community--in 
   one case, a black man in the African American community, and in the other case, a gay man in the gay and lesbian community. We need to help, and I believe the Kennedy amendment actually helps. 
   Some see this as controversial because they will stand behind the argument of States rights; that we cannot defend these people at the Federal level because there are State officials and local officials where most police actions and prosecutions occur; that we should leave that to them. I had that feeling until I was visited by a group of conservative Republican law enforcement officers from Wyoming who said, in the case of Matthew Shepard: It would have helped a great deal had the Federal Government shown up with resources and support to help in the prosecution of this horrible tragedy. 
   The Kennedy amendment allows this to happen, and I support it for that reason, because I believe we need to show up to work. 
   As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have spoken all over the globe against hate crimes of all kinds. Because of that, I cannot in good conscience remain silent about hate crimes in my own country. It is time to speak out, and it is time to vote on something that will actually make a difference. 
   In my Subcommittee on European Affairs, I recently held a hearing on the issue of antisemitism. One of the most remarkable witnesses I have ever listened to in the Senate came to testify in that hearing. He is the Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. I will never forget what he said to our committee that day. He said:  
   To hate is to deny the other person's humanity. It is to see in ``the other'' a reason to inspire not pride, but disdain; not solidarity, but exclusion. It is to choose simplistic phraseology instead of ideas. It is to allow its carrier to feel stronger than ``the other,'' and thus superior to ``the other.'' The hater ..... is vain, arrogant. He believes that he alone possesses the key to truth and justice. He alone has God's ear.  
   I am afraid there are some like that not just in Nazi Germany about which he was speaking, there are some like that today in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, Kosovo, in Africa. There are haters still, and there are haters in our own country as well. We are trying to say, once and for all, that when it comes to hate and hate crimes that are directed at these minority communities who live among us as Americans: Your Federal Government cares, too. The Federal Government will show up to work. The Federal Government will try to use the law as well to teach the American people that there is no room for hate, and if you commit a hate crime, we will come after you with the full force of the law at the local, the State, and the Federal level, because while many will say this is just symbolism, I grant you it is in part, but it is symbolism that can be made substance if we change some hearts and minds. In that sense, the law can be a teacher. 
   That is why I support the Kennedy amendment, because I think we need to change some hearts and minds, as well as some laws, so that the Federal Government can show up to work. 
   I am going to do something I do not suppose is commonly done here, but I want to speak using a Scripture. I do this because I need to reach out, not to change the minds necessarily of some in my own political base who are the conservative 
   Christians. They are my friends, and many of their views are views I hold. But on this issue, I believe we can care enough to change some hearts and minds. I believe that the God of Christianity, the God whom I worship, said on this Earth that by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples--if you have love one for another. He showed that in a remarkable episode, and I want to share it. I share it with my friends in the Christian community because we need to remember this story when we think somehow that we should not help a community because of what we think their sins may be. 
   This is the story. It comes from the 8th Chapter of John:  
   Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
   And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
   And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
   They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
   Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
   This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
   So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
   And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
   And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
   When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
   She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.  
   This happened in a public square. This was a wonderful example of mercy and compassion. It was a wonderful occasion in which, in my view, the greatest of all stood up against violence, violence that was later visited upon Him with hatred. 
   I point out that if you care about the American family and you perceive homosexuality as a threat to that family institution, remember that adultery, if you want to talk about sins, is a far greater threat to the American family than homosexuality. 
   What I say to fellow Christians everywhere is, it is time to help. It is time to remember a story and an example. It is time to say to the gay community: I do not agree with you on everything, but I can help you on many things. And particularly when it comes to violence, particularly when it comes to dragging a man to death, particularly when it comes to seeing someone beaten to death on a fence, I would be ashamed if we did not act as the Federal Government to say: We can show up to work, we can help, we can teach, we can change hearts and minds, and we can turn the symbolism into substance by letting Federal authorities bring resources and help make a difference. 
   I know I may not be in large numbers on my side of the aisle, but I hope they will consider what I have just said. All of the excuses that will be offered today--are we prosecuting people for their thoughts? No, we are prosecuting people for their actions that kill people. 
   Some will say: There are limitations in the bill so that every hate crime is not a Federal crime. There are limitations that will trigger the Federal response. We will defer to the States. 
   Some will say: What business is it of ours to put hate crimes on the Defense authorization bill? Some of the most horrible hate crimes I have read about have occurred within the military. It is our business to put it here if that is what it takes to pass it here. 
   Some will say: Isn't every act of domestic violence or rape a hate crime? I say, it may well be. It may trigger Federal involvement. But just because it includes sexual orientation does not make those victims less American. 
   Some will say: The Kennedy amendment is not constitutional. I believe it is constitutional. I believe it is OK to say we will help Americans--how we find them--whether they are black, whether they are disabled, or whether they are gay. 
   So my remarks today, Madam President, are about having a bigger heart and making the Federal law big enough to include communities that are the most vulnerable among us. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the days of the Oregon Trail, my state has been blessed with citizens dedicated to the spirit of ``neighbor helping neighbor.'' In every community in Oregon you can find men and women who give their time, effort, and money to making that community a better place in which to live, work, and raise a family. That is precisely what Ezra Koch has done in the community of McMinnville, and I am proud to pay tribute to him today. 
   After over half a century of service as one of McMinnville's and Yamhill County's most respected businessmen, Ezra is retiring as President of City Sanitary and Recycling. A native Canadian, who immigrated to Oregon nearly eight years ago, Ezra and his family have truly lived the American dream. 
   Under Ezra's leadership, City Sanitary and Recycling, and its parent company KE Enterprises, has become one of Oregon's leading sanitary companies--leading the effort to increase recycling long before it became a national cause. Ezra was the driving force behind the creation of the Oregon Refuse and Recycling Association, and served as president of the National Solid Waste Management Association. 
   Ezra's love of his community can truly be seen in his volunteer and philanthropic efforts. The list of organizations and causes that have benefitted from his leadership and generosity include Linfield College, the McMinnville School District, Rotary International, the McMinnville Chamber of Commerce, and the United Way. 
   Ezra credits his family with inspiring the values he has lived throughout his life. And his words are ones we should all take to heart. ``Even though we were a big family with poverty everywhere, we never lacked for enough to eat and share with others. A great tradition was born in our family of sharing what we have with those that are less fortunate, and that continues today.'' 
   I salute Ezra Koch for all he has done to strengthen the Oregon tradition of neighbor helping neighbor, and I wish him many more years of health and happiness.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, co-sponsored by 20 of my Senate colleagues, to bring sunshine to our campaign finance laws, to provide for full disclosure of contributions and expenditures of groups which have heretofore not been held accountable, yet have been subsidized by the American people through their tax-exempt status. 
   Joining me in this effort are Senators ABRAHAM, ASHCROFT, BURNS, SANTORUM, GORTON, HUTCHISON, ALLARD, BENNETT, COVERDELL, GREGG, HELMS, THOMAS, INHOFE, MACK, WARNER, BUNNING, LOTT, MCCONNELL, CRAPO, and ROBERTS. 
   I have long been a proponent of full disclosure, to the extent it is consistent with the First Amendment, of campaign contributions and expenditures. 
   If we are to rekindle the trust of the American people, not only must the political parties be held accountable, so, too, must those tax-exempt groups which engage in political activities, yet heretofore have operated outside the realm of disclosure. The public has the right to know the identity of those trying to influence our elections, and Congress must do whatever it can to make sure that organizations do not wrongly benefit from the public subsidy of tax exemption. 
   The bill we are introducing today, the Tax-Exempt Political Disclosure Act, expands upon the McCain-Lieberman amendment of last week which targeted a narrow list of tax-exempt organizations established under section 527 of the tax code. The so-called 527 groups covered in this bill do not 
   make contributions to candidates or engage in express advocacy, and thus are not required to publicly disclose contributors or expenditures. Our bill contains in its entirety the provisions of the McCain-Lieberman amendment, but goes beyond the 527 groups to require tax-exempt labor and business organizations, as well, to disclose their contributors and expenditures. 
   Specifically, in Title I of our bill, which is identical to the McCain-Lieberman amendment, we require the subset of 527 organizations that are not already subject to the Federal Election Campaign Act to: 
   1. Disclose their existence to the IRS; 
   2. File publicly available tax returns; 
   3. Publicly report expenditures of over $500; and 
   4. Identify those who contribute more than $200 annually to the organization. 
   Title II of our bill applies to business or labor organizations that are tax-exempt under sections 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code and that spend $25,000 or more on the very same kinds of political activities engaged in by section 527 organizations covered by Title I of our bill. As we do with the 527 organizations, we require tax-exempt business and labor organizations to report expenditures for political activity of $500 or more and identify those who contribute more than $200 annually. 
   Importantly, this legislation will not result in disclosure of any labor or business organization's membership lists because annual dues to these tax-exempt groups are excluded from the definition of ``contribution.'' The bill requires disclosure only of those members who choose to contribute more than $200 annually for political purposes. 
   If the Senate is for disclosure of the few tax-exempt 527 organizations that may spend a couple of million dollars on issue ads, then surely we should advocate disclosure of the tax-exempt labor and business organizations that will spend twenty or forty times that amount of money on issue ads and other political activity. Our legislation will require these organizations receiving tax exempt status to emerge from the shadows and make some minimal disclosure about themselves and the source of their money. 
   Tax exemption is not an entitlement, and any organization wanting to avoid the ramifications of claiming such status simply may choose not to seek that status. Our bill merely says that if a group engaging in political activity wants tax exempt status, the public has a right to expect certain things in return. 
   Let me make clear that we are sincere in this effort, and we welcome and invite Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD to work with us. We are open to discussions with business and labor groups, as well, on the mechanics of the bill. We want to be flexible and will consider changes where appropriate. 
   The bottom line, however, is that in the end there must be meaningful disclosure if we are to have the confidence of the American people and bring integrity to the process.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am delighted that last night the Senate voted to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act, S. 2311. I am proud to count myself as one of the cosponsors of this legislation in the Senate and strongly support its swift passage by the House. 
   The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to take a high toll on Americans infected with HIV and their families. HIV/AIDS has affected Oregon in many ways. Almost five thousand Oregonians have been diagnosed with AIDS--resulting in almost 3,000 deaths. In addition, those infected with HIV number up to 8,500 in Oregon. This epidemic has touched people in every part of my State--rural and urban, rich and poor, senior citizens and newborns. 
   Although the story of each of these individuals living with HIV/AIDS is different, they all have one thing in common: they all benefit from the Ryan White CARE Act. Oregon received almost $8.5 million federal dollars last year to fund programs through the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   Passage of the Ryan White CARE Act will allow Oregonians living with HIV to have timely access to life-prolonging medications and necessary health care and support services, regardless of income level or insurance status. The Ryan White CARE Act will also improve access for HIV positive Oregonians to clinical trials, with the potential for additional scientific breakthroughs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
   I call for the House to join the Senate in a similar quick passage of the Ryan White CARE Act that will allow hundreds of thousands of HIV positive Americans to remain healthy, productive members of their communities, while slowing the spread of the AIDS epidemic. 
   I would like to thank my friend Terry Bean of Portland, Oregon for talking to me about the good things the Ryan White Act does for Oregonians living with HIV/AIDS. Terry is a long time board member of the Human Rights Campaign and has been a highly valued advisor on issues affecting the Gay and Lesbian community in Oregon. 
   Terry's thoughts and wisdom on hate crimes, ENDA and fighting against all types of discrimination have provided me with an ethical marker for doing what is right on the Senate Floor for Oregonians. I do feel lucky that Terry's advice is dispensed on a golf course--though the only criticism I may have for Terry is that he lacks the political savvy to lose to a United States Senator. I thank him anyway for his strong support and good advice.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am a supporter of the death penalty. I believe there are some times when humankind can act in a manner so odious so heinous, and so depraved that the right to life is forfeited. Notwithstanding this belief--indeed, because of this belief--I rise today to talk about the importance of protecting innocent people in this country from wrongful imprisonment and execution. Today, Senator LEAHY and I are introducing the Innocence Protection Act of 2000 that will use the technological advances of the 21st century to ensure that justice is served swiftly and fairly. 
   It has been difficult to open a newspaper in recent months without finding discussion of the death penalty and possible miscarriages of justice. You have almost certainly seen or heard reports of inmates being freed from death row based on results of new genetic tests that were unavailable at the time of trial. There have been a number of cases where this has, in fact, occurred. 
   This is a cause for concern for a number of cases. First and foremost, of course, is the possibility that an innocent person could lose his or her life if wrongfully convicted. In such cases, this also leads to the double tragedy that the true guilty party remains free to roam the country in search of future victims. Clearly, capturing and convicting the true perpetrator of a crime is in everyone's best interests. 
   The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 would provide a national standard for post-conviction DNA testing of inmates who believe they have been wrongly incarcerated. Although many inmates were convicted before modern methods of genetic fingerprinting were available, not all states routinely allow post-conviction DNA testing. 
   This does not make sense. If we are to have a system that is just, transparent, and defensible, we must make absolutely certain that every person who is behind bars deserves to be there. One of the best ways to do this is to make the most advanced technology available for cases in which physical evidence could have an influence on the verdict. 
   Making DNA testing available will result in some convictions being overturned. In such cases, people who have been unjustly incarcerated must be afforded fair compensation for the lost years of their lives. The Leahy-Smith Innocence Protection Act of 2000 has a provision that would do this. Sometimes a person who has been wrongly imprisoned is released from prison with bus fare and the clothes on his or her back. This practice simply heaps one wrong upon another. 
   While officers of America's courts and law enforcement work extremely hard to ensure that the true perpetrators of heinous crimes are caught and convicted, there have been instances where defendants have been represented by overworked, underpaid, or even unqualified counsel, and this situation cannot be tolerated in a system of criminal justice. The Leahy-Smith Innocence Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that defendants who are put on trial for their lives receive competent legal representation at every stage in their cases. 
   The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 will allow us, as a nation, to continue our confidence in the American judicial system and in the fair and just application of the death penalty. We must have confidence in the integrity of justice, that it will both protect the innocent and punish the guilty. This legislation will not prevent true criminals from being executed; rather, it will increase support for the death penalty by providing added assurances that American justice is administered fairly across the country. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whether you support or oppose capital punishment, to join Senator LEAHY and me in backing the Innocence Protection Act of 2000, which will put the fingerprint of the 21st century on our criminal justice system, ensuring that innocent lives are not unjustly taken in this country. 
   Ms. COLLINS Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the ``Innocence Protection Act.'' 
   Since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976, 610 people have been executed in our nation. In that same period of time, an astounding 87 people who were sentenced to die have been found innocent and released from death row. Each of these individuals has lived the Kafkaesque nightmare of condemnation and imprisonment for crimes they have not committed. It is  difficult to imagine the despair and betrayal these individuals must have felt as they were accused, tried, convicted and sentenced, all the time knowing they were not guilty. And during all those years they remained in prison, the real perpetrators remained at large. 
   I am an opponent of the death penalty, and I am proud to be from the State of Maine which outlawed the death penalty in 1887. The legislation we introduce today is, however, not an anti-death penalty measure. 
   The legislation we introduce today simply requires logical safeguards to be put in place to prevent wrongful convictions. Its two most important provisions compel DNA testing where it can yield evidence of innocence, and puts in place a new process to ensure defendants receive competent counsel in death penalty cases. 
   The ``Innocence Protection Act'' calls on the federal government and the states to make DNA testing available in circumstances where it could yield new evidence of innocence. The incidents in which DNA testing has exonerated individuals are not isolated--64 people have been released from prison or death row due to DNA testing. 
   Linus Pauling once said that ``science is the search for truth.'' Through DNA testing, science provides a tool that can uncover the truth, and lend certainty to our moral obligation in a civilized society--proper administration of our criminal justice system. 
   The legislation we introduce today assists the wrongfully convicted, and will help prevent the miscarriages of justices that have seemed sadly common. It will also serve the interests of justice and protect crime victims. Justice is never served until the true perpetrator of a crime is identified, convicted and punished. We owe it to the victims and their families to pursue every avenue to find and hold accountable the true criminals who have injured them. 
   Our American ideals and sense of justice simply cannot tolerate the current risk for mistaken executions. The case of Mr. Anthony Porter should shock the conscience of America. Mr. Porter spent over 16 years on death row, and at one point he was only two days short of receiving a lethal injection, having been convicted of two murders. A determined group of journalism students investigated his case and uncovered evidence that exonerated Mr. Porter. It was only through their efforts that the identity of the real murderer was determined, a review of the case compelled, and Mr. Porter ultimately freed. The peculiar good fortune that lead to the release of Mr. Porter undeniably highlights a weakness in our system of justice that cries out for remedy. 
   Nothing that we can do here today can restore those years to Mr. Porter, or others who have been wrongly convicted, but we can demand safeguards be put in place to protect the innocent from conviction, and protect society from real criminals who may remain loose on our streets. Regardless of one's views about the death penalty, I hope we all can agree to needed safeguards to help ensure that justice is served. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation aimed at protecting the Little Sandy Watershed for future generations. The Little Sandy lies adjacent to the Bull Run Watershed, which is the primary municipal water supply for the City of Portland, Oregon. The water that filters through these forests and mountainsides to the east of Portland is of the highest quality in the nation and does not require artificial filtration or treatment. 
   The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit was established by congressional action in 1977, creating a management partnership between the USDA Forest Service and the City of Portland for the review of water quality and quantity. Additional protection was given to the Bull Run by the Northwest Forest Plan in 1993, restricting all timber harvests in sensitive areas. Neither of these actions, however, extended a satisfactory level of protection to the nearby Little Sandy Watershed. Population growth and heightened water quality expectations have brought the preservation of the Little Sandy Watershed to the forefront of the public's interest in recent years. 
   The legislation that I have cosponsored would expand the boundary of the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit to include the southern portion of the Little Sandy. This would add nearly 3,000 acres to the Management Unit, including a number of acres currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). I am aware that questions have just arisen as to whether some of this acreage is currently managed by O & C lands. If so, there are concerns that O & C land would be devalued by a change in management designation. If this is the case, as the bill moves through the legislative process, I will seek the redesignation of other lands outside the preserve in order to maintain the wholeness of O & C land and the timber base.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, frankly, I am pleased, as we alternate back and forth, there are Republicans and Democrats not crossing on party lines but arguing a very important issue of what they feel, what they think, and how they perceive America's interests to be best served. 
   I realize that many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about the consequences that will result if the United States Senate supports the Byrd-Warner amendment. And though I may repeat some of their arguments this morning, I think it is critical that those of us who oppose this language state loudly and clearly that this is the wrong way to go. 
   I spoke last week on this matter Mr. President. I said then that there may come a time when it is appropriate for the U.S. to withdraw from Kosovo--but that time is not now. We face enormous worldwide responsibilities, and I agree with those that feel the burden sometimes seems rather heavy. But that is not a reason for us to seriously jeopardize the most important and most successful Alliance in history. 
   We are a European power. It is in our interests to maintain American leadership in Europe. And we have seen what happens when the U.S. chooses to come home after a bitter conflict has ended. I am confident that if the U.S. pulls out of Kosovo, as this legislation requires if the Congress does not authorize continued participation, we will be forced to return--under circumstances that will certainly not be as favorable as we face today. We have managed to create a situation where our troops certainly face threats in Kosovo, but the risks are relatively limited. 
   By our action, by setting up the conditions under which American troops would withdraw from Kosovo next summer, we could trigger the very instability in Kosovo that we have managed to forestall thus far. I am not going to whitewash what is happening in Kosovo today. We have our work cut out for us in establishing a functioning administration there that respects the rights of minorities. But the situation is relatively stable, after over 10 years of disorder. We can only speculate, of course, as to what would transpire if we were to pull out. But there is a real possibility--one can almost say a probability--that the Kosovar Albanians would feel compelled to prepare for another assault by Serbian henchman directed by Slobodan Milosevic. Could our European allies adequately protect the Kosovar Albanians from this assault? I can not answer that definitively, but I will tell you that the Kosovars think that the answer is no. So we withdraw, the Kosovars rearm, Milosevic feels emboldened, and we are back where we started before the NATO air campaign began. Is that why we fought this war? 
   Why do we want to jeopardize the peace? The 5,900 American soldiers that are participating in KFOR are making a critical contribution to maintaining peace in Kosovo. Our troops comprise approximately 15% of the total of KFOR. That seems to me to be a reasonable percentage for the U.S. to contribute. The European forces are making a difference in Kosovo--they are doing their job. But we should be willing to do ours as well. 
   Mr. President, let me return to my principal concern with this amendment--the threat that it poses to U.S. leadership in Europe. I have met with five different Foreign Ministers from Europe over the past several weeks, and in these meetings I have emphasized the importance of maintaining the trans-Atlantic link. Our security is directly related to European security, whether we like that or not, and for us to signal to our Allies that we are unwilling to participate in securing the peace in Kosovo--when they are contributing 85% of the troops--inherently divides us from our Allies. I have criticized them for seeking to establish a separate defense structure that is not tied in with NATO at every step of the way. 
   We should not encourage them in these efforts by indicating that we are an unreliable ally that cannot be counted on to stay the course. I do not think this should be an endless commitment, however, there should certainly be a drawdown in our forces as circumstances warrant and as Europeans do more in Kosovo. But we  should not make the determination now as to what our troops should 
   do next year. 
   I realize that the supporters of this amendment say that they are not calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo--that they are simply asking for an authorization. But Mr. President, with all due respect for my colleagues, their amendment forces the withdrawal of our forces unless positive action is taken by the Congress. I do not quibble with their complaints that the President did not ask for Congressional authorization for this mission. I agree with them: he should have done so. But is it in our interests to tie the hands of the next President? To force him to adopt a course of action because of a lack of Presidential leadership today? I think not. 
   I am reminded of the early, tragic days of the war in Bosnia. As you recall, Mr. President, European troops were on the ground in Bosnia as part of the UN mission, but no American troops were there. As a result of the dramatically different risks we faced at that time, the U.S. and our Allies supported different approaches to deal with that conflict. We lost valuable time trying to coordinate our strategy--time when Bosnians of all ethnic groups were slaughtered. A strong Alliance is one where benefits and risks are shared, and that is the direction that we should be going now. 
   Let me say, that I agree with my colleagues who have complained about unequal burdensharing. The Europeans were incredibly slow in approving their contributions to the Kosovo Consolidated Budget, their humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, and getting their police forces on the ground. I commend Senator WARNER for his successful efforts at ensuring they get the picture. We have the right to expect that our European allies do their fair share consolidating the peace in Kosovo, particularly given the unequal burden borne by the U.S. during the war. And I believe that thanks to the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Europeans now understand this and are taking steps to correct the problem. 
   Mr. President, we must maintain American leadership in Europe. We should do our part in solidifying the progress we have seen in Kosovo. I urge my colleagues to support Senator LEVIN's motion to strike the Byrd-Warner language. 
   Mr. President, I admire Senator WARNER, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He is a great American and a great man. While I am not with him on this issue, it is a privilege to be with him on most issues. 
   Also, I believe Senator BYRD, the other author of this amendment, is a man who stands uniquely among us as a defender of the prerogatives of the Senate. I appreciate that, I admire him for that, and I thank him for that. 
   I believe it is Senator WARNER's desire to protect our armed services, as is his charge, and I believe it is Senator BYRD's desire to protect the prerogatives of the Senate that has motivated this. I respect that. I say to them that they have already achieved much of what they hoped to do with this amendment, so this debate, this effort, is not in vain. I tell them respectfully now why I am not with them on this issue. 
   I know that many Americans are weary of our involvement abroad, and I know that many would like to just go home. I actually believe the right political vote in this case would be to vote for a date certain with my colleagues on the other side to get out of Kosovo. I say to every American who cares about foreign policy or our standing in the world, this is not the right way; this is not the right instrument; this is not the right time for this branch of Government to interject itself with this kind of an amendment. 
   I happen to have traveled to the Balkans at the height of the Kosovo conflict. I was privileged to travel with Senator HUTCHISON of Texas in her codel where we visited many of the surrounding countries of Kosovo. I remember when we went to Hungary, we were standing on the balcony of the Foreign Ministry of Hungary, and the Foreign Minister came up to me--this is a 
   beautiful setting, overlooking the Danube--and he said: Senator SMITH, I did not realize when we were admitted to the NATO alliance that we would be at war a few days later, but we are thrilled to be a member of NATO, and we are proud to stand with the United States of America. 
   I drew him out and said: Why do you say that, Mr. Foreign Minister? 
   He said: We are proud to stand with the United States because the United States is a nation uniquely positioned in world history; that we are unique in that we have the capacity to fight for values and not just to fight for somebody's treasure or somebody's territory. 
   I was proud of my country when he said that. 
   I found myself a few days later in Macedonia. When we were there, we were at the point where, coming out of Kosovo through a pass in the mountains, literally tens of thousands of refugees were pouring into two camps. We went to the second camp. There were 50,000 people there. It was arranged that each of the Senators would have an hour there with interpreters. 
   We went through the camp talking to the refugees, examining the conditions of the people, and hearing their concerns. I became aware about halfway through my visit that there were three little girls following me around as though I was from Mars. They looked at me with some degree of awe and wonder. 
   Before we boarded the buses, I decided to try and engage them in a conversation. I was delighted to find that one of the little girls who was 10 years old could speak reasonably good English. I said to her: Would you like to go home? 
   She said: I'd love to go home, but I can't; there are very scary people there. 
   Then I said to her: Well, if you can't go home, would you like to go to America? And her eyes lit up with sparkles. 
   She put her hands to her face and said: Oh, to be a little girl in America. 
   I will never forget that expression. I thought of my own little girl all the way home. I wonder what has happened to that little girl. She did not come to America, but she was able to go home because the United States was there. 
   The United States is in Europe. The world is better because after the Second World War, the United States learned from a mistake and did not repeat the mistake of the First World War. We did not go home. We stayed there as a beacon of stability that Europe has needed and I believe still needs. 
   The Europeans are beginning to feel a need for more security of their own. I have cautioned them: Be careful as you set up these European defense identities that you do it within the context of NATO or you will begin to decouple the United States from NATO. Be careful about this. 
   My concern is heightened because as they talk of setting up these new structures, they are all cutting their defense budgets. It appears to me they are setting up a paper lion. 
   We made a commitment to go into Yugoslavia. If anything should be criticized, it may be we should not have gone into Bosnia. We have elections for a reason. We elected a President of the United States, not of my party, but a President who decided it was in the America's interest as the leader of the NATO alliance to go into Bosnia, and we went. That job was complicated because Mr. Milosevic continued his mischievous ways, his murderous ways in a fashion that was unthinkable to the Western World that we should do nothing. In view of our own troops, we were watching people being exterminated. 
   In the end, I decided to support President Clinton at this next level because I did not want to have to answer why, in the face of mass murder, I did not do anything. 
   Lest Americans think it is all in vain, it is not. Things are not great in Kosovo, but they are much better than when we found them. 
   The benefit of Senator WARNER's work is in this: The Europeans were slow off the mark in meeting their commitments financially and in troops, but they are now. They are putting in the resources, and they are manning 85 percent of the burden there. We have 15 percent, a little over 5,000 troops, there. Is that in vain? Is it appropriate for us now to set an arbitrary cutoff time and, with the blunt instrument of the budget, to say we have had enough, we are going home? I say with all respect, if we do that, we will somewhat be saying to the Europeans what they are saying to us; that  we are ready to delink the United States and NATO. 
   I do not want to do that yet. The day may come when we can say it is time to go home, and the Europeans will be in a position where they can handle it on their own. I do not believe that day has yet arrived. 
   I tell my colleagues and I plead with all Americans to understand that while we can take for granted the peace, the security, and the prosperity of this land, most of the world looks to us as an example and with some envy and some hope that they may someday have what we now enjoy. 
   If America says we are going home, I believe that vacuum will be so enormous, it will be filled not with an ideology but with a whole bunch of tyrants.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I do not want to see that vacuum filled by people who do not share the values of Western Civilization as we know it in Western Europe and in the United States of America. I believe the Europeans are beginning to do their duty and we ought to continue to do ours. 
   I also would like to conclude with an anecdote from campaigning with Governor Bush on Tuesday in Oregon, in which he assured me his opposition to this was not about getting America's withdrawal from Yugoslavia but to do it in a reasoned way, in a bipartisan way, and in a way that does not compromise the long-term security interests of the United States, which is now inseparably linked to Europe. 
   So I plead with my colleagues to vote for the McCain-Levin amendment to strike. I believe this is in the country's interests, in the world's interests, and certainly in the interests of Kosovo. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I have had the privilege for the last hour of sitting in that chair and hearing our colleagues debate the issue of NATO and our place in Europe and the broader national security issues and the specific issue of whether or not we should remain in Kosovo. It is entirely appropriate that this body debate this issue. No one should criticize any Senator for bringing that up or for crafting a piece of legislation designed to focus this Government on an exit strategy. Everyone knows we need one. 
   I add my voice to that of Senator LUGAR, Senator LEVIN, and others, who have expressed concern that while it is appropriate to debate, it is not appropriate to leave at this moment. I wish I could say it is time to leave, but I believe America still has a place in Europe. I believe if we set in motion the wheels to leave Kosovo, we will set in motion the mechanism to decouple the United States and NATO with Europe. I think we need to be very thoughtful about that. 
   I wish Mr. Putin and the new Russian Federation well, and I hope they join the democratic nations of Europe. I hope we can include them in more ways than ever imaginable throughout all of my lifetime. But I think the jury is still out. I hear from their neighbors, still, they are afraid of what happened in Chechnya. The Nation of Georgia trembles. I know Moldovians do, I know Ukranians do, I know Romanians do. They have all been in my office this week, worried that the United States would pull out its stabilizing influence, an influence that, frankly, these emerging democracies look to, count on, and still need. I know we are tired of it. I know we are tired of funding it. I know our fighting men and women don't like being in a police operation. 
   But I also know the cost of leaving Europe is a cost that is much larger than the one we are paying now to stay in Europe. I hope President Clinton and Madeleine Albright and others in our executive branch can figure out how we can get out of there, but get out in a way that does not destroy this institution called NATO, which the world still needs. As Senator LUGAR said, that day may come, that we can go home and the Europeans say goodbye, but that day is not now. 
   I think we should have a vigorous debate, but I think we should be exceedingly careful before we say to our European allies and to everyone watching the United States and counting on the United States, that we are pulling out of Dodge. I don't think we can say that yet. I hope we can say it soon. But I know we can't say it now.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have come to talk to citizens of my State who have a rare privilege in the next few days: The two leading candidates for the highest office in our land will be in the State of Oregon. Vice President GORE will be there tomorrow, and Governor Bush will be  there on Tuesday. I will have occasion to be with Governor Bush, and my friend and colleague, RON WYDEN, will have occasion to be with Vice President GORE tomorrow. 
   Oregonians need to ask a lot of questions to find out where these men are on issues that affect their lives. I came to speak in terms similar to those of Senator GORTON, who wants Washingtonians to ask what I want Oregonians to ask; that is, Mr. Vice President, where are you on the issue of hydroelectric power on the four Snake River dams in the State of Washington? I am not sure I know of an issue of greater importance to our State's environment and our State's economy. As a background to this question, Mr. GORE, where are you on the question of breaching these dams?

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. This is a news release from Department of Energy Secretary Richardson announcing six short-term actions to help prevent power outages. 
   This will blow your mind. 
   We are expecting power outages all over the United States this summer. The long-term forecast for the Pacific Northwest is for energy shortages, as well. If you look at the six proposals for what this Government is going to do, there isn't one proposal about producing energy. The first one is: Look for opportunities to reduce electric consumption at Federal water projects. 
   Let me tell the farmers what that means, they are turning off the switch and they are turning off the water. That is what that means. 
   Second, solicit and approve tariffs that will help reduce electricity demands during peak times. Do you know what that means, Mr. President? That means the rates are going up. It is like a tax increase. So the cost of your energy is going up. We are not going to produce any more, Heaven forbid, we are just going to make it more expensive. 
   The next actions prescribed: The Energy Department will conduct an emergency exercise with State and local governments to help prepare for potential summer power supply emergencies. So we essentially will do a fire drill to see what happens when a whole city shuts down because electricity isn't produced when hitting a switch. Somebody has to turn something before we can have lights. 
   The next one prescribed: the Government is going to gain up-to-date relevant information about potential grid-related problems as quickly as possible. 
   Great. We don't already have that information? 
   Finally, we are going to prepare public service announcements to provide tips for how you can conserve electricity. 
   Nothing in the news release about producing. 
   When Mr. GORE and Mr. Bush are in the State of Oregon, I want Oregonians to ask about our power. I want them to ask how are our lights going to go on at night? How are we going to stay warm in the winter? How are our factories going to continue to operate? How will we have jobs? 
   This is not a hypothetical situation I am posing. These are real potential threats. 
   In spite of all of that, the Vice President is talking about shutting down any offshore drilling. Fine, but realize that has a cost to the environment. 
   Talk about not renewing nuclear licenses for energy plants--but that has an environmental cost as well. I see Senator BYRD on the floor all the time, decrying how the coal fields of West Virginia are being shut down because this Administration does not want to produce any more coal. I hear the people in the northeastern United States screaming about skyrocketing fuel prices in the winter, yet we are becoming more dependent upon foreign oil. Now I hear this Administration, in my neck of the woods, the Pacific Northwest, saying they are going to tear out our hydroelectric power. 
   It is not unreasonable, my fellow Americans, to ask how are the lights going to go on? Our own Energy Department is admitting we have a problem on the horizon. I think the whole country was just reminded that gasoline does not come from a filling station. It is $2 a gallon and climbing in some cases, falling in others, I hope. 
   We need an energy policy. 
   I support conservation initiatives. Raise CAFE standards? I am for that. I am looking for ways to conserve. But Americans are demanding energy and this Administration's policy is to shut down domestic energy production and leave America more dependent on foreign oil. This does not add up. 
   I hope Oregonians understand that it is very important to ask the Vice President of the United States what his policy on energy is. Mr. Bush has already answered it. He said if he is elected President, the dams will stay and you will keep your jobs and the lights will go on at night. I like that answer. It is clear. 
   He also made the point that we can have our energy and we can have our fish as well. Let me tell you a real dirty little secret. As we speak, all that can be heard here in Washington is the gloom and doom about the fish going away. Do you know that in the Columbia/Snake Rivers right now, those rivers are teeming with salmon coming back to spawn? 
   Let me give some numbers. As of today, at the furthest dam they want to take out, called the Lower Granite, 18,000 chinook have passed through this season. Some say, ``Oh, but they must be hatchery fish.'' To those I say no, they are not. A few of the fish are from hatchery stock, but many of them are wild. Do you know how many fish passed through this same dam last year? It was 240. This year it was 18,000. These numbers have many in the environmental community looking pretty ashen-faced. 
   The first dam on the Columbia River that the fish pass through is called the Bonneville Dam, a dam Franklin Roosevelt dedicated, I believe in 1936. As of today, 160,000 spring chinook have passed over that dam this season. These are big returns. There are lots of fish returning. In fact, there are so many coming back that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is clubbing nearly every fish they can find  that is a hatchery fish. They are killing them so they will not spawn because they say that hatchery stock affects the ethnic purity of the wild stocks. 
   The real secret about hatchery fish is that their eggs come from wild fish. But, nevertheless, we have so many fish now, apparently, that we have the luxury of clubbing them to death before they can spawn. By the way, the hatchery fish in the Atlantic salmon recovery program are treated the same as wild fish. But in spite of all this, we're told in the Pacific Northwest that we have to take out our dams. We have to take them out in order to have a normative river. 
   What do we hear from the administration? We hear on the one hand that Fish and Wildlife has concluded the dams have to come out. The National Marine Fisheries Service says we need to study dam breaching for at least 10 years because we do not have a good answer yet. And, by the way, the studies they have been producing are all predicated on data from 1980 to the current date. However, if you look at data dating back to 1960, which is available, you do 
   not come up with extinction modeling. But federal agencies just picked the years that had the worst ocean conditions to argue that the salmon are going to become extinct unless we tear out our dams. I want the fish but I don't want the people to be suckers. I think we are being set up to be that. 
   I would like to know, also from Mr. GORE, why it is that the Corps of Engineers was about to issue their recommendation, which was don't take the dams out, and they were ordered by the White House not to make that recommendation? Why were they ordered to make no recommendation? What that adds up to, I believe, is that this is not about science--this is about political science. Political science is not the basis upon which this decision should be made, particularly when our rivers are full of fish as we speak. 
   What are the consequences if they pull the dams out? I have named a few already, but I do know it adds 13 cents a bushel to every farmer's wheat. I know it means $11 million a year lost in revenue to the barging industry. When you take this wheat from the barges and put it on a truck, do you know how many trucks it takes to replace those barges per day? It takes 2,000 semi trucks a day. You say you care about the environment? Are you going to burn that kind of fuel, burn up those kinds of miles, cause that kind of congestion in the city of Portland and the city of Seattle? Not on my watch you will not. 
   What else does tearing out the dams mean? It means a loss of about $130 million in property values to farmers. What does that mean to property taxes? School support? Roads? All those things are in jeopardy if you take those dams down. Dam breaching takes 37,000 acres of wheat out of production. What happens to those families? Their land goes back to sagebrush. 
   It takes at least 5,370 direct jobs in Portland. I actually think it is higher than that when you look at the ripple effect. When you take out these dams, you lose longshoremen in Portland and the many other service-related jobs that depend on them. Not only that, but to take these dams out, it would cost $809 million. Some have said that it could cost that much for each dam--I don't know whether we can get through this body an appropriation to destroy Federal assets that will be in the billions of dollars. What are you going to replace the energy with? What are you going to burn? This is crazy. 
   What else do you lose? You lose 3,033 megawatts of clean hydroelectric power. That is the amount it takes to run the city of Seattle every day. We are going to take that out in the face of projected energy shortages? Not on my watch. 
   So I say with the Senator from Washington: No, not on our watch. 
   I say to my fellow citizens in Oregon, this is the most important question you can ask Al Gore. Governor Bush has answered it. Please, Mr. Vice President, tell us what is your position on tearing out hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest? One of your agencies says do it. Another says we don't know enough yet. A third says don't do it. And GORE is refusing to answer the question. 
   We can have our fish and we can have our power. There are many things we can do, short of destroying our energy infrastructure and our clean, hydroelectric power. There are many things we can do to save fish short of the destruction of this kind of energy. To replace our clean energy with any other type, you are going to burn something and Oregonians will live in a dirtier place. I do not want them to. 
   I ask the Vice President, respectfully, to answer the question. What is your policy on dam breaching?

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I had the privilege of chairing a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee on April 5 that examined the status of U.S. efforts to resolve still open questions of compensation and restitution arising from the tragedy of the Holocaust, and that looked broadly at the persistent phenomenon of anti-Semitism that inspired and enabled that monstrous crime. 
   Extraordinary witnesses appeared before the Committee--led by Dr. Elie Wiesel, who called on us and all civilized men and women to stand firm against the dark forces of bigotry and other hatreds, and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Stuart Eizenstat, who described the efforts of the United States and other countries to finally and squarely confront with painful truths and achieve some level of justice for the Holocaust's victims and its survivors. 
   One subject that was analyzed for the Committee in great detail was the current reach and impact of anti-Semitism, and I feel particularly indebted to David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee, for his thoughtful and comprehensive testimony on this grave matter. This presentation reviewed not only the scourge of anti-semitism in Europe but the increasingly troubling incidence of this form of bigotry in the Arab world. 
   At the same time that countries across the Middle East are engaged in a peace process guided by Washington that promises a new era in relations between Arabs and Israelis, old anti-Jewish enmities are too often tolerated, or even fanned, by important institutions in the Arab world. Anti-Jewish and anti-Israel propaganda of the most grotesque nature is commonly available--on the newsstands, in schools, in professional societies and political conferences--and almost universally tolerated, even by governments committed to pursuing peace. 
   As the American Jewish Committee asserted, this sanctioning of hatred against Israel and Jews in general, profoundly complicates the search for Middle East peace, fostering a climate in which compromise, accommodation, trust and understanding--on both sides--may be unattainable. This virulent hatred is simply incompatible with the search for peace, and it is the obligation of the region's leaders to act firmly against its continuing dissemination.

<TEXT>
    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing, with my colleague from Oregon, legislation which will correct an oversight in the American Fisheries Act of 1998. Some of my colleagues will recall that the American Fisheries Act was passed as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act in the closing days of the 105th Congress. 
   Let me speak briefly first to the American Fisheries Act, or AFA, itself. The AFA was a major revision of management policies for the valuable Bering Sea pollock fishery, raising domestic vessel ownership standards, while bringing greater stability to the pollock fishery by allowing fishers and processors to engage in limited cooperatives. Months of intense negotiations between interested congressional offices and a number of Alaskan and West Coast fishing interests resulted in the compromise that was passed into law. 
   Oregon certainly does not have as great an interest in the Bering Sea pollock fishery as other states do. Nevertheless, Oregon-based vessels do participate in this and other distant-water fisheries. Many of these vessel owner-operators pioneered the development of the Alaskan pollock fishery during the Americanization of the Exclusive Economic Zone in the 1980s. The American Fisheries Act was supposed to allow these, and other fishing vessels with substantial history, to stay in the fishery while excluding new or speculative entrants. The language used in the AFA to achieve this purpose requires that qualified vessels must have delivered at least 250 metric tons of pollock in 1996, 1997, or an eight month period in 1998, to the shore-based processing plants that compose the ``inshore sector'' of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. Alternatively, the AFA requires vessels to have delivered at least 250 metric tons of pollock in 1997 and have had at least 75 percent of their catch delivered to the ``offshore sector'' of factory trawlers in order to qualify for that sector of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. 
   While it was thought that this qualification language in the American Fisheries Act would carry over all vessels with a substantial history in the fishery, this has turned out not to be the case. An Oregon-based vessel named the Hazel Lorraine--a vessel with years of Bering Sea pollock landings on record--has found itself locked out of both the inshore and offshore sectors of the Bering Sea pollock fishery due to the way the qualifications are worded in the AFA. On the one hand, the Hazel Lorraine does not qualify for the inshore sector. The fact that the then-Tyson Seafood plant in Kodiak was destroyed by a fire in 1997 also impacted the Hazel Lorraine's deliveries during this period. On the other hand, the Hazel Lorraine does not qualify for the offshore sector either--also as a direct result of the Tyson fire.  In short, the Hazel Lorraine does not meet the AFA requirements for either the inshore or offshore sector for Bering Sea pollock despite a substantial record of deliveries in the fishery that stretches back more than fifteen years. 
   Ironically, the owners of the Hazel Lorraine actively supported the American Fisheries Act as it had first been introduced in the 105th Congress. However the bill changed dramatically during a series of backroom negotiations before being tucked into an omnibus appropriations package. The AFA that actually passed the Congress differed substantially from the drafts that had been widely circulated in the fishing industry earlier that year. 
   Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Hazel Lorraine is recognized in the North Pacific as a vessel that can legitimately claim a long history in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. It would be a terrible mistake if the Congress were to allow this vessel to continue to be shut out of its historic fishery. A number of industry leaders and associations, such as United Catcher Boats and the Midwater Trawlers Cooperative, have also recognized this and have stated their support for restoring the right of the Hazel Lorraine to fish in this pollock fishery. 
   Over the course of the past year, Senator WYDEN and I have discussed this issue with our colleagues, and have come to the conclusion that the best course of action is to introduce authorizing legislation that would clearly place the Hazel Lorraine among those vessels eligible to participate in the inshore sector of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. This legislation will do just that. I think my colleagues will find that those in the North Pacific fisheries who know the circumstances surrounding the Hazel Lorraine will be supportive of this legislation. I look forward to working with members of the Commerce Committee to bring this issue to a resolution during this session of the Congress.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to speak briefly in support of this legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st century Act. Clearly, this bill represents a good compromise between the major risk management proposals that have been discussed here in the Senate in recent months. I command my colleagues--specifically Senator LUGAR, Senator KERREY, and Senator ROBERTS--for producing legislation which enjoys broad support in the agricultural community and is unquestionably needed during these times of crisis on the family farm. 
   As we all know, these are not the best of times for farming. Like their counterparts in other natural resources industries, farmers by and large have not equitably shared in the remarkable prosperity we have seen in recent years. Most farmers are faced with another year of low commodity prices on the Horizon. I know that for wheat growers in Oregon, this is the third year of historic low prices. At the same time, the rising costs of production--fueled by energy price spikes, an extremely tight labor market, and incredibly burdensome regulations and government mandates--continue to squeeze the farmer's bottom line. We need to work together to ease this price pressure on farmers and we need to act quickly. Opening up trade, relieving estate tax burdens, seriously reviewing some of the labor and environment regulations that seek to make farmers felons--these are just a few of the issues we need to address to turn around the fortunes of America's farmers. The development of more practical risk management tools is another. That is exactly the promise S. 2251 offers us today--not a fix-all, but a significant and necessary step on the road to farm recovery.

   Another who held this seat with distinction from 1960-1967 was Maureen Neuberger, who was the first woman ever to represent Oregon in the United States Senate, and the third woman in history to serve here. Mrs. Neuberger passed away last week at the age of 94, and I rise today to pay tribute to this remarkable Oregonian. 
   Oregon is a state known for its pioneers and trailblazers, and Maureen Neuberger was no exception. She began her political career in 1950 at a time when women in public office were very much a novelty. Upon her election to the Oregon State House of Representatives, she became one half of a truly historic couple. Her husband, Dick Neuberger, was serving in the Oregon State Senate, and they became the first couple in United States history to serve together in a state legislature. 
   Maureen continued to serve in the legislature even after her husband was elected to the United States Senate in 1954. Upon his death in 1960, Maureen was elected to the United States Senate in her own right. 
   During her years in this chamber, Senator Neuberger earned a reputation as an advocate for consumer rights. She sponsored legislation creating warning labels on cigarette packages, challenged the meat-packing industry for artificially adding water to hams, and exposed bedding manufacturers who sold flammable blankets. 
   She chose to retire from the Senate after serving one term, but remained active through service on presidential commissions and teaching at universities. Throughout her life, she also served as a mentor and role model to Oregon women from both political parties who entered the public service arena. 
   As my State's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, editorialized about Senator Neuberger:  
   Only 27 women have served in the Senate in U.S. history. She was third. The ones who served after (her)--including the nine who serve today--might not have been there at all if Maureen Neuberger had not helped pave the way.  
   I was privileged to meet Senator Neuberger during my service in the Oregon State Senate. I recall her as a gracious and straight talking person who never lost her interest in the issues of the day. Both Oregon and America are better for her life and service.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ``To live fully,'' said Oliver Wendell Homes, ``is to be engaged in the passions of one's time.'' 
   Those words came to mind with the recent passing of the remarkable Oregon journalist, J.W. ``Bud'' Forrester. Mr. Forrester's family and friends can take solace in the fact that here was a man who truly lived a full life, for here was a man who dedicated himself to the passions of our time. 
   As a journalist, Bud Forrester earned a reputation as one of the best newspaper editors in my state. Whether at the helm of the Daily Astorian, or my home town newspaper, the East Oregonian, Bud Forrester called them like he saw them, and could always be counted on to stand up for what he believed was right for his community and his state. 
   That same commitment and common sense were also provided to countless boards and commissions, on which Bud Forrester served throughout his life. President of the Columbia River Maritime Museum, member of the State Board of Higher Education, member of the Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission, unofficial advisor to Senators and Governors, community fund raiser and philanthropist extraordinaire--the list of Bud Forrester's contributions go on and on. 
   I consider myself very privileged to have known Bud Forrester, and know that his legacy of being engaged on the passions of our time will continue in the hands of his son, Steve, who serves as Editor and Publisher of the Daily Astorian. 
   The bottom line is that Oregon is a better place because of Bud Forrester. I join with countless others in my state in extending my sympathies to the Forrester family, and in paying tribute to a true original who indeed lived life fully.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, every time we have a recess and there is an occasion to go home, invariably we all learn something of significance that helps us in our service in the Senate. I thought I would take to the floor of the Senate today and speak about something I learned, something I experienced which I wanted to highlight. Right now, it is an issue that is sort of a low light in this body. 
   Earlier in this Congress, Senator BOB GRAHAM of Florida and I introduced a bill to fix our H-2A guest worker program that affects agriculture. Preceding that, Senators GRAHAM and WYDEN and I met with the Secretary of Labor and pleaded for the administration to come forward with some sort of fix to relieve the pressure on the farm labor system. There are enough workers, but you have to settle for an illegal system to conclude that there are enough workers. The Secretary assured  us that something would be forthcoming, but nothing has been. 
   In the meantime, I have gone forward with this fix of our farm guest worker program in the hopes of getting something through in this Congress that could win the support of the administration and begin to relieve a problem I have now seen in a very human way. 
   I had scheduled two meetings last Thursday, one in Woodburn, OR, and the other in Gresham, OR. The subject was farm labor. I invited people to come and talk about my bill. I was overwhelmed by what occurred. We met first in an armory in Woodburn. When I arrived, it was already filled to capacity. There were 1,200 people, most of them illegal, in the armory waiting for me to come. They had been there, I was told, for an hour or more ahead of time, hoping to get a seat to hear what was going to be shared. There were so many people in the armory, they had to put a speaker on the outside grounds so that those who could not get in could hear. Some in the media estimated there were 2,000 people in total. 
   I looked into their faces and saw those who live in our society, those who live in the shadows of our society, those who fill jobs in our society, those who keep our shelves full at home and in our grocery stores, but those who are victimized in the most inhumane way because we have an unworkable law. 
   I heard all kinds of opinions about my bill. I granted to them that it probably wasn't a perfect bill, but at least I was trying--one of the few who are--to resolve this situation. I thank Senator GRAHAM of Florida for his willingness to step into this issue. One gets lots of arrows in the back when they try to tackle an immigration issue. 
   What motivates me to do this is almost weekly reports of migrant workers dying in the American deserts of the Southwest, trying to make their way to jobs. These are people who are victimized by human coyotes. They are raped. They are robbed. They are bribed. They are pillaged in ways that are unthinkable, and ought to be unthinkable, in this country. It happens because they have no safe and legal way to come here and to go home, to work a job, to earn their way, and to share the American dream, which is really just a human dream. That was the motive upon which I tackled this issue. 
   The law we have regarding our guest worker system doesn't work. There are estimates of 2 million illegal aliens in this country working in agriculture. There are estimates of 6 million illegal aliens in the United States. I was trying to focus on agriculture. Let me tell you why this system doesn't work. 
   First of all, it is economically beyond the pale of most of those in the farm communities who would like to hire them. This is the application. There are hundreds of pages a farmer has to comply with to hire one worker. Conversely, I applied for a job in the Senate, I had to fill out a two-page document. This is what a farmer has to fill out just to get a worker in a system that is untimely as the crops go unharvested. 
   We have a broken system. I believe it is estimated about 30,000 in total in this country use this system out of probably 2 million illegal aliens in agriculture. I think it is a given, a manifest failure. We need to make our guest worker law workable. That is a long-term solution. I think we need to do this. 
   What made my meetings, frankly, more productive and very helpful was a press release from the AFL-CIO, 
   in which they called not for help to farmers and farm workers alone, they called for a general amnesty of all illegal aliens in this country. A general amnesty is something we have done in this country periodically; every few decades we seem to do this. The question now is whether it is appropriate to do that now. 
   There have been lots of editorial comments about this recently in the Washington Post. There was a very interesting article on this whole issue of farm labor and illegality. The Post said:  
   Congress has responded sympathetically to the pleas of the high-tech industry to hire more skilled workers from abroad, but it has yet to do anything for employers of those at the bottom end of the labor market--the end where U.S. citizens don't want to work. Now, with a record number of illegal immigrants living in the United States, an estimated 6 million, with most of them working, some even paying taxes and joining unions, it is time to bring our immigration policies in line with what is actually happening in the labor market. It is time to recognize that we need the immigrants as much as they need us.  
   See, I know in Congress there are a lot of people who make an academic argument that we don't want to reward illegal behavior with a legal document. I understand that, but it doesn't fix the problem. It doesn't deal with reality. These people aren't coming; they are here and they live among us. They live in our shadows and they are victimized on a daily basis in a whole range of ways--bureaucratically, even criminally. It is a shame upon this country that we don't resolve this--short-term and long-term. 
   I was pleased that in the recent testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan he gave support to what I am talking about. Said the Chairman:  
   It is clear that under existing circumstances, not only in the high-tech and in the farm area, but indeed throughout the country, aggregate demand is putting very significant pressures on an ever-decreasing available supply of unemployed labor. The one obvious means that one can use to offset that is expanding the number of people we allow in, either generally or in specifically focused areas. And I do not think that an appraisal of our immigration policies in this regard is really clearly on the table.  
   I think we need to put it clearly on the table as a priority of this Congress to do something about it. It need not be partisan. Regarding the position the AFL-CIO has just taken, I hope they will let me help them. I would like to help them to get a general amnesty. But I think that we also need to fix our broken farm labor system. 
   For those who say we should not do anything, I don't know what their motive is. I fear too often, though, that it is just anti-immigrant. We rightfully criticize, for example, Joerg Haider, of Austria for his anti-immigrant statement, which recalls a bygone era and a great tragedy. But what is the difference when we have politicians among us who make comments not unlike that about even legal immigration? They don't want anymore of it. 
   We have the Chairman of the Federal Reserve saying we need workers because we have good employment, but it is predicated on an illegal system. We need these jobs to be filled and we need crops harvested. Right now, we are victimizing farm workers and farmers because farm workers have to live like fugitives among us, and farmers are made out to be felons. We owe the United States something better. But, more, we owe the people at the bottom rung something better. They contribute to our society and they are victimized too often by our society when they make a significant contribution to the abundance that we enjoy as Americans. 
   So I call on our congressional leadership to bring us together, to fix our H-2A program, but also to pursue the amnesty that has been suggested by the AFL-CIO in this two-pronged approach. We can find a solution and we can treat these people more fairly, like human beings, with the dignity of law and the protection of law and a process that is safe and humane. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator BOXER in introducing the Global AIDS Prevention Act. This legislation authorizes $2 billion over the next five years to support the Agency for International Development's [AID] efforts to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS abroad. Fully half of the funds authorized would go to fight AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The remainder will go to other areas, including some countries of Southeast Asia where infection rates are growing at alarming rates. 
   While the nations of sub-Saharan Africa have faced a myriad of disasters in  the last decades of the 20th century, few reach the cataclysmic proportions that the spread of AIDS has wrought on every level of life in that area. The statistics are mind-numbing--in some countries, one of four adults are living with HIV/AIDS. Life expectancies in those countries over the next 5 years have been slashed from the mid-60s to the early forties. Cumulative deaths attributable to AIDS numbered over 13 million by 1999 and the number of children orphaned by AIDS is estimated between 7 and 10 million. An estimated 1 million children in Africa are HIV positive. 
   These numbers impact every facet of life in this region of Africa. Where populations of adults aren't likely to enter the workforce or care for their children, an economy cannot prosper and grow. Where millions are orphaned, many times watching their parents die, a future that includes any basic education is likely not to happen. Where governments struggle with civil strife, the basic medical needs of its populations go unmet. I am proud of the private and religious organizations that have heroically struggled to fight the impact on families, however it is clear that the scope of the AIDS crisis requires additional support. 
   In an area where some country infection rate reaches one out of four of the adult population, our diplomatic efforts must first and foremost include a means to stop this epidemic. While the internal political strife in some of these countries can be equally heartbreaking in outcome, the ongoing devastation spread by AIDS in some of these countries needs to be addressed in a broad and immediate way. 
   I would like to commend my colleagues from California for her strong leadership in this area and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation and meet this devastating epidemic.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate today to express my support for legislation, introduced by Senator MURRAY and others, that would allow the U.S. Department  of Agriculture to allocate to the Market Access Program unused Export Enhancement Program funds. 
   I have long been a supporter of the Market Access Program, which was designed to promote American agricultural products in foreign markets. Since its inception, it has proven to be a model program and has successfully fostered the growth of American agriculture producers through the expansion of exports. For smaller states like Oregon, the Market Access Program has played a critical role in getting the word out on an array of agricultural goods that otherwise have difficulty penetrating overseas markets. Many Oregon commodities, such as grass seed, tree fruits, and potatoes have benefitted greatly in recent years from the Market Access Program funding. For example, last year the Market Access Program enabled a delegation of Oregon grass seed growers to travel to China to meet with government officials interested in finding quality grass seed to stabilize river banks near the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River. There are numerous other examples where Oregon commodities have been able to make good use of these federal dollars. 
   Despite the achievements of the Market Access Program in recent years, funding for the program has been capped at $90 million. I am pleased today to cosponsor this bill which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to increase the Market Access Program funding up to a total of $200 million using unapportioned Export Enhancement Program funds. 
   This proposal has widespread support in my state from farmers and the agricultural groups that represent them. they recognize, as I do, that expanding markets overseas will be key to restoring the farm economy. 
   Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will take up this issue early in the next session. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation to enhance American agricultural export efforts and the family farms that depend upon them.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Wellstone amendment with 1 hour of debate remaining under the previous agreement. After all time is used or yielded back, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the Wellstone amendment, which will be followed by a vote on the Moynihan amendment No. 2663. Therefore, Senators can expect two back-to-back votes to begin at approximately 10:30 a.m. It is hoped that further progress can be made on the appropriations process during today's session, and therefore votes can be anticipated throughout the day. It is also hoped that an agreement can be reached regarding the remaining amendments to the bankruptcy reform bill so that the Senate can complete the bill prior to the impending adjournment. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise again to oppose the Wellstone amendment. I stand here as perhaps one of the only Members of the Senate who has made his living from agribusiness, specifically as a food processor. I think I know of what I speak this morning. 
   I tell my colleagues, if they are listening via TV or however, this is a vote about whether or not you believe and trust in the free-market system. 
   I also rise as somebody who cares a great deal about farmers. I have voted consistently for farm aid in its many forms as we try to provide it in the Senate. But I am saying the Wellstone amendment will not turn around the ag economy. It does nothing to open overseas markets. It does nothing about global oversupply of grain, and it does nothing to relieve the onerous regulatory burdens placed on family farmers by the Federal Government, such as estate taxes, the unworkable H-2A program, the way the Food Quality Protection Act is being implemented, or the loss of water rights. It goes on and on. 
   The family farmer is more under assault by regulation by this Government than it has ever been by the food processing industry. Frankly, what we are saying is the food processor who perhaps wants to buy 100 million pounds of grain but is offered 200 million pounds because it is produced is somehow to be penalized by the Senate for participating in the free market. It is not right. It is not our system.  
   The Wellstone amendment implies that the Antitrust Division at the Justice Department is incapable of handling these agribusiness mergers. Yet the evidence is to the contrary. This is the same Antitrust Division that has required numerous divestitures in recent agribusiness acquisitions, such as the Cargill-Continental, Monsanto-Dekalb Genetics Corporation. This is the same Antitrust Division that rigorously pursued antitrust proceedings against Microsoft. 
   Antitrust policy has an important implication to American business and deserves the scrutiny of the Judiciary Committee, not posturing on the floor of the Senate. Senator HATCH, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has already announced there will be in his committee hearings on agribusiness concentration, as there ought to be, but not here, not this way, not this amendment. 
   The Wellstone amendment additionally is not evenhanded in its approach. It exempts agricultural cooperatives, some of which are large agribusinesses in their own right. I know from my own experience how to take a small company and make it big by the inefficiencies of the large companies. The Wellstone amendment will prevent mergers that are often necessary to keep plants competitive, employing people in rural and urban areas, and providing important outlets for farm products. 
   It does not distinguish between good mergers and bad mergers. Some of these things have to happen because there is an oversupply of food processors, in fact. The same market forces that are affecting the farmer also affect the food processor. 
   The WELLSTONE amendment will effectively guarantee that no medium-size agribusiness will be capable of growing large enough to rival the scale of the existing large agribusinesses. Again, I say the American dream is for the little guy to become a big guy. This says the food processor has one of two options if he is in trouble: He can either struggle and try to continue or else he can go bankrupt. I point out if you are interested in farmers, remember that more than two-thirds of the farmers of this country do not grow for the agricultural cooperatives; they grow for stock-held-owned companies. 
   The Wellstone amendment will not deconcentrate agribusiness, but it will ensure small- and medium-size agribusinesses are prevented from taking advantage of the same efficiencies enjoyed by their larger competitors. Frankly, the kind of distrust of the market represented by this amendment is the kind of thing we should expect from the Duma in Russia and the National Assembly of France but never from the Senate. 
   In conclusion, I appeal to my colleagues' common sense. This amendment is before us today in the name of saving family farmers. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider for a moment just who supplies the family farmer with critical crop inputs, such as seed and fertilizer. Who does the family farmer sell their production to for processing and marketing? The answer, in most cases, of course, is agribusinesses, the one sector of the economy that is being singled out today for a federally mandated merger moratorium that is certainly a counter to the free market that I believe we value in this country. 
   I remind my colleagues that agribusinesses and farmers are intertwined and interdependent. They are under the same market forces on both sides. When the very visible hand of government intervention in the market place is raised in an attempt to punish agribusinesses, inevitably it will punish family farmers, too. 
   I say again, most farmers do not grow for agricultural cooperatives. They often grow for small family food processors. So what happens to them? Ultimately, no matter the good intentions of those who are behind this amendment because I stand with them when it comes to trying to help the family farmer, I just simply say this is not the way.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The first paragraph states:  
   In the great tradition of prairie populism, Sen. Paul Wellstone has responded to the current farm [crisis] by calling for a federal moratorium on big agribusiness mergers. As a cry of alarm for farmers, this is useful politics. But as a device to restore commodity prices, it is practically pointless, and as a tool of antitrust policy, it is [an] exceedingly blunt [instrument].  
   I join with this editorial in saying that Senator WELLSTONE's motives are good, but his means are just simply misdirected in this case. 
   Ultimately, no matter the good intentions of those who are behind this amendment, it is the family farmers who will pay the greatest price for hobbling the innovation and competitiveness of small- and medium-sized agribusinesses in such a sweeping way. 
   The consequences of the Wellstone amendment run contrary to the stated objectives of its supporters. It will not spur new competition in the large agribusiness sector. It will not induce higher commodity prices for producers. It would be a vote of no confidence in the ability of the antitrust division to enforce our existing antitrust statutes. 
   So I plead with my colleagues, if they can hear my voice. I ask them to vote no on the Wellstone amendment. This is not the way to help the family farmer. We should trust the marketplace, unless we as a government are prepared to subsidize even more and more aspects of our agriculture in this country. We already do a great deal. We may yet need to do more. But we must  not do more in this way, in this Senate, in this time. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Of course. 
   For the record, no one should be President who doesn't know something about green peas either. 
   In all seriousness, I understand what the Senator is saying. I think what the Wellstone amendment, hopefully, is doing--if it does not pass today, I hope it has the Justice Department going to work on this issue. In my view, what we don't need is more layers of second-guessing the marketplace from the Department of Agriculture. 
   We already have a system of antitrust laws. They need to enforce them, and there are serious problems of too heavy a concentration. I just simply tell you that I have seen, in my own experience, when these companies get too big, they create companies coming up behind them. It happens time and time again--for the little guy to become a big guy. It happens also on the farm, as a small family farm. Now you have huge corporate farms. 
   It is a process of the marketplace working. Usually, when we intervene in these ways, we do it incorrectly, bluntly, ineffectively, and we end up hurting the people we are trying to help. I believe we have laws that ought to be employed and, if they are employed, the concerns of the Senators from the Great Plains will be addressed, and they should be addressed.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to say, in a larger sense, if we can single out agribusiness in this way for sort of super-antitrust treatment, if you will, we can single out any industry. I have noticed, in my 3 years as a Senator, we have sort of a merry-go-round of unpopular businesses in this country and we pick them off one at a time. I am very concerned about this process of intervening in a marketplace that works because there are winners and losers in the marketplace. Agriculture is a very difficult industry. I don't know the profits of these big food processors. I, frankly, don't know most of these kinds of industries. Most of the food processors I think of may actually have revenues of $100 million. But that is sales; that doesn't mean profit. They may have losses of $110 million. I don't know. I don't see their books.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to talk so the American people can hear this. The problem we are talking about is that, for agriculture, we are not going to create just an antitrust division that ought to be going to work every day evaluating these things, but now we are going to create a whole new role for USDA to make judgments about the marketplace. I don't trust Government to make those judgments about the marketplace; I really don't. I think we mess it up more than we help it. So I really don't think that satisfies my concern.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am all for the rules Teddy Roosevelt created. If they were enforced, we would not need to develop more Government. 
   I guess I would understand the Senator's amendment more if he didn't exempt agricultural cooperatives. I don't understand that. It is a different forum of how you do agribusiness. It is farmer-owned. But, frankly, it is unfair to other farmers who do not process for nonfarmer cooperatives. I just think if it is good for the goose, it is good for the gander. But it is not in this amendment. It is unfair, and it isn't right. Treat them all the same or, frankly, let's defeat this amendment. I sincerely hope the Senate will not interfere in the marketplace as proposed by this amendment. Allow the Judiciary Committee to go forward and hold its hearings, and let's ask the antitrust department and Justice Department to go to work and enforce the laws we already have.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield, I was not a part of that  agreement. I know what I have been told by the majority leader and by Senator HATCH. Whether the scope is narrowed or not, the principle is the same. If there is an invasion of the free enterprise system, it potentially penalizes all the farmers who rely upon the stock-owned companies in advantage of a few others. 
   I think that is the wrong way to do it. We have some laws. I think they need to be enforced. But this is too blunt of an instrument. If you want to help farmers, this is not the way to do it. If you want to help farmers, you go after the regulations that are strangling them. You open up the international markets. And, yes, you enforce antitrust laws. But you don't create a regulation that interferes in a very blunt fashion with the free enterprise system.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am in no way questioning what the Senator was saying. I wasn't a party to the agreement he was talking about. What I am objecting to is the principle, whether it is a little or a lot. What I am saying is we have the laws to fix these kinds of problems. The Justice Department ought to go to work, and we ought not to be intervening in the agricultural marketplace in this way. 
   If you want to help farmers, help them with their water rights, help them with their labor problems, help them with closed international markets, help them with subsidies, and help them with a whole range of things we do in great abundance around here. But, frankly, get off their air hose when it comes to regulation. They are being strangled by regulation. This is not the way to help farmers; therefore, I object on my own basis--not on the basis of Senator LOTT or any other leader.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to respond to Senator WELLSTONE, not with any personal animus at all, but to give a perspective on this issue that perhaps I uniquely can give because, I say to Senator WELLSTONE, before I came into politics, I was a pea processor. 
   I say to the Senator, his amendment covers everybody I know in the industry, save those who are in farm cooperatives.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I come to the floor, I say to Senator WELLSTONE, with the same interest that he has in farmers. I care very deeply about the rural economy. I note, with great concern, what is happening to my farmer friends and the rural economy. And I simply come here, in respect, and say, while as well-motivated as I believe the Senator from Minnesota is with his amendment, it is too broad and too wrong when it comes to what we believe in in this country, which is a free market. 
   I look at what has affected the farmers in my area and much of rural Oregon. I know in Oregon the Asian flu had a great deal to do with a loss of markets and low commodity prices. I have watched, in horror, as this administration has attacked the grazing industry in my State, going after their grazing rights, making sure the little guy can't utilize public lands anymore. I have watched, with amazement, that in the Columbia Basin there is actually serious talk about taking out transportation systems provided by hydroelectric dams that are able to transport hundreds of millions of tons of wheat and grain inland from Idaho all the way to the Port of Portland and out into the Pacific rim. What happens to those farmers? This bill does not help at all. 
   I look at the Food Quality Protection Act being administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. While I support the Food Quality Protection Act, I have been one who has pled with this administration to employ good science as they review chemical tolerances. As they take away the pesticides, the herbicides that these farmers have depended upon--which have greatly contributed to their ability to be good  farmers and to produce high-quality crops with low production costs--they leave farmers with no effective alternatives. This bill does not address these farmers' concerns. 
   I have to say that the way the Senator from Minnesota has described this day of decision with respect to farmers, I think he has forgotten that we in this Congress have already voted out $8.7 billion in emergency assistance to farmers to help tide them through this very desperate season. 
   Many of us have gone to the U.S. Trade Representative and pled that this time, in Seattle at the WTO meetings, agriculture not be left out. One of the predicates of the Freedom To Farm Act was that we would increase markets and we would decrease regulations. We have not done either of those things. We have diminished markets, and we have increased regulation. We have, I am afraid, perhaps cut the farmer too short a deal. That is in part why we had to send another $8.7 billion in assistance this year. 
   In addition to that, I have tried to help farmers with the whole issue of immigrant labor, trying to reform the H-2A program. I am amazed at the things that are said about those of us who actually believe immigrant workers should have some legal stature to be here, to do labor that they want to do and that agricultural employers need them to do if they are going to have a harvest. I have been amazed at the way that we, who are trying to improve their legal standing, are characterized by those who are in the labor shortage business. 
   If you want to hurt a farmer, just make sure he does not have the ability to have his crops harvested. The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota does nothing for these farmer's concerns. 
   I want him to know, and anyone else interested in this issue, that Senator HATCH, of the Judiciary Committee, has announced that 
   there will be hearings on agricultural concentration so we can examine the instances where perhaps the Federal light ought to be put on a few mergers and acquisitions. We have laws to take care of those things. They need to be enforced. Perhaps they are not being enforced to the extent some would prefer. Senator HATCH's hearings I believe will get at that issue. 
   But the thing I would really to impress upon my colleagues in the Senate is that Senator WELLSTONE's amendment exempts farm cooperatives. I have nothing against farm cooperatives. They do a lot of business in my State, and they do a lot of good in my State. They play a very important role in agriculture. About one-third of the farmers in this country have a farm cooperative for the outlet of their production. How about the other two-thirds? The other two-thirds grow their products for stock-owned companies. 
   What the Senator's amendment is proposing to do is to say that in this 18-month moratorium, no market conduct, no mergers, no acquisitions can occur among stock-held companies. However, this same activity, among farm cooperatives, is no problem. That makes no sense to me. In fact, a lot of farm cooperatives buy stock companies. To me, this is just patently unfair. If we should do something this un-American, this countermarket, we should do it to all. But, frankly, let's not do it to any. 
   There are many ways to help the farm community without this kind of market intrusion by the Government. This really is an amendment that will ask every Senator what they believe about the free market system, not what they believe about helping farmers. 
   My Heavens, there is almost nothing you could bring to this floor that would actually help a farmer that I would not vote for or have tried to vote for and have taken a lot of heat for because I have voted for things that really do help a farmer to survive. But to go in and say one class of farm processors is exempt but two-thirds of you cannot participate in the free market, frankly, strikes me as strange. 
   I will tell you another thing that really is troubling based on my experience. I have seen many farm cooperatives be very good at producing lots of food, lots of surplus. In some instances, some have not been as good at marketing that surplus. So in a backhanded way, what we are saying is, if you organize yourself in this way, you get the benefit of the free market, but if you organize yourself as a stock company, you are limited as to how you can merge, sell, and acquire. 
   What does that mean to two-thirds of the farmers in this country? What does that mean to them, if their output goes to a stock food processor? It means the food processor, if he or she is in trouble, has one option because they can't sell. They can't merge. They could go bankrupt. So what have you done to help the two-thirds of the farmers in this country, if you put their outlet of production in that kind of jeopardy? 
   This amendment is a shotgun blast at the marketplace. I plead with my colleagues, I appeal to their commitment to free enterprise not to interfere in the marketplace in this way. This does not work. This is not fair. This is not the American way. 
   If there are antitrust problems, we have laws for that. If there is illegal conduct, we have laws to go after crooks. But why penalize all of the agricultural community that organizes themselves in stock companies as opposed to farm cooperatives? It makes no sense. I, frankly, don't know of a precedent for that in our Nation's history. Perhaps someone can show me one. This is not the way to help farmers. This is wrong. This penalizes hundreds and thousands of food processors who are trying to deliver to the farmer a good outlet for their product and to pay them a fair price. 
   I am aware of one farm cooperative this year that has said to their growers, the dollar you put in for a crop, we are going to pay you 75 cents this year. And, in this instance, all of the stock food processors are paying 100 cents on a dollar, plus the profit that they guaranteed by the contract. So we are going to punish the processor that is delivering 100 cents and more on the dollar? We are going to advantage those who are delivering less than that? 
   This amendment is misguided and must not pass, or we will be punishing farmers and food processors that simply do not deserve this kind of treatment from the Senate. 
   I rise in opposition to the amendment being brought forward by the Senator from Minnesota. While I recognize the concern among farmers in his state and mine over agribusiness concentration, I believe we would be making a profound mistake if we were to respond to the current situation by adopting this amendment today. 
   I, too, am concerned about the future of family farmers and American agriculture. Agriculture is one of the largest industries in Oregon. It represents more than 140,000 jobs including on-farm employment, food processing, marketing, and all the other factors that go into bringing fine Oregon produce to restaurants, grocery stores, and dining room tables around the country. It is the dominant industry in many Oregon counties, and it flourishes just a short drive from the urban centers of Portland and Eugene. So when farmers are concerned about something, I am too. 
   I am well aware that many people in farm country are suffering these days from another year of low commodity prices. Most of the farmers that have spoken to me about this current farm crisis believe it is mainly due to the lack of overseas market access, expensive environmental and labor regulatory burdens, and in some areas, natural disasters. For a state like Oregon that exports much of its produce across the Pacific, the recent Asian financial crisis has had a devastating impact on farmer's bottom lines. Moreover, in the Northwest especially, I have been witness to an Administration that has not been particularly friendly towards the interests of rural communities by continuously threatening long-standing grazing rights and the essential grain transportation network afforded by the lower Snake River dams. 
   So I have tried to be very sensitive and responsive to the needs of farmers in rural America that have fallen into something of a mini-depression while watching their urban counterparts enjoy an economic boom. Here in the Congress, we have decided to direct billions of taxpayer dollars in assistance to help tide farmers over during these lean years--another $8.7 billion was sent out to farm country this fall. I have voted for these assistance packages knowing that they are short-term  fixes and that much work remains to be done to improve the long-term outlook. Part of this is improving the demand side of the equation through the expansion of trade opportunities. I have been very supportive of unilateral sanctions reform, tearing down agriculture trade barriers through the WTO, and full funding for the promotion of American commodities overseas utilizing the Market Access Program. These efforts are all vital to induce a rebound in world demand, and, eventually, a rebound for our farmer's prices here at home. An equally important part of the equation is to reduce costs of production for farmers that come in the form of excessive federally-mandated regulations. I have worked hard to overhaul the currently impractical H2A guest worker program and free farmers from INS and Social Security Administration intimidation by giving them a legal workforce. I have consistently pushed for a science-based implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act, and an even-handed review of pesticide tolerances. I believe that continued work to open market opportunities for farmers while fulfilling our promises to ease regulatory burdens--in other words keeping the Congress' promises under the Freedom to Farm bill--will be necessary in order to get the farm economy back on track. 
   With that said, I am also aware that many farmers in my state and around the country have reservations about the pace of change and consolidation underway in certain agriculture sectors. The meat packing and grain processing industries have seen a number of headline-grabbing mergers and acquisitions in recent years. Critics of these mergers often cite the 3% rise in consumer food prices that has come over the last 15 years while the farmer's percentage of the food dollar has simultaneously dropped 36%. Others note the high profits attained by large agribusinesses at a time when many farmers continue to suffer from historically low commodity prices. Certainly, the pace of the concentration and how it affects the bargaining power of average producers and the overall future of family farming warrant careful review by appropriate federal agencies and continued study by the Congress. I note that this issue of concentration and competitiveness in agriculture was the subject of a recent hearing in the House Judiciary Committee just a few weeks ago. In addition, Chairman HATCH just announced last week that his Judiciary Committee will be looking into this issue in a comprehensive way early next year. I also want to point out that we in the Congress, largely in response to concerns about the competitiveness within the meat packing industry, just passed a provision to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill that requires mandatory price reporting for meat packers. So I want farmers to know that the issue of agribusinesses concentration has not gone unnoticed by the Congress. 
   I concur with the Senator from Minnesota that this is an important issue. However, I must respectfully disagree with his conclusion that an outright moratorium on agribusiness mergers is the right response. 
   His amendment would impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions among agribusinesses with annual net revenue or assets of more than $100 million for one party, and $10 million for the other. This would affect agriculture brokers, commission merchants, commodity dealers, agricultural suppliers such as seed and chemical producers, and food processors. This moratorium would remain in effect for 18 months or until Congressional legislation on this issue is enacted. In addition, this amendment would create a new 12 person federal panel to investigate the issue and report back to the Congress and the President. I find it remarkable that one week after tearing down barriers to mergers and increased efficiencies in the financial sector, we are now considering doing the opposite for agribusiness, an industry in part responsible for delivering the safest and most economical food supply in the world. What kind of message for American competitiveness would we be sending to the business world by placing such an arbitrary 18 month moratorium on only certain actors within a particular industry? 
   Unlike most people here in the Senate, I have actually run a food processing business. I have had to meet a payroll, efficiently produce a high quality product, endure all of the bureaucratic government regulations--and do it all at a competitive price the consumer was willing to pay. I had to go out there and compete in the 
   marketplace. From my experience, I can tell you that it is a lot more competitive, at least in the frozen vegetable business, than proponents of this amendment would have you believe. I am afraid that the Wellstone amendment, which has not been subject to Senate hearings or markup in committee is overreaching and blatantly unfair to many honest business people in the agriculture sector. 
   We all know that revolutionary innovations have developed in technology, marketing, and food production and processing over the last one hundred years. Our country has shifted from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy to an information technology and service economy. Today American agriculture has become part of a global marketplace. This is a far cry from the turn of the century when many if not most Americans were directly employed in food production and many producers distributed their goods largely within their own local area. The agribusiness sector--from processors and brokers to suppliers and grocers--has changed with the times as well; just like the small farmer buying land from his neighbor to add production acreage, many food processors and agribusinesses have found it helpful, if not imperative, to band together to meet the challenges of the new economy and, ultimately, the demands of the consumer. 
   It is demand of the consumer that I believe is a large reason for the growing disparity between the food dollar paid at the retail level and the cash received by farmers for their crops. Today's consumer is demanding greater convenience, enhanced nutritional value, choices in packaging, low fat and nonfat products, faster and easier to prepare items--all values usually added to the product after it leaves the farm. In addition, all of these new products have to be marketed in some way so that the customer knows they are available and attaches values to the brand names. And, of course, these products must be offered at a price the consumer is willing to pay. 
   There are a host of reasons why companies find it in their best interest to merge or why one company agrees to be acquired by another. Certainly, any of my colleagues that have experience in the business world understand that there are occasions when businesses, searching for the greatest efficiencies and competitive advantage, find the need to sell an underperforming or unprofitable division. There may be another business out there with the right mix to take these divisions on and make them efficient and profitable. In some instances, businesses that are failing would have to close their doors altogether if there is no willing buyer to come in and restructure the company. If there is no buyer for these businesses, the alternative is simply to see these jobs lost. This ability to adjust to the market and the changing demand of consumers is a fundamental component of our free enterprise system. Now, I am aware that a provision of the Wellstone amendment might allow businesses in severe financial distress to request a waiver from Janet Reno, but that option strikes me as especially bureaucratic and time-consuming. 
   Despite their portrayal as the oppressor of family farmers, many agribusinesses are family-owned operations or small businesses. Although $10 million in assets or annual sales sounds like a lot, when considering the capital-intensive nature of many of these food processing and support businesses, it is not an uncommon threshold to surpass. Many of these business-owners and entrepreneurs are depending on their businesses to serve as their nest egg for retirement. The Wellstone proposal would prevent an unknown number of families in these circumstances from selling their business to whom they pleased. 
   Even worse, the Wellstone proposal only applies to certain agribusinesses--it specifically exempts agriculture cooperatives. Many co-ops are large agribusinesses in their own right that have also acquired smaller companies in recent years. Yet, under the Wellstone  amendment, they would be in direct competition with other agriculture businesses and free from the requirements of this moratorium. 
   Mr. President, with this proposal, you would be led to believe that the Justice Department has failed to uphold our federal antitrust laws. However, that has not been the case. In the case that set off much of the concern in the first place, the Cargill-Continental Grain acquisition, the Department of Justice allowed the deal to go through only after the companies divested four port elevators, four river elevators, a rail terminal, and made a number of other concessions to enhance competition. The Justice Department intervened and required similar divestiture before approving the Monsanto Corporation's acquisition of DeKalb Genetics Corporation, ensuring continued competitiveness in the genetically-modified seed industry. Another announcement came just last week with respect to the merger of New Holland and Case Corporations, major farm equipment suppliers. I know the definition of supplier in this amendment exempted farm equipment, but many farmers were concerned about the potential implications of this merger, nonetheless. In this case, the Justice Department again required divestitures on the part of both companies. So, so I think the evidence is clear that the administration is looking at these merger proposals, and looking fairly carefully at what impacts they may have in the market, and enforcing federal antitrust law. Coming on the heals of last Friday's well-publicized victory for the Antitrust Division, I find it astounding that there are those that would imply this is an agency that is sleeping on the job. 
   In closing, I believe the matter at hand is a simple one. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment is the wrong answer to the wrong question. This isn't the key to farm recovery--that lies with expanding trade opportunities, government regulatory relief, and fulfilling our promises under Freedom to Farm. And this is not even the way to solve any flaws that may exist with our current antitrust laws. Those solutions must be developed with the scrutiny and public hearings of the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees. Do we want to set a precedent today by placing this kind of moratorium on business activity for one particular industry and treat them differently than all other businesses? Do we want to take a sweeping and unprecedented step of pushing a merger moratorium on an unknown number of businesses that play key roles in our food chain? I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the correct answer to both questions is no and that the prudent step to take here is to accept Chairman HATCH's offer to have comprehensive hearings on the matter early next year and take subsequent appropriate action in a way that is fair to our farmers, our businesspeople, and our consumers, alike. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to the Wellstone amendment. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to and recognize the contributions Native Americans and Indian tribes have made in the United States and in particular in the State of Oregon. Native Americans have a unique and important relationship with the United States, and Indian tribes continue to persevere in upholding their sovereign governments, economies, culture and heritage. I am pleased to join Senators CAMPBELL and INOUYE in submitting this resolution to designate this month as American Indian Heritage Month, and I appreciate their efforts on behalf of all Native Americans. 
   There are nine federally recognized tribes in the State of Oregon. Each of these tribes has successfully collaborated with State and Federal agencies and continues to develop active partnerships with the surrounding communities. 
   Five of Oregon's tribes are located in Western Oregon: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw, Coquille Indian Tribe, and the Cow Creek Band of Umpquas. Each of the tribes has made its own extraordinary contribution in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest region. The five tribes of Western Oregon have been successful in recent years in restoring their Federal recognition as Indian tribes, and they continue to work to stabilize and revitalize their social, cultural, and economic ties with the State and local communities. 
   There are four tribes located east of Oregon's Cascade Mountains. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, in Easter Oregon, have been successful in their conservation and restoration of salmon and water back into the Umatilla River. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, in Central Oregon, with their Kah-Nee-Ta Resort, have been making significant contributions to Oregon's tourism industry. The Burns Paiute and Klamath Tribes have renewed a foothold in the local economy. 
   Mr. President, I commend the contributions Native American people have brought to my State and this nation. American Indian Heritage Month is an important recognition to the accomplishments and contributions of Native Americans in our country. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this resolution and I look forward to its prompt consideration.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise with Senators GRAHAM, CRAIG, CLELAND, MCCONNELL, COVERDELL, MACK, COCHRAN, HELMS, GRAMS, CRAPO, BUNNING, and VOINOVICH to encourage support of S. 1814, the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1999. 
   Our bill will reform the agricultural labor market, establish and maintain immigration control, provide a legal workforce for our farmers, and restore the dignity to the lives of thousands of farmworkers who have helped make the U.S. economy the powerhouse that it is today. 
   I am sure you are aware of the problems that have arisen within American agriculture. For many years, employers in the agricultural industry have struggled to hire enough legal workers to harvest their produce and plants. 
   As one of the most rapidly growing industries in this country, we can only expect the demand for agricultural labor jobs to continue to rise. When coupled with the lowest unemployment rates in decades, a crackdown on illegal immigration, and increased Social Security audits, the agriculture industry--and ultimately its consumers--face a crisis of devastating proportions. 
   Contrary to some media accounts, these labor shortages and the need for a revised H-2A temporary foreign worker program exist around the country. Mr. President, my colleagues all agree with the General Accounting Office's (GAO) statement that while the labor shortage is not caused by one single problem, regional shortages stemming from region-specific problems do exist. 
   We have a shortage of legal workers in this country and the GAO estimates that there are in excess of 600,000 self-identified illegal aliens currently employed in U.S. agriculture. Another survey done by the Department of Labor also revealed that more than 70 percent, or about 1 million, of those hired to work on U.S. farms are here illegally. 
   Due to the highly sophisticated fraudulent documents in circulation and strict U.S. laws prohibiting employers from scrutinizing these documents too carefully, thousands of illegal workers have been unknowingly hired as a result. This situation leaves many agricultural employers vulnerable to potential labor shortfalls in the event of concentrated or targeted Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) enforcement efforts or Social Security Administration audits. 
   Immigrants are also severely impacted when they must work as undocumented workers. These foreign workers risk their lives paying human ``coyotes'' $1,200 to be smuggled across the desert border in the trunk of a car to work in this country. Because of the risks these foreign workers face in coming here and the difficulty of returning if they leave for a visit home, many go for years without seeing their spouses and children, some never return home. These illegal workers are extremely vulnerable to these ``coyotes'' and other dark elements of society that prey upon them, prohibiting the basic human rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   A recent survey published by the William C. Velasquez Institute demonstrated that a vast majority of registered Latino voters support a new farmworker program. In addition to supporting higher wages and unionization for farmworkers, the overwhelming majority of registered Latino voters--76% in California and 67% in Texas--supported a program where ``illegal immigrant'' farmworkers were allowed to become permanent residents in exchange for several years of mandatory agricultural labor. 
   This poll clearly demonstrates that the current farm labor system serves no one well. Farmworkers support changing an illegal system that victimizes them and their families. 
   This issue is not new to Congress. Our government's H-2A agricultural guest worker program was designed in part to help solve the labor problems facing our farmers. Instead of helping, the H-2A program--the only legal temporary agricultural worker program in the United States--it merely adds bureaucratic red tape and burdensome regulations to the growing crisis. And it is failing those who use it. 
   The H-2A program is not practicable for the agriculture and horticulture industry because it is loaded with burdensome regulations, excessive paperwork, a bureaucratic certification process and untimely, inconsistent, and hostile decision-making by the U.S. Department of Labor. This program is over 50 years old. 
   To illustrate, Mr. President, this is the application I filled out to run for the United States Senate. It is one page, front and back. 
   This is the Department of Labor's 325-page handbook, from January 1988, which attempts to guide employers through the H-2A program's confusing application process. The GAO itself found that this handbook is outdated, incomplete, and very confusing to the user. 
   Even the December 1997 GAO report illustrated the burdensome H-2A process with which employers must comply in order to bring in legal, foreign workers. A grower must apply to multiple agencies to obtain just one H-2A worker. This process is further complicated by the multiple levels of government, redundant levels of oversight and conflicting administrative procedures and regulations. Also, as reported by the recent Department of Labor Inspector General, the H-2A program does not meet the interests of domestic workers because it does a poor job of placing domestic workers in agricultural jobs. 
   We are looking for solutions to not only make it easier for employers to hire legal 
   workers to harvest their crops, but also to ensure that U.S. workers find jobs and are treated fairly in the process. 
   Our bill is a win-win-win for farmers, farmworkers, and immigration control. It reforms the agricultural labor market and establishes and maintains immigration control. It gives farmers the stability of a legal workforce and the certainty that the crops will be harvested in a timely manner. It gives farmworkers the ability to earn the right to legal status, avoid the risks of undocumented status and receive U.S. labor law protections. It addresses a status quo that persons on both sides of the issue agree is indefensible, but until now, has been too easy to ignore. It is a balanced bill that seeks both  short and long-term solutions to the crisis in farm labor. 
   Our bill will allow farmworkers who have a proven history of agricultural employment to eventually adjust to legal status in this country. Serious agricultural workers who are willing to commit to work several years in agricultural employment will receive nonimmigrant status and the rights that go with it. 
   If employment requirements are met, workers can eventually adjust to permanent resident status, allowing them to remain in the U.S. year-round. Utilizing the skills of the existing farmworker workforce, a majority of whom are undocumented status in the United States, would reduce the number of temporary H-2A workers needed. It allows hardworking farmworkers seeking to better themselves and their families the opportunity to earn the right to legal status. 
   At the same time, the current temporary farmworker program--called H-2A--will be reformed to make it more responsive, affordable and usable by the average family farmer who needs temporary help to produce and harvest agricultural crops and commodities. The need and risks of illegal immigration are removed. 
   Our bill provides a system or registry where our unemployed U.S. workers can go to find out about job openings on our U.S. farms. Any legal U.S. resident who wants to work in agriculture will get the absolute right of first refusal for any and all jobs that become available. After the Department of Labor determines that a shortage of domestic workers exists, farmers would be able to recruit adjusted workers. If a shortage of adjusted workers is found, farmers could then utilize H-2A workers. This ensures that employers hire workers already in the U.S. before recruiting foreign guest workers. 
   Our bill also improves the conditions of the farm workers' lives and provide them the dignity they deserve. These needed benefits include providing a premium wage, providing housing and transportation benefits, guaranteeing basic workplace protections, and extending the Migrant and Seasonal Workers Protection Act to all workers. 
   To add more protections for the health, safety, and security of farmworkers, our bill establishes a commission that would study problems with farmworker housing. Our bill also directs the Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture to study field sanitation, childcare and child labor violations, labor standards enforcement and to ultimately make recommendations for long-term changes and improvements. 
   I am very concerned that workers are protected, but let's not forget that growers have been victimized by this process too. In order to feed their families--and yours--the growers need to harvest their crops on time, meet their payroll, and ultimately maintain their bottom line. Without achieving those things, farms go out of business and the jobs they create are lost along with them. So it is in all of our best interests--workers, growers, and consumers alike--that growers have the means by which to hire needed legal workers. 
   While I don't have a crystal ball to predict the future of the indefensible status quo, I can tell you that we will have a major economic and social crisis on our U.S. farmlands if there is not an improvement over the current process. 
   Let's not keep making fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of farmers. 
   I urge my fellow colleagues to join Senators GRAHAM, CRAIG, CLELAND, MCCONNELL, COVERDELL, MACK, COCHRAN, HELMS, GRAMS, CRAPO, BUNNING, VOINOVICH, and me in support of this important bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I extend my sympathies to the family of John Chafee. 
   It has been my privilege to serve with John Chafee for but 3 of the years of his long and distinguished career in the Senate. But I will miss him. I do miss him. 
   I want to say publicly how much I appreciate the many times he came up to me and told me how much he appreciated me and how glad he was that I was here. 
   I thank him publicly for the many times he came to me and talked about environmental issues and told me he had a good environmental bill that he wanted me to be on. Many times, I was on them with him. 
   I appreciated his looking out for me in that regard, and in so many other ways. It was a great pleasure and a high privilege to serve with him in the Senate. 
   I wish his wife and his family my very best and pray God's comfort be with them in this time of their bereavement.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators GRAHAM, CRAIG, CLELAND, MCCONNELL, COVERDELL, MACK, COCHRAN, HELMS, GRAMS, CRAPO, BUNNING, and VOINOVICH to introduce the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1999. 
   Our bill will reform the agricultural labor market, establish and maintain immigration control, provide a legal workforce for our farmers, and restore the dignity to the lives of thousands of farmworkers who have helped make the U.S. economy the powerhouse that it is today. 
   Indeed, these people, the farmers and farm workers, are much of the reason you and I are able to go home to a table full of food. 
   In all of my legislative career--7 years now--I have never found an issue that as quickly moves off the merits and on to name-calling than the issue of immigration. I was amazed and astounded at the things that were said to me and my colleague from Oregon,  Senator WYDEN, as we pursued this issue with the very best of motives last year. Those things are said still. But I challenge anyone who wants to see a better life, I challenge them to defend the current system we have in this country for agricultural workers and farmers. We take for granted when we go to the grocery store all the abundance that there greets us, but we seldom take the time to think of those who helped produce it and bring it to the market. 
   There is a shameful story to be told in this country when it comes to agricultural workers. What I am offering with all of my colleagues--my bipartisan colleagues--is a good-faith effort to make a bad situation much better and to get this country off an illegal system and on to a legal system so farmers no longer need be felons and farm workers no longer need to live in our shadows as fugitives. 
   A few years ago, the GAO issued a report. They said there is no worker shortage in agriculture. They said there is no worker shortage because we have all these illegal aliens here. As a consequence of depending on an illegal system, these people who come--many from south of the border--are subject to the most inhumane treatment by coyotes in human form. These are people who prey upon their fears. These are organizations--even some who profess to be advocates--that hold them up for money, subject them to physical abuse and even rape, and do so in the name of providing labor. They are in business as long as we keep this shameful system illegal. 
   How many people are we talking about? By some estimates, there are 1.6 million illegal workers in agriculture in this country. These are the people who are so often victimized. They will always be victimized as long as we keep them illegal. 
   Senator GRAHAM, Senator CRAIG and I have tried to devise a way to help workers and farmers in three distinctive ways in the bills we have introduced today. First, we provide an opportunity for an adjustment of status so when this bill becomes the law, any worker who can demonstrate he or she has been in this country working in agriculture for some period of time in the previous year can apply for an adjusted status which will give them immediate legal rights and put them on the course over the next 5 to 7 years to work in agriculture and earn permanent legal status, a green card. Their change of status from illegal to legal actually occurs immediately. 
   It was my experience as a person in business that those who got amnesty immediately got a voice. As soon as they had a legal right to be here, their conditions began to improve. The people who will argue against this bill somehow benefit--even profit--by keeping these people illegal and by being their voice. I don't think that serves their interests based on what I saw in the private sector in the middle 1980s. 
   What we are proposing is not amnesty. Some have said this is indentured servitude. The indentured servitude is the status quo. The indentured servitude are those who simply say keep them illegal, keep them down, make sure they don't have the benefits that other workers in America do, and we will somehow suggest we are on their side. The way out of indentured servitude is to give them a legal path to follow. That is what Senator GRAHAM, Senator CRAIG and I are doing. 
   The second part of our bill is to actually reform the H-2A program. To demonstrate that, I have an application I filled out to become a Senator. It is two pages. I filled it out fairly quickly and persuaded 51-plus percent of the people in Oregon to 
   elect me to the Senate. 
   If I am a farmer and I need help, this is the manual that explains how to fill out the application for one worker: It is hundreds of pages long. The manual is unnumbered and covers a multitude of agencies in the Federal Government, all of which have to sign off on every single foreign migrant worker. I am simply saying this program, H-2A, as we have it now, is a manifest failure. It is a manifest failure because very few people utilize it. All of the benefits promised by the current H-2A program go unfulfilled because everyone evades the law because the law doesn't work. 
   What Senator GRAHAM, Senator CRAIG and I are proposing to do is to create a national registry that does not even kick in until all domestic workers have right of first refusal. What it does is connect workplaces and employers with employees who want to work on farms. It will provide an opportunity even for organized labor to go to one place, find out who wants to be there, who wants the job, and even assist them in organizing if they choose to do so. 
   I am not here to oppose organized labor. I am trying to help them, to say there is a legal way to do this that will better serve the interests of real people, and not the imaginary, hoped-for things that some are claiming are possible, which are not possible. 
   Third, Senator GRAHAM, Senator CRAIG and I are providing enhanced worker protections. Specifically, in this program, workers will get no less than the minimum wage, the prevailing wage, or the adverse effect wage rate which is 5 percent above the prevailing rate. This is our attempt to say that these people are due the basics of what American citizens have. In addition to that, they will have transportation benefits, housing benefits, and they will now be covered under the Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Protection Act in ways they were not before. 
   All of this is done because we are here to help. We reach out to all who are in this disadvantaged situation who want to be legal, who want a future, who want to pursue the American dream, and who want to do farm work. 
   Some have suggested we are trying to flood this country with more illegal problems. I say on the floor of the Senate, I don't want one additional worker, but I want those who are here to have a legal way to be here. This isn't as if they are coming; they are already here. It is a shameful situation when we can do nothing for them under law. 
   As this bill goes forward, lots of name-calling will go on, lots of mischaracterizations will be made. However, I ask my colleagues, I ask anyone interested in this issue, to read the bill this time and then tell the truth about it. Do not make it up because we have a problem. It is a human problem. It affects farm workers and farmers and we owe them something better than they have under U.S. law today.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the passage of this very important bill for American agriculture. I want to thank Senator COCHRAN and his staff for all of their hard work to produce this legislation under very difficult circumstances. Although I feel much more needs to be done to address the problems in the farm sector in my state, I will be supporting this conference report today in the hopes that it will provide immediate help to agriculture producers across the country still reeling from the combination of low prices and poor weather this year. 
   Although the underlying bill provides some $60 billion for domestic nutrition programs, food safety, agriculture research and extension, and other important programs administered by the Department of Agriculture, I would like to speak specifically to the farm relief package component of this conference report. This bill contains $8.7 billion in emergency farm assistance for producers hard hit by recent plunges in commodity prices and, in many parts of this country, weather disasters. Of this total, nearly $5.5 billion will go to program commodity producers in the form of increased AMTA payments to help compensate for lost markets. In Oregon, we produce a considerable amount of wheat for export to Asia, especially in the Pendleton area where I am from. For many Oregon wheat producers reeling from collapsed markets and prices, I know these increased AMTA payments may make the difference between keeping land in production and having to sell the farm. Since the beginning of this farm crisis, we have used this mechanism to deliver ad-hoc market loss payments to keep program commodity farmers afloat, and it may be the best and most efficient tool available to us in the short term. However, I believe the only long-term solution is to expand overseas market opportunities for our commodities. Although unilateral sanctions reform was taken out of this bill in conference, I hope we will have an opportunity to revisit this issue before the end of this session so that we may begin to address some of the root causes of our commodity price problems. 
   This farm aid package also provides $1.2 billion for weather-related disaster assistance. Severe droughts, both in the Mid-Atlantic States and in parts of my state, have caused tremendous agricultural losses this year. In addition, as we all know, flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd brought severe farm losses to the Carolinas this fall. Rising waters are also a problem for the second consecutive year in the Malheur-Harney Lakes Basin of Southeastern Oregon, an issue which the conferees have noted in this conference report. Certainly Mother Nature has not been kind to many of our farmers this year, and I am concerned that the $1.2 billion set aside in this conference report to address these weather-related losses may be inadequate. Should this turn out to be the case, I hope that my colleagues and the Administration will be willing to provide the resources to address these needs in a future supplemental appropriations vehicle. 
   Perhaps the biggest reservation I have with this farm assistance package is that it does not provide any funding to address the problems of the so-called minor crops. When the bill passed the Senate last August, it contained a $50 million earmark for fruit and vegetable producers. While these farmers have persevered with virtually no federal assistance in the past, they have not been immune to the Asian financial crisis and the historic downturn in the agriculture sector that we have seen in recent years. Nursery and potato producers are just as much a part of Oregon agriculture as wheat and cattle, yet they are not represented in this relief package. I am especially concerned about the future of Oregon's tree fruit industry. A number of producers in my state may be forced to tear out apple and pear orchards due to the deadly combination of international market collapse, frost and other weather problems, and mounting domestic regulatory and labor costs. I did note that the conferees made fruit and vegetable producers eligible for the $1.2 billion in weather-related disaster assistance money. However, I am afraid that none of this funding will reach Oregon tree fruit producers, considering that this same pot of money will be stretched to the limit to assist producers impacted by weather problems this year. I believe specialty crop farmers deserve a place at the table alongside our program commodity producers, and I hope we will better address their needs in future appropriations legislation. 
   Mr. President, despite the reservations I have about this conference agreement, I find that the few negatives are, in the end, outweighed by the many positive aspects of this bill for the Oregon farm sector. While I look forward to the opportunity to work with my colleagues on the pressing farm issues that have not been spoken to in this conference report, I will be casting a vote in favor of the bill. I hope that we will act affirmatively on this legislation today and not further delay the delivery of this needed relief to family farmers across the country.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate today to introduce legislation which would facilitate two exchanges of public and private lands in my home State of Oregon: the Triangle Land Exchange and the Northeast Oregon Assembled Land Exchange (NOALE). In terms of acreage, approximately 54,000 acres of BLM and Forest Service land is proposed to be traded for nearly 50,000 acres currently held by private landowners in northeast Oregon. As a result of 4 1/2 years of delays with administrative process, there is enormous support from my constituents for a legislative resolution to the exchange. 
   Both the government and the public have deeply rooted interests in this exchange. Federal agencies are seeking to acquire sensitive river corridors which will improve the efficiency of their protection efforts for threatened and endangered fish. Currently, many of these selected lands are intermingled with private parcels and make resource management difficult for the agencies. As you know, the improvement of fish-bearing streams and riparian areas is critical to the survival of many struggling species of fish in the Northwest. 
   Communities and landowners will also benefit from these exchanges. Each and every aspect, from the consolidation of ownership patterns to the release of previously inaccessible timber stands, will boost local economies and enhance the ability of the private sector to manage its own lands. 
   In addition, these land exchanges have received the strong collective support of several Oregon Indian tribes; conservation groups such as the Oregon Natural Desert Association, Oregon Trout and the Sierra Club; the Governor and scores of concerned citizens at large. 
   While these exchanges hold enormous benefit for all interested parties and for Oregon's natural resources, it is apparent that the only sure means of completing them is through legislation. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will take this opportunity and support my colleague from Oregon and me in the swift passage of legislation to facilitate the Triangle and Northeast Oregon Assembled Land Exchanges.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, last week I spoke in this Chamber of the damage that has been inflicted by this administration upon the people and communities of rural Oregon. I spoke specifically about communities such as John Day and Roseburg, communities where the failure of this administration to keep its word with regard to timber harvests has brought  great harm to families, communities, schools, and to their roads. 
   I am grateful to this Senate and the Senator from Washington for his leadership on this issue and voting last week to put the interests of children and families above a survey of fungus, snails, and slugs. 
   I return to the floor today to share with my colleagues a story about another rural Oregon community, one that is facing an uncertain future because of possible actions by this administration. 
   I traveled this past weekend to the community of Burns, OR, in Harney County. Harney County is small in population and large in area. About 8,000 people live in this county. It is roughly the size of the State of Massachusetts. It includes part of the largest Ponderosa pine forest in the whole Nation. It includes over 100,000 head of beef cattle on vast open ranges. It includes the Steens Mountain. 
   I would like to speak to you about the Steens Mountain and what this administration proposes to do with it. 
   Let me begin by saying that to fly over the Steens Mountain, and to tour it on the ground and from the air, as I did last Saturday, is to see some of the most breathtaking scenery in this country or any other; and to stand on the ridgetops of the Steens is to view unspoiled vistas of the Kiger Gorge, the Alvord Desert, and other true national treasures. From its peak you can see the States of Idaho, Nevada, California, and nearly all of Oregon. It is a very special place. 
   The Steens Mountain has remained unspoiled for one simple reason: The people of Burns and Harney County love Steens Mountain. Through unique partnerships between the Bureau of Land Management and private land owners, who own almost 30 percent of the mountain, they have found a formula that has worked. Harney County residents take great pride in their stewardship of the mountain that one rancher referred to, to me, as a ``tough old girl.'' At the heart of their stewardship is the commonsense principle of multiple use. 
   Their pride is very justifiable. According to the Bureau of Land Management, over the past 30 years essentially 100 percent of upland and riparian conditions on the Steens Mountain that needed improvement has, in fact, been improved. 
   I traveled to the Steens in response to a trip that Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt made there several weeks ago. After touring the mountain and praising what had been accomplished by local citizens, Secretary Babbitt also announced that only Uncle Sam could be trusted with the future of the mountain. He said that before this administration left office, he wanted to designate the mountain as a national conservation area or as a national monument; no matter what had been done before and how well it looked, still we cannot trust local citizens; we need to trust those with the wisdom of the bureaucracy in the beltway. Such a designation, as he proposed, would have far-reaching impacts, not only on the future of the mountain but on the future of those who live and work in its shadow. 
   Such an announcement would run counter to the significant efforts of the Southeastern Oregon Resource Advisory Council. It 
   is known locally as the RAC. The council is made up of individuals from conservation groups, resource groups, public bodies, and Federal agencies that have assumed the responsibility of exploring the proposal for a Steens Mountain National Conservation Area. This cooperative approach is the type of open and public process that I support and one that should be supported by this administration. But this group now labors under the certainty that, no matter what they decide, a decision has already been made here that the administration will make a designation. 
   I plan to meet with Secretary Babbitt in the very near future. I hope to do it with my colleague from Oregon and Congressman WALDEN who represents this area. When we do, we will share the frustrations expressed to each of us by citizens of Harney County when we have visited there. They have asked me why this administration is trying to impose a solution where there is no problem. The old adage that this is ``a solution looking for a problem'' has never been more true than when applied to the Steens Mountain. 
   They asked me why this administration does not trust them to continue with their excellent management techniques and innovative practices that have been at the heart of their stewardship. They asked me why this administration would be promoting a designation that would undoubtedly bring more visitors to the area, thereby harming the very environment they supposedly seek to protect. And they asked me if the Secretary's promise to work with them in the months ahead was real or whether this administration has already made up its mind. 
   I would also like to put on the Record the taunting that is being made to the administration by some members of the environmental community from organizations that support more Federal involvement on the Steens Mountain. It was said in the open, in the presence of the media, that Secretary Babbitt and this administration were being urged to find a legacy other than the impeachment scandal. They were literally saying: Grab private land, and you can grab a better legacy for yourself. They were urging a version of a domestic ``wagging of the dog.'' 
   I pray that this is not so because this is not the basis for good land management. Oregon does not need such an insult as was being urged upon this administration by some in the environmental community. 
   The bottom line is that I believe the future of the Steens Mountain in Harney County is in much better hands with the folks who live there--folks such as County Commissioner Dan Nichols and ranchers such as Fred Otley and Stacey and Elaine Davies--than it is, than it ever will be, in the hands of Federal bureaucrats who reside within the beltway. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to strike Section 329 of the Interior appropriations bill. This section is necessary to counter an extremely adverse ruling by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has just been described by my colleagues, as well as a preliminary injunction recently handed down by Judge Dwyer in the U.S. District Court. 
   The case before Judge Dwyer involves the implementation of the Clinton-Gore Northwest Forest Plan, which was unveiled in 1993. At the time, President Clinton said that it ``provides an innovative approach for forest management to protect the environment and to produce a predictable and sustainable level of timber sales.'' 
   The real travesty here is that the supporters of Section 329 are trying to fulfill the commitments made by this Administration in 1993, and we are now doing so over the objection of the Administration. 
   The Northwest Forest Plan was supposed to be the Clinton Administration's historic compromise between timber harvesting and the environment. For National Forests covered by the Plan, timber harvests were reduced by 80 percent. Apparently, that wasn't enough for those who want no timber harvests, because they are again challenging implementation of the Plan in Court. 
   While Judge Dwyer issued a preliminary injunction against the sales directly challenged in the case, the effect of his August 2, 1999, ruling is much broader. 
   The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have made a decision not to award any previously-auctioned sales until the lawsuit is resolved. Further, the agencies do not plan to offer any additional sales until their supplemental EIS on survey and manage is completed and approved. 
   While the Forest Service claims this will be completed by February of 2000, history tells us that this EIS will be appealed and litigated. In fact, the Forest Service hasn't produced a region-wide EIS for the Northwest for 10 years that hasn't been litigated. 
   The current or planned sales affected by Judge Dwyer's ruling contain about 500 million board feet of timber. Since there will be no future sales until the EIS is completed, the total volume affected could be 3 times that high. 
   Further, because many of these sales have already been awarded, if they are enjoined and operations are delayed, or if the government is forced to cancel these sales, the government will be potentially liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. 
   Because so little volume has been sold to date, and is therefore available to purchasers, the injunction of this volume will lead to immediate mill closures, increasing the government's liability for damages. 
   The issue in this case involves the Administration's implementation of one part of the Clinton-Gore Forest Plan, concerning surveys for 77 rare species of fungi, lichens, mosses, snails, and slugs, and for a small mammal called the red-tree vole. Six years into the 10-year plan, the agencies still do not know how to conduct surveys for 32 of the rare species. 
   None of these species is threatened or endangered. Although these surveys are only one piece of the Plan, the consequences of the case are potentially enormous. 
   The real fallacy of the survey and manage requirement is that we are only going to survey on those lands where ground-disturbing activities--such as recreational improvements and timber sales--are planned. In the National Forests covered by the President's Plan, this amounts to about 12 percent of the total forest base that is still available for multiple use. 
   This is not going to tell us about the overall health of these species, since we aren't going to be looking for these species in the remaining 88 percent of the land base. 
   Unfortunately, it could also apply to needed forest restoration activities such as prescribed burns and reforestation on other selected parts of the forests, thereby delaying these activities and increasing their costs. 
   It is unfortunate that the Clinton-Gore Administration ever included this provision in the Northwest Forest Plan. 
   But having done so, it is a travesty that the Administration's failure to effectively implement the plan has resulted in another injunction that will further erode our timber communities. 
   With respect to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, it requires surveys for all ground-disturbing activities. 
   This means not only timber sales, but recreation improvements and forest management activities. Some preliminary cost estimates put the nationwide implementation of the Eleventh Circuit court ruling at $9 billion. It is a Trojan horse rolled in by candidate Clinton to destroy an industry. 
   Therefore, we should make the public policy decision that we will allow forest managers to use the best available commercial data in amending or revising resource management plans, as Section 329 stipulates. 
   This is the standard for data under the Endangered Species Act. 
   The language in Section 329 does not preclude the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture from gathering additional data. 
   It simply gives the Secretaries more discretion to meet land management objectives in a timely manner. 
   Section 329 is designed to give the Clinton administration officials exactly the flexibility in land management that they argued for in court. 
   I am deeply saddened that in the face of the economic crisis about to be visited on my constituents, the President isn't 100 percent behind retaining this language. 
   This isn't an agonizing choice for me at all. If I have to choose here between surveying for red tree voles or keeping hundreds of Oregonians employed in family-wage jobs, I will vote for families. 
   I know that there are those who don't think the language in Section 329 is the best language possible. 
   I will commit to work with my colleagues and the Administration to see if we can improve this language. But I will strongly oppose efforts to strike it. 
   I urge anyone who has a National Forest in their State to support retention of Section 329. 
   If the Eleventh Circuit Court ruling is ever applied nationwide, we will have tied the hands of professional land managers with an expensive, time-consuming and ineffective requirement. 
   I believe my colleague from Virginia has the best of motives, but I only wish he could go with me to rural Oregon and see the human consequences of what he proposes. 
   I began my political career in 1992 running for a rural seat in the Oregon State Senate. It was the same election year that now-President Bill Clinton sought the Presidency. I watched as an opponent of his campaign with admiration for the skill with which he came to my State and reached out to those in the rural communities and made some very dramatic promises, some promises which he said would protect  the environment and ensure a sustainable harvest of timber. 
   He carried my State. He carried your State, Mr. President, with these same promises because a lot of people wanted to believe in him. 
   I have noted with great interest that recently the President --and I applaud him for this--has gone to rural Appalachia. I don't know whether he went to parts of the State of the Senator from Virginia. I know he went to West Virginia, and he decried poverty levels that are lamentable and awful. But there are parts of my State as a result of his forest policies which are in worse shape than those he visited in Appalachia. 
   I rise today with a lot of emotion in my heart because I think the truth has not been told and promises have not been carried out. 
   I have recently come from a town hall meeting in Roseburg, OR, where people are finally looking at oblivion because their jobs are directly dependent upon the sales that have now been enjoined by Judge Dwyer in the district court of the Ninth Circuit. 
   I hope I can reach the heart of every one of my colleagues because this stuff matters in human terms. I wish they would have a more honest approach and say: We don't want any more harvest of timber; let's shut it all down. At least that would be honest. This isn't. 
   I wish they could see the kids in John Day, OR, who go to school 4 days a week because they can't afford to open the school for 5. I want my colleagues to understand what they are voting for. If you distill this down, this is about pitting a survey of fungus, snails, and slugs against children and families who need streets and schools. 
   Now, lest you think the last pine tree in Oregon is about to go down, I am sorry to disabuse you. You can't stop timber from growing in my State. We went to the CRP area not far from where I live. There are wheat fields that formerly were in wheat that were left to go to nature, and there are Ponderosa trees going up everywhere. They are 12 feet high now. 
   I know what the New York Times says. I know what the Washington Post says. But like some of my colleagues, they have never been to my State. They have never looked into the eyes of the schoolchildren who, frankly, don't have an adequate education because the Federal Government made promises to them 
   and their county officials and their school officials that are being denied to them in a very dishonest and disingenuous way. 
   I am angry. It is not right. It is not right to go win an election and then supposedly put up a program that is to provide for the environment, to provide a sustainable yield, and then through subterfuge make sure it doesn't happen, when you have a year to go in your term, when you are decrying poverty elsewhere in this country, but you are creating it in my backyard. 
   I don't think the Senator from Virginia would offer this motion to strike if he could go with me to Roseburg, OR. It has been a long time, has been a lot of heartache, a lot of pain, but it is getting old. It is almost over. Here you and I are defending the President's plan, trying to help him live up to his promises. I want the American people to know that the Clinton-Gore forest plan, at the beginning at least, was honest enough to say: The traditional harvest you have had, we are going to cut it by 80 percent, by 80 percent. The reality is, it is not even 10 percent of what is delivered, and now what we are seeing is there is going to be nothing delivered. 
   That isn't right. A sustainable yield of 20 percent is all that was promised, and yet even that apparently is another mirage. 
   Well, I know the President wishes we didn't have to do a rider, but it is the only tool left because we are running out of time. Your proposal is for a year to allow the Federal courts to allow these sales to go forward. Without the Clinton-Gore forest plan, these sales would be fine; these meet the Endangered Species Act, but somehow in the creation of this plan, they have put in a survey system that isn't economical. It isn't going to happen. It isn't even necessary. It is a fraud. It is a way to undermine their own promises. 
   Well, history tells us this is not going to happen now. I regret to tell the people of rural Oregon that the Clinton forest plan is a failure to them. 
   Another irony. I heard my colleague from Virginia say he read a letter from the Forest Service about their new-found position on this issue. Why didn't they argue that in court? If it was an argument to be made a month ago, why isn't it still a good argument. They have reversed course. Why? Is it only about politics? I think people are sick of that. I think people are ready to be told the truth, and they thought they had been told the truth by the President, at least when it came to his forest plan. I regret to tell them that apparently they have not been. 
   What is at stake? In Judge Dwyer's ruling, about 500 million board feet of timber. By the way, to my colleagues on the other side, if you think by killing the forest industry in this country you are somehow saving the environment, you are the best friend the Canadians and the New Zealanders have ever had because the U.S. demand and use of timber is not going down. It is going up. We have just exported those jobs. So we pat ourselves on the back that we somehow have taken care of our forests, even though it is growing at record rates and subject to catastrophic fire. Even though we pat ourselves on the back, we are pillaging our neighbors' land. 
   I am simply saying, the promise of the President to have a sustainable harvest and a good environment are possible, but it isn't possible with this. We are trying to help the President make it possible. 
   I am saying what is being asked for by the courts now, as required by the Clinton-Gore forest plan, is a survey for 77 rare species of fungi, lichens, mosses, snails, slugs, and for a small mammal called the red tree vole. Well, the agencies don't know how to conduct these things. They don't even know some of these species. The amount of land that is at issue is 12 percent of 100 percent of the land, so 88 percent of the land is not going to be surveyed, only the area where they are digging around. No one contends that any of these things are endangered at all. What is endangered is rural people, creating a new Appalachia with chronic poverty. We are doing it in my State while he decries it in his State. That isn't right, not when they have been promised something better. 
   I conclude my remarks by pleading with my colleagues not to put in an artificial requirement that we will not fund, which is not necessary and which can be adequately provided for, by the way you described it, by giving to the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture the power to do what they already do under the Endangered Species Act, by giving them that power and allowing these things to go forward and keeping some promises. Why don't we keep some promises around here? 
   I want my colleagues to know this is about a survey versus families. It is about snails and slugs versus streets and schools. I ask you to oppose the motion to strike this amendment. What is being done here is wrong. It has human consequences, and we in this Senate ought to be bigger than that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman and his committee for the work they have done on this bill. 
   I rise to encourage my colleagues to vote yes when this vote is taken. I have had the privilege of sitting in that Chair, Mr. President, for a good part of this debate and have seen, with very clear eyes, two different philosophies on the floor of the Senate. One is a philosophy that says that Government spends money better than people can. That philosophy would grow Government. The other philosophy says we trust people; we don't trust Government as much. That philosophy, which trusts people, says let's grow families. Let's trust them to spend it for their needs because they can do it better than we can imagine it here inside the beltway. 
   As I look at this plan that has been produced by our Finance Committee, and through this conference process, my conditions for voting for this have been met. I see both sides allocating the same amount to Social Security. I see both sides allocating the same amount to Medicare, save that we do not expand Medicare, but we dedicate a great deal of money to Medicare. 
   I see both sides making the same commitment to debt reduction. In fact, this Republican proposal conditions the tax cuts upon the actual realization of the surpluses. So people that say we are spending the surplus or spending it without it actually being realized, we will not do that. We will not spend it in the sense of tax cuts if, in fact, these surpluses are not realized. 
   So the question really becomes, Who is going to spend the surplus? Our friends on the other side would do it to grow this Government. We, on this side, would spend it to grow families because we trust people more than we trust Government to spend it wisely. 
   I tell you, as I look at the things that are provided in this tax package, I like what I see. When I look at reducing estate taxes, I say yes because, as a philosophical matter, I do not believe that it is the Government's business to tell you and me how we allocate our estates when we die. 
   It is about redistribution of economics, which is what they are proposing, which is the law. I don't think that is the Government's role. I think we should trust people to distribute their money as they see fit. 
   I look at the marriage penalty reduction. I don't think there should be a bias in our Tax Code against people marrying. I think it is terribly unfair when you have two working spouses, one has a high income, and the other may have a lower income; one is a corporate executive, the other is a schoolteacher; but the schoolteacher, the one with the lower income, gets taxed at the higher rate. What is fair about that? That is wrong. That is a bias against marriage that we should eradicate. If President Clinton wants to veto that, I will let him justify it. 
   I look at the reduction of capital gains taxes, and I wonder, frankly, why we are taxing this capital twice. We should not be taxing it. We should be reinvesting it. 
   That brings me to an important point. I am extremely frustrated every time I hear President Clinton or any other politician take credit for creating jobs. You and I, as politicians, as public servants, do not create jobs, unless we own the stock or unless we buy a bond, unless we invest in the free enterprise system that allows labor to go to work. When you hear President Clinton or any other politician claim they have created jobs, the predicate of that claim is that we are a centrally planned economy. And we are not. We are a free market republic. 
   I think if my party has any contribution to make to this country, it is to make sure we do not become a socialistic, democratic welfare state, because if we become that, we will suffer the kinds of economic consequences that, frankly, our friends in Europe and Asia are suffering, which is little or no growth, high inflation, high interest rates, enormous unemployment rolls. That is the kind of system I don't want to be part of creating.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I think that is what is at stake. What kind of an America do we want? Whom do we trust? Are we the party of government or are we the party of the people? 
   It is a question of whom you trust. It is a question of how you spend the money. When it comes to the essential programs, our programs are the same. When it comes to spending, we spend it differently. One does it for government; the other does it for families. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, next week our Nation will pass an important if unnoticed anniversary--the anniversary of one of the first official notifications we were given of the atrocities of the Holocaust. 
   On August 8, 1942, Dr. Gerhart Reigner, the World Jewish Congress representative in Geneva, sent a cable to both Rabbi Stephen Wise--the President of the World Jewish Congress--and a British Member of Parliament. In it, Dr. Reigner wrote about ``an alarming report'' that Hitler was planning that all Jews in countries occupied or controlled by Germany ``should after deportation and concentration *.*.* be exterminated at one blow to resolve once and for all the Jewish question in Europe.'' Our Government's reaction to this news was not our greatest moment during that terrible era. 
   First, the State Department refused to give the cable to Rabbi Wise. After Rabbi Wise got a copy of the cable from the British, he passed it along to the Undersecretary of State, who asked him not to make the contents public until it could be confirmed. Rabbi Wise didn't make it public, but he did tell President Roosevelt, members of the cabinet, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter about the cable. None of them chose to act publicly on its contents. 
   Our government finally did acknowledge the report some months later, but the question remains: how many lives could have been saved had we responded to this clear warning of the Holocaust earlier and with more vigor? The questions of how the United States responded to the Holocaust and, specifically, what was the fate of the Holocaust victims' assets that came into the possession or control of the United States government, is the focus of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, of which I am a member. 
   This bipartisan Commission--chaired by Edgar M. Bronfinan--is composed of 21 individuals, including four Senators, four Members of the House, representatives of the Departments of the Army, Justice, State, and Treasury, the Chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, and eight private citizens. 
   The Commission is charged with conducting original research into what happened to the assets of Holocaust victims--including gold, other financial instruments and art and cultural objects--that passed into the possession or control of the Federal government, including the Federal Reserve. We are also to survey the research done by others about what happened to the assets of Holocaust victims that passed into non-Federal hands, including State governments, and report to the President, making recommendations for future actions, whether legislative or administrative. 
   The Commission was created last year by a unanimous Act of Congress, and has been hard at work since early this year. Perhaps the most important information that the Commission's preliminary research has uncovered is the fact that the question of the extent to which assets of Holocaust victims fell into Federal hands is much, much larger than we thought even a year ago, when we first established this Commission. 
   Last month, at the quarterly meeting of the Commissioners in Washington, we unveiled a ``map'' of Federal and related offices through which these assets may have flowed. To everyone's surprise, taking a sample year--1943--we found more than 75 separate entities that may have been involved. 
   The records of each of these offices must first be located and then scoured--page by page--at the National Archives and other record centers across the United States. In total, we must look at tens of million of pages to complete the historical record of this period. 
   Furthermore, to our nation's credit, we are currently declassifying millions of pages of World War II-era information that may shine light on our government's policies and procedures during that time. But, this salutary effort dramatically increases the work the Commission must do to fulfill the mandate we have given it. 
   In addition, as the Commission pursues its research, it is discovering new aspects of the story of Holocaust assets that hadn't previously been understood. The Commission's research may be unearthing an alarming trend to import into the United States through South America, art and other possessions looted from Holocaust victims. Pursuing these leads will require the review of additional thousands of documents. 
   The Commission is also finding aspects of previously known incidents that have not been carefully or credibly researched. The ultimate fate of the so-called ``Hungarian Gold Trains.''--for example--a set of trains containing the art, gold, and other valuables of Hungarian victims of the Nazis that was detained by the liberating US Army during their dash for Berlin has not been carefully investigated. 
   In another area of our research, investigators are seeking to piece together the puzzle of foreign-owned intellectual property--some of which may have been owned by victims of Nazi genocide--the rights to which were vested in the Federal government under wartime law. 
   For all of these reasons and more, I am introducing today with Senators BOXER, DODD and GRAMS the ``U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Extension Act of 1999.'' This simple piece of legislation moves to December, 2000, the date of the final report of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, giving our investigators the time to do a professional and credible job on the tasks the congress has assigned to them. 
   This bill also authorizes additional appropriations for the Commission to complete its work. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this necessary and simple of legislation. 
   As we approach the end of the millennium, the United States is without a doubt the strongest nation on the face of the earth. Our strength, however, is not limited to our military and economic might. Our nation is strong because we have the resolve to look at ourselves and our history honestly and carefully--even if the truth we find shows us in a less-than flattering light. 
   The Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States is seeking the truth about the belongings of Holocaust victims that came into the possession or control of the United States government. All of my colleagues should support this endeavor, and we must give the Commission the time and support it needs by supporting the U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Extension Act of 1999.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Oregon and others from cranberry producing states, amends the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, giving cranberry producers the tools they need to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing marketplace. Cranberry growers in my state produce a fruit that is an important portion of our state's agriculture economy. Despite their economic significance, cranberry marshes or bogs are often small and multi-generational family farms. In fact, it is not uncommon to find a grower who is a third, or fourth generation farmer, working the same ten-acre  bog that is or her grandparents or great-grandparents worked in the twenties or thirties. They have a strong tradition of independence and stewardship and have been marvels of ingenuity and productivity for a long time. 
   However, today they are suffering. Prices are down by forty to sixty percent over the levels of only a year ago. In some cases the cost of production exceeds the current value of the harvest crop. While cranberry growers tend to be resilient, many are having difficulties dealing with these extreme market conditions. 
   Our amendment will not solve all of the problems this industry faces in the near-term, but we believe it will help the industry in the long-term. It does not provide any money or increase the regulatory controls on industry. However, the amendment before us today addresses the problems in the cranberry industry in two ways: 
   First, our amendment would expand the information-gathering authority of the Cranberry Marketing Committee beyond the traditional production states outlined in the original Cranberry Marketing Order. When the order was first conceived, cranberries were largely used only as fresh fruit for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, decades of innovation and creative marketing by the cranberry industry has led to a tremendous expansion of this commodity--mainly through its use in juices and other products that are consumed year-round. Unfortunately, the commodity reporting mechanisms provided under the current Cranberry Marketing Order have not kept up with the growth and evolution of the industry. Today, vast amounts of cranberry supplies are imported and processed outside of production states that are subject to the Cranberry Marketing Order. This handicaps our cranberry growers, who are unable to obtain accurate information about the available supply, and therefore cannot make the optimum planting decisions. Our legislation would correct this by expanding the Cranberry marketing Committee authority, ultimately enabling growers to make better production decisions. 
   A second component of our amendment would add cranberries to the list of commodities eligible to use funds raised from domestic procedures for overseas advertising as part of a generic marketing promotion program. Like all other agriculture producers, cranberry growers know the ability to effectively market products in the global marketplace is critical to maintaining growth and increasing price stability. Although it is my understanding that the Cranberry Marketing Committee does not currently plan to initiate such a campaign at this time, our legislation gives them the flexibility to do so. 
   Much has been said in recent months on this floor about the plight of agriculture and an ongoing farm crisis brought about by record low commodity prices. This problem is real and cranberry producers in small Oregon coastal towns like Bandon and Coos Bay have felt it as well. I would like to urge the Secretary of Agriculture to get directly involved with the leadership of the industry to try and find meaningful initiatives that can help them weather this difficult time and ensure a healthy industry for a healthy product. 
   Mr. President, cranberry growers know global competition will become increasingly fierce in the next century, yet they also know that their future prosperity will be built upon effective marketing and production innovation--not expensive safety nets or reactive trade barriers. I thank my colleagues for joining me in support of this amendment to give cranberry growers in my state and throughout the nation the freedom to address the current farm crisis and pro-actively meet the challenges of the new century.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator BOXER in introducing this legislation to help control a deadly and easily communicable disease--tuberculosis (TB). I, like many of you, thought we had this scourge under control since the development of antibiotics more than 40 years ago. 
   However, TB is a real problem here and abroad. It is a disease that knows no borders--because of the ease of transmission of TB, its growth abroad poses a real public health threat to nations like the United States that had previously controlled TB. 
   Our bill will authorize $60 million in FY 2001 to help control this deadly disease. This bill calls for a coordinated effort to wipe out this disease and sets goals for the detection and cure. 
   The statistics surrounding tuberculosis are terrifying. TB kills almost 2 million people abroad every year. The rate of infection abroad is increasing each year and TB is transmitted as easily as the common cold. Every second someone is infected with TB. Further, TB is the leading killer of women, more than any single cause of maternal  mortality. This has an enormous impact on families and the very social fabric of a society. TB is the leading cause of death among HIV-positive individuals. It accounts for almost one-third of AIDS deaths worldwide. 
   Many TB cases are easily treatable by a six-month antibiotic regimen. Tragically, this regimen is only used in 15% of TB cases worldwide. An untreated person with active TB will infect 10-15 people per year. TB control programs are underfunded and poorly organized in many countries. Since millions of people travel between the U.S. and other nations daily, we must develop stable country-specific programs that will control this disease. 
   I believe that our bill is a good strong step towards ending TB here and abroad and I look forward to working with my colleague from California on this legislation. I ask all my colleagues in the Senate to support his important legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a moment about the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act that I am pleased to cosponsor with a number of my colleagues who are concerned about the state of agriculture today. I want to thank Senator HAGEL and his staff for their work on this legislation which refects the input of a number of agriculture groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
   When the Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act in 1996, the idea was to update our pesticide laws so that our farmers could continue to provide the safest and most economical food supply in the world. FQPA eliminated the outdated zero-tolerance Delaney clause for pesticide residues and provided the EPA a framework to review and approve pesticides based on the best scientific evidence available about any health risks these chemicals may pose. What was not intended was to give the EPA the authority to embark on a course to eliminate pesticides based on unrealistic, worst-case scenarios while keeping important stakeholders in the dark. 
   Agriculture in my state of Oregon is incredibly diverse. We have everything from large wheat or nursery operations to small berry farms and hazelnut orchards. While implication of FQPA will surely have implications for program commodities like wheat and soybeans, it is the small speciality crops grown in my state that I am most concerned will be the first to find what may be the only available crop protection tool arbitrarily axed by EPA. At a time when farms all across the country are in the grip of a price depression crisis, our farmers simply can't afford to take another hit--especially one from their own government. 
   Despite our hopes to the contrary, it has become apparent in recent months that legislation is needed to steer the Environmental Protection Agency back towards science-based review of pesticide tolerances under the Food Quality Protection Act. The Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act that we are introducing today requires the EPA to expose its decisionmaking process for public comment, identify areas where assumptions were made, expedite data collection procedures where needed, and streamline the process to get economically viable alternative products approved. The common-sense legislation is the result of consultation with more than 60 agriculture and pest control organizations. 
   Mr. President, the public has a right to know what processes are beingused in the implementation of the FQPA and how the EPA is arriving at its decisions. Our farmers have a right to know that important crop protection chemicals will not be eliminated on a whim by a federal agency. I hope colleagues agree with me that this measure of regulatory relief is urgently needed, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee I have spoken out against hate crimes of many kinds and in many lands. For that reason I cannot be silent at home. I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens. To defend them against the harms that come out of hate. To defend them regardless of their status, be they female, disabled or gay. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act is now a symbol that can become substance. By changing this law we can change hearts and minds as well. 
   The law is a teacher and we should teach our fellow citizens that all crime is hateful. But we can also teach that some crime is so odious that an extra measure of prosecution is demanded by us, so that it will never again be repeated among us. 
   Never again should we in the federal government withhold our help or stand idly by when a Matthew Shepard is tied to a fence, beaten and left to die because he is gay. Never again should we defer to others when one James Byrd, Jr. is dragged to his death because he is black. No, in these cases and in too many more, the Federal Government must have the power to persuade, to pursue and to prosecute when hate is the motive of violence against American victims, no matter their state, no matter their minority or vulnerability.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, many of the HMOs that Senator REID identifies are self-funded insurance plans that are provided by businesses. They certainly are included. 
   As Senator GREGG has noted, the language reads ``discretionary authority'' which is a very broad term. The potential for liability is very great. 
   As I speak to my colleagues and the American people today, I simply say we have a problem. We are mortals, and no one gets out of this life alive. When people die and when they get sick, there are lots of tears. We would like to help. Often, as we reach out to help, we look also for people to blame for tragedy. There are plenty of people in the legal profession to help them find others to blame. 
   I stand before the Senate as a member of the bar. But I am not going to speak as a member of the bar. I am going to speak as the Senator from Oregon and as a member who holds a somewhat unique perspective in this Chamber--as a businessman, also as someone who has actually paid the health care bills. 
   Colleagues, as I have listened to Senator FRIST I have been impressed by his skill as a physician, his nuances and his understanding of these issues and they have been helpful to me. As I watched Senator EDWARDS of North Carolina use his great skill and ability as a trial lawyer to make the case for liability, I was also impressed. 
   However, there are not many people in this Chamber who have actually written the check to provide the health care coverage to their employees. My experience before coming to this Senate was as a food processor. I provided health insurance to hundreds of employees and their families. For nearly 20 years in which I managed that business, I saw health care costs rise three, four, even five times the rate of inflation. My business was not to provide health care, it was to produce food. It was--beyond all others--a cost out of control. 
   These people who are writing the checks, trying to live up to the promise that we all want in this country for health care, are not the enemy. They are trying to do a good job, and to meet the needs of their employees. I cannot think of a single thing that would imperil health care more in this country than removing the protections provided to employers on the issue of liability. 
   We are shown all of the terrible situations by the charts shown in this Chamber. But I say to you, I have a heart, too. I would like to help. But I also know that when you deal with an inflationary cost such as medicine, sometimes you don't have the ability--particularly in agriculture--to pass those costs on in the price of your product. So when you add on top of that the potential cost of liability, I fear that employers will not be able to bear it and will turn that benefit into cash for their employees and simply say to employees--you will have to buy it yourself. 
   But people don't have the ability to buy health care coverage as individuals as well as when they are pooled in employer groups. I support employer-provided health care. I think we are imperiling it if we remove the protections provided to employers by ERISA. 
   Now, employer-provided health care has an interesting origin in our country. It was very rare prior to World War II when we put on wage and price controls but did not limit the ability of businesses and labor to bargain for benefits. When the men went off to war, businesses reached out to many of the  women. They could not offer them a higher wage, so they offered them the benefit of health care. Then businesses began to do this more and more, and it became the subject of collective bargaining under Taft-Hartley and other labor provisions. By the 1970s, nearly three quarters of the American people were covered by 
   employer-provided health care plans. 
   Congress wanted to go further. In fact, it was a Democratic Congress in 1974 that produced the protection called ERISA to further induce and incentivize businesses to expand in a multistate way to provide health insurance. 
   Folks, it has worked. Right now the frustrating thing to me is, as we try to legislate, we inevitably have to draw lines and make decisions. 
   We once were in the position in the State of Oregon of figuring out how best to allocate Medicaid resources. We don't like to have uninsured people in our State; we want them to be insured. Our current Governor's name is John Kitzhaber. He is a medical doctor; he is an emergency room physician. He is a Democrat. He came to the Federal Government, along with many on the Republican side, and said: Let's take this Cadillac plan for a few and essentially turn it into a Chevrolet plan for many. 
   So we got a waiver. Instead of rationing medicine through waiting lines and price, we did it upfront by saying: These are the health care procedures that are available. 
   The Vice President, AL GORE, and others referred to our Governor sometimes in very disparaging terms. He was even called ``Doctor Death'' by the media. But he had the courage, and many with him, to make decisions that were tough. 
   So when we see the pictures and the charts, I say to you that I have been there, I have seen and lived them before. My heart strings are pulled by those, too. But I also know that we don't help them by increasing health care costs--we uninsure them. 
   What we are debating, really, is where to draw the line, how to make health care more affordable to more people. The last thing in the world we should be doing is so disincentivizing the ability of small businesses to afford health care that they will simply turn it into cash.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The letter talks about how many small grocers, as many in business, simply will not be in a position to bear this additional burden. 
   I ask Members to understand, we are talking about a very significant thing. It is not just about price; it is about the ability to participate, and to continue providing health insurance to the working men and women of this country. I ask my colleagues to vote against expanding liability and in support of the Gregg amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise to oppose the MCCONNELL second-degree to the Silk Road amendment. I rise as a cosponsor of the bill. 
   We are constantly called upon in this country to pick sides among parties with ancient feuds. The area of the Silk Road, as defined in this bill, is an area that has long been beset with communism, Islamic fundamentalism, and other interests which, frankly, are inimical to U.S. interests. 
   Section 907 picks a side. I think it is founded on the best of motives but with the worst of results. At the end of the day, if we want to be honest brokers in this fight, it does not help us to be sanctioning one party at the table. 
   This isn't about oil; this isn't about some of the interests of the oil companies that want to develop in the Caspian; this is about being evenhanded; this is about getting beyond the status quo, which simply is not working. 
   In my view, it is appropriate to give the President the discretion to make a recommendation as to whether or not this sanction should continue. If he determines that it is working, fine, leave it in place. If not, I fear we will forever be caught up in picking sides on the Senate floor in conflicts we cannot ultimately end. I believe the U.S. posture in this very sensitive and important region of the world should be fair to both sides. 
   There are atrocities, human rights violations, on both sides. I wish there were just good guys and bad guys; unfortunately, there are plenty of both on both sides. In the end, I ask us to take a more evenhanded approach, support the Brownback bill and, ultimately, I believe, be more effective in this very sensitive negotiation in trying to foster peace, trying to foster development, trying to foster democracy in a part of the world that has known little of any of that. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution regarding a deplorable vote by the General Assembly of the United Nations in February 1999. At that time a resolution was passed recommending a convening of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This Convention protects civilians living in territory occupied by a hostile force. 
   In February, the Palestine Liberation Organization supported by the Arab Group and the nonaligned Movement successfully and wrongly argued that the Convention should meet to adopt measures that would stop Israel from building in what they termed the ``Occupied Palestinian Territory including Jerusalem.'' 
   Only Israel and, I am proud to say, the United States voted against this United Nations Resolution, which carried by a vote of 115 to 2 with five abstentions. Unfortunately, with such a lopsided vote, we now face a situation in which the Swiss Government, as depositary of the Geneva Convention, has been asked to convene this conference on July 15, 1999. 
   This resolution, sponsored by Senators SCHUMER, BROWNBACK and I, commends our Department of State for its strong opposition to the United Nations action and, in addition, asks the Swiss Government to refrain from holding this politicized convention. We intend to send a clear signal to the United Nations General Assembly about the inappropriateness of this resolution and urge our government to continue to work for the cancellation of the scheduled conference.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to thank a departing member of my staff for his contributions to the State of Oregon. Michael Drobac, who currently serves as my legislative aide for defense, labor and judiciary issues, is a native of Eugene, Oregon. Michael received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford University and has been a highly valued aide in my office since my election to the United States Senate. 
   In my short time in the Senate, I have grown to expect and receive unadorned direct advice from Michael on a variety of issues and projects helping Oregonians. He has worked tirelessly on drug control issues and judicial appointments. Michael has worked attentively with affected Oregon communities and the Department of the Army to resolve safety and economic issues surrounding the Chemical Demilitarization program at the Umatilla Depot in Oregon. His advice and work on defense related issues on both the national level and in conjunction with Oregon's fine National Guard has always been exemplary. 
   Michael, is returning to Oregon to attend Law School at the University of Oregon. I wish him well and do not doubt that Michael will put his law degree to good work. I join my staff in thanking him for his time and expertise. Given his background, good character and passion for public service, I would not be surprised to see Michael's return to Washington, DC, sometime in the future, working again on behalf of the state of Oregon.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. On behalf of the Senior Senator from Oregon and myself, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Honorable Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services on the issue of Chemical Demilitarization, 
   Oregon is one of the eight states with chemical weapons stored and awaiting destruction required by the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   Our local communities surrounding the Umatilla depot have serious concerns about the pending demilitarization program. These concerns include the safety of the local population and the impact on the local communities of undertaking a huge demilitarization effort to destroy 3700 tons of chemical agent. 
   This effort will require the influx of nearly one thousand workers to build and operate the destruction facility over a period of eight years. These workers will require the communities to provide facilities, infrastructure and services to accommodate them. These efforts will cost money, and we are concerned that the economic impact of this effort will be a huge drain on the local communities. We are concerned that, while there may be a considerable impact on the local communities, there has not been adequate attention given this issue by the Department of Defense. 
   Would the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee agree to work with us to look into this situation so we can better understand the problem, and in so doing, find a solution? 
   Finally, I mentioned my concerns to the Secretary of Defense. He expressed his willingness to work with us. I would ask that the Chairman and Ranking Member discuss this problem with the Secretary of Defense and consider including language in the Conference Report on the issue of impact. I understand from the Office of the Secretary that the Army will work with us to include some acceptable report language. We want to make it clear that any discussion of impact would be restricted to the chemical demilitarization program and account. Again, I thank the honorable Chairman and Ranking Member.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise first to thank the cosponsor of this amendment, Senator JEFFORDS; and also Senator MCCAIN, who was instrumental in helping me and others to bring attention to the need to get a bill we can be proud of and that actually works. 
   Second, I extend my condolences, my thoughts, my prayers to the people of Atlanta. I know whereof they suffer this terrible day. It was a year ago, and a few days, that Oregon, in Springfield, at Thurston High School, suffered a similar tragedy. Now we must add Atlanta to the roll of Littleton and Springfield and Jonesboro and Paducah and many other places. 
   We stand here today as elected representatives of the people of the United States, to try to do right by them. But too often in this Chamber the focus seems to suggest there is only one answer and that answer is to go after guns. But the problem is so much deeper than that. I am willing to admit there are things we can do, and things we are doing now, that will separate law-abiding citizens and gun owners from the fanatics and the kooks and the criminals, the dangerous and the deranged in our society. We do not want them to have guns. We do not want obtaining guns to be easy for them. But we want to construct a system that encourages the law abiding to come and participate in an instant check, a system that encourages, that incentivizes, and does not just regulate and drive things into the back alley and into the parking lot. 
   The amendment that Senator JEFFORDS and I offer today does two very simple things. We do close the pawnshop loophole. We use the very language of my colleague and friend from New York, Senator SCHUMER, to go back to current ATF regulation to make sure if someone comes in and hocks his gun he cannot then go, commit a felony, and then retrieve that gun without a background check. I have no intention of leaving that loophole open. We are going to close it today. 
   Second, because there is a dispute as to the Hatch-Craig language in terms of licensees, we are clarifying that. We are saying simply those in the new Federal firearms dealer category of a ``special licensee'' must comply with all dealer provisions of the Gun Control Act and always do a background check with no exceptions. 
   This morning we have heard there are apparently 13 additional loopholes. Let me suggest the difference between our amendment and theirs. What our amendment does is incentivize. What their amendment does is regulate. The special licensee, if he obeys the law, comes in and is entitled to an instant check, access to the instant check system. He is not charged a fee, because we are not interested in increasing taxes here. He is immune from civil liability and fines of up to $10,000 and 5 years in prison. We are trying to get people to understand we want them to come in. We do not want to drive them into the back alley and into the parking lot and into the street. We want them to come in, in the light of day, because they are proud of their second amendment rights, and will protect their second amendment rights through instant check. 
   Let me tell you what else we do. There is a huge difference between this amendment and the one my friend from New Jersey is proposing. He is allowing for 72-hour checks. If it takes 72 hours to get a background check, it is not an instant check. If you have ever been pulled over for a traffic violation, you know the policeman will check your car, check your license, check your registration, and he will find out if 
   there is any additional reason, other than a traffic violation, to hold you. We have instant check now. Why do we not make instant check available to people who are exercising their second amendment rights? I want to be real clear: 72 hours is not an instant. We are going down to 24 hours because we want to incentivize this Government to finally go to work and produce instant check, make it available. 
   One of the most appalling revelations to come out of the tragedies of Littleton is that gun laws are not prosecuted by this administration. We can pass all the laws in the world on guns but if they are not enforced they are of little value to this country. So, where it makes sense to add, we are adding. But we call on the administration also to enforce. If we enforce our laws, we will begin to make them efficacious; we will begin to change conduct. 
   But there is an important additional reason for supporting this amendment versus that of the Senators from New Jersey. Many States, as we speak, my own included, are debating the issue of gun shows, are debating the issue of instant check. You and I know very well that law enforcement takes place where crimes occur, at the local level. There are Governors and legislators  who are working with gun advocates, gun opponents, and police forces who are trying to come up with definitions that will work for their States and their localities. That is happening as we are talking. It is happening in my State. If we go to Senator LAUTENBERG's definition, all we would do is nullify much of the work that has already been done and has been passed into law. I am saying we should not do that. Because law enforcement, while we have a role, will remain primarily a local concern because it is locally administered. 
   So I would like to trust the States, to leave them some room, some discretion to fix this problem on their terms, in ways that work in their communities. We cannot know it all here, even though we too often pretend to. So, if you care about the issue of States rights and law enforcement, Smith-Jeffords is the way to vote. If you want Washington to dictate every principle and every definition, then Senator LAUTENBERG's approach is the way to do it. 
   There is another reason. I talked about incentives. I congratulate the Senator from New Jersey. His amendment today is much better than the one I proudly voted against on Wednesday night. That one made sure taxes were raised, Government bureaucracies were built, and everybody in sight got sued. What we are trying to do is not raise taxes, not grow Government, and to provide some immunity, therefore some incentives to get people to comply with these laws. We call upon this administration to enforce these laws. 
   I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will vote for this amendment. We are using Senator SCHUMER's language. I thank him for that. It works. It clarifies. It ties it up. But if you try to tighten every loophole you see, I promise you the effect of your work today will be to create a black market, an underground, a back alley business, a parking lot exchange. I want them to come inside. 
   Because second amendment rights do come with second amendment responsibilities, let's make it easier; let's not make it harder. We are doing this in this amendment. We are applying instant check, we are trusting the States, and we are not growing Government. We are protecting kids in the schools, we are protecting the second amendment right to bear arms, we 
   are protecting law-abiding citizens, and we are getting after the kooks and the criminals, the deranged and the dangerous who haunt our society, to make sure this is not a huge loophole that will give them access to dangerous weaponry. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment and vote against the Lautenberg amendment. It is too much and it will drive this issue into the back alley. 
   Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.

   My point really is this. I wonder if this amendment isn't so regulatory that it really isn't trying to end gun shows, and not an attempt to provide the service that we are asking be provided. If they find that there is a question, shouldn't the Justice Department, the FBI, deny the check in 24 hours, 1 hour, or whenever it occurs, and then go investigate it?

I especially thank Senator HATCH for his indulgence and his leadership; Senator CRAIG, for allowing this to go forward; Senator MCCAIN, for his doggedness and determination to help a number of Members to make sure that what we began yesterday to close this loophole, we, in fact, closed today. 
   I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate and proclaim myself a defender of the second amendment. I say that and also qualify it only in this respect: I defend the second amendment for law-abiding citizens to bear arms--not for nuts and crooks. I think it is possible to defend this constitutional right and also defend kids in the school cafeteria. But to do that, we need to make this technical amendment today. 
   I am proud to stand with my colleagues. I hope the other side will allow this to clear. This is something our country needs. It is something I am proud to be a part of. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, cosponsored by my colleague from Oregon, to reauthorize participation by the Bureau of Reclamation in the Deschutes Resources Conservancy for an additional five years. 
   The Deschutes Resources Conservancy, also known as the Deschutes Basin Working Group, was authorized in 1996 as a five-year pilot project designed to achieve local consensus around on-the-ground projects to improve ecosystem health in the Deschutes River basin. This river is truly one of Oregon's greatest resources. It drains Oregon's high desert along the eastern front of the Cascades, eventually flowing into the Columbia River. It is the state's most intensively used recreational river. It provides water to both irrigation projects and to the city of Bend, which is one of Oregon's fastest growing cities. The Deschutes Basin also contains hundreds of thousands of acres of productive forest and rangelands, serves the treaty fishing and water rights of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, and has Oregon's largest non-federal hydroelectric project. 
   By all accounts, the Deschutes Basin Working Group has been a huge success. It has brought together diverse interests within the basin, including irrigators, tribes, ranchers, environmentalists, an investor-owned utility, local businesses, as well as local elected officials and representatives of state and federal agencies. Together, the Working Group was able to develop project criteria and identified a number of water quality, water quantity, fish passage and habitat improvement projects that could be funded. Projects are selected by consensus, and there must be a fifty-fifty cost share from non-federal sources. 
   From October 1998 to March 1999, the Deschutes Resources Conservancy has leveraged 272,180 dollars of its funds to complete 777,680 dollars in on-the-ground restoration projects. These projects include: piping irrigation district delivery systems to prevent loss; securing water rights to be left instream to restore flows to Squaw Creek; providing riparian fences to protect riverbanks; working with private timberland owners to restore riparian and wetlands areas; and seeking donated water rights to enhance instream flows in the Deschutes River Basin. They have been very successful at finding cooperative, market-based solutions to enhance the ecosystem in the basin. 
   The existing authorization provides for up to one million dollars each year for projects. Funding is provided through the Bureau of Reclamation, the group's lead federal agency. The group did not actually receive federal funding until this fiscal year, but it has already successfully allocated these funds. The Deschutes Resources Conservancy enjoys widespread support in Oregon. It has very committed board members who represent diverse interests in the basin. The high caliber of their work, and their pragmatic approach to ecosystem restoration have been recognized by others outside the region. 
   I am convinced this pilot project needs to continue. That is why the legislation I am introducing today would extend the authorization for federal funds through fiscal year 2006, and increases the authorization for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to two million dollars each year. I urge my colleagues to support this project. Not only is it important to central Oregon, but the Deschutes Recources Conservancy can serve as a national model for cooperative watershed restoration at the local level.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation requiring the Secretary of State to report on actions taken by our Ambassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their group. 
   As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member states that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in a regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key United Nations bodies such as the Security Council. In order to correct this inequality, I am introducing ``The Equality for Israel at the United Nations Act of 1999.'' I believe that this legislation will prompt our United Nations Representative to make equality for Israel at the United Nations a high priority. 
   I am proud to be joined by Senators BROWNBACK and THOMAS as original co-sponsors of this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since 1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any regional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block Israel's membership in any relevant regional group. The Western Europe and Others Group, however, has accepted countries from other geographical areas--the United States and Australia for example. 
   Last year, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that ``It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the United Nations *.*.*. One way to rectify that new chapter would be to rectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is not a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no chance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security council or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be corrected.'' 
   I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with strong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this discrimination against Israel.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to submit S. Con. Res. 30, in order to recognize the sacrifice and dedication of members of America's non-governmental organizations and private volunteer organizations throughout their history and specifically in answer to their courageous response to recent disasters in Central America and Kosovo. I am pleased to be joined by Senators WELLSTONE, THOMAS, SARBANES and BROWNBACK as original cosponsors. 
   While much time on the Senate floor has been devoted to America's response to the natural disaster wrought by Hurricane Mitch in Central America and the human disaster wrought by the horrifying aggression in the Balkans, little has been devoted to those organizations conducting humanitarian relief efforts in those areas. 
   I am proud to note that several Oregon humanitarian organizations have been on the front lines in both Central America and the Balkans--particularly in Kosovo. Mercy Corps International based in Portland, Oregon, is one of the largest humanitarian agencies helping Kosovar Albanian refugees and first began work in that area in 1993. Over the past six years, the agency has provided more than $30 million in relief and development aid to 250,000 people in the area. 
   Whether it be providing food, blankets, clothing, hygiene and cooking utensils to the first onslaught of refugees, or managing refugee camps in Senekos, Mercy Corps International has made humanitarian aid a priority in a desperate situation. 
   In Central America, Mercy Corps' Hurricane Mitch relief efforts included evacuating thousands of children and families, delivering housing materials for tents and temporary shelter, and providing more than 200,000 pounds of  food to the hungry and 60 tons of clothing and blankets to the homeless. I am truly proud of Oregon's Mercy Corps International. 
   Mercy Corps is not alone as a humanitarian presence in Oregon. Portland's Northwest Medical Team International has provided disaster response and emergency relief to refugees of wars and to victims of hurricanes, floods and famines. Each year, Northwest Medical Teams International recruits, equips and dispatches volunteer surgical, medical and redevelopment teams to areas of the world in need of this type of humanitarian aid and assistance. 
   Northwest Medical Teams International ships more than $50 million in humanitarian assistance to over 50 countries each year. Currently, Northwest Medical Teams International is helping to manage the flow of humanitarian aid and to assist refugees in the Balkans and is collecting donations for humanitarian aid in the region through its Kosovo Relief Fund. 
   These two Oregon humanitarian organizations embody what is good in America--the noble effort to reach out and help a neighbor in need, regardless of geography, cultural or linguistic differences. This outreach from non-governmental organizations deserves far more than this resolution, it deserves the sincere acknowledgment and thanks from each citizen of this country.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in an effort of bipartisanship with Senator KERRY, to present our plan to improve the quality of education for the children of this country. The legislation that we are introducing with Senators CHAFEE, COLLINS, SNOWE, BAYH, CLELAND, KENNEDY, LEVIN, EDWARDS, BRYAN, and MURRAY, combines the best ideas from the Republicans with the best ideas from the Democrats--it is a way of reaching across the aisle to accomplish education reform. 
   Our shared goal is legislation that empowers educators, parents, and principals to initiate positive change in the local school districts without burdensome Federal mandates. The Kerry-Smith Plan to Educate America's Children acts upon that goal and incorporates what the President proposed in his State of the Union Address--that our Federal dollars must be invested in programs that work. I couldn't agree more. We need to ensure that we're getting the biggest bang out of our education buck--not only for the Federal Government--but for the taxpayers who deserve it, and who expect it. The taxpayers are not only the watchdogs of how we spend our money, they are the stockholders and have the right to determine the direction and quality of our investment. This legislation turns the taxpayers into stockholders by directing the Federal dollars to State and local education agencies and allows them to manage the money locally--in local school districts and for local students--to enhance and improve the quality of public education in our nation. 
   Our proposal provides local education agencies, parents, principals, and teachers the resources to build upon reform models that have been proven to work, such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse and Success For All programs. For example, the Success For All program focuses on raising the achievement levels of K-12 students in low-performing schools by providing a wide range of assistance, including one-on-one tutoring and family support programs. To ensure that progress is being made, students in the Success For All program are assessed every eight weeks. If a student needs assistance in a specific area such as reading, a tutor is provided to help that student improve his or her reading skills. 
   Mr. President, this is exactly what every school in America should be doing. In addition, the Modern Red Schoolhouse program goes back to the basics and focuses on the core subject areas of math, science, and reading. Students learn to master these subject areas at their own pace in order to fulfill individual learning contracts. Importantly, this program combines parental and community involvement with flexible daily and yearly schedules for students in order to meet their individual goals. 
   It is clear that any education reform proposal must be comprehensive in order to be successful. That is why the Kerry-Smith bill focuses on the needs of children and parents before the school day begins, and after the school day ends. 
   First, our legislation strives to ensure that every child begins school ready to learn by providing the resources to expand existing programs such as EvenStart or HeadStart. 
   Second, our legislation provides the resources for the development and training of excellent principals--and the retraining of current principals to improve the way they manage our schools. This program can be an opportunity to encourage and recruit second-career principals from the business community. 
   Third, we provide the needed support for communities to develop alternative schools for students who need further academic or psychological counseling. One of the concerns I hear in my state is that there aren't enough counselors in each school district. In fact, one particular school district in my state, has one counselor for every 800 students. It is my hope we can greatly increase the number of counselors. Too many children need extra support, and it benefits us all to help ensure they get that support. 
   In this world-wide web generation where everything is changing and growing at such a rapid rate, we're not always able to keep up with the pace and progress of our children. Thomas Jefferson once said something to the effect that each generation is its own nation--and I think that is true to some extent--and it is our responsibility to prepare the next generation as they face the challenges of the next century. 
   So as we begin debating education reform, I will support those policies that fulfill our commitment. We can achieve our commitment by providing comprehensive programs to meet the needs of all of our children throughout the entire school day and after school. 
   We can achieve our commitment by investing in education programs that have proven to work--based on research and real results. And we can achieve our commitment by directing the resources for mentoring and training of our teachers and principals and rewarding local districts that display excellence in education. 
   The Kerry-Smith bill is an aggressive approach and puts these principles to work--not in Washington, D.C., but in our states and local school districts. We realize that there are many education reform proposals that will be introduced in the Senate this year. And despite the differing views of our respective parties on education in previous years, Senator KERRY and I intended to work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a workable solution based on the combined strength of various bills. 
   In closing, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator KERRY, for his foresight and leadership on this issue and encourage my colleagues' cosponsorship and support. The education of our children is, and must continue to be, a bipartisan commitment to excellence.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, my friend from Maryland and I rise today to offer a sense of the Senate out of the concern for the 150 account out of the U.S. budget. It is an account that funds our efforts abroad, our foreign relations. 
   As we speak this evening, bombs are falling on Serbia. I simply note that there are a lot of bombs falling in the world today. It seems like more all the time. Yet, since the mid-1980s, our foreign affairs budget has fallen by 50 percent. 
   I supported the President last night. It was a difficult decision. We are picking among bad options, but, frankly, a good option for us is to wage more peace, a little less war. It seems to me we ought to find a way to limit within the caps but recognize the value to this country of waging peace through diplomacy. 
   Senator SARBANES and I have held hearings, at the instruction of the chairman, on the 150 account in the last Congress and share a concern  about the direction of the 150 account and stand together today to offer this and hope that the Senate can find the resources to do better by our efforts at waging peace. 
   I turn to my colleague from Maryland, Senator SARBANES, and yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of an extraordinary group of people in my state who are working each day to protect our children and teenagers from the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse. 
   The Oregon Partnership, led by Executive Director, Judy Cushing, is the only nonprofit statewide network of drug prevention services available to every community--rural and urban--throughout Oregon. 
   While we may talk about the importance of drug abuse prevention programs on the floor of the Senate, the staff at the Oregon Partnership are turning words into action with very limited federal resources. Their accomplishments and allegiance to the thousands whom they serve, deserves respect and additional federal support. 
   Formed in 1993, the Partnership is governed by a volunteer, 12-member Board of Directors and has a statewide volunteer base of 500 educators, parents, youth, health professionals, business and faith leaders. Together, they share a common goal--to help the young people of Oregon help themselves and their peers--to lead productive and drug-free lives. 
   Through these combined efforts, this group of dedicated volunteers is truly a partnership. With 73 coalitions that reach across the state of Oregon, the Partnership empowers communities at a grassroots level through a strong support network of resources including media relations assistance, event planning and training that targets the local needs of each community. In addition, the Partnership's resource center provides communities and families with materials that provide answers to questions about alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. The Partnership also maintains a website that provides details about other available resources, materials and programs. 
   Recognizing that information is only effective when it is available, the Oregon Partnership houses the only statewide 24-hour helpline with person-to-person contact every day. The HelpLine/YouthLine currently responds to 2,000 calls per month from substance abusers, family members and friends who are searching for referral assistance and information about treatment programs and services within their local area. 
   What is truly exemplary about the Oregon Partnership, is that it provides these services through its network of volunteers. More than fifty professionally trained volunteers provide confidential counseling, information and local treatment referral for chemical dependence and other addictions. Sixty percent of the volunteers are college and graduate students pursuing counseling careers. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the Oregon Partnership is an example of what Congress intended for the use of federal drug prevention dollars. Unlike any other program in our state, the Oregon Partnership is the resource that serves as the link that keeps the chain from prevention programs to treatment strong. The Oregon Partnership is our first line of defense and the kind voice at the end of the phone that says, ``Yes, we can help.'' 
   For these reasons and many more, I would like to take this opportunity to formally thank the directors, members and volunteers of the Oregon Partnership for their dedication and gracious, generous service to the people of Oregon as they work to eliminate drug abuse throughout our state: Judy Cushing, Joyce Adams-Malin, Lloyd Duncan, Jennifer Fogelman, Jill Showalter, Kaleen Deatherage, Penny Labberton, Elizabeth Buskirk, Mary Ellen Apostol, Michelle Kromm, Ericka Ziettlow, Jennie Donnelly, Karla Bateman.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank Senator JEFFORDS for giving us this time, and my colleague, Senator KERRY, for his leadership on this issue. I also appreciate Senator KERRY's willingness to set aside some of the partisanship that divides us on this issue. There are too many good ideas that Republicans and Democrats share in common for us not to make significant progress on the issue that is on the minds of most parents, perhaps, more than any other--the education of their children. 
   While Senator KERRY and I will not be introducing our amendment today to this legislation, I think it is important that we take this opportunity to raise the issue of principal training and development. 
   After speaking with educators, parents, principals, and teachers in both Oregon and in Massachusetts, it became clear to Senator KERRY and I that our principals are too often not prepared to address the needs of our children. As Senator KERRY has said many times, we can't expect our schools to be well managed without good managers. It is time to provide our States and school districts with the resources to train our principals as managers. 
   Our proposal would provide States the needed resources for the development and training of excellent principals, and the retraining of current principals to improve the way they manage our schools. This competitive principals' challenges grant will allow States to develop programs that focus on providing principals with effective instructional skills and increased understanding of the effective use of educational technology and the ability to implement State content performance standards. 
   Throughout the debate on the Ed-Flex bill, we have heard a lot about the need for greater accountability. Our proposal does not expect the States to be accountable. Our proposal requires accountability. State educational agencies must specify how the Federal funds will be used for principal training programs, how the use of these funds will lead to improved student achievement and provide, through annual evaluation, evidence of such improvement having occurred. 
   Importantly, this proposal does not dictate to the States how to implement these programs. Rather, it gives States the opportunity, the resources, and the support to create programs that meet the needs of every school district, rural and urban. 
   Mr. President, as we continue to debate education reform in the Senate, I believe that we must include a component that reforms the way in which our  schools are managed. We have some excellent principals in our school districts in Oregon, in Massachusetts, and all over the country. We now have an opportunity to recruit excellent principals. They are the CEOs of our schools. We should ensure that every principal has the resources and training to be a successful manager. 
   Senator KERRY and I believe that our principals' challenges grant proposal is a strong step toward improving the quality of education in our public schools, and we look forward to working with our colleagues during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Again, I thank my colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, for allowing us time to speak on this issue and for his leadership on the Ed-Flex legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a bill I have introduced today that will provide Oregon pear producers the flexibility they need to meet the demands of their foreign customers. 
   With continued low commodity prices in nearly all sectors of American agriculture, and with financial uncertainty in many of our export markets, now is the time for the Congress to do  all it can to remove unnecessary hindrances to sales of farm products abroad. The legislation which I have introduced today with my colleague, the senior senator from the state of Washington, would delete references to pears in the Export Apple and Pear Act. Under the Export Apple and Pear Act, only pears meeting Federal high quality standards are allowed to be exported. Although this standard served the purposes of the pear industry when the Export Apple and Pear Act was originally enacted in 1933, it has increasingly become an obstacle to U.S. pear producers who desire to enter new markets through the export of lower grade pears. In recent years, pear producers have had to obtain special waivers from USDA in order to sell lower grade pears to the emerging markets of Russia and Latin America. With American agriculture increasingly a part of a larger, global economy, U.S. pear producers need the Congress to remove this antiquated regulatory hurdle to expanded pear exports. 
   Perhaps my colleagues noted that the companion bill to this legislation, H.R. 609, was adopted unanimously by the House of Representatives earlier this week. The swift passage of this legislation in the House is the result of the clear consensus of both the pear industry and the Department of Agriculture that the inclusion of pears in the Export Apple and Pear Act is no longer necessary. 
   Mr. President, from Hood River, in the shadow of Mount Hood, to the Rogue Valley, just north of California, the pear industry has long been a key part of the success of Oregon agriculture. With the regulatory relief provided by this bill, I believe that pear producers in Oregon and around the country will have the ability to continue to compete effectively overseas and prosper at home. I urge my colleagues to join Senator GORTON and myself in support of early adoption of this legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, Morris King Udall is my cousin. But he is more than a kinsman to me. He is a political exemplar and a source of wisdom and humor still. I lament his passing but I rejoice in his legacy. 
   I was but a boy of 8 years when Morris was elected to Congress from Arizona to replace his brother Stewart. It was 1960 and Stewart Udall became the Interior Secretary for John F. Kennedy. It was then that I realized more fully my maternal heritage to public service. My mother, Jessica Udall Smith, often held up the service of Morris and Stewart Udall as public examples worthy to follow in order to make the world a better place and to lighten the burdens of human kind. 
   I grew up as best I could in the tall shadows of Udall giants. I choose to follow their path to pubic service. The way is sometimes hard and the storms many. But it is a way made easier by the humor of Morris Udall. He taught me that humor directed at oneself is usually best and often funniest. He wrote to me that the only cure for political ambition is embalming fluid. He told me to use any of his jokes `cause he'd ``stole `em all fair `n square.'' 
   I learned from him that the greatest thing about the United States of America is not that any boy or girl can grow up to be President, but that any boy or girl can grow up making fun of the President. I learned all of this from cousin Mo and so, so much more. 
   May God bless the memory of Morris K. Udall and may we all fondly remember him too.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and honor two young Oregonians who have received national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Mr. Cody Hill of Portland and Mr. Quinn Wilhelmi of Eugene have recently been named State Honorees from Oregon in the 1999 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor confered on only one high school student and one middle-level student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
   Mr. Cody Hill, nominated by Lincoln High School, created and currently coordinates a program called ``Guns Aren't Fun,'' a toy gun trade-in event to encourage kids to trade in their toy guns for other non-violent toys. His idea is currently being developed into a non-profit organization to spread the message of non-violence across the country. Due to Cody's hard work and determination, more than one hundred toy guns have been turned in during two trade-in events. Cody has worked closely with local non-profit organizations and, to date, he has collected over $13,000 for the purchase of new toys. Cody has also received recognition in local newspaper detailing his volunteer work. 
   Mr. Quinn Wilhelmi, nominated by Roosevelt Middle School, began a tutoring program with fifth grade students in his former elementary school. Quinn's program works to develop the student's writing skills by helping them compose their autobiographies. Through his initiative, Quinn was able to recruit several of his classmates to join in this effort as well, and he has made a tremendous impact on several younger students while working as a writing mentor. 
   In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young people have made. Young volunteers like Cody and Quinn are inspiring examples to us all, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. I applaud them for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact that they had on the lives of others. In recognition of their efforts, Cody and Quinn will come to Washington, DC in early May, along with other 1999 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country. While in Washington, ten students will be named America's top youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection committee. 
   I would also like to recognize four other young Oregonians who were recognized as Distinguished Finalists for their outstanding volunteer service: April Choate of Bend, Jennifer Fletcher of Portland, Julia Hyde of Portland, and Tiffany Wright of Springfield. They deserve high praise for their hard work and determination in helping others in their communities. 
   It is clear that these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary, and I believe they deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can, and do, play important roles in their communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the class from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon, that will be representing the state of Oregon in the national finals of the program We the People ..... The Citizens and the Constitution. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained knowledge and understanding of the principles and values that support our constitutional democracy. 
   The We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress, consisting of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. The student testimony is followed by a period of questioning during which the judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   It is so important that our young people come to understand and appreciate these unique concepts and values which knit our nation together. For it is their leadership which must guide our country's future, and their wisdom which must be equal to our country's need. Again, I congratulate the student team from Lincoln High School and thank each for their dedication and diligence. 
   The student team from Lincoln High School consists of: Graham Berry, Nicole Byers, Brianna Carlisle, Naomi Cole, Violet Dochow, Andrew Dunn, Etopi Fanta, Jordan Foster, Ian Galloway, Arianna Hearing, Sarah Hodgson, Britta Ingebretson, Aaron Johnson, James Knowles, Ashley Linder, Katharine Mapes, Heather Marsh, Amanda Morganroth, Joshua Moskovitz, David Murphy, Eric Nadal, Simone Neuwelt, Melissa Nitti, Lauren Olson, Aubrey Richardson, Caitlin Ryan, Jonathan Schwartz, Elizabeth Smith, Paul Susi, and Katherine Wax, with Hal Hart and Chris Hardman serving as their teacher advisors. They are currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington, DC. I wish the students and teachers the best of luck at the We the People national finals and I look forward to their visit to Capitol Hill.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr President. I thank Chairman BENNETT and Senator DODD. It has been a great pleasure and a real privilege for me to participate in this committee with them. 
   I can tell you that I sought membership on the committee when I heard about its creation. I sought membership not because I am some computer whiz--in fact, my kids are always trying to teach me new things we can do with it--but, frankly, because I recognized that my State, as well as yours, is very much focused on the development of the high-tech industry. Oregon has grown in high-technology in a remarkable fashion in the last decade. So I thought it would be important. I didn't realize how important it would be until feeling my oats as a member of this new committee.  
   Last year, I held a town hall meeting in Medford, OR. We published notice of it. Usually at a town hall you get 20 or 30 people to show up who want to talk about some public policy. But we said it was going to be about Y2K. There were over 1,000 people who came to that meeting. I realized we were on to something here. 
   If any of my colleagues are listening to me at this time, I would say to them that no matter what State you are from, if you want to get the attention of the people you are trying to serve, call a Y2K town hall. You will be amazed. And you will perform a great public service to the people who are becoming aware of this, mindful of it, some afraid of it, some panicked by it. 
   What I have found in Oregon is that by going home to meet with my constituents and saying, ``Look, don't panic, but begin to be prepared,'' has had a calming effect on my State. I thank these two leaders in the Senate, these men who led this committee, because when they first began talking about this issue --and I know in the Republican caucus Bob BENNETT was sort of Chicken Little; he is Paul Revere now, and I honor him and salute him as that. I think, frankly, Chris DODD has done the same thing in the Democratic caucus. We all look to them with renewed respect, and deserved respect, because they have been the Paul Reveres for this country on this issue. It has been a great pleasure to serve with them. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill that will allow the committee to continue to do its wonderful work. I was proud to vote this morning for another bill that would allow the SBA to help small businesses become Y2K compliant. 
   Chairman BENNETT asked me to focus my service on the committee on the whole business industry. Having come from the private sector, I will tell you that businesses have a ways to go, but they are making great progress, because the motive of the business man or woman is to make a profit. I found that for a food processor, for example--whatever the Government standard was, it was an important standard. It was always the floor and was never the ceiling. And when I wanted to sell frozen peas, I wasn't trying to sell it to the Government, I was trying to sell it to Campbell Soup, whose standard is much higher than those of the Government. 
   So for me as a business person, when Y2K would come to my desk, I would say, ``How does this affect my ability to sell my product and make a profit?'' 
   So I say to all business people, this could affect your ability to stay in business and make a profit. So if you are interested in a profit, get interested in Y2K and figure out how it is that this computer glitch might affect either your energy supply, your financial services, your transportation, and your ability to communicate with the world. These things are all interconnected. 
   I never realized as fully as I do now as a member of the committee just how interconnected we are as a country, and now as an entire world. I would predict, as others have, that our problems in this country will be theirs. This is real. But it will not be of a millennial nature, like some fear. But in some parts of the world it may well be. And a business man or woman is going to have to figure out how to deal with an international trade world that is having to adjust to these Y2K problems. 
   I want to also say, to comfort the people out there, that the United States is prospering right now relative to the rest of the world in a remarkable way, in part because during the 1980s and the 1990s American industry began to retool. As we have retooled and restored our industrial base, we have done so with Y2K-compliant equipment and computerization. This will all make the bump in this country much smaller than it otherwise would be. 
   So there are lots of reasons for optimism. But there is still much work to be done. 
   I am just pleased to participate with my colleagues today, and I know that a vote is pending. So, Mr. President, without further delay, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this legislation. Today, I think has become something of a Y2K Day, and it does a great service to our whole country to alert them to the real dangers and not the mirages. 
   In a hearing I recently held in my State, I heard a tragic story about a gentleman who had listened to some literature that caused him to panic. He went out and took all of his savings from his personal account, roughly $30,000. But somebody heard that he had done it and went and robbed him of his life savings. 
   So don't panic; just simply be prepared. Find a reasonable level of storage for food and water for your family, take some copies of your financial statements, check your own computers, but don't do things that are unwarranted, because that will be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. We are not here to be self-fulfilling prophets; we are here to be Paul Reveres, as Senator BENNETT and Senator DODD have shown us how to be. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this bill.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, first let me thank the Chief Justice for the dignity he has lent to this trial. I have so appreciated the keenness of his intellect and the fairness of his spirit. 
   I also join the Senator from Mississippi in thanking these two magnificent men who lead this Chamber. I express to you, my colleagues, the genuine affection that I feel for each of you. I am often asked the question, who do you like and who do you dislike? The ones I especially like are very easy to name; and then when it comes to those I dislike, I cannot name one. I genuinely thank you for allowing me to participate with you in this difficult and historic time. 
   I want to also thank my colleague, RON WYDEN, for his comments about me yesterday. When RON and I ran for the Packwood seat, I think America--and certainly Oregon--saw one of the  most difficult and mean elections in the history of our State. Yet since that time, when I won the Hatfield seat, RON and I have become friends. It was a remarkable thing to both of us that by doing something as simple as having a joint town hall meeting, Republican and a Democrat from the same State, it led to a full-page story in the New York Times. That is a sad commentary. 
   The truth of the matter is that if RON WYDEN and I can become friends and do things to the credit and benefit of our State, so can you all. I actually believe that this trial will bring us closer together over time, and I hope lay a foundation for some very good work in the 106th Congress. 
   Today, as Oregon's other Senator, I will cast two votes to convict and remove the President of the United States. Reaching this verdict has been a very difficult ordeal for me, and I would like to tell you why. This Mr. SMITH did not come to Washington, DC to oppose President Clinton. Indeed, over the last 2 years there have been many issues, ranging from the expansion of NATO to the promotion of free trade and the fight against big tobacco, in which I have supported him and worked closely with him. As I have met with President Clinton in his office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, he has consistently treated me with great civility and has often inspired me with his eloquence. 
   To be in his presence is to experience the magic of his enormous personal and political talents. It is the magnitude of his talents that makes the magnitude of his misdeeds so disappointing. There can be no doubt that President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of his words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to our culture and to our children. These personal conclusions, however, do not provide a constitutional basis for his removal. Only his high crimes could justify such a vote. 
   As you know, the House of Representatives argued two articles of impeachment to us. Article I alleged four instances of perjury before a grand jury; Article II alleged seven instances of obstruction of justice. 
   The House managers presented us with volumes of direct and circumstantial evidence, and the White House lawyers worked skillfully to plant the seeds of reasonable doubt. But as the trial progressed, I found that these seeds of doubt could only grow in proportion to my ability to suspend common sense. I struggled throughout the trial to find a way to acquit the President, if possible, on both or at least one of the articles. But in the end, the facts kept getting in my way. The stained blue dress. The Dick Morris poll asking whether the President could get away with perjury. Monica in tears in the Oval Office being told she could not come back to the White House, and then being threatened that it is a crime to pressure the President in that way. 
   These facts and so many, many more led me to the logical, inescapable conclusion that what began as private indiscretions became public felonies. It is even more ironic to me that I had not made up my mind on article I until Mr. Ruff was in his closing arguments. We had just seen a videotape of Mr. Blumenthal saying that what he had been told was a lie, and we saw Mr. Ruff play the videotape of Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony in which he said, ``What I told him was truthful but misleading.'' That was a lie. And it was to a grand jury. It revealed the calculations of his mind to obstruct justice. So common sense caught up with this juror. 
   Having concluded that the President did, indeed, commit perjury and attempt to obstruct justice, I had to ask if these offenses were high crimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the founders of this Nation. Like many of you, I found answers and comfort in the Federalist Papers Essay No. 65 written by Alexander Hamilton spoke directly to the ultimate power of impeachment. You remember his words; I won't repeat them. They will be in the RECORD many times. 
   When Senator MOYNIHAN speaks, he is kind of like E.F. Hutton to me--I listen. He had a wonderful statement yesterday about the kinds of impeachable offenses. He cited the example of Justice Chase and President JOHNSON. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN said that they were nearly impeached for their opinions, and to have done so would have been wrong. But it is not Bill Clinton's opinions that affect my vote, it is his conduct. 
   Now, what is his conduct here? Last night, I think we all saw a brilliant statement by Senator EDWARDS. I think we saw firsthand why he has made so much money talking to jurors. We are seeing right now why I had to make my money selling frozen peas. I went through the same calculations as Senator EDWARDS, but I want to point out to you some very different reasoning that led me to come down on the other side. See, Senator EDWARDS is talking about what you do when you talk to a jury about taking someone's life or their liberty. That is not what we are doing here. We are talking about protecting the public trust, protecting the Constitution. So the arguments that he made ultimately aren't the ones that we ought to be using to decide whether to remove President Clinton from office. 
   Now, what was so bad about President Clinton's conduct? The scales that Senator EDWARDS spoke to us about, the fulcrum of justice, won't work if President Clinton's conduct is sanctioned by this body or by any court. What President Clinton did was an attack on the Government, and specifically on the judicial branch of Government. You see, the courts aren't supposed to write law, though, Mr. Chief Justice; they do too much of that. The courts don't have any power to raise taxes or appropriate money, and they can't raise an army or send a navy. They can find the truth and act upon the truth. And if what Bill Clinton did is OK, then we have weakened the weakest of the branches of our Government, and that is a high crime under the Constitution. 
   I mentioned Mr. Hamilton. I think it is worth noting again that after the publication of Federalist Paper No. 65, he became the Secretary of the Treasury for President George Washington. He also became involved in an adulterous relationship with a woman named Maria Reynolds. Her husband, upon learning of the affair, demanded of Mr. Hamilton a job at the Treasury Department in exchange for keeping his silence and keeping Mr. Hamilton from personal humiliation and political scandal. Hamilton refused Mr. Reynolds a position on the public payroll, but he agreed to pay him blackmail from his personal funds. News of this arrangement soon found its way to Mr. Hamilton's opponents. When confronted, without being under oath, Hamilton confessed the truth and the whole truth. He knew and respected the boundaries between the public and the private. He wrote them down for our country, and he lived his life within those boundaries, never veering recklessly over the line of impeachability. 
   Consider the painful contrast this creates when measured against the public life of President Clinton. When his scandalous conduct with a subordinate female became entwined with another woman's civil rights action against him, which a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that she had the right to bring, President Clinton set about to cover himself by lying to his staff, to his Cabinet, to the Congress, and to the country. And then, as the evidence so clearly shows, it demonstrates that when brought to court--the weakest of our branches of Government--and placed under oath, he lied again and again and again. 
   Now, in the end, I suspect this place is going to divide pretty much down the middle. I simply sound a warning note to raise your awareness to the fact that, ultimately, history and biographies and accounts yet to be revealed, facts yet to be uncovered, shoes yet to drop, will determine which of us voted right. But we have to decide on the evidence today, and the evidence to me is clear. Soldiers and sailors are discharged and punished for far less than what the President did. And judges are impeached by the House and removed by the Senate for far less than this. Indeed, we have to ask, is the President to be held to a lower standard than those he sends to war or those he appoints to dispense justice? I cannot and I never will agree to such a low standard for the Presidency of the United States. 
   Pollsters tell me how strongly Americans and Oregonians feel about this case and how conflicted their feelings.  Large majorities have concluded that the President is guilty of the felonies charged. Yet, large majorities have also concluded that they do not want him to be removed from office. These numbers remind me that the demands of justice are sometimes hard. I hope, however, that we remember obedience to the law will protect our liberties as nothing else can. 
   You see, political prisoners around the world look to the United States for hope, not because we have a popular President, but because we have laws to protect us from a popular President. If the President of the United States is allowed to break our laws when they prove embarrassing to him or conflict with his political interests, then truly some public trust has been violated, a trust which, as Hamilton says, ``relates chiefly to injuries done immediately to society itself.'' 
   These felonies are impeachable offenses, and the Constitution makes our duty clear, even though it appears harsh and difficult. When the Chief Justice calls my name, ``Senator, how say ye?'' I will say guilty twice, because I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring Wall Street indexes give license to those in high places to act in low and illegal ways. Perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes, and they are utterly inconsistent with any Federal office--ours as well, but especially with the office of the President of the United States. 
   I harbor no illusions that two-thirds of the Senate will vote as I will. Therefore, I hope the President will spend the balance of his office repairing the damage done to his family, our democratic institutions, and our country. I will continue to support his proposals when I believe they are right, and I will oppose them when I believe them to be wrong. 
   Now, the other man in this Chamber that I deeply regard--and because I am so junior I do it from a distance--is Senator ROBERT BYRD. I have appreciated his public struggle with this issue because it has validated my own struggle. When he said this last week on ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' he could have been speaking my words: ``We have to live with the Constitution. We have to live with our consciences.'' And so do I.

    Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation that will enable the city of Sisters, Oregon, to obtain Federal lands for the purpose of constructing a sewage treatment facility. The federal government will benefit directly from this facility, and we have the opportunity to show that we can be good neighbors and help solve local problems. This legislation, and the approach I have taken to provide a funding mechanism to benefit natural resources in the area, has broad support in the local community and the surrounding region. 
   The city of Sisters, Oregon, is facing both environmental and public health problems due to the lack of a sewer system. Currently, all of the homes and businesses inside the city limits must use septic systems. In the summer, in order to accommodate tourists who often recreate in the surrounding federal lands, the city must place approximately sixty portable toilets throughout the town. Deschutes County has  had to develop alternatives to established regulations for septic systems in order to continue use of some properties. 
   There are ongoing concerns about a possible outbreak of infectious diseases from failed and leaking septic systems, and of groundwater contamination. Obviously, this is a situation that cannot continue. 
   Fortunately, the city has risen to the challenge. In 1998, the 775 residents of Sisters voted to issue up to seven million dollars in bonds to construct a sewer system and a wastewater treatment facility to service their municipality. This vote was noteworthy because Sisters is the fourth most economically depressed city in Oregon. Sixty-one percent of the town's residents are considered low to moderate income and the average annual income is $17,188. 
   While the city has put together a financing package of approximately twelve million dollars, this financing package does not include funds for land acquisition. Additional funds to acquire the land for the treatment facility and for the disposition of the treated wastewater are beyond the resident's ability to pay, and pose a huge financial burden. There is a long-standing recognition in federal law, both in the Townsite Act and in the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, that in some instances the transfer of land out of federal ownership to serve community objectives outweighs the goals of maintaining such a tract in federal ownership. 
   This is definitely one of those cases. The city of Sisters is literally surrounded by land managed by the Forest Service. After examining numerous other non-federal sites in or near the city, it was determined that this parcel is large enough, and has the proper soil conditions for disposing of the treated wastewater. 
   I am proud to sponsor legislation that will not only resolve the city's public health threat, but will benefit all the parties involved. My bill calls for the Forest Service to convey land for the facilities at no cost to the city of Sisters. The legislation also stipulates that, at the option of the United States, the land would revert to the Forest Service upon termination of the specified uses. 
   In return, the Forest Service will benefit from the treatment facilities themselves, as well as from improved environmental conditions. The Forest Service currently maintains eleven separate septic systems in the city to serve existing administrative buildings. Since the Forest Service administers seventy-seven acres of land within the city limits, the federal government will benefit from the expected increase in land values directly attributable to the sewer system. 
   In order to capture some of this enhanced value for the benefit of the environment, the Forest Service will also be required to sell no less than six acres of the unimproved administrative lands within the city limits. The bill stipulates that the sale be at fair market value within three years of the enactment of the Act. 
   Most of the revenue from this sale will be used for activities which are directly related to improving the long-term conditions in the watershed of Squaw Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River. The remainder, not to exceed twenty-five percent, may be used for administrative improvements by the Sisters Ranger District. 
   My legislation makes sense. It is a win-win solution that helps both the community of Sisters and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support its early consideration by the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this evening, the President of the United States will speak to the 106th Congress and the country in his annual State of the Union address. As distracted as we appropriately are by the Senate trial of the President, it is nevertheless my hope that the Senate, by the conclusion of the 106th Congress, will have enacted a strong bipartisan agenda reflecting several core principles. First, we must ensure that our public education system provides a high-quality, safe learning environment for all children; second, we must help working families save for the future; and third, we must support policies that increase access to health care services and improve the quality of health care in this nation. 
   With respect to the third principle, I rise today to introduce the ``Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999'', legislation that my former colleague, Senator D'Amato from New York, proposed in the 105th Congress. Last year, this legislation received bipartisan support in the Senate with 35 cosponsors, and 113 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, demonstrating our commitment to improving the health and lives of low-income women in the United States. 
   Mr. President, whether we stand here as fathers, husbands, brothers or sons, mothers, daughters, sisters or grandchildren, we all know someone, a family member or a friend, who has experienced the devastating emotional and physical effects of breast or cervical cancer. In my state of Oregon, more than 28,000 women are living with breast cancer. In 1999, 500 women will die of breast cancer, and 200 women will die of cervical cancer. In an age of advancing technology and improved mammography, this is unacceptable, and unbelievable. We can and must do a better job for the women most at risk in this country. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, gives us an opportunity to expand upon an existing program that was enacted by Congress in 1990. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act created a breast and cervical cancer screening program for low-income and uninsured women, and women of racial and ethnic minority populations throughout the United States. In its eighth year at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) more than 1.3 million screening tests for breast and cervical cancer were provided. The CDC estimates that if such services were available to all women at risk, 15-20 percent of all deaths from breast cancer among women over 40 could have been prevented. 
   Recognizing the success of this screening program, the only question that remains is the availability of treatment. For a low-income or uninsured woman, a diagnosis of breast or cervical cancer means that the fight has just begun. Without adequate coverage for treatment, women in this program are left to find their own coverage or rely upon public hospitals or charity organizations. At Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), physicians are working overtime to treat patients and are facing limited budgets with which to provide services. 
   Mr. President, when a woman is diagnosed with cancer, there should be no question of whether she will be treated; rather, the answer should be ``Absolutely, as soon as possible,'' not ``How do you intend to pay for the treatment?'' 
   The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999 seeks to expand upon the CDC screening program--with an emphasis on continuity of care--by giving states the option of providing Medicaid coverage for breast and cervical cancer treatment services to women who have been diagnosed through the CDC Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening program. With this legislation, a woman who is diagnosed through the CDC screening program would no longer have to worry about where to find treatment; the treatment  would be available to her upon diagnosis, by familiar physicians, in familiar surroundings. 
   Mr. President, this is not an issue of costs; it's an issue of compassion. It is an opportunity to say ``yes, we're here to help'' to the women in our lives who need our help the most. I believe that this bill creates a new beginning not only for families of the women who are and who will be fighting cancer in their lives, but for us as legislators as we face a new millennium. I urge my colleagues to say yes by joining me in this opportunity to set a new standard in the way we meet the health care needs of women in this country.

   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators THURMOND, LEAHY, and JEFFORDS, to introduce the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1999, a bill to provide greater protection to Federal law enforcement officials and their families. Last year, this legislation received strong bipartisan support and passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent on November 9, 1997. I intend to work with my colleagues and the members of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that this bill becomes public law this year. 
   Former Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles once stated that ``Of all the tasks of government, the most basic is to protect its citizens against violence.'' I believe that the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1999 gives us that very opportunity to strengthen those laws that deter violence and provide protection to those whose careers are dedicated to protecting our communities and our families. 
   Under current law, a person who assaults, attempts to assault, or who threatens to kidnap or murder a member of the immediate family of a United States official, a United States judge or a Federal law enforcement official, is subject to a punishment of a fine or imprisonment of up to five years, or both. This legislation seeks to expand these penalties in instances of assault with a weapon and a prior criminal history. In such cases, an individual could face up to 20 years in prison. 
   Importantly, this legislation would also strengthen the penalties for individuals who communicate threats through the mail. Currently, individuals who knowingly use the United States Postal Service to deliver any communication containing any threat are subject to a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to five years. Under this legislation, anyone who communicates a threat could face imprisonment of up to ten years. 
   Emphasizing the need for this legislation, are the experiences of Oregon's own Chief Judge Michael Hogan and his family. They were subjected to frightening, threatening phone calls, letters and messages from an individual who had been convicted of previous crimes in Judge Hogan's courtroom. For months, he and his family lived with the fear that these threats to the lives of his wife and children could become reality, and, equally disturbing, that the individual could be back out on the street again in a matter of a few months, or a few years. 
   Judge Hogan and his family are not alone. In April, 1997, the wife of a Circuit Court judge in Florida was stalked by an individual who had been convicted of similar offense in 1994 and 1995. In this instance, the judge's wife was leaving a shopping mall one afternoon, and as she left the parking lot, realized that she was being followed. In an attempt to lose her pursuer, she took alternative routes, speeding through residential streets. In a desperate attempt, she cut in front of a semitrailer truck, risking a serious accident and possible loss of life, to escape. Even after his third offense, stalking the wife of a Circuit Court judge, her pursuer has been sentence to only six months of probation and $150 in fines and the court costs. 
   Mr. President, these are two examples of vicious acts focused at our Federal law enforcement officials and their families. As a member of the legislative branch, I believe that it is our responsibility to provide adequate protection to all Americans who serve to protect the life and liberty of every citizen in this nation. I encourage my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this important legislation.
