   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to notify my colleagues of my efforts to change the Department of Defense's vaccine acquisition strategy. You see, it is my belief that the BioPort/anthrax debacle provides lawmakers with an excellent case study, one which illustrates that the Department's present policy of relying on the private sector to provide vaccines critical to the protection of our men and women in uniform is fatally flawed and must be changed. There exists a growing consensus that the Department of Defense must shoulder the responsibility and begin to produce biological warfare vaccines for itself. 
   In the early 1990's, in the aftermath of the gulf war, recommendations were presented to senior Defense Department acquisition officials to fulfill the urgent demands of war-fighters to develop vaccines against biological agents. One of the principal recommendations was for the construction of a Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) vaccine production facility. Detailed and thoughtful studies presented many merits to the GOCO approach. Without listing all of its merits, I will point out that the GOCO option would guarantee the country access to a vaccine supply immune from the foibles of a profit-driven pharmaceuticals industry. 
   For reasons that remain a mystery to this day, the Defense Department did not elect to pursue the safer, GOCO option. Rather, the Department chose to contract with a private-sector entity we now know as BioPort, for the vaccine against the biological agent anthrax. 
   Since embarking on this acquisition strategy, events have proceeded as many had feared they would; disastrously. Last summer, the Defense Department awarded the BioPort corporation extraordinary contract relief to a previous contract for the production and vulnerable storage of the anthrax vaccine. The terms of the contract relief reduced the number of doses of vaccine to be produced by one-half, charged the U.S. taxpayer almost three times as much as was originally negotiated, and provided BioPort with an interest-free loan of almost $20 million. BioPort officials have stated that even this may not constitute enough support. I question the fitness of whoever negotiated such a horrendous arrangement on behalf of the American taxpayer. 
   In July, because of BioPort's continuing troubles, the Department was forced to dramatically scale back the scope of Phase One of the immunization program because the rapid rate of vaccinations threatened to consume the last of the Department's stockpile of FDA approved vaccine. Now, only those personnel who are deployed to high-threat regions, such as the Persian Gulf and the Korean Peninsula, will receive vaccinations. As it appears increasingly apparent that neither additional lots of vaccine, nor the new production line in East Lansing, will receive FDA approval anytime soon even this dramatically reduced effort may completely exhaust the Department's supply of vaccine, leaving our troops vulnerable. 
   As the Department is preparing to transition into production of the first of more than a dozen new bio-war vaccines developed under the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program, it was apparent to me that unless we wish to repeat the mistakes of the past, a new acquisition strategy is urgently needed. 
   My colleagues and I on the Senate Armed Service Committee are making efforts to prevent the Defense Department from continuing to pursue a flawed acquisition strategy. Through oversight hearings and legislative provisions within the national defense authorization bill, we are actively providing the Department with some much needed guidance. 
   On April 14, I chaired the second of three committee hearings on the topic of vaccine production. During that hearing, DOD personnel who had advocated the GOCO route in the early Nineties, and were overruled, were given the opportunity to testify. Their testimony is perhaps the most important the committee has received all year on this topic. 
   At a third committee hearing, conducted in July, the Department announced that it had published a solicitation for a second-source of the Anthrax vaccine. As the Department received only cursory inquiries from the pharmaceutical industry during the required thirty day period, this effort appears to have failed. 
   In response to the testimony received by the committee, I drafted section 221 of the Senate's fiscal year 2001 national defense authorization bill. Section 221 requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a reevaluation of the present vaccine acquisition. The report will include an evaluation of the commercial sector to meet DOD's vaccine requirements and a design for a Government-owned, contractor-operated vaccine production facility. 
   Section 221 also notes that a significant body of work regarding this topic was assembled in the early 1990's including Project Badger, which recommended that a GOCO vaccine production facility be constructed at the Pine Bluff Arsenal in my home state of Arkansas.  
   I am pleased to report that the provision was retained in the conference report which the Congress voted to send to the President for his signature. 
   In addition to hearings and legislative provisions, I have begun a dialog with numerous personnel within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. I would be remiss if I did not mention the many productive conversations I have had with the Under Secretary of Defense, Rudy deLeon. Because Secretary deLeon is relatively new to his position and has little ownership over the flawed decisions of the past, he has been very willing to explore alternative acquisition strategies including the solution I favor: construction of a Government-owned, contractor-operated vaccine production facility. As evidence of his commitment to find a solution, vaccine production was the first topic discussed by the Defense Resources Board, which Secretary deLeon chairs, when it met to begin its preparation of the Defense budget submission for fiscal year 2001. 
   I have encouraged Secretary deLeon to include $25 million in the fiscal year 2002 Defense budget submission for R&D, in addition to $400 million in the next version of the Department's Fiscal Years Development Plan, to cover construction costs. To ensure that funding for this project does not come at the expense of other critically needed bio-defense programs, I will soon meet with the Director of OMB. I am hopeful that I can explore with Mr. Lew ways to increase the top-line of the Defense budget to cover the expense of this project. 
   For too long DOD has pursued a flawed acquisition strategy that is a disservice to both the American taxpayer and our men and women in uniform. The Department must be weaned from its dependence on the private sector for the provision of critical biological warfare vaccines.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee I worked hard this year, along with Senator MAX CLELAND, our ranking member, to develop a defense authorization bill that is responsive to the manpower readiness needs of the military services; supports numerous quality of life improvements for our service men and women, their families and the retiree community; and addresses in a comprehensive manner, the health care needs of military retirees. 
   The subcommittee focused on the challenges of recruiting and retention during each of our hearings this year, including the health care hearing. The important legislation contained in this bill will have a positive impact on both recruiting and retention as those who might serve and those who are serving see our commitment to provide the health care benefits promised to those who serve a full military career. I am proud of this bill and I believe the initiatives it contains will result in improved recruiting and retention within the military services. 
   The most vigorously pursued and most prized provisions in our bill will extend TRICARE, the military health care system, to all military retirees without regard to their age. We have eliminated the statutory language that kicked military retirees out of the military medical system when they became eligible for Medicare--just at the time of their lives when these retirees need medical help the most and can afford it the least. 
   We were fortunate during conference to be able to include a permanent funding mechanism for the retiree health care benefit. This funding mechanism will ensure that the important health care benefit will be financed in perpetuity rather than being subject to annual budget exigencies. I am delighted that we have stepped up to fulfill the commitment to those who served our nation over a full career. 
   Of course, health care is not the only issue on which the Personnel Subcommittee focused this year. In the area of military personnel policy, there are a number of recommendations intended to support recruiting, retention and personnel management of the services. 
   Among the most noteworthy, is a provision that would, effective July 1, 2002, require high schools to provide military recruiters the same access to a high school campus, student lists and directory information as is provided to colleges, universities and private sector employers, unless the governing body--school board--decides by majority vote to deny military recruiters access to the high school. 
   When I asked military recruiters what I could do to assist them in meeting the challenges they face recruiting the best young men and women in America, they asked me to help them get access to high schools on the same basis as the colleges and universities. 
   Other initiatives to support recruiting are: a pilot program in which the Army could use motor sports to promote recruiting; implement a program of recruiting in conjunction with vocational schools and community colleges; and a pilot program using contract personnel to supplement active recruiters. 
   This conference report authorizes the expansion of Junior ROTC programs. We have added $13.5 million to expand the JROTC programs. When combined with the funds in the budget request, this add will maximize the services' ability to expand JROTC during fiscal year 20001. I am proud to be able to support these important programs that teach responsibility, leadership, ethics and assist in military recruiting. 
   In military compensation, our major recommendations include a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel and a revision of the Basic Allowance for Housing to permit the Secretary of Defense to pay 100 percent of the average local housing costs and to ensure that housing allowance rates are not reduced while permitting increases as local housing costs dictate. 
   The bill directs the Secretary of Defense to implement the Thrift Savings Plan for active and reserve forces not later than 180 days after enactment. The Thrift Savings Plan will be a very positive recruiting and retention tool assisting the military services in attracting high-qualified personnel and encouraging them to remain until retirement. 
   We included a provision that will dramatically reduce the number of military personnel eligible to receive food stamps. Under this provision, military personnel determined by the Secretary of Defense to be eligible for food stamps would receive an additional special pay sufficient to raise their income level to where they would no longer need food stamps. This special pay will reduce the number of military personnel eligible to receive food stamps from the current DOD estimate of about 5,000 to less than 2,000. No United States military personnel should be forced to use food stamps to feed his or her family. When you combine the food stamp assistance in this bill with the increased pay raises we have directed over the next 5 years, we should practically eliminate the need for any service member to seek assistance from food stamps. 
   We also modified the basic pay tables for non-commissioned officers effective July 1, 20001 to give these deserving leaders a well deserved pay raise. When we adjusted the basic pay tables for all military personnel last year, we discovered that the non-commissioned officers--the key element in our military units--did not receive an equitable pay raise with the officers. We were able to correct that situation this year. 
   Other health care provisions include: the elimination of co-payments for those active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime; an initiative that would provide recipients of the Medal of Honor, and their families, life-time military health care; and a provision that would direct the Secretary of Defense to implement a patient care reporting and management system to reduce medical errors. 
   Mr. President, I am proud of this bill. It will provide the resources and authority the military services need to maximize their readiness and to improve the quality of life for active and retired military personnel and their families. 
   Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hardworking staff members of the Personnel Subcommittee: Charlie Abell, Patti Lewis, and Michele Traficante. I am proud of the work they have done this year, and every man and women who wears our nation's uniform, and every military retiree, is better off today because of their efforts. I thank you. 
   I will vote for the bill and I urge my colleagues to support the bill as well.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and I want to commend my colleagues Senator BROWNBACK and Senator WELLSTONE for their hard work on this legislation. 
   Inge had hoped for a better life when she left her home in Veracruz, Mexico--for legitimate work that would pay her well. She was hoping to earn money in a restaurant or a store and earn money to bring back to her family. 
   She never expected a smuggling debt of $2,200. She never expected to be beaten and raped until she agreed to have sex with 30 men a day. She never expected to be a slave--especially not in the United States--not in Florida. 
   So she got drunk before the men arrived. And when her shift was done, she drank some more. Inge would soak herself in a bathtub filled with hot water--drinking, crying, smoking one cigarette after another--trying any way she could to dull the pain. And she would go to sleep drunk or pass out--until the next day when she had to do it all again. 
   Unfortunately, Inge's case is not unique. It is a horrific story played out every day in countries all over the world. In fact, at least 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the U.S. each year and at least 700,000 women and children are trafficked worldwide. These women and children are forced into the sex industry or forced into harsh labor, often by well organized criminal networks. Traffickers disproportionately target the poor, preying on people in desperate economic situations. They disproportionately target women and girls--all of this for money. 
   Trafficking of women and children is more than a crime--it is an assault on freedom. It is an assault on that founding principle of our nation, ``..... that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.....'' It is an assault on the very dignity of humanity. 
   Yet the protections we have against trafficking are inadequate. That is why the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is so vital. 
   This legislation takes several approaches to address this human rights abuse. It requires expanded reporting by the State Department in its annual human rights report on trafficking, including an assessment and analysis of international trafficking patterns and the steps foreign governments have taken to combat trafficking. It also requires the President to establish an interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking. 
   As a means of deterring trafficking, the President, through the Agency for International Development (AID) must establish initiatives, such as microlending programs to enhance economic opportunities for people who might be deceived by traffickers' promises of lucrative jobs. In addition, this legislation establishes certain minimum standards for combating trafficking and authorizes funding through AID and other sources to assist countries to meet these standards. The President can take other punitive measures against countries that fail to meet these standards. 
   The bill also creates protections and assistance for victims of trafficking, including a new nonimmigrant ``T'' visa. At the same time, punishments for traffickers are increased through asset seizure and greater criminal penalties. 
   All of these provisions are important for strengthening U.S. and foreign law and for combating trafficking. I strongly support them. 
   It is a sad consequence of globalization that crime has become more international in its scope and reach. These seedy sex industries know no boundaries. Traffickers use international borders to trap their victims in a foreign land without passports, without the ability to communicate in the local language, and without hope. 
   But just as trafficking has become global, so must our efforts to fight trafficking. That is why I also support an appropriation in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for $1.35  million earmarked for the Protection Project. This legal research institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies is a comprehensive analysis of the problem of international trafficking of women and children. Led by Laura Lederer, a dozen researchers have been documenting the laws of 190 independent states and 63 dependencies on trafficking, forced prostitution, slavery, debt bondage, extradition, and other relevant issues. When it is complete, the Protection Project will produce a worldwide legal database on trafficking, along with model legislation for strengthening protections and recommendations for policy makers. 
   At the moment, the Protection Project is at a critical phase of research and funding is crucial. For the last few years, the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has been funding the project, along with private donations made to Harvard University, where the project was formerly housed. However, with its transition to Washington and Johns Hopkins, the project has lost private funding and has suffered a nine-month delay in its research. 
   I urge my colleagues on the CJS conference to retain the Senate earmark for this project. The research that the project is producing is critical to understanding, fighting, and ultimately winning the war against international trafficking of women and children.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Captain Joseph E. Baggett, Judge Advocate Generals' Corps, United States Navy, upon his retirement after twenty-nine years of devoted, active duty service in our great nation's Navy. 
   Captain Baggett was born into a military family. The son of a career enlisted Marine, Captain Baggett grew up in the presence of the United States Navy in such diverse locations as Naval Air Station Pensacola, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, and the United Kingdom. Raised with the values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment, and with a family tradition of service, it only made sense that he too would pursue a military career. 
   Captain Baggett graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Tulane University in May 1971, and entered the Navy through Tulane's Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. At that time Captain Baggett raised his hand and took his oath to support and defend the Constitution. In the years since that day he has devoted indeed all of his great energy, talent, and intellect to that task. He has been steadfast in his covenant to this nation and his devotion to those with whom he has served. An illustrious career gives eloquent testimony to his service to our country and to our Navy's legal community. 
   After two tours as a Supply Corps officer, including service onboard USS Rich (DD-820), he entered the Navy's Law Education Program and commenced the study of law at Tulane University. After earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1977, his first tour of duty as a Navy Judge Advocate was at Naval Legal Service Office, Jacksonville, Florida where he served as a formidable military prosecutor tirelessly pursuing justice on behalf of the Navy. 
   Captain Baggett's subsequent tours demonstrate his exceptional talent for international and operational law, his unsurpassed academic credentials, and his desire to serve the Fleet wherever required. In such diverse assignments as Commander Middle East Force onboard USS LaSalle (AGF-3) and USS Coronado (AGF-11), Commander Iceland Defense Force, and Commander Sixth Fleet, serving onboard USS Belknap (CG-26) and USS Iowa (BB-61), Captain Baggett's legal acumen and diplomatic skill repeatedly helped safeguard America's Interests and project America's presence in these often complex areas of the world. Interspersed were tours in Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs, the International Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, and the University of Miami where he earned a Masters of Law degree in Ocean and Coastal Law. 
   With his vast experience with forward-deployed, operational forces, Captain Baggett was able to quickly contribute to a number of vital, National-level issues in subsequent Washington staff assignments, including tours on the Joint Staff's Strategic Plans and Policy Directorate, as Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General for International Law, and as the Defense Department Representative for Ocean Policy, where he was pivotal in developing United States policy on a variety of issues, including issues involving the newly formed Russian Federation. With this comprehensive top-level, international legal perspective, Captain Baggett was the obvious choice to become the Counsel for National Security to the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. 
   Returning to the Fleet as the Senior Staff Judge Advocate for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Captain Baggett was a major influence in high-level decisionmaking related to all aspects of Fleet operations, including environmental coordination and enforcement, rules of engagement, medical law, military justice, and the legal aspects of shore activity management. Captain Baggett's subsequent tour as the Commanding Officer of the Navy's flagship Naval Legal Service Office, in Norfolk, Virginia, demonstrated once again his exceptional leadership skills. Here he mentored the young men and women of the Navy's legal community about the operational imperatives of the Navy, and constantly stressed the paramount need to serve the Fleet. 
   Captain Baggett's wealth of expertise of Navy won him the assignment as Director of the Legislation Division in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity his consistent sound judgment and flawless tact ensured Navy issues were properly conveyed to Senate Committees and Subcommittees. 
   Standing beside this officer throughout his career has been his wife Suzanne, a lady to whom he owes much. She has been his key supporter, devoting her life to her husband, to their two sons, Merritt and Graham, and to the men and women of the Navy family. She has traveled by his side for these many years. Her sacrifice and devotion have served as an example and inspiration for others. 
   With these words before the Senate, I seek to recognize Captain Baggett for his unswerving loyalty to the Navy and the Nation. The Department of the Navy and the American people have been served well by this dedicated naval officer. He will be missed. He has left the Navy better prepared to face the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. We thank him and wish Joe, and his lovely wife Suzanne, fair winds and following seas as they continue forward in what will most assuredly remain lives of service to this Great Nation.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, when I was elected to the House of Representatives back in 1992, I spent 2 years serving in the minority--2 years; in 1993 and 1994--before the Republican victories in the 1994 elections brought about the first Republican majority in the House of Representatives in 40 years. 
   Having now been on the majority side for 5 1/2 years, I am very appreciative of the 2 years I served in the minority. Having had the experience of knowing what it is to be in the minority, to have the agenda set by the majority side, to have the frustration of having vote after vote in which you come up on the short end, is important. I think it helps me in understanding the frustrations the other side has experienced. It also helps me understand now, being in the majority, how hard it is to lead and to govern. 
   I remember in those first 2 years, we were pretty organized in lobbing criticisms and lobbing objections and in presenting our agenda to the American people. We didn't have to worry about legislating. We didn't have to worry about passing anything. We didn't have the votes to do that. But we could do a lot in framing the debate. 
   As we approach the end of this session, it is much easier to criticize in the minority than to govern in the majority. It is easy to say no; it is easy to find even the slightest flaw with a legislative proposal as a rationale for opposing it and blocking it. When you are in the majority, the job of calling up tough bills, debating the very tough issues, taking the very tough votes, that is what governing is about. 
   That is why I have come to the floor this afternoon. I believe an attack unanswered is an attack assumed. 
   Last week, Senator BYRD, for whom I have the greatest admiration, came to the floor and noted that few Members in this body have ever witnessed how the Senate is really supposed to function. I concur with that; I agree entirely. I believe it takes a commitment, a commitment from both sides of the aisle to complete our appropriations obligations in a timely fashion and to ensure the Senate is governing and functioning the way it is supposed to. 
   The fact is, there are a number of Senators who don't seem to want bills signed into law but who want issues. Why? Because it is easier to demagogue an issue than it is to legislate an issue. So who gets left holding the buck? Who gets the blame if legislation, for any reason, does not pass? It is clearly the majority in the Congress who will get blamed if the Government shuts down, as we have already found out. It is those who are in the majority in Congress, clearly, who get the blame. 
   In terms of another Government shutdown, I assure the American people and my colleagues that despite any dispute over issues pending, the Government will not shut down if we have anything to say about it or anything to do about it, if it can be prevented in any way. Social Security checks will be delivered, health care services under Medicare will be funded, and our Nation's veterans will not be left out in the cold. 
   That being said, we still have 11 appropriations bills unsigned and multiple unrelated issues on the table. The education of our kids, prescription drugs, and a Patients' Bill of Rights are all there, still on the table. Since these unrelated issues seem to get tossed around a great deal, let me talk about them plainly for a few minutes and why the minority continues to insist on their passage by holding up our Nation's spending bills. 
   First of all, in the area of education, the other side maintains that we are not having a debate on education in the 106th Congress. I suggest that the other side of the aisle doesn't really want a bill; they want an issue. They say that 
   unless we vote for their few education proposals, which, by the way, would concentrate even more power in the Department of Education, we are not having a debate on education. I think that is not fair, and it is not accurate. 
   During the 106th Congress, we have already voted six times on the class size reduction initiative. Six times we have all been called upon to cast our vote, to go on the record, even though that has been misconstrued and misrepresented to the American people. We have been willing to debate it. We have been willing to cast votes a half dozen times during this Congress alone. 
   As my distinguished colleague from Alabama pointed out, the Department of Education has failed to pass an audit for 3 years in a row. They can't even account for how the money is being spent currently. So it is not unreasonable that many of us have reservations in giving them more power and more authority in the area of school construction and the hiring of 100,000 new teachers. 
   According to the Congressional Daily Monitor, a press conference was held recently with Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Education Secretary Dick Riley, ``demanding that Republicans accept their positions.'' So after voting six times against the class size reduction initiative in the Senate, you would think the attitude would not be their way is the only way. Our side of the aisle has been more than accommodating in providing funding that was reserved for class size reduction. In the fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, Republicans have appropriated the $1.3 billion for class size reduction in the title VI State grant so that schools who want to use the funding for this initiative are able to do so. But schools that have already achieved the goal of class size reduction or have more pressing problems can use the funding for other priority items such as professional development or new textbooks.  
   One would think that is a reasonable, acceptable compromise, a middle ground. But instead, we hear the other side saying: It is our way or no way. We are going to block the appropriations bills unless you do it exactly the way we want it. They contend, again, unless we are voting for class size reduction, we are avoiding the issue of education, even though we have already voted on class size reduction six times in this Congress. 
   The Democrats considered bringing this issue up again in the HELP Committee just last week as an amendment to a bipartisan bill to fully fund the IDEA program. If a debate on education is what the other side really wants, then why did they object to multiple unanimous consent requests on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to keep the debate on education? 
   The ESEA debate was moving along very well on the Senate floor. There was a consensus that only a few amendments should be offered and they should be germane. They should relate to education. But then on the other side of the aisle there were those who objected to those agreements to keep the debate limited to education. I know that I and my colleagues on this side of aisle would be more than willing to return to S. 2, the reauthorization of this critical elementary and secondary education bill, to debate education, if we would simply have that agreement to limit the amendments not to everything under 
   the sun, not to prescription drugs and a Patients' Bill of Rights and minimum wage and everything else, but to limit that debate to education. 
   I am not going to allow Members on the other side of the aisle to have it both ways. You claim that we are not dealing with education and then object to agreements to keep education debates on education bills. I suggest you are looking for an issue, not the passage of legislation. 
   Then on the issue of prescription drugs, my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, last week--I had the opportunity to preside as he made this speech, but I want to quote him--said:  
   On the other side, they make a proposal which sounds good but just will not work. Under Governor Bush's proposal on prescription drugs, he asserts for 4 years we will let the States handle it. There are fewer than 20 States that have any drug benefits. Illinois is one of them, I might say. His home State of Texas has none. But he says let the States handle it for 4 years. Let them work it out. In my home State of Illinois, I am glad we have it, but it certainly is not a system that one would recommend for the country. Our system of helping to pay for prescription drugs for seniors applies to certain illnesses and certain drugs. If you happen to be an unfortunate person without that kind of coverage and protection, you are on your own.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I know Senator MCCAIN is waiting. I appreciate very much his graciousness. 
   The fact is, while Senator DURBIN made that comment, every State does have a Medicaid program that offers prescription drugs today. In addition, they have State employee drug programs already in existence. These programs are separate from the State pharmaceutical assistance programs, of which 25 currently exist. So Senator DURBIN's argument is unfair and unjustified because the money given to the States is not required to be used to only start a new pharmaceutical assistance program. 
   They can be used to expand the existing Medicaid drug programs. So Governor Bush's helping hand drug plan provides greater assistance to low-income seniors, and provides it now, while Vice President GORE's plan requires an 8-year phase-in for those drug benefits. So I suggest that we are getting a lot of demagogy. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is the final issue I wanted to talk about, but I will reserve that for another time. I will say this, and say it clearly: We have an active conference that has been working, and working hard. We had numerous votes on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We had endless amendments in the committee on the Patients' Bill of Rights. To suggest this isn't a deliberative body, as the Democratic leader suggested last week, is unfair. This issue has been debated, and debated thoroughly. It is the Democrats who stifled the debate by walking out on the conference in the spring. We can still have a Patients' Bill of Rights enacted if we have cooperation. There are two sides to every story, and both should be told. Let's not allow two competing agendas to prevent us from getting our work done on the spending bills. They are too important. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his work in this area. I am glad I am cosponsoring the bill. Senator SESSIONS has been one of the tireless leaders in education and in rooting out fraud and abuse in the Department of Education. 
   I also mention, with Senator SESSIONS' help on the Education Committee, we recently sent a bill out that I sponsored on the Senate side, that passed the House of Representatives, which would require a fraud audit of the Department of Education be performed by the General Accounting Office within 6 months. 
   While the Senator is dealing with one specific area of fraud that is very serious, for which this legislation needs to be enacted, there are other examples of fraud, mismanagement, and abuse within the Department of Education that have come to light in recent days. 
   We are hopeful that legislation can move before this session ends. It is ironic that there are those who want the Department of Education to have even more power, such as in the hiring of 100,000 teachers or in school construction projects, when it is clearly a troubled agency that has had a real problem in even having a clean audit of their books. 
   So I commend the Senator heartily and appreciate the work he is doing.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act. While I am profoundly saddened by the fact that such legislation has become necessary, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and commend Senator SANTORUM for his efforts on behalf of those members of our society who don't yet have a voice. 
   While the abortion lobby announced its vociferous opposition to this common-sense legislation and will most-certainly denounce this as an attack on Role v. Wade, this is not such an attack. Rather, it is an effort to end the brutal practice of infanticide, and to reaffirm that a child may not be killed once it has been born. 
   I simply do not know how some of my colleagues will be able to defend the practice of killing children who have been born alive. We are talking about children who have been fully delivered. As I think of the moment I first held my grandson Jackson, I am repelled by the fact that our society has degenerated to the point where some people say that Jackson's life should be able to be taken even after his birth. I truly fear that if this practice is not stopped, some day, when the Peter Singers of the world have their way, the weakest members of our society--babies, the mentally retarded, the terminally ill, and the elderly--will have their lives taken from them against their will after someone has determined that their life is not meaningful. 
   Accordingly, I ask that my colleagues join me and work to enact this legislation. 
   Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. SARBANES, and Mr. BIDEN): 
   S.J. Res. 53. A resolution to commemorate fallen firefighters by lowering the American flag to half-staff on the day of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in Emittsburg, Maryland; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the month of September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Contrary to public perception, cancer is not just an adult disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of childhood deaths, second only to accidents. Cancer strikes 46 children, or two classrooms of children, every school day. In 1975, only 35 percent of children with cancer survived more than five years. Thanks to modern medicine, 70 percent of children diagnosed with cancer survive. Thirty percent, however, do not. 
   Childhood cancer has a unique set of characteristics and problems which researchers are still trying to find answers to. While most adult cancers result from lifestyle factors, such as smoking, diet, occupational, and other exposure to cancer-causing agents, the causes of most childhood cancers, are not yet known. While adult cancers are primarily those of the lung, colon, breast, prostate and pancreas, childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system and tumors of the muscles, kidneys and nervous system. Childhood cancers further differ from adult cancers in that they often have spread to other parts of the body by the time they are diagnosed. 
   Our goal must be to increase funding for research, early detection and treatment, and prevention of childhood cancer. The member institutions of the Children's Oncology Group, C.O.G., provide treatment for up to 90 percent of all children with cancer in North America. The Children's Oncology Group is supported, in part, by federal funds from the U.S. National Cancer Institute and by private funds raised by the National Childhood Cancer Foundation. The National Cancer Institute is slated to receive $3.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2001 for cancer research. Yet childhood cancer is one of many focuses of the NCI's research, and it certainly is not among the top funding priorities. 
   I have worked with my fellow colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to raise awareness about the need for greater focus on childhood cancer, and I am delighted that the Senate will today pass legislation to address a number of pressing children's health issues. In particular, I want to thank Senator FRIST, the author of this legislation, for working with me to include language directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study environmental and other risk factors for childhood cancers and to carry out projects to improve treatment outcomes among children with cancer --such projects shall include expansion of data collection and population surveillance efforts to include childhood cancers nationally, the development of a uniform reporting system nationwide for reporting the diagnosis of childhood cancers, and support for the National Limb Loss Information Center to address the primary and secondary needs of children with cancer to prevent or minimize the disabling nature of these cancers. By authorizing the Secretary to carry out these functions, we will hopefully get the answers we need to ensure that all children live a healthy, cancer-free life. 
   Another devastating disease which affects almost exclusively male children, is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, DMD. At this time, there is no cure for DMD. Little boys with DMD are most often not diagnosed before the age of two or three years. Most boys with DMD walk by themselves later than average, and then in an unusual manner. They may frequently fall, have difficulty rising from the ground, or difficulty going up steps. Calf muscles typically look over developed or excessively large, while other muscles are poorly developed. Use of a wheelchair  may be occasional at age 9, but total dependence is normally established upon reaching the teen years. Most boys affected survive into their twenties, with relatively few surviving beyond 30 years of age. 
   I have heard from the parents and grandparents of a little boy in Arkansas who has DMD. His name is Austin and his family is desperately hoping for a cure so they don't have to watch their son and grandson lose his ability to walk. While we are far from finding a cure for DMD, I am hopeful that language that Senator FRIST has graciously worked with me to include in the children's health bill will help Austin and the thousands of other young boys suffering from DMD. Specifically, the Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and increase coordination of the activities by the National Institutes of Health with respect to research on muscular dystrophies, including DMD. 
   In conclusion, we are about to pass incredibly important legislation to address a myriad of children's health issues, including childhood cancer and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Efforts to improve the quality and length of life for millions of children are valuable beyond measure, and I encourage all of my colleagues to work together with me to raise awareness about these devastating diseases and the need to find treatments and cures for the children they affect.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on the legislation pending before the Senate on the permanent normal trade relations status for China. As announced, we will be having the final vote on this legislation on Tuesday. We had an extended debate on this issue. I think it has been a healthy debate and a good debate for the American people. As I announced earlier, we have disposed of all amendments. We have had amendments on almost every conceivable subject, everything from the environment to labor issues in China, to abortion issues. Of course, none of those amendments, I think, has received more than 33, 34 votes. It is clear this legislation is going to pass and is going to pass overwhelmingly. 
   Historically, every time there was a vote in the House of Representatives, when I served in the House, and on the occasions in which there were sense of the Senates, I have voted against granting annual most-favored-nation status to China, that which we now call normal trade relations. I want to explain my thinking on this issue. 
   On May 24, 2000, as the House of Representatives approved permanent normal trade relations status for China, Pastor Wang Li Gong celebrated his 34th birthday by sewing footballs in a forced labor camp in Tianjing. His hands are injured, and they bleed every day because of the work. When Pastor Wang is not trying to fulfill high production quotas, he is allowed only a few hours of sleep and many more hours of torture. He has been under administrative detention since last November for the crime of organizing a Christian gathering in his home. 
   But Pastor Wang is not the only target of persecution. In its annual report on human rights, our State Department documents just about every violation of international norms in China. Religious persecution to crackdowns on political dissent, to torture, to forced labor, to trafficking of women and children--it is all happening in China. It is not getting better. At least, if you view it in terms of the last few years, if you go back to the Cultural Revolution, you can find there have been fits and starts of improvement, but as you look at the State Department's reports over the last few years, the situation is not improving. 
   In the area of religious persecution, the State Department, in its Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, notes:  
   The Government's respect for religious freedom deteriorated markedly, especially for the Falun Gong and Tibetan Buddhists, and the Government's repression and abuses continue during the first 6 months of 2000.  
   That is, of course, as far as the report extends, is the first 6 months of this year. Its conclusion is:  
   Respect for religious freedom deteriorated markedly.  
   At the very time the House of Representatives was voting for PNTR, and during the process by which that debate has gone on in the Senate, the conclusion of our own Government is that ``religious freedom has deteriorated markedly.'' 
   The report goes on to note that:  
   The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a decision to ban ``cults,'' including the Falun Gong and other religious groups.  
   At the time the Chinese People's Congress adopted that law banning religious cults, I expressed concern to my colleagues in the Senate that this new law would be very broadly applied. It is bad enough to give a government the power to define what is a cult and what is not, what is acceptable religious belief and what is not acceptable religious belief, but this crackdown was unprecedented. There had been serious crackdowns in the past. At that time, I introduced a resolution in this Senate expressing my concern and the concern of the Congress that this crackdown, this harsh crackdown on the Falun Gong, would only be a beginning. I predicted the so-called cult law would be widely applied. 
   My worst fears have come true. The law has been applied extremely broadly to other groups, including Christians. On August 23, 2000, Chinese police arrested 130 Christians in Henan Province. These Christians are from the Fangcheng church, a popular house church movement. The Chinese Government considers them a cult, not because of what they believe, not because of their teachings, but because they are not registered with the State; they are not under the control of the Chinese Government. Their leaders, arrested a year ago, are suffering for their faith in labor camps, a penalty under the so-called anti-cult law. 
   The proponents of PNTR have argued that, No. 1, increased trade will result not only in an increased export of American products to China but also in the export of American values, including human rights and individual freedom. 
   No. 2, they have asserted that the failure to grant PNTR would result in isolating China and driving the Chinese regime to even more repressive tactics. 
   No. 3, they have insisted that entry into the WTO will ensure that Chinese misbehavior can be addressed and that Chinese violations would be dealt with under the World Trade Organization. 
   No. 4, they have further asserted that the creation of a human rights monitoring commission in this legislation will guarantee the ongoing monitoring of human rights conditions in China. 
   In my opinion, these arguments have merit. Also, the advocates of PNTR are, in my opinion, sincere. I would never question their motivations. I would never question that, in fact, they believe in all sincerity that this is a better route or a real route to improving human rights conditions in China. 
   I very much want to vote for permanent normal trade relations for China. It will have great economic benefits in the United States; potentially it does. It certainly has great economic benefits to the State of Arkansas. Arkansas is the No. 1 rice-producing State in the Nation. We are looking for markets. We want to sell that rice, whether it is in China, whether it is in Cuba, or wherever it is in the world. 
   Some have analyzed the cotton industry will be the biggest beneficiary under PNTR. Arkansas is in the top tier of States in the production of cotton. 
   Arkansas is the leading State in poultry production. When I visited China and went to the two Wal-Marts that are in China today--a Sam's store and a Wal-Mart--I was surprised to see the No. 1 product being sold is chicken feet. It is a delicacy, a speciality in China. We in Arkansas grow poultry. We want to make every use of it, and China is a good market for it. We have major retailers in Arkansas, and the prospects of new markets emerging in China are very appealing to retailers. 
   I very much wanted to vote for this bill. It is in many ways in the economic interest of Arkansas to see this go forward and, in fact, it is going to pass. 
   In addition, the human rights community, while generally opposing PNTR, is not of one voice. It is not of a monolithic opinion. Not everybody in the human rights community believes that PNTR should go down. Some, in fact, accept these arguments as being meritorious, that increased trade will bring about liberalization in China, greater democratization, and eventually improvement in human rights. Good people can and do disagree. That is the case when it comes to whether or not China should receive from us permanent normal trade relations. 
   I hope and pray the arguments that have been made by the PNTR proponents are all realized, that they are right on every point. I hope when they express their conviction that the best way to improve human rights in China is to see increased contact with the outside world, to see increased trade, to be exposed to new ideas, to see an expansion of the Internet, that all of those arguments are realized and realized soon, not in the long term but in the short term. 
   We may eventually see political liberalization in China. I think we will in the long term. But we should not assume PNTR or the WTO will be the main driver of this change. While we hope for change in the long run, I do not believe we can remain silent about Chinese abuses in the shortrun. We must not ignore 
   the lessons of history.  
   I listened with great interest to much of the debate on the floor over the last 2 weeks, particularly the distinguished Senator from New York, in whom I have the greatest admiration and respect for his scholarship and his mind, as he went through some of the historic lessons of China and talked of improvements in China's human rights record. In one sense, that is certainly true. It is better now than it was during the Cultural Revolution, but let's not be selective in our recounting of recent Chinese history. 
   During the winter months of 1978 and 1979, thousands of people in Beijing posted their written complaints and protests about the ills of China on a stretch of blank wall on Chang'an Avenue. This voice of protest, which became known as the democracy wall movement, was muzzled as the Chinese Government imprisoned its leaders such as Wei Jingsheng. 
   That same year of the crackdown on the democracy wall movement, the U.S. established diplomatic relations with China and signed a bilateral trade agreement. Deng Xiaoping introduced a series of economic and legal reforms, and international protests against repression in China were drowned out by the promise of free-market initiatives. Twenty-one years since the United States signed a bilateral trade agreement with China, we have only seen increasing political repression and religious persecution. 
   Harvard professor Dani Rodrik expressed this sentiment when he said:  
   I would not assume, as many advocates of normalized trade relations with China have done, that expanded trade will necessarily produce greater democracy. ..... If the Chinese leadership is truly interested in democratization, they do not need the World Trade Organization to help them achieve it. ..... There are no human rights prerequisites for WTO membership. Even if the Chinese Government were to become more repressive, existing WTO rules would not allow the U.S. and other countries to withdraw trade privileges. The pressure would have to be applied outside the WTO context.  
   What he is saying is if we cede the main tool we have for applying this pressure, which has been the annual MFN debate, by passing the PNTR package, we are left with a toothless Levin-Bereuter commission. This commission proposal, which is included in the PNTR package we will be voting on, has been sold as a Helsinki Commission for China. As a Helsinki Commissioner, I know this proposed commission lacks a cornerstone, the Helsinki Final Act, which commits OSCE member nations to certain human rights standards. Without that foundation, we will simply be duplicating the efforts of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and we will find out from this commission what we already know: Human rights in China are and at least for the foreseeable future will remain deplorable. 
   It would be wrong for me not to recognize the economic arguments for granting PNTR to China, and I have tried to acknowledge that. I believe business and agriculture can determine their best interests, but here, too, we should recognize that inflated expectations could quickly be punctured by an unruly China. For all the anticipation and excitement in the business community over PNTR, we will face a recalcitrant trading partner in China at the WTO. We will see the dispute settlement system and the very functioning of the WTO put to a great test. 
   In the final analysis, though I know PNTR is going to pass and though I realize there are going to be some very significant economic benefits to our country, and while I hope the best face and the great expectations that have been propounded for this legislation will be realized, I have concluded that I must vote no on this because the words in the most recent State Department report on China keep echoing in my ears: ``The Government's respect for religious freedom deteriorated markedly.'' It is the most recent report--and I cannot escape the judgment that it has not gotten better--that the conditions in China have deteriorated markedly. 
   In ancient Rome, the Roman Government did not really care what Roman citizens believed. They did not care what their religious faith was or necessarily if they even had a religious faith. What they did care about was the supremacy of the Roman Government over its people and over all religions. Effectively, they said to their citizens: You can believe anything you want so long as you will affirm that Caesar is lord. It was not the beliefs of Christians that got them in trouble in the Roman persecutions; it was the fact they would not make that affirmation that the Roman Government was supreme and that Caesar was lord. 
   It seems to me that is a clear analogy to the conditions in China today. There is religious freedom in China only insofar as every religious group in China will affirm that the Chinese Government is ultimately supreme. To the extent that any religious group defies that ultimate standard, they then face intense persecution. 
   So for those reasons I will cast a ``no'' vote. I suspect that there will be 20 to 25 Members who will cast that same vote. I hope for the best outcome for PNTR, but for my own conscience I will cast a ``no'' vote next week. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important and necessary legislation and commend my friends, Senator SESSIONS and the late Senator Coverdell, for all of their hard work and leadership they have shown in this matter. 
   To justify the need for this legislation, I point to the situation that the Arkansas State Crime Lab is experiencing as a direct result of the exponential increase in the production, use, and distribution of methamphetamine. Simply put, with 16,000 test requests this year--resulting in a backlog of over 6,000 cases--the Arkansas State Crime Lab is at the breaking point. Accordingly, it now takes five to six months from the receipt of a sample to complete the analysis necessary for prosecution. I commend and thank Senator GREGG for his assistance in the procurement of funding to hire three additional chemists. However, I recognize that Arkansas is not alone in its great need and that Congress must authorize more federal funding to fight the ever-increasing proliferation in the production, use, and distribution of illicit substances in our nation. 
   The Act would provide an additional $768 million over the next six years in the form of block grants by the Attorney General to states to improve the quality, timeliness, and credibility of forensic science services to the law enforcement community. It would do this by allowing states the flexibility to use these monies for facilities, personnel, computerization, equipment, supplies, accreditation and certification, education, and training. The Act's merit is further made manifest by the fact that it is supported by such groups as the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, the National Association of Medical Examiners, the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, the Southern Association of Forensic Sciences, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Counties, and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Thus, I ask my colleagues to join me in helping Senator SESSIONS in his efforts to enact that this important legislation.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak for 5 minutes as if in Morning Business. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution which designates September 7th of each year as ``National Safe TV for All-Ages Day.'' On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth, a young 21-year-old inventor in San Francisco, transmitted the first all-electronic television picture. By the time he died in 1971, Philo Farnsworth's invention had become one of the greatest innovations of the 20th Century. 
   Today, the modern television plays a central role in entertaining untold millions world-wide, and no where has it made more of an impact on society than in the United States. Television has become a fixture in almost every home. Americans view an average of 17 hours of television per week. This medium enjoys unprecedented access into the American home. Sadly, this access to the family has been abused as scenes of overtly violent and sexual acts on television have been on the rise for decades. As a result, there is a general consensus among researchers and the American public that violence on television correlates to violent and aggressive behavior in children and teenagers. 
   Given the continued rise of this negative behavior in American society--especially among young people--parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, sociologists, and politicians are looking for ways to fight back. That is why I have publicly encouraged television executives and movie makers to take responsibility for the impact their programming and movies are having on viewers, regardless of age. While the entertainment industry continues to market violence, families must decide how to protect against a barrage of negative images. 
   My resolution encourages families and viewers of all-ages to turn off the overtly violent and sexual programming and turn to safe, family oriented programming which reinforces positive attitudes and sound cultural values in our homes, schools, and communities. Television programming which portrays responsible conflict resolution and positive, meaningful role models has a profound impact on the values that influence American culture. 
   It is my hope that parents take matters into their own hands by making September 7th the day families use the remote control to send a message to the television executives that violent programming is not wanted in our homes. It is my sincere hope that more Americans consider what kind of cumulative affect negative television programming has on families. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure and support safe TV for all ages. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Just Opportunities in Bidding (JOB) Act which is  necessary to ensure that companies who seek to do business with our government are treated fairly. The JOB Act would prohibit the implementation of proposed regulations which would dramatically amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
   I have many concerns about these proposed regulations, but I am deeply troubled by the discrimination which it will inevitably foster when implemented. The regulations will de facto amend many of our nation's laws and give government contracting officers, who are not trained in the interpretation of these laws, unfettered discretion to deny contracts to companies based on any alleged violation of any labor and employment, environmental, antitrust, tax, or consumer protection laws over the three years immediately preceding the contract. This is a dramatic change from the current requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation which requires that violations must be substantial to trigger denial of contract eligibility and does not extend to unrelated, past violations. 
   The proposed regulations would also allow for the denial of contracts on the basis of a mere complaint issued by a federal agency, which often are based solely upon information provided by outside, interested parties. Moreover, the proposal's terminology is vague and extremely subjective--placing tremendous and unprecedented discretion in the hands of federal contracting officers. That is discretion that they do not need nor qualified to exercise. Terms such as ``legal compliance'' by bidding parties are well-intentioned, I am sure, however, I view this as a trial lawyer's greatest wish come true. What does ``legal compliance'' mean? Does it mean that employers must ensure that they are 100 percent in compliance with all of the pertinent laws? Can even the most prudent employers guarantee that they and their worksites are 100 percent in compliance with all federal tax, labor, environmental, and anti-trust statutes and regulations? That's certainly a question which many creative lawyers will undoubtedly rush to answer in courthouses across our nation. 
   This proposal is in direct contradiction to existing policy which is to fulfill governmental needs for goods and services at a fair and reasonable price from contractors who are technically qualified and able to perform the contract. Our current policy is based upon a good balance between our desire to get the best value for our constituents' taxdollars while being fair to all qualified companies who want to have the opportunity to provide their goods and services to the government. The proposed regulations will result in the unjustified exclusion of many of these companies from the bidding process and will result in less competition, reduced job opportunities for many employees--especially small businesses--and less value for our constituents' taxdollars. 
   As elected representatives of our constituents, we cannot condone this and as a legislative body we must refuse to allow a continuation of this Administration's legislation by regulation. The JOB Act would require the GAO to thoroughly examine this issue and report back to Congress with its findings. To me, this is a sound and reasonable approach rather than a political one. If you agree that the proposed regulations--and the millions of American workers, employers, and taxpayers that they will profoundly affect--deserve more thorough consideration, join me in my effort to enact the JOB Act.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator FEINGOLD, to introduce the Equal Access to Justice, EAJA, Reform Amendments of 2000. I do so because I firmly believe that small business owners and individuals who prevail in court against the federal government should be automatically reimbursed for their legal expenses-- fulfilling the true intent of EAJA when passed in 1980. 
   EAJA's initial premise was to reduce the vast disparity in resources and expertise which exists between small business owners or individuals and federal agencies and to encourage the government to ensure that the claims it pursues are worthy of its efforts. Twenty years ago, former Senator Gaylord Nelson, the author of the original, bipartisan EAJA bill, clearly explained EAJA's intent when he stated, ``All I can say is the taxpayer is injured, and if the taxpayer was correct, and that is the finding, then we ought to make the taxpayer whole.'' I commend former Senator Nelson. His steadfast commitment to our nation's businesses as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee is worthy of admiration. As  a result of a political compromise, however, the final version of EAJA does not provide for an automatic award of attorneys' fees. Rather, it provides for an award of attorneys' fees only when an agency or a court determines that the government's position was not ``substantially justified'' or that ``special circumstances'' exist which would make an award unjust. 
   Agencies and courts have strayed far from the original intent of EAJA by repeatedly using these provisions to avoid awarding attorneys' fees to small businesses and individuals who have successfully defended themselves. The bill that Senator FEINGOLD and I are introducing today, the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000, would amend EAJA to provide that a small business owner or individual prevailing against the government will be automatically entitled to recover their attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in their defense. 
   Unfortunately, EAJA is not making the taxpayers of this nation whole after they defend themselves against government action. Thus, I ask that my colleagues join Senator FEINGOLD and myself in our effort to make these American taxpayers whole by cosponsoring and supporting the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in rising to offer my sympathies and condolences to Nancy and the Coverdell family. 
   Today, we all grieve PAUL's passing, but we also celebrate his life. What a life it was; a life of achievement, a life of incredible service and accomplishment. 
   I did not know PAUL COVERDELL until I came to the Senate in 1996. I followed his career, as many Americans did. I followed with interest and admiration his campaign for the Senate and his election to the Senate from Georgia. It was only when I arrived at this institution that I got to know PAUL COVERDELL, the man. 
   Much has already been said this morning and yesterday and has been said well. He was ubiquitous. It seemed PAUL was everywhere. The breadth and number of issues he was involved in takes your breath away. It was amazing how much he knew and how much he was willing to invest his time and energy. He was incredibly hard working and willing to do what others didn't want to do, didn't have time to do. He made time and he was willing to take on the nonglamorous jobs. He didn't seek glory and he didn't seek adulation. He gave credit away freely because he didn't seek it for himself. He was a consensus builder; he was a doer. If you wanted it accomplished, you gave the task to PAUL COVERDELL. 
   One quality which I as a junior Member of the Senate especially appreciated and admired was his deep respect for his fellow man and his deep respect for his colleagues, regardless of their rank or status. I served on the education task force with PAUL. We had a lot of strategy meetings. We had meetings in Senator LOTT's office in which we would talk over the education issue and discuss not only how we would communicate our message but how we would pass legislation. There were a lot of senior Members on the task force. They were always quick and bold to speak out and give their opinion. What I noticed about PAUL COVERDELL was that he was always observing who had spoken and who hadn't, who had expressed their opinion and who hadn't. At every meeting he said: TIM, you haven't said anything yet. What are your thoughts? Do you have an opinion? 
   Or he would see SUSAN COLLINS and say: SUSAN, how do you feel about this issue? 
   He always included junior Members. He included everyone because he respected not only their opinion, but he respected them as human beings. 
   He epitomized what service is all about. I think that PAUL COVERDELL provides the lasting role model of what a U.S. Senator should be, what a public servant should be. 
   Many of my colleagues have struggled to find words and to find scripture and verses to express what they felt about PAUL COVERDELL. I have found a verse that I think applies most appropriately to PAUL. It is Mark 10:31. Jesus said:  
   But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.  
   PAUL was a leader. But he was a leader among us because he was servant of all of us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I rise in opposition to the Democratic alternative and in strong support of H.R. 8. I listened with interest to the debate taking place earlier this morning on this bill. I have the utmost respect and admiration for Senator MOYNIHAN. However, I wrote down one phrase he used. He said: We should stay with a tax that has served us well. 
   I think that is the fundamental difference between the parties and those who differ on this issue. I don't believe the death tax has served our country well. I don't believe it has served the American dream well. I don't believe it serves the American people well. 
   The death tax basically says to the American people: Be successful but don't be too successful. The death tax says: Work hard but don't work too hard and make too much. The death tax says: Save your money but don't save too much. The death tax puts a ceiling on what the American dream can be. I think that is fundamentally wrong, and therein is the basic difference between the two philosophies, the two parties, the two approaches on the death tax. 
   There are those who say you can make too much and at that point the Government is going to step in and we are going to take what we think you have excessively made and earned and saved and invested, and we are going to redistribute that; we know better how to use that estate than your heirs, your family, your loved ones. 
   We believe that is wrong. The whole approach behind the death tax is fundamentally wrong and un-American. The amendments that are being offered, including the Democratic alternative basically say, let's tweak it a little bit; let's finesse the death tax a little bit; let's expand the exemption a little bit, let's tinker with it. 
   But that is not enough. This is a tax that is past its time --if it was ever justified, and it was not. It should be removed, eliminated, and that is why this alternative is insufficient.  
   It is no accident that the American Farm Bureau endorses H.R. 8. American farmers already have enough challenges growing crops, bringing them to market, making a living. Yet still our farmers see their land whittled away generation by generation, and not just by floods or storms or infestation but by the Federal Government and its tax policies. Death taxes can destroy family-owned farms and ranches when, after taxes, farmers do not have enough to keep their land, their buildings, or their equipment. 
   I want you to listen to the words of H. Jay Platt of the Arizona Farm Bureau Federation as he testified before the House Small Business Committee. This is what he said:  
   My grandfather started our ranch around the turn of the century with a couple of cows on a few acres of grazing land. For 100 years my family has worked hard to build our operation into a modern ranch that is the core of the financial base for three families. We paid taxes on everything we've earned and we don't understand why we have to pay again when we die. We can't comprehend why the government wants to penalize us for being successful by taking our ranch at death. We believe that our family, our community and the environment will all be better off if our ranch continues.  
   That is a powerful statement. That is farmers. But small businesses are in a similar trap. According to the NFIB, more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to even the second generation, and more than 87 percent of these small family-owned businesses never make it to the third generation. One in three small business families today have to sell their businesses outright or liquidate business assets just to pay the death tax. 
   The American dream can become an American nightmare because of the death tax. Democrats talk about the estate tax bill we are considering, the elimination bill, as being a tax break for the richest people in America. Let me tell you about some of the people who are really affected by the death tax. 
   One of my own staffer's husband and his siblings just 
   experienced the deaths of both parents. Their mother died only 2 weeks ago. In addition to the intense emotion and grieving this family is currently going through, they are now faced with selling family farmland and other assets in order to pay estate inheritance taxes in an attempt to save the family home and the family business. 
   This is farmland that their parents and they have tilled and planted, farmland which paid for all four of the children's college education. Their small lumber and hardware store is located in a town of 1,400 people and has been in existence nearly 50 years. Not only will they have to pay estate taxes totaling almost half of the estate; they will have to pay capital gains taxes on the assets they sell in order to pay for the death tax. Talk about adding insult to injury. That surely does. 
   This is not about the wealthiest Americans. This is about a family who has put countless hours into rebuilding their family lumber business which burned to the ground a decade ago. This is about all 1,400 people who live in that small town, who are served by that family business, as well as the employees whose livelihoods depend upon that business. This is about handing down a legacy to their children who want to maintain the business which has served this rural community for five decades. 
   The Federal estate tax, the death tax, punishes families for the deaths of their loved ones. The Federal estate tax takes its toll irrespective of the fact that any sale of inherited assets is subject to capital gains taxes. It is clear and, to me, it is simple: This is double taxation. It runs contrary to this country's work ethic and to family values. 
   I have a stack of letters that have come in in the last month from people in the State of Arkansas who are not wealthy Americans but who see the deadly impact of the death tax. Let me share with you one letter from Haskell Dickinson:

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I request the Chair to notify me when I have 1 minute remaining of my 5 minutes. 
   This BINGAMAN amendment is a diversion from an important debate on the elimination of the death tax. If you can't change people's minds, sometimes you want to change the subject. That is what the Democrats seek to do by this list of amendments. 
   We had an education debate. We spent 8 days on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am ready to return to that. I think we should. The majority leader has offered the opportunity to return to the ESEA debate just as we did on DOD authorization. Let's do it next week. But let's limit it to germane amendments. 
   The reason we are not on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is because the Democrat side offered amendment after amendment that had nothing to do with education. I suggest if you want an education debate, let's do it on ESEA. Let's not do it on the elimination of the death tax. 
   The death tax is growing increasingly unpopular with the American people. It is for obvious reasons. They realize it is fundamentally wrong. They know double taxation when they see it. They know if they paid income tax, if they paid capital gains tax, and if they paid sales tax, that it is absolutely, fundamentally, inherently wrong to make death another taxable event. 
   That is what we are wanting to do with this legislation, eliminate it--not refine it, not tinker with it, not raise the cap but eliminate the death tax once and for all because it is wrong. 
   The American people are increasingly opposed to the death tax because they realize that it penalizes success; that the American way is to reward success. The death tax penalizes hard work. It penalizes savings, and it penalizes investment. 
   Senator BINGAMAN, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who I have the greatest respect for, says: Let's not eliminate it; let's just tinker with it, and take the savings--the so-called savings--and put it into education. 
   We have increased spending on education. 
   But it would seem to me the logic is rather ironic; by putting it on the elimination of the death tax and saying we want children to be better educated because we want them to use that better education so they can be successful, but don't be too successful because, if you are, we are going to punish you when you die for the success you have achieved. 
   The Bingaman amendment says to young Americans that it is OK to dream but don't dream too big because when you die we will punish you. 
   The turn of the century was a period appropriately dubbed ``the age of innocence.'' Millions of immigrants came to this country. They came so fast that we couldn't build ships enough to bring them into this country. They came with a dream. Some stayed in New York, others went to Detroit, Pittsburgh, and other industrial cities. But they came with one goal in mind: to succeed with no limits, no caps, no punishing economic thresholds, and, most importantly, no charade. 
   That is why they came here. They knew that life was too short and their families too precious to continue living under oppressive governments. 
   I ask my colleagues: Do you think we are fostering the same dream that existed 100 years ago by keeping the status quo? 
   My esteemed colleague from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN, said this morning that it is a tax that has served us well. That is the basis of this debate. If you believe that the death tax has served this country well, then you certainly don't want to eliminate it. If you believe, as I believe, as Senator GRAMM believes, and as I believe most Americans believe, that it is fundamentally un-American, then you want to eliminate it. 
   Senator GRAMM is absolutely right. It is a cancer. It is the cancer that you don't just trim back. It is a cancer that must be removed from the body politic and from our public policy.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. It seems ironic to me when we had the education bill on the floor of the Senate for 8 days, the amendments offered by the other side of the aisle were on health care and campaign finance reform. They had nothing to do with education. 
   Now we have elimination of the estate tax bill on the floor of the Senate and they want to talk about education. The majority leader has done everything in his power to give an opportunity for legitimate education debate and to pass reauthorizing of ESEA. This is a diversion, and all the protests will not change that fact. 
   The death tax has been repealed in 20 States since 1980. I say to Senator KENNEDY, I believe the Senate ought to do what his home State of Massachusetts did; we ought to abolish it. We ought to eliminate it as Oregon, as Vermont, as Canada, as Israel, as Australia. We should abolish it--not tinker with it, not play with it, not raise the cap. We need to eliminate it. 
   Senator KENNEDY called it the millionaire tax loophole. That is why the Black Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this bill, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Association, and the Pan American Chamber of Commerce have endorsed it. We need to abolish the death tax.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I compliment and commend the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. NICKLES, for the  hard work he has done and the months of labor he has put into this conference. Anybody who has followed the reports of what has come out of this conference cannot honestly say it has been glacial movement. Enormous progress has been made. Concessions have been made on the part of the House conferees as well as the Senate conferees. 
   This is no way to legislate and no way to provide patient protections the way Senator KENNEDY and Senator DORGAN have done in parceling out a little piece here and there. Tonight we are going to do scope. That is not the way to legislate. This is truly the triumph of politics over policy. 
   I was writing as various Senators on the Democratic side made speeches. They spoke of a national standard, of universal coverage, and of a national health system. To this Senator's mind, they could be synonymous with a national health care system. We had that debate. We had it in 1993. It was called ``Clinton care.'' Senator GRAMM piled it up over here, and it was about 2 feet tall. 
   The American people made a judgment on ``Clinton care.'' We do not want a national health care system, nor is that in the best interest of Americans. 
   The real debate tonight centers around not whether we want protections for all Americans or whether we believe we are the only ones who can provide that protection or whether the States have a legitimate role in providing protections for their citizens. How many States have patient protection laws? Forty-three States have already enacted patient protection laws. 
   Do we not believe they have the best interests of their 
    citizens in mind? What we are doing in our legislation is providing protection where States cannot do it where Federal jurisdiction is legitimate. Under ERISA and self-funded plans, we do that, as we should. 
   I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY. In his State, in 1996, they had a ban on gag clauses. They passed a grievance procedure. They, in fact, have 26 State mandates. Does the Senator not believe they care about their citizens? 
   I heard my colleague and good friend from Florida speak of the need for a national system. The State of Florida passed a comprehensive bill of rights in 1997, emergency room services in 1996. They have 44 State mandates. Do they not care? They care as much as we care, and they know their State better than we do. 
   I heard my colleague from the State of Rhode Island speak about the need for a national health care system. Rhode Island passed a comprehensive consumer rights bill in 1996. They have passed 27 mandates in Rhode Island. I can go on and on. Forty-three States already have a bill of rights. It is not our place to usurp their authority. It is not our place to take over insurance that has traditionally and historically been regulated at the State level. It is wrong for us to do that. 
   To my colleagues I say we have a conference in progress. It is progress. It is working hard. It is making progress. That is the way we should provide patient protections, not through an amendment on an appropriations bill. 
   I thank my colleague, Senator NICKLES, for the hard work he has done and all the conferees and look forward to when we will have a meaningful patients' rights bill passed into law. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation requiring an audit of accounts at the U.S. Department of Education that are susceptible to waste, fraud, and abuse. It is unfortunate that Congress has to be dealing with this issue, but unfortunately, it is all too necessary. 
   As Members of the Senate have been debating education this year, we have stressed the need for accountability of federal funds. Before we stress accountability at the local level, though, we must ensure that accountability is also occurring at the federal level. It we are going to increase the budget for the Department of Education, as the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education Appropriations bill does, we have the responsibility to determine whether the Department is properly accounting for the funding that they already have.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a few things that my colleague from Minnesota said. 
   First of all, I mention that my father spent more than 20 years in the poultry plants of Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi doing exactly the kind of repetitive motion work that the Senator from Minnesota described. I believe, if my father were on the floor of the Senate today, that he would as vehemently and strongly and vigorously oppose this OSHA draconian power move as much as I am going to oppose it. 
   Senator WELLSTONE emphasized that it is not yet a final rule and therefore it is premature for us to act. I don't think so. I hardly think it would be prudent on our part to wait until after they enacted the rule, and then come back and try to change it when employers would have already faced the rule that was in place. It is anticipated, as I understand it, that the rule will be finally promulgated by the end of this year. If we are going to act, we must act now. 
   Again, Senator WELLSTONE said they are not done yet. This is the 600 pages that they are to right now. I am concerned if we wait much longer that it may be 900 pages before the end of the year. This is the time for us to act. 
   One of the things that I appreciate about my distinguished colleague from Minnesota is that he believes what he is saying, and he doesn't mince words about it. 
   He made it very clear that from his viewpoint this is class warfare. It is those mean, uncaring employers; it is those managers; it is those businesspeople--they just don't care about their employees. Then we have anecdote after anecdote. 
   That assumption is wrong. I think OSHA will state that does not describe 99.9 percent of the employers in this country. They do care. They have every incentive in the world in caring for those who work for them, ensuring there is a healthy and safe workplace. 
   Beyond that, we ought to talk about the small business man or woman who are struggling to meet every other regulatory burden that this Government has placed upon them and meet all of the tax burdens we placed upon them, trying to keep their heads above water, trying to make ends meet, trying to provide jobs for their employees, and trying to make a contribution to their community. And a rule such as this will have some of the most dramatic effects upon business and upon the economy of any rule ever promulgated by any agency. What about them? 
   As Senator ENZI pointed out, what about the senior citizen on Medicare or those senior citizens on Medicaid or those poor people who are on Medicaid and dependent upon them? What will happen to their health care when we tell health care providers they have to meet the new requirement, they have to comply with the new rule? 
   There is no increase in their budget. There is no change in the reimbursement formulas. You will get what you got before, but now you will have to meet all of the additional burdens. 
   I suggest those who are going to be hurt the most by this rule are those who are the most vulnerable in our society. 
   The Enzi amendment would simply prevent OSHA from finalizing an ergonomics program in fiscal year 2001. That is all it does. It gives the National Academy of Sciences the time it deserves to complete its ongoing, taxpayer-funded study and allow the public to then evaluate the merits of the proposal as well as the NAS study. 
   On Friday, November 19, 1999, Congress adjourned for the year, having completed its work for the 1st session of the 106th Congress. After we left town to return home, OSHA announced the following Monday its new ergonomic proposal. As a member of the Senate authorizing committee and the Subcommittee on Employment Safety and Training, I received no notice, no advance warning, no copy of the proposal--nothing. None of my colleagues serving on the committee received that same courtesy, either. With Congress heading home, OSHA decided it was in America's best interest to launch the largest regulatory proposal ever to be put forth by an administration. Shotgunning the proposal through its hoops in less than 12 months, OSHA refused to wait for the completion of the $890,000 NAS study, bought and paid for with hard-earned tax dollars. 
   The Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, chaired by Senator ENZI, reacted as it should have. After weeks of evaluating the impact this proposal would have if actually enforced, we held our first hearing in April, addressing just one of many portions of the OSHA proposal, the work restriction protections, WRP. The WRP provisions would require employers to provide temporary work restrictions up to and including complete removal from work, based either upon their own judgment or on the recommendation of a health care provider. If the employer places work restrictions upon an employee which would allow them 
   to continue to perform some work activities, the employer must provide 100 percent of the employee's after-tax earnings and 100 percent of work benefits for up to 6 months. If the employee is completely removed from work, the employer must still provide 90 percent of the employee's after-tax earnings and 100 percent of benefits for up to 6 months. 
   The hearing revealed that the WRP provision is a direct violation of section 4b(4) of the 1970 OSH Act. There is no ambiguity in the wording. I have it on this chart.  
   Nothing in this Act shall be construed to supersede or in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of employment.  
   This is in reference to the State workers compensation act. When the OSH Act was enacted back in 1970, the clear intent, explicitly stated, was that OSHA was never to impact the State workers compensation laws. Believe me, what they are proposing in this rule would do so entirely. Congress specifically withheld OSHA having that right to supersede or affect those State workers compensation laws. Congress did this because State workers compensation systems are founded upon the principle that employers and employees have both entered into an agreement to give up certain rights in exchange for certain benefits in the area of work-related injury and illnesses. Most often, employers give up most of their legal defenses against liability for the employees' injuries, and the employees give up their right to seek punitive and other types of damages in turn. 
   The crucial factor that makes State workers compensation systems possible is that the remedies it provides to employees are the exclusive remedies available to them against their employers for work-related injuries and illnesses. 
   Anyone who served in the State legislature, as Senator ENZI and I have, knows that this is always one of the biggest issues of debate, discussion, and ultimately, hopefully, consensus between labor and management. It has been a workable system. But it is dependent upon that idea that this is the exclusive remedy. 
   WRP's provisions are in direct contradiction of section 4b(4) and will shake the foundation upon which the State workers systems rests because they will provide another remedy for employees for work-related injuries and illnesses. That is an absolute contradiction of what the OSH Act, establishing this agency, intended in 1970. 
   Since WRP provisions conflict with workers compensation systems, there will certainly be confusion to say the least as to who is liable. That is precisely why Congress put section 4b(4) in the act 30 years ago. To be sure, I dug deeper and found the conference report filed December 16, 1970, accompanying the act. As it pertains to section 4b(4) it reads:  
   The bill does not affect any Federal or State workmen's compensation laws, or the rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under them.  
   It is clear in the language of the statute as well as in the conference report, that Congress did not intend OSHA to have the power to affect and supersede State workmen's compensation laws. I  say to my colleagues, it doesn't get any clearer. How can it be misconstrued by OSHA? And they are simply in 
   violation of the act that established them. 
   OSHA is not listening to Congress. Frankly, it also is not listening, not paying any attention to what other Federal agencies are saying about their proposal. According to the Small Business Administration, OSHA has grossly underestimated the cost impact of its proposal. The SBA ordered an analysis of OSHA's Data Underlying the Ergonomics Standard and Possible Alternatives Discussed by the SBREFA Panel. 
   Policy Planning & Evaluation, Incorporated, PPE, prepared the analysis that was issued September 22, 1999. The PPE reported that:  
   OSHA's estimates of the costs in its Preliminary Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the draft proposed ergonomics standard, as furnished to the SBREFA Panel, may be significantly understated, and that OSHA's estimates of the benefits of the proposed standard may be significantly overstated.  
   This is the conclusion that we find another Federal agency coming to that OSHA has overstated what the benefits will be and they have significantly understated what the costs are going to be. The PPE further reported that OSHA's estimates of capital expenditures on equipment to prevent MSDs--the musculoskeletal disorders--do not account for varying establishment sizes, and seem quite low even for the smallest establishment size category. 
   The PPE attributed the overstatement of benefits that the rule will provide to the fact that OSHA has not accounted for a potentially dramatic increase in the number of MSDs resulting in days away from work as workers take advantage of the WRP provisions. 
   OSHA estimated the proposal's cost to be $4.2 billion annually--that is OSHA's best estimate. That is their cost estimate upon the economy and upon American business, $4.2 billion annually. That is not insignificant. But the PPE estimates that the cost of the proposed standard could be anywhere from 2.5 to 15 times higher than OSHA's estimate. That moves the cost from $10.5 billion to as much as $63 billion or higher. 
   That is just one Federal agency versus another. That is the Small Business Administration saying what OSHA is preparing to do is going to cost small business in this country $60 billion or more. 
   Whom are you going to believe? Are you going to believe OSHA's estimate of a minimal impact? Are you going to believe the Small Business Administration? I don't know, but I don't want to risk the jobs of the American people. I don't want to risk the economy on conflicting opinions by two Federal agencies. 
   Finally, the PPE report for the Small Business Administration shows that the cost-benefit ratio of this rule may be as much as 10 times higher for small businesses than for large businesses. It is very easy for the other side, the proponents of this drastic, dramatic rule change, to come down and rail against big business. Do they not realize that small businesses, the tiny businesses, the mom and pop operations struggling to exist in this country, are going to be impacted 10 times more than large businesses? 
   So if you don't care about the impact upon the economy as a whole, if you don't care about the impact upon large employers, then please consider the impact upon those small businesses out there and what they are going to have to pay to try to comply with this ill-advised rule. The cost disparity is not some slight discrepancy. We are talking about $60 billion a year. 
   Who covers that cost? Who is going to cover the $60-plus billion a year imposed upon the business community of this country? OSHA has an answer. OSHA's answer is: Pass it off on the consumer. Just pass on the cost. That is easy enough. Of course it is inflationary, of course it hurts the economy, but we can solve the problem of this added cost. Just let the consumer pay. 
   Senator ENZI has well noted that cannot be done in Medicare. It cannot be done in Medicaid. It cannot be done on those businesses reimbursed by the Federal Government, where their reimbursement is capped. There is nobody to pass the cost to. No bother, OSHA is going to push forward anyway, and that is what they have done. 
   I have listened to the opponents of the Enzi argument make the case that if this rule is delayed any longer, thousands of additional employees will suffer. Let's be clear, please, colleagues. Let's be clear. With or without this, with or without the 600-page--so far--proposed ergonomics regulation, rule, OSHA can still enforce its current law. The current law states this in the ergonomics proposal, on page 65774. It is on the chart before us. This is it. Let me quote what their proposed rule says. This is under the general duties provision. OSHA says:  
   [Every employer] shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees; and shall comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Standards promulgated under this Act.  
   This is the general duty provision which OSHA has used widely in enforcing conditions in the workplace that they believe are detrimental to the worker. They already have that tool, and they are not hesitant about using that authority. They don't have to have a new ergonomics proposal. They don't have to have a new ergonomics regulation in order to protect the 
   American worker. 
   By the way, this is not about whether or not we are going to address ergonomics at some point--we should. But we should do it in the right way. We should do it with due scientific study, based upon good scientific principles. It is not whether or not there is going to be an ergonomic standard. The issue is how it is going to be done and whether it is going to be done in a thoughtful way, respecting not only the worker but the needs of the employer. But I say again, OSHA currently has the authority under this general duty clause, and they can enforce ergonomics violations currently. 
   According to the proposal:  
   OSHA successfully issued over 550 ergonomic citations under the general duty clause.  
   They even list a number of employers, too. They have the authority, and they are proud of the fact that over 550 times they have issued citations on ergonomics violations under the general duty clause. 
   The point is, OSHA is not a crippled agency--far from it. It is a full-fledged regulatory agency that has the power to put any business out of business. 
   This proposal contains serious flaws which just beg the question: Who is really calling the shots as OSHA? This is not the first regulatory blunder to come out of OSHA in recent days. Just last January, they announced their intention to regulate private residences, our homes. Perhaps my distinguished colleague, for whom I have the utmost respect, Senator WELLSTONE, would say whether they are just doing their job in that case? 
   The American people rightly rose in outrage that OSHA would think they have the authority to go into the American home and regulate it as a workplace. After being publicly ridiculed and repeatedly humiliated, OSHA dropped the issue. They didn't drop it, they said they want to talk about it next year. Good thing, too, since 10 percent of working Americans work from home at least part-time, and their pursuance would have caused a chilling effect on modern technology. 
   OSHA's home regulation should be mentioned during this debate because many of the hazards OSHA wanted to regulate would be ergonomic-regulated: keyboard height, monitor height, desk height, even the type of chair you might sit in, in your home workplace. The list doesn't stop there. It also includes other potential OSHA violations including the number of outlets, adequate lighting, exit signs, even the bannister height. 
   Neither OSHA nor the 1970 OSH Act provides any guidance as to how to carry out their responsibilities. 
   We raised even more questions: Are employers required to ensure that home offices remain clear of toys at all times so employees don't trip and fall? What about an employer's smoking policy? Does that apply to the home, too? Most important, what about liability for employees' accidents in their employees' homes? How could employers possibly monitor this based upon what OSHA was asking?  
   In that same vein of questions asked in January, we are here again questioning the validity of OSHA's ergonomics proposal: What statutory right does OSHA have to regulate State workers compensation? 
   Senator WELLSTONE says they are just doing their job. There is no doubt what they have proposed will impact State workers compensation law in violation of the 1970 OSH Act. What 
   reason does OSHA give to why its WRP compensation package would not encourage fraud and abuse? Who would oversee fraud if it did occur? What about the cost estimates posed by another Federal agency, the Small Business Administration? 
   Again, it is not about how much we are willing to pay for an employee's safety but, rather, one agency's estimates being 15 times higher than another's, and then OSHA saying we have enough information, we have a solid basis to move forward. 
   Why are we funding the Small Business Administration if we are going to absolutely ignore their cost estimate in an area they ought to be experts? That is, experts on small business. They say it is 15 times higher than what OSHA says. If OSHA is going to shotgun an ergonomics proposal through the rulemaking process, at least I say they should do it right. 
   So I say to OSHA, put your love of regulating on hold and listen to what America is saying. You have 7,000 public comments submitted. Consider them all, not just a few that happen to support the agenda you seem to be pursuing. 
   Is it a love of regulating? This is a quote I think Senator ENZI used earlier. It is by Marthe Kent, who is the director of safety standards, the leader of OSHA's ergonomics effort, recently quoted in the Synergist magazine of May 2000. This is what was said:  
   I love it; I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I don't know why, but that's very true. So long as I am regulating, I'm happy.  
   That is one person's statement, though they are deeply involved in the ergonomics issue and the drafting of the ergonomics rule. But I think that might well reflect the way a lot of regulators feel. 
   So, concluding my comments, I just believe there is something much deeper at stake here, a very genuine and real philosophical difference. 
   Senator WELLSTONE believes, and those on the other side who support this rule believe, OSHA is just doing their job, and I believe we need to do our job. OSHA was not elected by the people, we were. 
   Not a day goes by that I do not have constituents in Arkansas call our office and complain about some regulatory agency that has gone afield, that has gone off on their own agenda. 
   Thomas Jefferson well recognized that the great threat to freedom of any individual comes when power becomes concentrated. Concentration of power, whether in the private sector, public sector, in a regulatory agency, in a corporation, if there is enough power accumulated in a single place, it threatens the individual's liberty. 
   I believe regulatory agencies today have become a fourth branch of Government unto themselves, unresponsive to what we say, unresponsive to what we do, until we are forced into a position of having only one tool left, and that is to cut off the funding for the implementation of the rule. That is what Senator ENZI has sought to do. That is why I think, on a bipartisan basis, so many realize this step is necessary. 
   I say to Chairman ENZI of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment Safety and Training that I appreciate his dedication to worker safety--no one doubts it--and for taking the high road when dealing with such highly contentious issues. And he has. Nobody told me when I joined his subcommittee that these issues were going to be easy. They have not been. But that is no reason for us to avoid asking the tough questions and, when necessary, taking the tough votes. 
   Until we get the answers--and OSHA does not have them now--until we get the answers to these tough questions, I ask my colleagues to take a hard, hard look at this ill-advised proposal. Look through it. It may take a week or two, but look through it, and you may understand why the Enzi amendment is so essential. 
   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to simply postpone, delay OSHA moving forward in this fiscal year with an ergonomics proposal that is going to dramatically impact the economy of the United States, I believe, and negatively impact the safety and the health of senior citizens on Medicare and Medicaid. Delay it by supporting the Enzi amendment. Allow the NAS the time necessary to complete their study and then maybe move forward with a good ergonomics rule to protect the workplace for American workers on the basis of sound science. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Enzi amendment and to oppose the ergonomics rule that has been proposed by the Department of Labor. This is the rule: hundreds of pages long. 
   Senator DURBIN said a few minutes ago this vote will be about values. I will accept that challenge. It is demagoguery to say because we oppose this rule we are not for safety in the workplace. I don't think anybody sincerely believes that on the other side. I am for a safe and healthy workplace. If we want to talk about values, I hope Members will read this and realize what we are imposing on the businesses on this country. There are going to be workers who lose their jobs because of this rule. There will be small businesses that are going to go bankrupt because of this rule, if it is not stopped. 
   My colleagues, I am opposed to the ergonomics rules for three reasons: It is based upon uncertain science, at best. This body funded almost a $1 million study by the National Academy of Sciences, which is not yet complete. Why do we fund a study by the NAS and then allow OSHA to move forward with the rule before we have the scientific basis for the rule? The Enzi amendment simply says let's hold off and wait until the science is in. 
   CRS says there is great uncertainty about what OSHA has proposed. Not only is there uncertain science, there is uncertain cost. While OSHA says it is a $4 billion cost, the Small Business Administration says the cost will be 15 times what OSHA says it will be. I am inclined to believe the estimates of the Small Business Administration. Private groups 
   believe the cost will be many times beyond that. But we know that it will be very expensive. There is uncertain cost involved. 
   Third, I oppose this rule because of its uncertain impact. It is 600 pages with many unintended consequences. Many times we allow things to go on in these agencies in which there are unintended consequences, but we know that the OSH Act says that OSHA is not to impact workers compensation laws in the States. This will most assuredly do that. 
   As Senator ENZI has rightly pointed out, it is going to negatively impact Medicare, health care dependent upon capped Federal reimbursement. They will have to absorb the costs of the ergonomics with no way to recapture those costs. 
   We also know that OSHA has proudly said they have already used their general duty clause with over 500 citations on ergonomics. They are not helpless to protect workers in the workplace now. We should not allow them to move forward with an ill-advised rule. 
   The issue is not safety. The issue is not OSHA doing their job. The issue is  whether we will do our job and whether we will stop an agency that is unresponsive, arrogant, and out of control. I urge my colleagues to support the Enzi amendment. 
   I retain the remainder of the 5 minutes.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee on Armed Services, I rise in strong opposition to the Murray amendment which allows abortion on demand in military facilities overseas. 
   I oppose the pending amendment because, No. 1, it is unnecessary. It is a solution in search of a problem. No. 2, it violates the letter and spirit of existing Federal law; that is, the Hyde amendment which prohibits Federal funding of abortion. In fact, that is the issue involved in this amendment. It is a subsidizing of the abortion procedure. Third, if it were adopted, it would likely accomplish very little while providing a Federal endorsement of the practice that is opposed by tens of millions of Americans. 
   My colleagues contend that the Murray amendment is a banner of constitutional rights. I think that argument is disingenuous. The current statute does not preclude servicewomen, serving overseas, from obtaining abortions. Women serving overseas already have the opportunity to terminate their pregnancy because the Department of Defense will provide them transportation either to the United States or to another country where abortion is legal for only $10. That is the cost of the food on the flight. 
   To say there is a constitutional right that is abrogated is incorrect. In 1979, the Congress adopted what has come to be known as the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court as constitutional. It prohibits the use of Federal funds for performing abortions. The Hyde amendment has broad support in the Congress, and in fact it has broad support by Americans in general. 
   I know my colleagues claim that Federal funds would not be used in these abortions, that women would pay for their own abortions, ostensibly by reimbursing the hospital, although that raises a host of questions that I hope we have time to pose for Senator MURRAY. But they can't possibly reimburse the hospital for the total cost of the abortion because the military hospital is 100-percent taxpayer funded. The building itself is built with taxpayer funds. 
   Do we intend, under the Murray amendment, to allocate a portion of the cost of the building of that hospital's facilities to the servicewoman seeking an abortion? The beds, the utilities, the salaries of those performing the procedure, these costs come out of the pockets of taxpayers, millions of whom believe abortion is a reprehensible practice. 
   Abortion should not be a fringe benefit to military service. We can't avoid the fact that adoption of the Murray amendment would be clearly inconsistent with the current U.S. statute  prohibiting the current funding of abortion. It not only departs from the letter of the Hyde amendment; it departs from the spirit of the Hyde amendment intended to protect the American taxpayer who has a conviction against the practice of abortion from being forced to subsidize and pay for the abortion procedure. 
   My colleagues contend that this is simply a matter of choice. Let's talk about choice for a moment. What about the choice of people who believe that abortion is inimical to their dearest values? What about the choice of taxpayers who don't want to subsidize the termination of life? 
   I find it significant that during 1993, when President 
   Clinton liberalized the practice of abortion in military hospitals, killing of the unborn in military hospitals, every single military physician and nearly every military nurse refused to volunteer to perform such procedures. The President issued his executive memorandum permitting abortion on demand at military hospitals on January 22, 1993--ironically, the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The fact that no doctors and almost no nurses volunteered to perform this procedure I think indicates that such a scenario would likely repeat itself if the Murray amendment were adopted. 
   Since military health care professionals cannot be forced to perform such a procedure against their conscience, as Senator MURRAY has said, the military will then be forced into a position of having to contract out the performance of such procedures to a civilian physician, which would in itself violate the Hyde amendment by requiring the expenditure of taxpayers' funds to pay for that contracted physician. 
   Having to hire abortionists at U.S. military hospitals puts the U.S. military in the abortion business. I find that appalling, something that is not supported by the American people. It is not supported by people on either side of the choice issue, whether pro-choice or pro-life. They do not believe we ought to be expending American taxpayers' dollars in subsidizing abortion. 
   This amendment, whether it is intended or not, would have that result--from the fact that we cannot totally allocate those costs, we are using a military hospital building built by taxpayers' dollars, using doctors whose salaries are paid by taxpayers, using equipment, using support staff--of all being paid for by the taxpayer. There is no conceivable way to calculate what that person should pay to reimburse the Government. The result is that the taxpayers are going to be subsidizing the practice. 
   If in fact doctors in the military react the way they did in 1993, when the President, by executive memorandum, issued the order that we were going to provide abortion on demand in military hospitals, if they react the same way, we would then be in the position of having to go into the civilian sector, contract with doctors who are willing to perform abortions, and pay them with American taxpayers' dollars--clearly, and explicitly, in violation of the Hyde amendment. 
   I find this whole debate to be an exercise in irony. The purpose of our Armed Forces is to defend and protect American lives. We should not then subvert this noble goal by using the military to terminate the lives of the innocent among us. 
   What the Murray amendment would do, in the opinion of this Senator, is to create a kind of legal myth: We are not subsidizing abortions, but we really are. We are saying we are not but in fact we know we are. Let's pretend we are not subsidizing abortions. We know they are in military hospitals performed by military doctors paid by American taxpayers. We know it is supported by taxes paid by American taxpayers. We know the equipment used is bought and paid for by American taxpayers. But we are not really subsidizing it. That is a legal myth and it simply does not measure up. 
   There is a concept called the slippery slope. I suggest allowing abortions to be performed in U.S. military hospitals overseas is just one little more slide down that slippery slope.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will respond to a number of things my colleague from Washington said. 
   While I do not know the specifics or the circumstances of the situation to which she made reference, I know it is a bad practice when we try to legislate by anecdote. I do know this as well, that much of the debate is centered around whether or not a woman's rights can be protected under current DOD policy. The insinuation has been that servicewomen experience a lack of support from their chain of command when requesting leave in order to obtain an abortion. That was the circumstance in the situation to which Senator MURRAY just made reference. 
   Such an argument impugns the professionalism of the officer corps. There are procedures in place and there are rights by which men and women in uniform can be protected. If, in fact, their rights are being disregarded by a commanding officer, there are means under current law by which those rights can be vindicated and the wrong righted. 
   I have great confidence in the professionalism of our officer corps. I fully expect any commanding officer to approve a service member's leave when properly requested, whatever the motivation for that request. If that is not done, then there should be a grievance filed, and I would stand in support of such an individual's right to make that request on a space-available basis. I believe the professional officer corps that we have is going to respond and treat that servicewoman properly and give her the rights she has under the law. 
   The other point I would make to those who would impugn the professionalism of our officer corps is that the commanding officer today may just likely be a woman. That woman seeking permission to receive approved leave for an abortion under current policy may just as well find they are dealing with a commanding officer who is in fact female. 
   At this time, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from the State of Kansas, Senator BROWNBACK.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, one of the issues that has arisen during this debate is whether or not the Murray amendment violates the Hyde provision which prohibits Federal funding  for abortion. Proponents of the amendment argue, no, this doesn't violate Hyde because we are requiring a woman to pay for the abortion procedure. 
   I have raised the issue as to how exactly to calculate the cost of reimbursing the DOD for the expense of an abortion procedure, in a military hospital, when the facilities were built at taxpayers' expense, and the support staff were paid salaries out of public funds, in which the equipment has been paid for. How in the world would this be calculated? 
   Now, earlier it was suggested that is not really a problem. During the lunch break, we checked with the Department of Defense. I will share for the record what we found. It is currently not feasible with existing information systems and support capabilities to collect billing information relative to a specific encounter within the military health care system. 
   Procedures performed in military hospitals are assigned a diagnostic related group code, but these are ``assigned'' or ``allocated'' costs that don't necessarily reflect resources devoted to a specific case. Military infrastructure and overhead costs cannot, at the present time, be allocated on a case-by-case basis. 
   It is very clear that the Hyde amendment would be violated, that we would--whether we admit it or not, whether we promulgate this legal myth--be subsidizing abortion with taxpayers' money, in violation of the law of the land. 
   I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Wyoming, Senator ENZI.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself all but the remaining 2 minutes of the time allotted to my side. 
   Let me clarify a couple of things from my perspective. 
   It has been alleged that if you have a servicewoman who is seeking an abortion under current policy, you put her on an aircraft, fly her back to the U.S. at taxpayers' expense, and therefore what is the difference? And the only reason we want to maintain the current policy is we want to put an impediment up to a woman having an abortion. 
   The current DOD policy for servicewomen seeking to obtain abortions is that they may fly on a space-available basis, if the aircraft are already making the trip for operational reasons--not for the purpose of facilitating abortions. Space-available transportation is available for any service member on leave regardless of what their motivation is. 
   These aircraft have been referred to repeatedly during the debate as ``cargo aircraft.'' In fact, these aircraft have passenger seats just as on civilian airlines. 
   I wish to propound a series of questions to the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, on my time. 
   I ask the Senator exactly how she would calculate the cost of reimbursing DOD for the expense of an abortion procedure. Does she count only things consumed such as blood, bandages, and surgical tools, or would she compute the cost of using the facility, the salaries of the support staff, and the other medical equipment used to perform such a procedure?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator. I appreciate very much her candor in answering the questions. I think it has been illuminating.  
   I would like to go back on some of these questions. Frankly, it has been made very clear by the Department of Defense, as I stated earlier, that they do not currently have the ability to make these calculations on a case-by-case basis. 
   I quote once again that ``procedures performed in military hospitals are assigned a diagnostic-related group code, but these are assigned or allocated costs that do not necessarily reflect resources devoted to a specific case.'' 
   That is very plain. 
   They further go on and say that military infrastructure and overhead costs cannot at the present time be allocated on a case-by-case basis. 
   As much as we would like to say and as much as I believe the proponents of this amendment are sincere, it is not currently possible for the Department of Defense to calculate what portion of the infrastructure, the equipment and facilities, should be allocated to an individual servicewoman seeking an abortion. That simply means we will, in fact, be subsidizing abortion procedures, and in doing so violate existing law. 
   I raise another issue as we think about Senator MURRAY's response to my questions. She said: Yes, in the case that you contract for a physician, it would be assumed that the proper defense would indemnify the contract physician. That means that the U.S. Department of Defense becomes the malpractice insurer for that abortion provider, that contract physician. It means that should there be a botched abortion, that doctor doesn't have to worry about malpractice because it is the U.S. Government that will, in fact, indemnify those costs. The Senator is correct; it is a terrible liability we would be assuming. 
   Senator MURRAY, in her response to my questions, also said it was her understanding that her amendment would allow elective abortion procedures to be performed in countries where abortion is prohibited by law. That is a very candid confession because that would dramatically change current DOD policy. This amendment would, in fact, allow abortions to be performed in countries where it is against the law. That includes South Korea, where we have 5,958 women serving. It includes Germany, where there are 3,013 women serving. Over 9,000 women serve overseas. 
   We are not just changing one Department of Defense policy. We are changing current policy that honors the laws of the countries in which these men and women are serving, a dramatic change from current policy and one of which my colleagues certainly need to be aware. 
   Much of this debate has been about providing abortions to military personnel overseas. The amendment would remove the restrictions on performing abortions at all military hospitals, even in the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to look closely at the Murray amendment and exactly what it seeks to amend. I want my colleagues to be aware this amendment permits abortions at any military facility overseas or in the United States. This is not a simple refinement of current policy. This is not something dealing with the quality and fairness. 
   It can be argued that if it does not overturn current DOD policy regarding countries where abortion is illegal, you are only going to exacerbate any disparity that exists by saying some women overseas would be able to go to an American military facility and receive an abortion and others in countries where it was illegal would not. This is a dramatic change that would not only permit abortions in military facilities overseas but would also make a dramatic change in military facilities in the United States. 
   The arguments are clear and the arguments are persuasive. It is a mistake for this Congress to intervene and change current DOD policy, a policy that has worked well, a 
   policy that accommodates women in uniform who desire to have an abortion, but without turning the American taxpayer into subsidizers of a practice that they find deeply, deeply offensive. 
   In Senator MURRAY's response to my question regarding what this amendment would do to our current policy regarding abortions in countries where it is illegal, we could have a dramatic and detrimental effect on our diplomatic relationships with our allies. Would Saudi Arabia continue to permit U.S. forces to remain if we permitted abortions at our facilities? How would the South Korean Government react to having abortions, which are illegal in South Korea, performed at the U.S. military facilities? These are serious issues. This is not something to be trifled about in a 2-hour debate on the floor of the Senate, as if we are trying to provide equity and to be fair to our women and military overseas. 
   The evidence is clear. The Murray amendment violates the Hyde provision in current law. The Hyde provision says we are not going to subsidize abortions; we are not going to spend public funds for abortions. It is a provision that has wide, broad, bipartisan support across this country. In fact, it is supported by both those who are pro-choice and those who are pro-life, who believe, even if a woman has this constitutional right, those who are offended by that, those who believe it is wrong, should not be required to subsidize it. 
   The Murray amendment chips away at that basic provision supported by the American people. It says she may have to pay something, but we are going to use taxpayer-funded facilities, taxpayer supported and paid for salaries, support staff, and equipment. If that is not subsidizing it, I am not sure what is. The Department of Defense has made it clear that trying to calculate the infrastructure, support staff, salaries, and everything else that goes into a military health care facility simply cannot currently, understandably, be computed on a case-by-case basis. 
   The issue about indemnification of contracted doctors is a serious issue that bears very serious consideration by this Senate. It is an issue that has not been previously raised. Senator MURRAY said, yes, if, as in 1993 when not one physician in the military volunteered to perform abortions when the President said we were going to offer these services in military facilities around the world, not one volunteered to do that, Senator MURRAY says in that circumstance, should that recur, under her amendment we will go out and contract. If we go out and contract physicians, it is a very clear and explicit violation of the Hyde amendment and, in addition, subjects the U.S. Government to untold liability. 
   I believe men and women of good will differ and do sincerely differ on the abortion issue. I do believe that men and women of good will, respecting the sincere convictions of others, do not believe those who are offended by the practice of abortion should be required to subsidize it. That is what is at issue. There can be no serious question. There can be no real debate that, in fact, by taking the step the Murray amendment suggests, we are going to put the U.S. military in the business of performing abortions. I don't believe that is supported by the American people. I don't believe that is in the spirit of the Hyde law. I don't believe that meets the criteria of the letter of that law. 
   It would be a terrible mistake down the slippery slope of providing abortion in this country to pass the Murray amendment and, in so doing, make millions and millions and millions of Americans who feel very deeply about this issue involuntary contributors to the practice of abortion by having this procedure done in military facilities not only overseas but here in the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I hope everybody will read the Murray amendment. In fact, there is nowhere in this amendment that it says a woman who is seeking an abortion overseas has to pay for it. There is nowhere that it says that. But the current policy in fact is that servicewomen serving overseas do not forfeit their right to obtain an abortion. They may request leave. They fly to the United States, or another country, on a military aircraft, on a space-available basis. The flights are for $10. 
   This amendment should be tabled for a number of reasons. It violates the Hyde amendment. The Department of Defense has said you cannot calculate reimbursement on a case-by-case basis, even if it did say a woman was going to pay. 
   As Senator MURRAY said, you would have to contract with physicians. That puts us in the position of violating the Hyde amendment by paying these physicians to come into military hospitals to perform abortions. 
   It is going to create untold diplomatic dilemmas because, as Senator MURRAY said, her amendment will require abortions to be performed in countries that prohibit abortions, such as Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It is going to be a thumb in the eye of our allies. It is going to create untold diplomatic problems. 
   Finally, it turns military hospitals into abortion providers. That is not what we want. That is not what the American people want. It is going to make millions and millions of Americans, pro-life Americans, who have deeply held beliefs about this issue, subsidizers of a practice they find offensive and morally wrong. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in tabling the Murray amendment. I move to table the amendment, Mr. President, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am for campaign finance reform. I voted for cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill, and I would do it again. 
   I think this has merit, but it is the wrong time, the wrong vehicle, the wrong scope. If this is the U.S.S. Warner, this is the torpedo that could sink it. That is wrong. 
   There are too many important things in the bill to destroy it. There is health care for our military retirees forever. By a 96-1 vote yesterday, we put that in. There are retail and mail order pharmacy prescription benefits. I don't want to face those military retirees and say: We thought this was a good vehicle for campaign finance reform. There is the thrift savings plan, TRICARE remote, a 3.7-percent pay raise. 
   It is wrong to kill this bill for a nongermane campaign finance provision. There will be an opportunity. We should do it, but we should not put a nongermane provision such as this on an important DOD bill.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am deeply disappointed that this nongermane amendment is being offered on this very important bill. As a member of the conference committee, I am very disappointed it has been described and depicted in the way it has by the Democrats today. 
   I have never seen a group of my colleagues work as hard as the members of this conference committee have for the last few months. Over 400 hours have been logged by staff and members in meetings trying to negotiate very tough and very difficult issues. These are tough issues, and there are big differences between the House and the Senate. There has been enormous  movement, and most of the movement has been on behalf of Republican Senators who have made compromises and concessions to move this bill forward. There has been no stall. One does not stall a bill by spending the kind of time and energy we have seen expended on this bill. 
   In reference to the Kennedy amendment that has been offered today, we spent a week debating this issue. One of the biggest problems I see with the Kennedy bill is that all of the access provisions have been removed. Even the access provisions we saw in the Dingell-Norwood bill have been removed. There are none of the means by which more people can get insurance. 
   The only access left in this bill is access to the lawyer, and there is plenty of access to the lawyer and plenty of access to lawsuits. That is the real purpose of why we have seen this brought forward, to provide a whole new realm of litigation for trial lawyers. 
   I want to give one particular example, a company in my State. I do not mention it particularly because it is from my State, but it happens to be the largest employer in America, and that is the Wal-Mart Corporation. It sounds good: Let's sue Wal-Mart, big, bad Wal-Mart; let's sue corporations. 
   Let's put it in practical terms. They have 900,000 employees in the United States. Forty percent of them chose voluntarily to go under the Wal-Mart health plan. There are about 10 percent in HMOs and many are insured by their spouses who are employed in other places. 
   Those 40 percent represent 700,000 Americans in this one company who receive their health care through Wal-Mart. The 10 percent who are in HMOs pay three to four times more in premiums. It costs three to four times more than those who are under the Wal-Mart plan. 
   Recently, they surveyed all the employees in the Wal-Mart plan. Ninety-five percent expressed satisfaction, but more significant, not one of them mentioned they wished they had a right to sue their employer. Not one of them. 
   I want to read what they said in a letter. We met with them off the floor a few moments ago. This is what they said in a letter:  
   Our concern is that unavoidable litigation costs will increase health care costs and in turn increase health care premiums.  
   There is no doubt about that.  
   Depending upon cost, we will be forced to increase health insurance premiums, reduce benefits, or shift associates in health maintenance organizations.  
   They are going to take care of their associates. Frankly, they said most are going to be forced into HMOs that cost three to four times more than the Wal-Mart health plan. If it costs three to four times more, literally hundreds of thousands of employees in this one company alone will be faced with making the decision they cannot pay the premiums or a portion of their premiums and will be pushed into the ranks of the uninsured. That is going to be the intended or unintended consequence of the Kennedy bill if it is adopted. 
   The plain truth is, Democrats want to get rid of employer-sponsored health insurance. Mr. President, 103 million Americans receive health care through their employers, and it will take one lawsuit with an egregious award to force employers to drop their health care and add their employees to the ranks of the unemployed. 
   Senate Republicans are dead serious about producing a bill out of this conference and one that puts patients first, not trial lawyers first. 
   The Kennedy amendment is in bad faith. The question is, Do you want an issue or do you want a law? We can produce a bill that can become law and protect millions of Americans, but this is too important to do it quickly instead of doing it right. We want to do it right. I reserve the remainder of our time.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Col. Craig F. Brotchie of the United States Special Operations Command who is retiring from the United States Air Force after 26 years of active duty. Colonel Brotchie is an exceptional leader, and has served this great country with honor and dignity. He understands leadership and selfless service. He is known for his dedication and integrity. Colonel Brotchie has tackled the tough issues that our Air Force and Special  Forces Units have had to face over the past three decades, and this wonderful American deserves tremendous praise and thanks from a nation he loves and for which he has given so much. 
   Colonel Brotchie was born January 27, 1952, in San Bernardino, California. In 1974, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration from Southern Utah State College, and earned distinguished graduate honors in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps prior to commissioning. He completed Squadron Officer School at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, in 1978; the U.S. Army Command and General Staff Officer course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1983; and the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, in 1987. While at Fort Leavenworth, Colonel Brotchie earned a master's degree in human relations from Webster University. 
   Colonel Brotchie completed various operational, staff and command assignments in his career. He served as a personnel officer for the 777th Radar Squadron, Klamath Air Force Station, California; and in various personnel offices in the 1606th Air Base Wing, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, prior to entering the combat control career field. Since 1979, Colonel Brotchie served as officer in charge, Combat Control Team, 62nd Military Airlift Wing, McChord AFB, Washington; Special Tactics Team Leader and Operations Officer, Detachment 1, Military Airlift Command Operation Staff, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; and as the Combat Control Staff Officer, Joint Special Operations Command. In 1984, Colonel Brotchie took command of Detachment 2, 1723rd Combat Control Squadron, Clark AB, Republic of the Philippines. After Intermediate Service School, he took command of the 1723rd Combat Control Squadron, Hurlburt Field, Florida, and in 1989, became the commander of the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, Pope AFB, North Carolina. Upon completion of War College, he was assigned as the Deputy Chief, Special Operations Division, Directorate of Forces, Headquarters United States Air Force, Washington, D.C. In 1995, he returned to Hurlburt Field as Commander of the 720th Special Tactics Group. 
   Colonel Brotchie is a master parachutist, military free fall parachutist, combat diver, and air traffic controller. His military decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and the Joint Service Achievement Medal. 
   Colonel Brotchie shares his devotion to our Nation through military service with his wife, Col. Ann E. Dunwoody, who was recently selected for promotion and designated to command a major unit at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They have two sons: Bryan and Scott. 
   It is with great pride and honor that I wish CRAIG and his family the best as he retires from the United States Air Force. He has set an inspiring example of dedication to the defense of freedom and to the protection of the basic liberties that the citizens of our country enjoy.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I join Chairman WARNER in expressing my gratitude to Senator JOHNSON for his leadership on this issue. He made some very salient points on which I hope to reflect in my comments in support of the Warner-Hutchinson amendment. 
   The question here is not one of sentiment. It is not one of seeing the problem. It is not one of wanting to act and to act now. The question is, What is the realistic way? 
   The fact that the Johnson amendment will cost over $90 billion and will be subject to a budget point of order, which Senator LEVIN saw fit to raise in regard to the underlying Warner-Hutchinson amendment which would have made this permanent but has not seen fit to raise against Senator JOHNSON, but undoubtedly that is going to happen, that is a huge barrier, as we know, and a big problem. 
   I think we have to do something this year. That is why I am glad to rise and join Senator Warner in introducing the Warner-Hutchinson amendment for the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   I want to comment also on Senator DORGAN's points concerning the VA health care system; that it was this Congress last year that increased VA medical care spending by over 10 percent, the largest single increase in VA health care spending in over a decade; that, indeed, with our veterans, as well as with our military retirees, our credibility is in tatters when it has been this Congress that has been determined to take the steps necessary to restore that credibility and to restore that confidence--with the pay raise last year, with the 10-percent increase in VA medical spending, far above the President's budget request, and now with this enormous step. Let us not, 
   in comparing it with Senator JOHNSON's broad amendment, try to minimize the significance of the step that will be taken under the Warner-Hutchinson amendment. I am glad to be a sponsor of this amendment in introducing it. 
   In my experience as the Armed Services Committee Personnel Subcommittee chairman, and in my experience as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee--I have served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the House and in the Senate since I came to Congress--I visit regularly with retired military personnel on a broad range of topics. 
   Time and time again when speaking with military retirees, or responding to letters of concern, the subject of adequate health care coverage comes up. Senator JOHNSON is absolutely right about the feelings expressed by our military retirees and their concerns since we have broken our commitment and our promise to them. 
   The citizens of our country who have served proudly in the armed services prefer to be doing other things than spending their time petitioning Members of the Senate. They are mature, humble, and they are patriotic by nature. But in this situation, they simply must speak out. These fine Americans have been slighted as the years have passed. They have seen benefits erode. They have seen promises broken or the fulfillment of promises delayed. 
   No issue causes more distress than the lack of comprehensive medical care as part of their retirement benefits. Military retirees are annoyed. They are more than annoyed. They are distressed. They feel betrayed. They have witnessed bureaucratic stalling through trial programs and tests that serve no purpose and simply nibble around the edges of the problem. They do not provide the kind of permanent and tangible fixes to the inadequacies and shortfalls of the medical care system. 
   I want to share a couple of quotes from several of the thousands of heartfelt letters I have received on the subject of military retirees in my home State of Arkansas. These letters from Arkansans who have served faithfully in our Nation's Armed Forces are a mere representation of the sentiments expressed by military retirees all across the Nation. 
   Col. Bob Jolly, of Hot Springs, AR, echoes the feelings of many others when he writes:  
   Thousands of military retirees are dying each month while denied the health coverage our government willingly gives all other federal retirees. We older retirees, now in our sixties and seventies, cannot wait for your Senate colleagues to prescribe years of tests to receive the care we were promised and have earned through decades of fighting our nation's wars.  
   Then, in a letter Mr. Stewart Freigy, a retired Air Force pilot from Hardy, AR, writes:  
   My decision to make a career of the Air Force was based on two things. First a sense of patriotism instilled in me as a child. The second factor was a promise by my government that if I served twenty years, I would receive half of my base pay plus free medical and dental care for myself and my dependents for the rest of my life. By the time I retired, the dental benefits were already gone. Since then I have watched the erosion of my benefits through Champus and then through Tri-Care. In short, like many other military retirees, I feel I have been deceived by a government that I served faithfully.  
   Mr. President, it is time we let retired military personnel know that the Senate hears their plea for justice and equity. How we handle this issue will not only send a message to these Americans that correction is on the way, but it will also send the proper message to those on active duty and to those young people who are considering whether or not they want to enter the Armed Forces or whether they want to make a career of the military. 
   I have heard from recruiters time and time again since I assumed the position as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee that the most important pool from which to attract military recruits is the children of those who had  careers in the military. When their parents feel betrayed, it becomes increasingly less likely that they are going to make the choice to go into the military themselves. It is important that Congress and the American people demonstrate that we are going to honor our promises to our military personnel. 
   The Warner-Hutchinson amendment will permit military retirees to be served by the military health care system throughout their lives regardless of age and active duty or retirement status. That is an incredibly huge and important step for this Congress to take. Under our proposal, the current age discrimination will be eliminated. No one will be kicked out of the military health care system just because they turn 65. 
   Let us not minimize and let us not underestimate the dramatic step of the Warner-Hutchinson proposal: No more age discrimination, no more kicking military retirees out of the health care system and forcing them to leave the doctors and the system with which they have been served for many years and with which they are familiar. Beneficiaries will continue their health care coverage in a system with which they are comfortable and will not be forced to pay the high cost of supplemental insurance premiums to ensure their health care needs are adequately provided. Medicare will pick up what Medicare pays for, and TRICARE will be the supplemental plan to pick up the remainder. 
   It is a dramatic, important, and positive step and commitment we are making. This initiative will act as a statement of our absolute commitment to the promises made to those who have faithfully served the United States of America in our Armed Forces. 
   As Senator WARNER stated, improving the military health care system has been the top priority of the Senate Armed Services Committee this year. 
   Last year, we did the pay raise. Personnel chiefs tell me that has made an enormous difference in their ability to go out and recruit. It has improved morale in the Armed Forces. This is the next big step: Improving the health care system both with the prescription drug component as well as this very major step we are taking for our retired military. Hearings have been held on this issue, and input from retirees has been received and has been heard loud and clear. 
   Time and again, our extensive review of the situation has highlighted the importance of retiree access to the health care system and to pharmaceuticals, with pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs being the No. 1 concern for retirees. This already addresses the issue of pharmaceutical actions by providing a pharmacy benefit with no enrollment fee for both the retail and mail order programs. On a bipartisan basis, that has been included. It is an important provision with overwhelming support. 
   The Warner-Hutchinson amendment complements that pharmacy benefit and continues the efforts of the committee to provide a comprehensive solution to the issue of health care for America's deserving military retirees. By adopting this amendment the Defense authorization bill will provide a comprehensive health care benefit for all of our country's military retirees. 
   As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I am well aware of the other legislative alternatives that have been proposed. There has been a very positive, productive colloquy and debate on the floor on these alternatives. However, I believe strongly that the Warner-Hutchinson amendment provides the most effective and realistic remedy in a fiscally responsible manner. America's military retirees were promised a health care benefit. They served our country and we, as a nation, need to fulfill our duty by honoring the commitments made to them. This amendment does that. 
   I applaud Senator WARNER and his leadership on this issue, his willingness to take this bold step. I believe this amendment will pass with overwhelming support. I appreciate Senator JOHNSON's continued leadership. I know this will be a debate that continues in the years to come. It should not preclude first taking this step. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the speedy adoption of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001.  
   I join my colleagues on the committee in expressing my appreciation to Chairman WARNER for the outstanding job he has done in his work on this bill. 
   I commend Senator ALLARD for the great work he has done as chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, for the work he did on the Personnel Subcommittee prior to my ascension to that post, and for the assistance he has given me; I express my appreciation for that. 
   As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I worked closely with Senator MAX CLELAND, our ranking member, to develop a package that is responsive to the manpower readiness needs of the military services, that supports the numerous quality of life improvements for our service men and women, their families, and their retirement communities, and that reflects the budget realities we have today and will face in the future. 
   The subcommittee focused on the challenges of recruiting and retention during each of our hearings this year. Even the health care hearing really focused on that area of recruitment and retention and the impact of what we do in the area of health care on our future retention and recruiting ability. 
   This bill will have a positive impact on both recruiting and retention as those who might serve and those who are serving see our commitment to provide the health care benefits promised to those who serve with a full military career. 
   I am very pleased with this bill. I am proud of this bill. I believe these initiatives will result in improved recruiting and retention within the military services. 
   The bill supports the administration's request for an active duty end strength of 1,381,600, and reserve strength of 847,436, more than this administration requested. 
   On military personnel policy, there are a number of recommendations intended to support the recruiting and retention and personnel management of the services. Among the most noteworthy is a provision, that would be effective July 1, 2002, requiring high schools to provide military recruiters the same access to the campus, to student directors, to student lists and information as they provide the colleges, universities, and private sector employers unless its governing body, the school board, decides by a majority vote to deny military recruiters access to the high school. 
   Currently, there are literally hundreds of high schools that have made decisions--usually on the basis of the superintendent or the principal--to deny access to military recruiters. For those school boards that do not vote to limit access to military recruiters, the proposed modification in the bill retains the original requirement that the services must send a general or flag officer to visit high schools within 120 days of the denial of access to military recruiters. If the high school continues to deny equal access to military recruiters, the Secretary of Defense will then send a letter to the Governor notifying him of the denial and requesting assistance in obtaining access for military recruiters. 
   If, after the efforts of the Secretary of Defense and the Governor, the high school continues to deny access to military recruiters, the Secretary of Defense will notify the congressional delegation of the high school that has not complied with the statute we will enact with the passage of this bill. Of course, if the school board votes not to restrict access of military recruiters, the services and the Secretary of Defense will not be required to go through the procedures I just described. 
   I believe requiring school boards to take that affirmative vote and to do so publicly in the light of their constituencies will really eliminate this problem that has posed such an obstacle to our military recruiters. In our hearings, we heard from frontline military recruiters that the biggest obstacle they have is actually having access to be able to make their case to young people in our schools today. 
   Another initiative to support recruiting is a pilot program in which the Army could use motor sports to promote recruiting, implement a program of recruiting in conjunction with vocational schools and community colleges, and a pilot program using contract personnel to supplement active recruiters. 
   Another important recommendation in this mark is the expansion of JROTC programs. We have added $12 million to expand the JROTC programs. We combine it with the funds in the budget request. This will maximize the services' ability to expand JROTC during fiscal year 2001. 
   I am proud to be able to support these important programs that teach responsibility, leadership, and ethics and assist the military in recruiting. In fact, it has been one of the most effective tools the military has in recruiting high school students. 
   Our major recommendations include a 3.7-percent pay raise 
   for military personnel and a revision of the basic allowance for housing to permit the Secretary of Defense to pay 100 percent of the average local housing costs and ensure that housing allowance rates are not reduced while permitting increases that local housing costs dictate. 
   The bill directs the Secretary of Defense to implement the Thrift Savings Plan for active and reserve forces not later than 180 days after enactment. Making mandatory the provision of the Thrift Savings Plan will be a very positive recruiting and retention tool in assisting the military services in attracting highly qualified personnel and encouraging them to remain until retirement. 
   This year, the committee focused on improving health care for active, reserve, and retired military personnel and their families. In health care, there are a number of key recommendations. The foremost of these provisions is the pharmacy benefit for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries to which Senator ALLARD alluded in his remarks. This is the first time Medicare-eligible military retirees have an entitlement to military health care. 
   In addition, prescription drugs represent the largest unmet need of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. I will be speaking on the Warner-Hutchinson amendment, when that is offered, regarding health care and what we are doing for our men and women in uniform. 
   I am very proud of this bill and pleased with what the committee has put together. It will provide the resources the military services need to maximize their readiness and to improve the quality of life for active and retired military personnel and their families. 
   I express my gratitude to Charlie Abell, committee staff, for the outstanding work he has done in the past and for the service he has again performed to our country and to the committee. I appreciate his work, along with other members of the committee staff. I especially thank my personal staff, Michael Ralsky, for the work he has done not only on behalf of our country and our national security but for the State of Arkansas. This is a good bill worthy of the support of the Senate. I am pleased to be supporting it. 
   I again thank Chairman WARNER for his leadership in putting this bill together.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) as they approach their 50th Anniversary. ABC was founded by seven contractors in Baltimore, Maryland on June 1, 1950, and is today a national trade association representing over 22,000 contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers and related firms from across the country and from all specialties in the construction industry. 
   ABC is the construction industry's voice for merit shop (open shop) construction as ABC is the only national association devoted to the merit shop philosophy. Merit shop companies employ approximately 80 percent, or four out of five, of all American construction workers and seek to provide the best management techniques, the finest craftsmanship, and the most competitive bidding and pricing strategies in the industry. ABC believes that union and merit shop contractors and their employees should work together in harmony and that work should be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder regardless of labor affiliation. 
   I greatly appreciate ABC's commitment to developing a safe workplace and high-performance work force through quality education and training with comprehensive safety and health programs. I also appreciate ABC's dedicated efforts to secure free enterprise, fair and open competition, less government, more opportunities for jobs, tax relief, increased training, and the elimination of frivolous complaints and over-regulation. 
   Accordingly, I thank ABC for their efforts and wish them continued success in their efforts to ensure that the American construction industry continues to afford the finest work product and greatest opportunity in the world.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my distinguished colleague from North Carolina. I applaud his willingness to look at new and innovative approaches. I think his embrace of the Lieberman amendment is reflective of that desire for change. 
   I note, as I listened to the Senator's comments, he spoke of the North Carolina experience and some of the things they have done in North Carolina--some of the innovative, creative, and constructive programs in North Carolina. 
   I applaud the State of North Carolina. And I think that makes our case for Straight A's. I think the idea of giving those kinds of States which are doing good and innovative things more flexibility in carrying out those programs is exactly the direction we ought to be moving. 
   I believe the Lieberman proposal moves us in that direction, that it is a constructive effort, that it has been a positive effort, that there has been, on the part of the moderate Democrats who have spoken on behalf of the Lieberman amendment, a recognition of the need for change. There has been a candid recognition of the failure of the top-down, one-size-fits-all approach that we have taken for 35 years to the Federal role in education. 
   I must say that I still have a number of concerns and reservations, and have opposition to some of the provisions in the Lieberman proposal. I still think there is too much regulatory effort from Washington. I think there is a failure to embrace the kind of bold steps we need that are in the underlying Educational Opportunities Act and that it would be a shame for us, while recognizing the need for change, recognizing the need for adequate funding, to only take a half step or a baby step in the direction of reform. That is why I believe the underlying bill is far preferable. 
   I am pleased, however, that there have been ongoing discussions among those who believe that we need change on both sides of the aisle, that we need to provide greater flexibility, that we need to consolidate programs, that we need to streamline programs, and that there has been an effort to accomplish that. But I am very concerned that we still centralize too much power in the name of accountability. We still give too much authority to the Department of Education. 
   Members have been talking about the importance of accountability all week and last week. If we are to have accountability for Federal education funds, we must first ensure that accountability is occurring not only at the local level but at the Federal level as well. 
   So when I heard Senator LIEBERMAN earlier say these are billions of American taxpayers' dollars that we are sending back to the States and to the schools; therefore, we have a right and a responsibility to require specifics on how that money is spent, that sounds very good, but I say that we should require the same kind of accountability from the Department of Education which oversees these programs that it administers. 
   For the second year in a row, the U.S. Department of Education has been unable to address its financial management problems. Those management problems are very serious. In its past two audits, the Department was unable to account for parts 
   of its $32 billion program budget and the $175 billion owed in student loans. They were unable to account for parts of that budget. Before we entrust the Department with administering more funds and creating more new programs, we must ensure that they are properly accounting for the funding they already have. 
   The Lieberman amendment, though a step in the right direction, still leaves more power in the hands of the Federal Department of Education and provides a modicum of improvement for State flexibility that, in my opinion, is not enough. 
   The House Education Committee has been holding hearings on the financial problems at the Department of Education and has found instances of duplicate payments to grant winners and an $800 million college loan to a single student. That is rather amazing. 
   In its 1998 audit, the Department blamed its problems on a faulty new  accounting system that cost $5.1 million, in addition to the cost of manpower to try to fix the system. A new accounting system will be the third new accounting system in 5 years. 
   The most recent 1999 audit showed the following: The Department's financial stewardship remains in the bottom quartile of all major Federal agencies. If you stack them all up, you find the Department of Education down toward the bottom in the job they are doing in fiscal responsibility. The Department sent duplicate payments to 52 schools in 1999, at a cost of more than $6.5 million. And perhaps most significant, none of the material weaknesses cited in the 1998 audit were corrected when the Department was reaudited in 1999. 
   So they have failed to take the kind of corrective measures that might reestablish confidence and faith in the Department of Education. These problems make the Department vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. I have submitted an amendment to this bill that would require an investigative study by the GAO into the financial records of the Department of Education. 
   No one is suggesting we should eliminate the Department. No one is suggesting that having a voice for education at the Cabinet table is not critically important. But it is equally important that we require high standards of fiscal responsibility for the Department that oversees billions of dollars in taxpayer money. We entrust them with funding. We expect local schools to handle their funds properly. We should have the same kind of demand on the Department of Education. 
   In addition, I have an amendment to provide increased flexibility among Federal formula grant programs for States and local school districts. It is identical to language included in legislation in the House to reauthorize ESEA. 
   One of my concerns about the Lieberman amendment, although I do believe it is a step in the right direction and will provide expanded flexibility, is that it does not provide the kind of flexibility the States and local school districts are crying out for. 
   This amendment would give States and local school districts the authority to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs to address local needs as they see fit. Covered programs would include professional development for teachers, education technology, safe and drug-free schools, title VI innovative education block grants, and the Emergency Immigrant Education Program. 
   In addition, States may transfer funds into, but not away from, title I funding for disadvantaged students. So they would 
   have the ability to take funds from these other programs and move them into title I for the benefit of disadvantaged students, but not the other way around. 
   It would not be only money flowing into the title I but would provide greater flexibility for the local school district to move money between programs--transferability. States may transfer all of the program funds for which they have authority, except for the administrative funds. Local school districts may transfer up to 35 percent of the funds they receive without obtaining State permission, and all other funds under these programs, if their State approves. 
   So this would provide for all of those States that are not fortunate enough to be included in the Straight A's Program, which the Presiding Officer has authored and expended so much energy and resources in promoting, but we still know that we have only 15 States in the underlying bill that are going to be able to participate in that program. So for those States not fortunate to be in the Straight A's Program, this would give them the ability to have some increased flexibility in devoting funds to arising needs in their schools. Local school boards know that needs often change from year to year. This gives them the authority to flexibly use their Federal funds to address those changing needs. As we all know, these local school boards are elected by the people just as we are in the Senate. I trust them to know the specific needs of their schools from year to year. 
   I believe that the debate for now more than a week has been very illuminating to the American people. The course of the debate has moved us a long way toward reaching, if not consensus, at least a strong majority of this body recognizes what we sought to do in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in producing the Educational Opportunities Act, which is supported by the American people and what we need to do--greater flexibility, greater local control, more child centered in our effort, high-performance expectations, a determination to see the achievement gap close between advantaged and disadvantaged students. And while initially we heard many on the other side simply defend the status quo in very plain terms, saying that we had to stick with the tried, true, and tested programs that have ``worked so well'' during the past 35 years, though with the expenditure of $120 billion, we cannot show that the achievement gap is closed. 
   I believe the debate has moved a long way, and I look forward to seeing the opportunity to pass the Educational Opportunities Act, including the Straight A's provision.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Educational Opportunities Act, there are fundamental fault lines and differences between the Democrats and the Republicans on this very critical and very important issue for this country and for our children. 
   I noticed when Senator WELLSTONE spoke that he said the Republicans just keep saying change, change, change. I plead guilty to that. We are saying change. That is one of the very clear lines in this debate between those who are defending the status quo--defending the old system, defending the old model, who are saying create more programs, who are saying pour more money into the old programs and the same models--and those of us who say, yes, let's fund education adequately. Yes, let's increase our appropriations for education. But let's make certain that we are using that money efficiently and effectively. If the old model isn't working, it is time that we try something new. 
   That is the fundamental fault line in the debate that has gone on in the Senate for the last week and will continue for the next few days. 
   I have to say that I believe there has been a lot of misinformation about the Educational Opportunities Act that has been put forth on the floor of the Senate. I understand that change is difficult and change is discomforting. There are those who are going to recoil at the thought that we might try something different. But there have been, in the arguments put forward by the other side, several themes that have recurred. 
   They said title I has enhanced academic achievement. That has been one of the things they have argued consistently. 
   They said the status quo somehow guarantees student achievement. 
   They said parental control is something to be feared. 
   They said the contents of the Educational Opportunities Act contain no accountability safeguards. 
   I would like to, in their own words, go through those arguments and rebut them one by one in the few minutes that I have on the floor. 
   First of all, Senator KENNEDY made, I think, one of the clear statements last week when he said, ``We want to support tried and tested programs that have worked.'' 
   The question that I have raised over and over again is, How has title I worked? How has title I been so successful that we want to continue it as it has been, and as Senator KENNEDY suggests we should continue it? 
   After 35 years and $120 billion has been expended, we have seen no closing of the achievement gap. 
   The original purpose of title I was that we would see those disadvantaged students improve, we would see their academic performance elevated, and we would see the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged closed. After 35 years, any objective assessment of what we have done would have to say we have failed. 
   That is why it is so amazing to me to hear my colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle stand and say: We want to support tried and tested programs that have worked. 
   If they had worked, this debate wouldn't be going on. We would be delighted to be supporting the status quo. But the 
   status quo has failed America's children. 
   Instead of letting States have flexibility under  Straight A's, requiring improvements in student achievement, the Democrats would rather leave disadvantaged children the same programs they have had for the last 35 years. 
   Senator KENNEDY speaks movingly, and I know sincerely, about the homeless, the migrant children, and the immigrant children, saying that they are the ones who are going to be hurt most under the Educational Opportunities Act--the homeless, the migrants, and the immigrant children are the big losers. 
   I would suggest just the opposite is the case; that they have been the big losers in a system that continues to fund a broken system, a broken program; that for the first time under Straight A's we will require test scores to be disaggregated and broken down on the basis of those who are disadvantaged and those who are advantaged based upon their backgrounds and economic backgrounds so that we will be able to see clearly whether or not the educational curriculum, the textbooks, and the programs being utilized in a local school district are working for the least advantaged and the most vulnerable in our society. These homeless children, migrants, and immigrant children, to whom all of our hearts go out, are the ones who have been left behind under the status quo. 
   Of course, Senator KENNEDY said, ``We want to support tried and tested programs that have worked,'' even though 35 years of these programs has demonstrated they have not worked. 
   He said that block grants--he always likes to use that loaded term, ``block grants''--have no accountability. 
   And then he uses the term ``blank check.'' This is a ``blank check.'' 
   I suggest that trying to compare the Educational Opportunities Act with any of the old block grant experiments of the past is as if to compare apples and oranges. It is a total mismatch. It is an unfair comparison. 
   These are exactly and precisely, word for word, the same arguments we heard against welfare reform. Welfare reform was block grants with no accountability. Welfare reform was a blank check to the Governors: You can't trust the Governors--the same rhetoric that we heard for the last week. 
   If you compare block grants, the Educational Opportunities Act has more accountability than any of the existing title I programs or any of the existing Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs because we require the testing. We require the States to say what they are going to do and how they are going to do it and then demonstrate that they, in fact, have done it. That is what has been lacking under the existing program. 
   As Senator KENNEDY said, ``We are not prepared, with the scarce resources here, to try to turn that over to the Governors one more time and expect they are going to do the job. No.'' 
   I can't reach his volume level when he said, ``No.'' 
   But he said, ``We are going to insist that there will be incentives and disincentives for performance. That is what we do.'' 
   Throughout this debate we have heard, ``We don't trust the Governors. You can't trust the Governors.'' 
   I remind my distinguished colleagues that the same people who elected us to the Senate elected those Governors to serve the same people. They are every bit as accountable to their constituents as we are accountable to our constituents. Yet it 
   has been a recurring theme: Do not trust the State; Do not trust the Governors; They won't have the most vulnerable in their States in their concerns and in the programs that they put forward. 
   I reject that. Then he said, ``We are going to downsize.'' He said, ``We are going to insist that there will be incentives and disincentives for performance.'' 
   Where in the Democratic proposal are there incentives and disincentives? Their proposals are for new teachers and for school construction and contain no requirements that student achievement must increase--none. 
   If we want to talk about incentives for performance, and if we want to talk about disincentives, look at what the Republicans have proposed in our Straight A's plan and in our performance contracts and agreements because in that you find real requirements concerning student achievements and student elevation in academic performance. 
   Then Senator KENNEDY said, ``Under Straight A's, the State could demonstrate statewide overall progress based on progress being made by wealthier communities, while a lack of progress in disadvantaged communities remains statistically hidden.'' 
   The irony of that criticism of the Republican bill is that is what can happen under the current system where the performance of the disadvantaged is hidden by aggregating the scores and concealing those who are supposed to be targeted--those children we are supposed to be helping the most--concealing those in the overall scores. 
   I think this is a very misleading charge against the Republican proposal. 
   Straight A's requires each participating State and local school to report data by each major racial and ethnic group, gender, English proficiency, status, migrant status, and by economically disadvantaged student as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged. 
   That language in our bill prevents what Senator KENNEDY expressed from ever taking place. In fact, we are going to know much more about whether we are really helping the disadvantaged under the Straight A's proposal. 
   Then Senator KENNEDY said this last week: ``We are still finding out that of the more than 50,000 teachers who were hired this past year, the majority of those serving in high-poverty areas are not fully qualified.'' 
   I will accept Senator KENNEDY's statement as being accurate. But it raises in my mind this question: Why then are Democrats proposing their Class Size Reduction Program if in fact it has led to the hiring of unqualified teachers? 
   The evidence is that as much as we would all like to see school class sizes reduced, and while that is a desirable goal, one of the unintended consequences in Class Size Reduction Programs around the Nation has been that it has resulted in unqualified teachers filling slots that have been opened up, and those who have been harmed the most are those who are in schools with a high percentage of disadvantaged students. 
   That is the tragedy of it. That is acknowledged by Senator KENNEDY's statement. 
   He has repeatedly said only 7 percent of the funds come from the Federal Government. Then he suggests, because it is a relatively small portion of the local school districts' funding base and their budget, we cannot expect whatever we do up here will have too much of an impact upon local school policy. 
   If, in fact, our influence over local schools and the States were proportionate to our funding about 7 percent, I would not be too concerned, either. The reality is, though, we provide only 7 percent of the funding; we provide a much higher level of the mandates under which the local schools are laboring. It has been estimated we provide 50 percent of the paperwork that is required of the local schoolteachers for the 7 percent of funding. 
   To diminish the importance of the debate because it is only 7 percent of the funding misses the point. The State of Florida takes six times as many personnel to implement a Federal education dollar as it takes to implement a State education dollar. I suspect that figure is typical across the Nation. 
   Senator MURRAY made this statement regarding the Abraham teacher testing and merit pay amendment:  
   It requires testing, and there is no money. That money will have to come from somewhere in the districts. The districts will not have the money, and likely they will require the teachers themselves to pay for it. That has been the practice in the past.  
   First, the Abraham amendment only made teacher testing and merit pay an option. They are in no way required to implement it. 
   Speaking of unfunded mandates on the districts, what about the class size reduction mandate? What happens at the end of that program? I have raised that concern. When the authorization for the Class Size Reduction Program ends, don't the schools then have to pick up the tab for a program that they did not start? 
   Senator DODD made this comment last week about the Abraham teacher testing merit pay amendment which added teacher testing and merit pay to the list of optional uses of funds. Senator DODD said:  
   What works best is a decision that ought to be left to the local communities. For the Senate to go on record to decide what will work best in the 50 States is in direct contradiction to the arguments I hear being made in support of the underlying bill, and that is: We do not know what we are doing here; we ought to leave this up to the local governments. Now we are going to decide, apparently, that teachers ought to get a pay increase rather than leaving that decision to the local level. It seems they have it backwards. Those decisions are best left at the local level.  
   It takes my breath away. Amazing. Since the Democrats' proposal for teachers mandates separate funding streams, they mandate separate funding streams for professional development, alternative certification, teacher  recruitment, and mentoring, separate funding for all of those, school districts must do each of these or they don't get any of their funding. Our proposal only adds teacher testing and merit pay to a list of allowable uses of funds. It is absolutely consistent with our belief in local control. It is an option. If we ought to leave this up to the local government, as Senator DODD says, then why does the 
   Democratic proposal provide repeated mandates on how to spend the money? 
   Senator KENNEDY also said in the debate last week in his continual theme that the Republican bill lacks accountability:  
   We asked our good friends on the other side how their bill is going to solve the issue of accountability. They cannot do it. We have been challenging them since the beginning of the debate. They cannot do it. We can.  
   I remind my colleagues of the one single example I left before the Senate that I think is illustrative of the problem and the current system and lack of accountability in the current system: Holly Grove. Or think in your mind's eye of the pictures of treadmills, Nautilus equipment, StairMasters, and $239,000 in a Federal grant that could not be spent for computers, for textbooks, for renovating a falling down building, a dilapidated school building, could not be spent in those ways, but could be spent on expensive exercise equipment when what was needed was improving the school facility. 
   Senator KENNEDY would dare to say that the current system provides accountability. I suggest when we tell the Governors they have to sign a contract with the Federal Department of Education to state what they are going to do, how they are going to do it, how they will accomplish it, when they will achieve it, require testing the students, require breaking down the test scores and show how every subgroup is performing and whether, in fact, the gap is being closed, I suggest that is far greater accountability than the current system of categorical agreements that can be misused and used in inappropriate ways. 
   Senator KENNEDY said last week:  
   I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to spare us a lot of discussion about local control and parental involvement because it just isn't there, it just isn't there.  
   We are not going to spare you; we are going to continue to talk about local control. We will continue to talk about parental involvement. That is the key to education in the country and the key to making significant and meaningful education reforms. 
   When Senator KENNEDY says it just isn't there, first of all, there have been a number of speakers, and I will allude to their statements later, who acknowledged parental control is at the core of the Republican bill. Aside from that, I simply point out two things. The portability provisions provide the ultimate in parental control. If parents are unhappy with the services the school is providing their child with Federal money, they can use that Federal money to improve their child's education in the way they best see fit. That is very consistent with parental control. 
   I also point out the provisional public school choice where a failing school that has been deemed failing, failing and failing, given years of opportunity to improve and they still don't improve, there is an exit, a way out. No disadvantaged child ought to be locked to a failing school and consigned forever throughout their educational experience to a school that is failing them. They shouldn't be required to do that. We show them a way out. 
   I quote Senator MURRAY from last week:  
   I am looking at language of the bill. It says ..... that a parent directs that the services be provided through a tutorial assistance provider. It is not directed by the school but is directed by the parent. I think that is one of the underlying flaws and concerns that we have ..... frankly, the parent is in control.  
   I wish I had another chart showing Senator KENNEDY saying that the parental involvement is not there. Senator MURRAY said, ``..... frankly, the parent is in control,'' under the Republican plan. 
   Senator MURRAY is right. That is not bad. That is not something to fear, the fact that we increase parental involvement. Since when did parental control become a bad thing? It is part of the problem, that parents have too few choices when their child is forced to remain in a failing school. 
   I have heard repeatedly, and I am paraphrasing, but this has been the message from the other side: We don't trust the Governors; we don't trust the local educators; we don't trust the parents. We just trust ourselves. We can make the decisions. We are the 100 Members of Senate, the super school board for America. Let us make the decisions; let us prescribe the formulas. 
   That is what we have done for 35 years. If we want to stick with that formula, that failed formula, then the status quo is the way to go on and the Democratic counterproposal is the way to go. I think America says no. Our children deserve better, American families deserve better, and we can do better by American education under the Educational Opportunities Act. 
   I commend Senator REID last week with one last quote from the other side of the aisle. Senator REID, the assistant minority leader, said:  
   One of the things I have tried to do following the direction of the minority leader, in consultation with the majority leader, is to keep this debate on this education bill on education. We have worked very hard to keep other matters off this bill, Patient's Bill of Rights, prescription drug and minimum wage.  
   I commend Senator REID. I think that is the right approach. I am pleased we went through the first week of this debate without having extraneous amendments, nongermane amendments. I hope that will continue to be the case as we go through this second week of the most important debate we will have in the Senate during this Congress. 
   Rather than kill the pending education bill by offering irrelevant amendments, I ask my colleagues to complete the work we have been so successful debating for the past week. We have the chance to help millions of American students overcome illiteracy, to cite U.S. history, to master basic mathematical skills. Let's do our jobs and not fail these kids. Let's not put politics above American education and student achievement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the debate over the days and the hours of this week. It has been particularly interesting to me to listen to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have, in glowing terms, defended the status quo and have spoken in very rosy descriptions of the status of American education. 
   I will not recite once again all the very gloomy statistics and the very real statistics and the very undeniable reality of where we stand in American education and how we compare internationally with our competing young people around the world. 
   I believe one statement from the Vice President of the United States, AL GORE. His plans for education basically say enough about the status of American education. Vice President Gore, in unveiling his education plans, said:  
   I am proposing a major national investment to bring revolutionary improvements to our schools. I am proposing a national revolution in education.  
   Now, the question I ask is, If you have to propose a ``revolution'' in education, does that not imply that there is a problem? If the status quo is as good as the Democratic side has said during the debate this week, then why is it necessary to say we are going to have a revolution in education? 
   The reality is that it is not good. The picture is not good, and that ``a nation in crisis,'' as it was called a few years ago, is still the truth when you look at American education, and a defense of the status quo is not satisfactory. The American people deserve more and deserve better. 
   Now, what we have from time to time are fads in education. We have the fad of the day or the fad of the year. That is what we are facing right now with the whole idea of class size reduction. Let me clarify. I think class size reduction is a wonderful thing. I think if teachers have fewer papers to grade and smaller classes, they have a lot of  advantages. My sister is a fourth grade teacher. I know she would love fewer students at times in that classroom. But I want to challenge the basic premise of what the Senator from Washington laid out before us in this amendment. I don't question her sentiment, her goals, her objectives, or her sincerity. But I think the research that is out there is far less conclusive than what we have been led to believe. 
   Class-size reduction is not the magic elixir that its proponents would like us to believe. The fact is pupil-teacher ratios have been shrinking for half a century in this country. 
   In 1955, pupil-teacher ratios in public elementary and secondary schools were: Elementary, 30.2; secondary, 20.9 to 1 respectively. 
   In 1998, they were 18.9 in elementary, and 14.6 in secondary. 
   That is a dramatic drop in the size of classes in this country. 
   Yet the fact is test scores went down for many years, and have leveled over to some extent. But they have leveled off at an absolutely unacceptable level. 
   Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester has been one of the outstanding scholars in looking at the effects of class-size reduction. He concluded--and I think we should conclude that:  
   A wave of enthusiasm for reducing class size is sweeping across the country. This move appears misguided. Existing evidence indicates that achievement for the typical student will be unaffected by instituting the types of class size reductions that have been recently proposed or undertaken. The most noticeable feature of policies to reduce overall class sizes will be a dramatic increase in the costs of schooling, an increase unaccompanied by achievement gains.  
   That is the sad reality. 
   Between 1950 and 1995, pupil-teacher ratios fell by a dramatic 35 percent. 
   We are trying to cure a problem with this amendment. That is being cured already in the States. 
   We have seen a dramatic 35-percent decrease. While we don't have all of the information for the last 50 years that we would like to have on student achievement, we have enough to conclude that the performance has been at best stagnant. 
   According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, our 17-year-olds are performing roughly the same in 1996 as they did in 1970. While we have seen this dramatic drop in class size, we continue to see a stagnant student performance. 
   The article ``The Elixir of Class Size'' concludes:  
   There's no credible evidence that across-the-board reductions in class size boost pupil achievement. On this central point, the conventional wisdom is simply wrong.  
   Look at the Asian nations today that trounce us on international assessments. Those Asian countries have, on average, vastly larger classes with many times 40 and 50 youngsters per teacher. Yet in every evaluation, they are leading us on international comparisons of scores. 
   If lowering class size were the elixir that its proponents claim, we would be seeing a dramatic increase. We would be seeing an improvement in these academic scores. 
   If this were health care, and if this were a new tonic being brought before the Food and Drug Administration, I assure you additional experiments would be warranted; additional experiments would be required. But no scientist would say that efficacy has been proven. It simply has not. 
   There is a simple reason why smaller classes rarely learn more than big classes. Their teachers don't really do anything much different. The same lessons, textbooks, and instructional methods are typically employed, whether the class size is in the teens or whether the class size is 25. It is just that the teacher has fewer papers to grade and fewer parents with whom to confer, but getting any real achievement bounce from class shrinking hinges on teachers who know their stuff and use proven methods of instruction. 
   Of course, knowledgeable and highly effective teachers would also fare well with classes of 30 or 35. Jaime Escalante, renowned worldwide as the ``best teacher in America,'' packs his classroom every year with 30-plus ``disadvantaged'' teenagers and consistently produces scholars who pass the tough advanced placement calculus exam. But such teaching is not the norm in U.S. schools, and adding more teachers to the rolls won't cause it to be. 
   Much of the current enthusiasm for reduction in class size is supported by references to the experimental program in the State of Tennessee that Senator MURRAY made reference to in her comments. The common reference to this program, Project STAR, is an assertion that the positive results there justify a variety of overall reductions in class size. 
   By the way, this report is cited so frequently because there are so few studies on the academic impacts of smaller classes. 
   The study is conceptually simple, even if some questions about its actual implementation remain. Students in the STAR experiment were randomly assigned to small classes of 13 to 17 students, or large classes of 21 to 25 students with or without aides. They were kept in these small or large classes from 
   kindergarten through third grade. Their achievement was measured at the end of each year. 
   If smaller classes were valuable in each grade, the achievement gap would widen. But that was not the fact in the STAR study. In fact, the gap remains essentially unchanged through the sixth grade. 
   While there may be some evidence that in kindergarten the smaller class sizes improved academic performance, as you go through grades 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged students did not narrow. It remained the same. 
   Apart from all of that, I think we should be concerned about the Murray amendment because of the unintended consequences. I know what Senator MURRAY wants to accomplish. She wants to see improved schooling. She wants to see improved academic performance. She believes smaller classes will inevitably result in that, and that her amendment will achieve that. 
   So often is the case as we pass amendments for legislation in the Senate that they end up being consequences that we never imagined. 
   I want to share with you four of them which I believe will occur if the Murray amendment is adopted. 
   Teachers will leave the worst schools in the State to fill the newly created affluent slots. 
   That is what happened in many States where they have implemented these kind of programs. 
   There will be the unintended consequence of exacerbating the problem of less-qualified teachers being hired. 
   In California, Governor Wilson shrank California's primary classes. What happened was the veteran teachers fled the inner-city schools in droves lured by the higher paid, cushier working conditions of suburban systems that suddenly had openings. This exodus forced city schools to hire less qualified teachers, threatening the one ingredient that researchers agree is the most important to good education-- teacher quality. In fact, in California they sacrificed teacher quality in hiring more teachers, and the schools that were hurt the most were those with disadvantaged students. 
   The West Education Policy Brief is the regional education lab for Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. This is what they said about class-size reduction. This is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.  
   A fundamental condition for the success of the Class Size Reduction is good teaching. Class size reduction can exacerbate teaching shortages and lead to the hiring of unqualified teachers. In California, for example, since the implementation of the state's class size reduction program, the percentage of teachers without full credentials has jumped from 1% to over 12%, while the proportion of teachers with three or fewer years of experience rose by 9% and the proportion of teachers who had the least education, a bachelor's or no degree, increased by nearly 6% statewide.  
   Those are unintended consequence. 
   A second unintended consequence is driving us, if we adopt such an amendment, toward nationalizing education. 
   I didn't want to interrupt Senator MURRAY when she was making her presentation. But what I wanted to ask is, What does she anticipate happening when this authorization expires? 
   I am not sure whether it is 5 years or 7 years. Originally it was a 7-year proposal. At some point the authorization ended. Does the Senator anticipate the Federal Government will reauthorize and make this a permanent entitlement that the Federal Government will be funding teachers at the local level?  Or does Senator MURRAY anticipate that the States, the local governments, and the local school districts will be required to pick up the tab for the teachers hired during this 7-year authorization? It is one or the other. We will continue to fund them or they have to pick up the tab. 
   We had an experiment in the COPS Program, which has done a lot of good, by the way. When we funded the 100,000 policemen on the street, we funded it from Washington, DC. The State police and local law enforcement were calling me saying the money had run out on the COPS Program, the Government had to fund it again. We can't pay for the policemen we hired under the COPS Program. 
   My friends, that is exactly what will happen on the Federal teaching program. When the authorization ends, when the spending ends, somebody has to pick up the tab or we will exacerbate the condition we have now in the schools. I think this is an unintended consequence and a very serious consequence. 
   I have a serious problem with the idea of handing this over to the U.S. Department of Education. I see Senator KENNEDY on the floor. I am not among those who want to eliminate the Department of Education. I believe we are going to talk about accountability, making certain the Department of Education is accountable. 
   The most recent 1999 audit of the Department of Education showed the following: The Department's financial stewardship remains in the bottom quarter of all major Federal agencies. The Department sent duplicate payments to 52 schools in 1999 at a cost of more than $6.5 million. None of the material weaknesses cited in the 1998 audit had been corrected in the 1999 audit. Yet we want to turn over to the Department of Education the hiring of thousands of teachers? That ought to be done and funded at the local level. 
   A 1,150-student district in East Helena, MT, hired 2 teachers with the $33,000 Federal grant. The educators make about $16,000. The superintendent said: We have tremendous fear about whether this is going to be funded on an annual basis. But we have learned if you don't take advantage of whatever is available at the time, somebody else gets those dollars. 
   That is the attitude we are promoting. I don't blame that superintendent for wondering what will happen. Will the Federal Government pick this up as an entitlement or will they have to pick up the tab? What will be the long-term and the unintended consequences of such a program? 
   Bringing 100,000 teachers onto direct Federal support creates another permanent program of virtual entitlement. We are going to create a permanent entitlement if we go down this route. 
   The third unintended consequence in passing this amendment is moving education away from flexibility toward rigidity. I know Senator MURRAY insisted this preserves flexibility at the local level and local decisionmaking. We heard a lot of anecdotes in Senator MURRAY's presentation, and I will relate an anecdote heard this week. 
   An anonymous principal--I don't want to get her in trouble with the Department of Education or title I police, but she encouraged me to share this--is working on her Ph.D. She is very bright. She made a grant application with the Department of Education. Her title I supervisor suggested it be changed, and the title I supervisor wrote the application to apply for the classroom reduction program. And, as Senator MURRAY suggested, it was quickly approved. So much for local flexibility. 
   The title I supervisor said: You must take this teacher you have hired and move that teacher from one class to another class to another class to another class--90 minutes in each classroom with about 24 students in each classroom. The teacher who was hired would go into the classroom for 90 minutes. They would divide the class of 24 into 2 classes of 12. The new hire was supposed to keep separate grade books, separate grade reports. Every 90 minutes, they moved on to the next class. 
   The principal said to the title I supervisor: That is not what I need. We have 24 students, which is not a problem for us. Our teachers would prefer to do remediation: Rather than postponing remediation until summer school, have that teacher they hired do the remediation at the point of time the problem developed. The title I supervisor said: You can't do that. We will audit you. You will be turned in and lose your funding and lose that teacher. 
   That is not flexibility. That is the typical kind of prescriptive rigidity you expect from any kind of Federal education program. That is the unintended consequence. We move exactly away from what we intend to do with this legislation, which is to provide greater flexibility. 
   The fourth unintended consequence is to increase the inequality between rich and poor school districts. I will return to the example of California. A one-size-fits-all allotment per student, from the WestEd Policy Brief of January 2000 and a rigid 20:1 ratio cap on class size led to uneven implementation. Early evaluation findings support the concern that the very students who stand to benefit from class size reduction, poor and minority students, are least likely to have the opportunity to do so. 
   Schools serving high concentrations of low-income, minority English language students learned more slowly due to lack of facilities. They get the teacher and there is no place to put the teacher. Teachers are going into poor school districts with poor facilities. They have the classroom reduction personnel. They hire the teacher and they have no place for the teacher. The schools that need the help the most are those least likely to benefit. That is the WestEd Policy Brief conclusion funded by the U.S. Department of Education. 
   Let me reiterate. It will increase the number of less qualified teachers in the classroom. It will drive us toward a national control of education by creating a permanent entity. It will move education away from flexibility, which ought to be exactly the direction we are moving. It will increase the inequities between the wealthy and the poor school district. 
   Our bill allows true classroom reduction by providing flexibility and allowing funds to flow between programs. In so doing, the school can do what is most needed, whether it is classroom reduction, buying computers, hiring tutors, finishing that building if they need to, or whatever that local need is. If there is an elixir, that is a far better elixir than the illusionary classroom reduction magic potion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator JEFFORDS. 
   I say to Senator KENNEDY that I never shared the enthusiasm that some did. But, fortunately, there is a better way for class size reduction. It is in this underlying bill. 
   Earlier in my remarks, I made a reference to an example in Arkansas in which a class size reduction grant was given. The title I supervisor said to the principal that against her wishes the hired teacher would have to be rotated among classes for 90 minutes in each class, even though the principal thought that was not the best use. She wanted to use that person for a point of time for remediation to help these who needed remediation in their school work. 
   After I spoke, Senator MURRAY and Senator HARKIN both said that it sounded to them as if my beef was with local control. I simply want to clarify that my beef is not with local control. My beef is title I police. My beef is with a rigid, inflexible Federal program that overrules what is best for the children so as to comply with the prescriptions of the Federal U.S. Department of Education. 
   That is why we have a better way. 
   I want to clarify for Senator MURRAY and Senator HARKIN. It was not the principal's decision, not the superintendent's decision, not the classroom teacher's decision. It was the decision of the title I supervisor in what she said was compliance with the Class Size Reduction Program. My beef is not with local control. My beef is with the program that has that kind of rigidity built into it. 
   I thank the chairman for yielding me 2 minutes of the remaining time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Minnesota, for his gracious comity, his willingness to afford me this opportunity on the very limited schedule. We are all fighting the schedule. I appreciate that very much. 
   I thank Senator COVERDELL for his continued management of this legislation. 
   I have spoken several times on the Educational Opportunities Act, the legislation that the HELP Committee on which I serve and Senator WELLSTONE serves has brought to the floor of the Senate. I will take a few moments to respond to the substitute proposal that has been offered by the Democrats under the leadership of Senator KENNEDY. 
   Senator KENNEDY stressed that what he is offering is a break from the status quo. He is trying to distance himself from this inevitable and unavoidable label that has been attached to the Democratic approach which is, in fact, the defense of the status quo. While you can run from the label of status quo and try to say no, this is not the status quo, you cannot run from your own words. It was Senator KENNEDY who said we have to stick with the tried and the tested. That is clearly an identification and defense of the existing model, the existing strategy, the existing approach we have used in this country for the last 35 years and one that has brought us to the current situation in American education and a situation that no one can, with a straight face, truly defend. 
   It is the status quo in the alternative, the option that has been offered. It speaks on behalf of the Washington-based establishment. It throws more money at a broken system rather than focusing upon children. The strategy is to claim the underlying bill is a blank check. It seems pretty clear this 
   strategy is going to bounce. 
   This substitute amendment before us again presents more of the same programs that have been around for 35  years, a plethora of new programs to try to solve some nationally recognized problems, loads of new bureaucracy and paperwork for teachers and principals. Of the more than 60 programs that are in the substitute amendment--60 programs in the substitute amendment--there is no emphasis upon rewarding States and school districts that do well. There is no emphasis upon sanctioning or punishing those that do poorly. 
   The bottom line is that is more of the same. That is more of the same approach we have had where, if you fill out the forms correctly and you receive the funding and you spend it in the way that is prescribed by Washington, that is the end of so-called accountability. That is a defense of the old way. We are suggesting the real accountability is in whether kids are learning, whether the performance gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged is narrowing. 
   The emphasis in this substitute is on the status quo. I will quote in just a moment from an April 13 editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal regarding AL GORE's education agenda because I think it is reflected in this substitute.  
   So what's left in the Gore teaching plan? Hire more teachers. Smaller class sizes (hire more teachers). Pay more teachers more. Sounds like a textbook definition of more of the same ..... One of Democratic liberalism's underlying, decades-old premises of using highly controlled federal funds is that Washington's moral intentions always trump those of the untrustworthy states. After 40 years this theory is fairly shopworn, but the core of the Democratic Party will never let go of it.  
   This substitute is clinging to the shopworn formula of the last 35 years. The idea that Washington's moral intentions trump those of the untrustworthy States is being rejected on this floor and rejected in this country. Democrats keep mentioning that we need to continue our current commitments. This amendment not only will continue to support the status quo, it will continue to add on to the piles of programs created at the Federal level and the piles of paperwork that we require school districts to fill out. That is not the way to help students. 
   Yesterday, Senator HARKIN, very dramatically--I was watching it--held up a four-page application for class size reduction funds. He emphasized the point that all of this stuff about paperwork from Washington was blown out of proportion, there was nothing all that burdensome, nothing that onerous being placed upon local school administrators because it was only a four-page grant application on the class size reduction from one of his districts there in Iowa. 
   That might have been what was in the original application. But complying with Federal requirements usually imposes a much larger burden. Lisa Graham Keegan, Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Arizona, recently talked about the paperwork burden that Federal programs impose on her State:  
   Their end (meaning the grant application sent by the Federal Government) may be five pages--  
   That is Washington's end--  
   but ours certainly isn't. We have to send in a hideous amount of justification. Plus they ask for ``assurances'' that we will align our state laws, policies, procedures, (thoughts, actions, desires ..... ) to the federal program. Home loan applications also start out as one to two pages ..... by the time you are done with justifications, you have killed a forest. Same with federal applications.  
   That is the point. So Senator HARKIN may hold up a four-page application. This is the 110-page end result of what the States have to do. This is the 1999 IASA Program Data Checklist. There is, in fact, 110 pages in the application. That is much more typical of what ends up having to come back to Washington. 
   In her home State of Arizona, 45 percent of the staff of her State education department is responsible for managing Federal programs that account for 6 percent of the State's education program. As I pointed out the other day, in Florida, it takes six times as many people to administer Federal education dollars as State dollars--six times as many. So something is wrong. 
   What the substitute before us would do is create more programs, more paperwork, and reinforce more of the same without any of the focus upon children's academic performance and narrowing the gap that is the focus of the underlying bill. 
   I know most Members of the Senate want to do what is right for children. I ask them to consider where the focus really is in this substitute. If every school district in Arkansas--there are over 300 of them--applied for this one grant, the result would be over 30,000 pages of paperwork for those 300 school districts, for just one grant. 
   I know of two teachers in my home State of Arkansas who had to take 1 week out of the classroom to apply for a Federal grant. It is not easy for many small districts in Arkansas to find a person knowledgeable in the intricacies of the Federal grant process to locate funding that originally came out of their own pocketbooks, and there are no requirements in the substitute amendment for improvements in student achievement--no requirements. Instead, they are funding systems, not students, as we have done for 35 years. If we are to change the course of education in this country, it is time to realize that funding must support each and every child, not each and every program. 
   Senator DASCHLE charged that the underlying bill would replace federal targeting of funds and hand it over to the states to set their own performance criteria. I think this ``blank check'' strategy breeds contradiction. I am reminded of past bills that are now law where we voted to do just what the underlying bill requires. Let me give an example. 
   In August, 1998, the Senate HELP Committee--at that time it was the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee--passed and sent to the floor the Workforce Investment Act--a bipartisan job training bill. Like our existing education system, the nation's job training programs were top-down, Washington-controlled and funded programs infested with bureaucratic redtape. The WIA gutted the longstanding 1982 Job Training and Partnership Act, JTPA, and handed over years of federally controlled, prescriptive requirements to the states and localities. The States were given the green light by us to create their own plans to administer their own job training--teaching people the skills they need to make a living right on the local level. 
   I did not hear folks make the claims that this was a ``blank check'' 2 years ago. Where were they then? How can we have a bipartisan bill that overwhelmingly passed the Senate and handed the bulk of discretion over to States and local boards for teaching people job skills, but we cannot even think of doing the same for education. I will tell you why. It is because the Washington establishment for job training does not have Congress in a head-lock like the education establishment does. That is why. 
   Theold adage, ``you can't teach an old dog new tricks'' sure has meaning when the Washington establishment weighs in. Sure enough, creativity and innovative means to education get chucked out the window. I will not allow such unfounded charges that mischaracterize the underlying bill to go unchallenged. 
   There can be a legitimate debate, and should be, but my constituents overwhelmingly believe local control and local flexibility is a better course for American education. 
   I am very pleased with the underlying legislation with which the Presiding Officer had so much to do in the drafting, and Chairman JEFFORDS showed such leadership in the committee. It is a bill on which we can stand with pride. I do not want to trade in or exchange the future for the past. That is what this debate is coming down to. 
   The substitute that is being offered is a return to the past. The underlying bill takes us in a new direction and pioneers new opportunities for American children. The vote on this substitute will be: Do my colleagues want to turn back to the past or do they want to go a new route or new direction for American education--a plethora of new programs or a new way? That is the question before us. 
   I look forward, as we continue this debate, for the Senate, following the lead of the American people, to say enough is enough; let's chart a new path; let's put trust in those laboratories of democracy in the States that have done such a marvelous job on welfare; let's give them the same opportunities in education. We will look back,  as we look back on welfare, in a few years and say we did right by the American people and, more importantly, the children of this country. 
   I again thank Senator WELLSTONE for his willingness to allow me to precede him. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I commend Senator SESSIONS from Alabama. The Senator from Alabama has been a strong voice for change on the HELP Committee. He has been a very influential member in the writing and offering of this legislation, as has the Senator from Washington, who has been one of the outstanding leaders in this Nation. He returns periodically from our recesses and reports on his visits to the schools in Washington State. He made a conscientious effort to gain the input of local educators, the ones to whom we ought to be listening. I commend his great efforts in this debate. 
   This is an important debate. As I said yesterday, I believe this is the most important issue and the most important debate the Senate will have in this Congress. It is important, as Senator GREGG said, for us to have this debate on the substantive issues. There are very real, philosophical issues as to what should be the Federal role in education. It is that philosophical difference that should be debated. I am afraid, as I listened to the other side yesterday during their speeches, that what I saw was a straw man being erected and knocked down. That is a very common practice in debate but not very illuminating when it comes to what ought to be the public policy of the United States regarding our public schools. 
   During the 35 years of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Washington made its imprint very deeply; it engraved it into the status quo. The ``status quo,'' that is what Ronald Reagan used to say is Latin for ``the mess we are in.'' If you look at the statistics and studies and reports, you cannot help but conclude that American education is a mess today. 
   American 12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrialized 
   nations in mathematics. Only Cyprus and South Africa fared worse. You can take a whole smorgasbord of studies and facts and statistics to indicate the status quo is not sufficient. 
   The Democratic side, the other side in this debate, has clearly aligned themselves with the status quo. They said it explicitly. They said it forthrightly. They said it candidly. Senator KENNEDY, who is always very articulate and succinct in the way he expresses himself, said we should stick with the tried and the tested. That is an honorable position to take. It is a position we deserve to debate on the floor of the Senate, not misrepresenting or mischaracterizing the bill the committee has presented. 
   If you want to preserve the status quo, if you want to stay with the tried and the tested, then clearly the bill the HELP Committee has produced is not the bill for you. This is a bill that takes a dramatically new approach. It is a bill that says the past may have been tried and tested, but it is also a past that has clearly been flawed. While American 12th graders have been ranked 19th and 21st among industrialized nations in mathematics since 1993, 10 million American kids reach 12th grade without having learned to read at the basic level. 
   Senator GREGG said it very well: That is the problem in American education today. We have young people who are reaching 12th grade, preparing to graduate from high school, who cannot read and write. It is not sufficient. It is irresponsible, and it is reprehensible for this Senate to defend that kind of status quo. 
   Twenty million high school seniors cannot do basic math, and 25 million are illiterate in American history. That should embarrass us as Americans. It certainly ought to embarrass us as U.S. Senators. 
   What about middle school test scores? Two-thirds of American eighth graders are still performing below the proficiency level in reading. But it is not only high school and middle school students being shortchanged by our Washington cubical-based system; over three-quarters of fourth grade children in urban high-poverty schools are reading below basic on the National Assessment of Education Progress. Those kids, in particular, are the ones title I was intended to help most. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it originated 35 years ago, was created to help those disadvantaged children who were from distressed urban schools. Yet it is these very children, three-quarters of whom are in the fourth grade, who are reading below the basic level. Those are the children we are failing, those we had promised we were going to help when we established the ESEA 35 years ago. 
   Last year--and I think this will demonstrate the tragic failure of America today--when the Children's Scholarship Foundation, a private scholarship fund--no public dollars, no Federal dollars, no ESEA dollars; private dollars, a private scholarship fund--offered 40,000 scholarships for tuition, 1.25 million applications were received. Even though families were required to make a matching contribution from their own pockets of $1,000, 1.25 million applications were received for 40,000 scholarships from the Children's Scholarship Foundation. 
   Does that not tell us that the status quo has tragically failed American families and American children? In urban districts, the Children's Scholarship Foundation demand was high. A staggering 44 percent of eligible parents in Baltimore applied; 33 percent of the parents in Washington, DC, applied 
   for these scholarships. In the poorest communities, parents simply are not satisfied with their schools. 
   So I say to my colleagues, one could make the argument our country's education system is in a state of emergency, and you would have compelling data to back up that claim. Clearly, the ``tried and tested programs'' are flat busted. They even say that expanding Washington control would fix the multitude of programs. That is nothing more than robbing our kids of their future. 
   I mentioned yesterday that the President a year ago, as quoted in the New York Times, said he wanted Washington to have more control over education. I will say again, we have too much Washington control. Just last week, back in the State of Arkansas during our recess, I visited an elementary school in North Little Rock. I spoke to a very, very impressive class of fourth graders. I had been invited to come and talk to them about government. They were seated around. For 45 minutes we did a give-and-take. They asked me questions and I asked them questions. I asked them questions to try to get an idea of where they were in their understanding of American government. It was inspirational. Frankly, they knew more than many civics classes and government classes in high schools that I had visited and to whom I had spoken. 
   The key wasn't any ESEA program. Frankly, it wasn't any title I program. It was that they had a tremendous teacher. I am convinced more and more as I visit schools, the key to good education is good principals and good teachers who are excited about their job and want to communicate facts and information and truth to children. 
   So I went to this school. While I was at the school, after I made my presentation, the principal, who sat through the 45-minute session with the fourth graders, half jokingly--I say, only half jokingly--introduced me to one whom he described as ``his boss.'' He said, ``Meet my boss, the title I coordinator for our schools.'' 
   I thought in that little joking comment there was a real truth that was being communicated. The other side has said that title I is only 7 percent of the local school district's budget, it is only 7 percent of their funds, but I think when a principal says, ``Meet my boss, this is the title I coordinator,'' it says that while it may only be 7 percent, it wields tremendous influence on the decisions made by local educators. It is a revealing comment, indicative of the extent to which our Federal bureaucracy has assumed control of our local schools. While 7 percent of the education dollars come from the Federal Government, I am repeatedly told by educators, half of all the paperwork is done to obtain Federal grants and comply with Federal regulations. 
   Child-based education is the focus of the bill the HELP Committee has produced. The pending legislation before us is based upon children; not systems and bureaucracies, but what is best for the children. Make no mistake about it, we have a bill that is about educating America's children, not keeping a failing, dilapidated system on life support. 
   The bill before us pioneers a new direction for the Federal Government's role in education. It includes four student-focused initiatives, including the  Straight A's program, which we have heard a lot about and which I think is the heartbeat of this legislation. It is a 15-State demonstration program. As Senator GREGG said, no State has to do it. No State is compelled to do it. No State is required to get into the Straight A's program. 
   If they want to continue with the calcified system of bureaucracy that we have created over the last 35 years, they can do it, but 15 States will be given the opportunity to exchange the mandates, the regulations, the prescriptive formulas from Washington, DC, for freedom to mingle and merge those funds and use them as they deem most important for those children. The bill before us moves us in that direction. 
   It also has a Teacher Empowerment Act. It has child-centered funding, and it has public school choice, all geared to students, under the premise that no child ought to be chained in a school that has failed year after year. The Department of Education tells us there are literally hundreds of schools that have been adjudged failing schools in which children are trapped. No child ought to be trapped in those schools. 
   I have listened carefully to the bill's opponents who claim our legislation is nothing more than a blank check to the States. Having served in the State legislature in Arkansas and worked with local school boards, I do not subscribe to the notion that Washington is somehow omniscient. It is not. Nor do I subscribe to the notion that the States are incompetent or uncaring. 
   Beyond that, this bill is not a blank check. It requires accountability and student performance measures in exchange for flexibility and discretion by States and local schools. That is something the current system does not have and opponents fail to mention. 
   I say to all my colleagues, when they listen to the eloquent speeches on the other side of the aisle and when they speak about blank checks and lack of accountability, ask yourselves what kind of accountability exists in the current system. I will tell you what accountability means under the current ESEA. It means: Did you fill out the grant application correctly? Did you get the ``i's'' dotted and the ``t's'' crossed? Did you fill it out in the correct manner? 
   The second thing accountability means under the current system is: Did you spend the money in the prescribed way? That is all accountability means. There is no accountability as to whether kids are learning. There is no accountability as to whether academic progress is being attained. In fact, if you fail, the likelihood is we will just fund your failure at a higher level. 
   That is not real accountability. Rather than cubical-based bureaucrats in Washington pulling the funding strings, funding will be allocated directly to the States and based on how well each school's students are performing. 
   Let me illustrate what is happening under the current Washington-based, top-down system. 
   School districts currently receive funds under more than a dozen Federal categorical grant programs. The only accountability for many of these programs lies in how the money is spent, not in improving student achievement. Washington requires schools to spend money on technology, but there are no requirements for what matters most: Are the kids learning? 
   Officials in an elementary school in my home State think that one of their greatest needs is to remediate children early. This is referring to a principal whom I talked with last night and again today in a situation that arose in her elementary school. 
   She thought the greatest need was to begin remediation 
   early, as soon as the deficiency could be identified, rather than waiting until the end of the school year and sending the children to summer school. To achieve this, the principal wanted to implement a concept known as point-in-time remediation, which is designed to help underachieving students before they fall irreversibly behind. 
   This principal needed to hire a new teacher who would spend time each day working in different classrooms throughout the school assisting students who were struggling below grade level. In her desire to do what she believed was best for her children and to utilize this point-in-time remediation, she made an application for a Federal grant. Her title I coordinator rewrote her grant application as a request for funding to hire a teacher to reduce class size, and the application was then approved. 
   She now had an approved grant for class size reduction, which has been one of the hallmarks of what the other side said we needed to be doing: provide 100,000 teachers from the Federal level to reduce class size. That is what this title I coordinator did. She rewrote the principal's application so it would comply with the program that was most likely to get approved--class size reduction. The application was approved. 
   Here is the problem: The school does not have a class size problem. They do have a desire to work with students to keep them from falling behind. Unfortunately, for many of the children of this Arkansas elementary school, under our current one-size-fits-all, overly prescriptive Federal education system, arbitrarily lowering class size is more important than meeting the real needs of children. This principal is faced with the alternative: I either fudge, I cheat, I do not follow the prescription of the grant application and what the grant was given for or I cheat my children whom I care about, for whom I want to do point-in-time remediation. 
   That was the choice this principal was facing. That is the choice our one-size-fits-all approach to education from the Federal level gives educators over and over. 
   The arguments I have heard repeatedly from the other side echo the arguments we heard a few years ago when we sought to reform welfare: block grants, blank checks, cannot trust the States; they are going to hurt people; they are not compassionate. 
   What happened is, nationwide welfare caseloads have fallen in half since we passed welfare reform and gave the States the same kind of latitude that we now would like to give them in regard to education. The sky did not fall. Disaster did not occur. The States did not turn their backs upon the needy. But hope and opportunity and a way up and out was created for millions of Americans who had been trapped in a welfare system that did not do anyone justice. 
   Now we are hearing the same arguments regarding education: You cannot trust the States; they will build swimming pools; it is a blank check; they are not compassionate; they do not care; they are not going to do what is right for the children. 
   I reject that, and I think the American people reject the notion that wisdom flows out of the beltway in Washington, DC. 
   Under the Straight A's Program, States do not receive a blank check. Before a State is even eligible to participate in the optional demonstration program, it must have a rigorous accountability system in place. It must establish specific numeric performance goals for student achievement in every subject and grade in which students are assessed. It must establish specific numeric goals to reduce the achievement gap and to increase student achievement for all children. No more averaging. No more aggregating the test results so as to conceal the failure of the current system. They must establish numeric goals reducing the achievement gap, which is still all too real between the disadvantaged students and those who have more advantages. 
   Under our bill, it must establish an accountability system to ensure schools are held accountable for substantially increasing student performance for all children, regardless of income, race, or ethnicity. That is far from a blank check. That is not the end. 
   Then a State signs a performance contract with the Secretary setting forth the performance goals by which the State's progress will be measured and describing how the State intends to improve achievement for all students and narrow that achievement gap. Unlike current law, Straight A's forces States to measure the progress of all children by requiring States to take into account the progress of students from every school district and school in the State so that no community is left behind. 
   States must make improvements in the proportion of students at proficient and advanced levels of performance from year to year so that no child is left behind.  
   Most importantly, States must include annual numerical goals for improving student achievement for specific groups of children, including disadvantaged students, so that no child is left behind. 
   Right now, title I--I know my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, cares about disadvantaged children--only serves two-thirds of the eligible children. That is a tragedy. That is a disgrace. Under the bill our committee has produced, every title I eligible child will be assured of being served. 
   For the first time, the Federal Government will not make schools fill out paperwork to show us what they are spending their money on, but we will make States show us that every child in every school in every school district is learning. 
   Block grants. I heard Senator KENNEDY say this yesterday, and I think some others on the other side of the aisle also said this: Block grants will surely result in abuses. 
   We are, of course, investigating this, but let me point back to the example of a school building a swimming pool with a block grant. First of all, I do not know if that is accurate, and I do not know if they were violating the law at the time, if it did occur. But beyond that, there is no honest way to compare the block grant experience of the 1960s with the accountability provisions that are required in the Straight A's proposal in the legislation before the Senate. It is apples and oranges. It is not even fair to make such a comparison. But they do so. 
   In that allegation, in that attack upon this bill, there is the insinuation or the suggestion that currently, under the status quo--which is so roundly defended--there is somehow accountability and those abuses do not occur. On that, I know they are wrong. 
   Let me give you an example. I want to show some pictures. 
   Last August, during a recess, I toured a lot of the Delta area in Arkansas, which is the poorest area in the State of Arkansas. It is also the poorest area in the United States. We hear about Appalachia. Today, the Delta of the Mississippi River is the poorest area in this Nation. So I spent almost 2 weeks in the Delta area of Arkansas. 
   During that time, I visited the rural health clinics, I visited the hospitals, and I visited schools. But one I will never forget--I had staff go down this past week to verify that I had my facts straight--was the Holly Grove school in southern Arkansas in the Delta. 
   It is about 95 percent minority--95 percent African American. They are in a 50-year-old building. The building is older than the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. They have a very low property tax base, so they have very little funding. Frankly, it is an issue the State needs to address in the equitable distribution of State funds. But that is not my point at this moment. 
   So I went into the building. It is 50 years old. It is dilapidated, falling down. We hear about inner-city schools falling down. This rural school surely is as bad as any inner-city school I have ever visited or seen or heard about. 
   The ceilings are 12 feet high, so it is very difficult to 
   heat. That in itself makes it a very bad learning environment. The lighting is very poor. Then, worse yet, the ceiling is collapsing. Tiles are falling down, tiles are missing. There are big water stains. You can see it in this picture. These are the water stains in the tile of the ceiling. There are missing tiles in the ceiling. This picture gives you an idea of the conditions in the building. 
   This picture shows the outside of the school, the school door. This one school building, by the way, houses Head Start through the 12th grade. As you can see from the picture, the paint is in very poor condition. The building itself, while brick, is 50 years old. 
   I want to show you an amazing thing. I toured the school. The principal took me through the school. There were broken windows. The ceiling was, as I said, collapsing. We opened this one door, and I had the most amazing sight. I saw state-of-the-art exercise equipment. 
   Here is a picture of it. This was taken last week. These are treadmills--I suspect better than what we have in the Senate gym. There were a number of treadmills. And then, if you don't like treadmills, they had Stairmasters, a number of Stairmasters. This is brand new equipment. This was all purchased last year. If you want to go beyond the Stairmasters and the treadmills, there is Nautilus equipment, state-of-the-art, brand new Nautilus equipment, a big room full of this equipment.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me finish my story. Then maybe I will answer the question and be glad to yield. 
   After having looked at the terrible conditions in the building, the conditions to which the students were being exposed every day, I asked the principal: Where did you get the money? Where did you get the money to buy all of this state-of-the-art equipment? And he said, rather sheepishly: This was a Federal grant. 
   We went back and talked about it. He applied for this grant. The school applied for the grant. This was the way they could spend the money. Then he said: I would much rather have spent the money on improving my facilities. I would much rather have lowered the ceiling, put good lighting in, painted the rooms. I would much rather have had some resources to do that. 
   The answer on the other side is: Well, we will just start a school construction program from up here. Do you know what will happen then? We will spend school construction money where they don't need school construction. What we had here was a typical Federal Government approach, a prescriptive categorical grant. Do you know how much money they got? They got $239,000 for the Holly Grove school to buy athletic equipment. 
   To my colleagues, I say that is the insanity we must end. I am not saying that is not good. I am glad they have the equipment. I am sure the community can come in and use it in the evening. There is probably some good coming out of this state-of-the-art athletic equipment. But that is not what they needed, and the principal knew it. 
   Under our legislation, that principal and the school district, working together with the school board, would be able to decide what was needed most. 
   For a lot of schools, maybe it would be nice. I don't know. For an afterschool learning program, maybe they could use the equipment. Or maybe a school could use computers, or maybe 
   they could use tutors, or maybe they could use new textbooks. But when they talk about swimming pools from block grants, I want you to remember this picture because that is the current system. 
   I am not shy about how I feel about education. As is Senator SESSIONS, I am excited about the legislation this committee has produced. This is a debate about education, not elections. It is a debate about student achievement, not bureaucratic preservation. 
   If the underlying bill is passed and signed into law, the American people will be the beneficiaries, the American children will know they have a better opportunity in the future, and we will know we did our job. 
   I think this bill is so good and the facts so clear and the message so strong that proponents of the status quo are worried this could actually happen. In fact, some colleagues have already stated their intentions to offer amendments that they know darn good and well will kill this bill--kill it. 
   I am elated that so far the debate has been about educating our kids. I hope it continues. However, I understand a gun and gun violence debate is coming. Who knows? Possibly campaign finance, maybe prescription drugs, too--all important issues in their own place, to be sure. But there isn't any American who follows this debate who does not understand what that would do to this bill. It would kill it. That is what they want to do. 
   I respect any Member's right to have their amendment debated on the floor of the Senate. I, too, have that right. I want to preserve it. But the Senate has already debated a juvenile crime bill. Members have stated their positions, and they have taken tough votes. What we need to do is ensure that this debate remains on education. 
   I implore my colleagues on the other side to reject the temptation to offer extraneous, unrelated, nongermane amendments to this bill. Let's have an honest debate on education. We can disagree and disagree vehemently. We  can have an honest philosophical difference over what the role of the Federal Government ought to be. Let's have that debate and take those arguments to the American people. But let's not clutter this up with extraneous, nongermane issues. 
   With millions of American students struggling to read, millions of American students who don't know the basics of U.S. history or don't exhibit basic mathematic skills, you would think we could collectively improve student performance by passing the pending legislation. We will soon see if we can bring our children to the halls of learning or keep them outside spinning endlessly on the merry-go-round of Washington politics. 
   I will conclude by quoting a former Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett. He used this analogy, and it is appropriate in our debate on the floor of the Senate. This was back in 1988, and it is true today under the ESEA:  
   If you serve a child a rotten hamburger in America, Federal, State and local agencies will investigate you, summon you, close you down, whatever. But if you provide a child with a rotten education, nothing happens, except that you're likely to be given more money to do it with.  
   That is the current system. That is the status quo. I won't defend it. We want to change it. This legislation does that. I hope as this debate goes forward we will have an opportunity to vote on the substance of the Educational Opportunities Act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I thank him for his leadership on this bill we bring to the Senate floor today. I thank Senator COLLINS for her outstanding remarks, as well as her leadership, particularly in the area of our rural schools. She has done a great job. I also am pleased that that is included in the chairman's mark. I look forward to the debate in which we engage today and throughout this week and perhaps next week as well. 
   I see Senator COVERDELL from Georgia, who has led the way on education savings accounts, and Senator FRIST from Tennessee, who was on the floor a moment ago, who led on education flexibility. We have a number of members of the committee who have worked hard, including Senator SESSIONS from Alabama, who has been very engaged and involved in this, and Senator GORTON from Washington, who has been very involved as well and is not a committee member. 
   This is the most important debate we will have in this session of the Congress. The debate on education and the Educational Opportunities Act is the most critical debate we could possibly have. 
   I sat here during the remarks of Senator KENNEDY. I respect him immensely; I regard him as a friend. Never could the philosophical chasm that exists between the Democratic approach and our Republican approach on education have been made more clear than during the statement of Senator KENNEDY. While I wish I could take longer to refute some of the things he said, there was one particular comment to which I took greatest exception. That was his statement that Republicans want to cut funding for education. That simply is not accurate. 
   As all who watched the budget process last year are well 
   aware, we increased education spending above what the President had requested and what he had recommended in his budget. This year, in this legislation, we once again increase spending on education. The statement that Republicans want to cut spending for education is simply inaccurate. Senator KENNEDY is off base in making that allegation. Every school district in Arkansas will see an increase in the Federal contribution to their budgets as a result of the Educational Opportunities Act. 
   There was another statement of which I took note. I wrote it down as Senator KENNEDY was speaking. He said twice: We need to stick with the tried and the tested. At one point he said: We need to stay with the tried and the demonstrated successful programs. Another time he said: We have an effective program. 
   I will debate on that ground all week long. I do not want to be the Senator standing on the floor of this Chamber defending the status quo and arguing that it is tried and tested. It was tried and it has failed. 
   We don't have to look very far to realize that. In yesterday's Washington Post, in the Metro section, just the headline tells the story: Test Shows Students Can't Do The Math; 64 Percent Fail Final Exam After Montgomery Standardizes Grades. As we read the small print in the story, it becomes even sadder. 
   The whole purpose of the Federal role under title I was to lower the disparity in scores between the disadvantaged and the advantaged, to narrow the gap. What this story tells us is that while 64 percent of all students failed--almost two-thirds--80 percent of African American and Latino students flunked the test while only about 50 percent of whites failed the test. 
   That is one of the great tragedies. That is the great failure of our existing status quo approach to title I and trying to fund education for the disadvantaged and trying to narrow the gap between those who are advantaged and those who are disadvantaged. I will repeat this over and over again this week. Stick with the tried and the tested. That is what Senator KENNEDY said: Stick with the tried and the tested. That is what the Democratic side offers. That is what they offer this Chamber. That is what they offer this country: Just stick with the status quo. 
   That is why we will win this debate this week and before the country, because we know the children of America deserve better. The tried and the tested has not been good enough. To use an old phrase from Scripture: It has been weighed in the balances, and it has been found wanting. 
   During the 34 years of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Congress has increased funding dramatically. We have created programs exponentially, and we have added bureaucracy layer upon layer. As Senator COLLINS pointed out, 15 years ago the alarming report, ``A Nation At Risk,'' recorded that the state of education in the United States not only jeopardized a generation of young Americans but posed a real threat to the future of our Nation.  
   Since that time, many States have embraced standards and accountability; 26 have instituted exit exams for high school. With these reforms, slight increases in student performance have occurred. But by virtually every measure, we remain a nation at risk. 
   Unfortunately, while many States are responding to the crisis with bold, creative reforms, the approach of the Federal Government has remained unchanged. Each succeeding 
   reauthorization of ESEA has resulted in preserving the top-down bureaucratic model of education. This is the first time we as Republicans have been in control of the majority, at least in the House and the Senate, the first time we have had an opportunity to leave our imprint upon ESEA. 
   It should not be surprising, as we look at the history of this program, that the American Legislative Exchange Council, when they issued their bipartisan report on education 2 weeks ago--the American Legislative Exchange Council is the Nation's largest bipartisan association of State legislators; they released their report card on American education about 2 weeks ago--concluded the current path is not good enough. 
   Senator KENNEDY may say let's stick with the tried and true, but the American Legislative Exchange Council, as most Americans, has concluded the current path is not good enough. 
   We heard the same dire, fearful predictions when we tried to do welfare reform a few years ago, the same predictions exactly: The sky is falling. You can't trust the States. We heard the same kind of fearful, dire predictions when States began experimenting with charter schools, that it was going to destroy public education. Yet today, with thousands of charter schools throughout the country, no one would dare make that claim. 
   Where has the current prescriptive regulatory approach led us? In student performance, America's 12th graders rank 19 out of 21 industrialized countries in math achievement and 16 out of 21 countries in science. Where has the current prescriptive regulatory approach led us since 1983? Ten million young Americans have reached the 12th grade without having learned to read at a basic level; 20 million seniors could not do basic math; 25 million are ignorant of the essentials of U.S. history. 
   In the fourth grade, over three-quarters of children in urban, high-poverty schools are reading below basic on the NAEP test--the National Assessment of Education Progress. Where has it gotten us? Throughout the United States, per pupil expenditures have increased by more than 23 percent over the past 20 years, the past two decades, after adjusting for inflation. Yet two-thirds of American eighth graders are still performing below the proficiency level in reading. I suggest that reauthorizing a status quo ESEA should not be an option. America's children deserve better. 
   Not only does American education fail in regard to the most essential criterion, student achievement, but it also fails in its allocation of resources. For example, in Florida it takes six times as many people to administer a Federal education dollar as a State dollar. 
   That is amazing. In Florida, they have 297 State employees administering $1 billion in Federal funds. They have 374 employees overseeing $7 billion in State funds. It takes six times as many people to administer a Federal education dollar as a State dollar. Unfortunately, Florida is not an exception; it is all too typical. 
   The result from this bureaucratic model of education is that we fund systems; we fund bureaucracies; we fund enormous overhead. In 1994, fewer than 50 percent of the personnel employed by U.S. public schools were teachers. Something is wrong with that picture. Senator KENNEDY may say that it is tried and it is tested, but when more than 50 percent of our education personnel are not even in the classroom, I say it is tried, tested, and it has failed. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act pioneers a new direction for the Federal Government's role in education. When only 38 percent of U.S. public school teachers majored in an academic subject in college and only one in five teachers feels well prepared to teach to high academic standards, my colleagues, I say we need a new approach to professional development and teacher empowerment. The Educational Opportunities Act gives us that new approach. 
   The New York Times ran a headline in its January 18, 1999, edition. It read: ``Clinton to Urge More U.S. Control on Aid to Schools.'' 
   Colleagues, more control is not what is needed. Better student performance--better results--is what is needed. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act includes four initiatives that promote student achievement. These provisions focus on students rather than school systems. They require results and student performance, help develop teachers of excellence, and promote choice and flexibility. These four initiatives are: Straight A's, Teacher Empowerment Act, child-centered funding, and public school choice. 
   The Straight A's provision is the heartbeat of this bill. In short, it allows up to 15 States to execute a 5-year performance agreement with the Secretary. States then have the option to consolidate any of their formula grant programs, including the huge title I program, and merge those funds with State and local dollars. 
   The 15-State demonstration project would allow States to use Federal dollars for any educational purpose permitted under State law. In return for this broad new flexibility, participating States will be held accountable for improving student performance and narrowing the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. States will be rewarded with bonus funds for successfully reducing this achievement gap. By the way, no State is required to leave the current funding system; but the 15 lucky States--the 15 wise States--accepted into the demonstration program may consolidate funding from any or all of 12 different ESEA programs. 
   The idea is to let States mingle the dollars from these several programs and spend the money on whatever their students need most--new tests, tutors, reading programs, bricks and mortar, computers, whatever is deemed most needed. States that prefer to keep their Federal dollars in redtape-wrapped categorical packages may, of course, be free to do so. 
   Straight A's will work because it is based on a solid premise: Accountability plus freedom equals academic achievement. Instead of filling out form Y to get grant X, 
   Straight A's would only require that States boost academic performance and narrow the learning gap. 
   After 34 years and $118 billion, with no reduction in the achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students, it is time to say: Enough. 
   Kentucky Democratic Governor Paul Patton expressed the Straight A's concept well when he told the L.A. Times recently: ``We need the Federal Government as a limited partner and us as the general partner.'' 
   Straight A's respects the tenth amendment and allows Uncle Sam to put fuel in the gas tank while leaving the States in the driver's seat. 
   Straight A's will reduce overhead and transaction costs for dozens of separate fussy programs enabling more resources to go to direct services to students. 
   The old Federal approach to education has failed. It is time to give the States the opportunity to act as charter schools and option out of burdensome Federal regulations in return for unprecedented levels of accountability for student achievement. 
   Under the current model, accountability means this: Did you fill the forms out correctly? Did you cross your ``t's'' and dot your ``i's''? Under the Educational Opportunities Act model, accountability relates only to student performance. 
   The theory of Straight A's was clearly articulated by Democratic California Governor Gray Davis on the ``Meet the Press'' program in February. He said, ``So if you say to the States, `we will hold you accountable. You just improve student performance and we will give you the money,' that will give all the Governors the flexibility to get the job done.'' 
   While there has long been lipservice to goals, standards and accountability associated with Federal programs, the reality has been that the question we focused on was: Are you spending the money in the prescribed way? Under the new approach, the question is, and must be, Are the kids learning? If academic achievement rises, particularly  for low-income children, why should Washington care whether the dollars that produced the desirable result were spent on smaller classes or larger classes, on computers or textbooks, on tutoring programs or staff development? The important thing is that those children are making academic progress. The gap is narrowing. 
   Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not CEO of the Nation's education enterprise. 
   I have talked about--and I will talk about it later this week--the example of one of the school districts I visited in Arkansas which has about a 95-percent minority population. As I toured the school, the sad thing was the building was dilapidated, with paint peeling off of the walls. I will show pictures later this week. The ceiling was collapsing and it had big waterstains where it flooded. I thought, these poor children have to be educated in such an environment. Then I walked into a room which was full of state-of-the-art Nautilus equipment--treadmills and all kinds of gymnastic equipment. I said to the principal: Sir, how did you get the money to do this? He mentioned a particular grant program. I have since investigated, and they received $239,000 to buy treadmills and Nautilus equipment. That may be nice for the community, but the principal told me he would like to have improved, renovated, and made that school building into an atmosphere in which the children could better learn. 
   Under our bill, they will have the flexibility to take Federal dollars and use them where they--and they alone--know it is most needed and not what Washington says in some prescribed formula grant where the money has to be spent. 
   The second important provision in this bill is the Teacher Empowerment Act. This initiative is included in title II and provides maximum flexibility to States and to local education authorities to develop high-quality professional development programs by consolidating funds from the Eisenhower Teacher Professional Development Program and the Class Size Reduction Program. As a result, the bill provides more than $2 billion annually over 5 years by consolidating these two programs into one flexible funding stream. 
   Under the Teacher Empowerment Act, States and local governments would be encouraged to fund innovative programs to promote teacher testing, tenure reform, merit-based teacher performance systems, alternative routes to teacher certification, of which Senator COLLINS was speaking, and differential and bonus pay for teachers in high-need subject areas, teacher mentoring and in-service teacher academies. 
   Local school districts could use this money to hire new teachers to reduce class size or hire special education teachers. They would have the option of issuing teacher opportunity payments directly to teachers to use toward a high-quality professional development program of their own choice. If a local school district fails to improve teacher quality, they are required to offer teacher opportunity payments directly to teachers, if they are failing to improve the professional quality of their staff. 
   In consolidating these two programs, we provide more money for teacher professional development. In my home State of Arkansas, the combined fiscal year 2000 allocation for both programs is $14,970,900. The estimated fiscal year 2001 allocation will be $16,337,800, an increase of over $1.3 million. Under this bill, every school district in Arkansas will be authorized to receive additional money for teacher professional development. For example, the Jonesboro School District in northeast Arkansas currently receives about $169,000, and they will be authorized to receive $186,000, an increase of almost $17,000, for professional development. In Texarkana, the increase amounts to an additional $24,000. The Fort Smith School District will see a $36,800 increase. The teachers of the Little Rock School District will have $82,000 more for professional development activities under our program. 
   One of the other key changes made in the Educational Opportunities Act is to shift the child-centered funding. We do this through a title I portability demonstration program. Under this initiative, interested States and school districts are allowed to use their title I dollars to establish a per pupil amount for each eligible child, which would then follow the child to the school they attend. The per pupil amount would be used to provide title I's supplemental educational--``add on''--services directly to eligible children. 
   Eligible students will be able to use their per pupil amount for ``add on'' services at a public school (including charter schools) or a tutorial assistance provider. This funding is available for children between ages 5 and 17 whose family income is below the poverty line. A State may choose to expand eligibility to any educational or economically disadvantaged child in preschool through high school. (These eligibility requirements are consistent with title I.) 
   Each State participating in a portability program is required to operate a full public school choice program to ensure that low income families have maximum flexibility as to where their child receives title I services. 
   States operating a ``child-centered'' program would continue to receive their title I formula allocation as well as a new allocation authorized in this program. The new allocation coupled with the States' formula dollars will permit States to serve all of their title I eligible children. Only two-thirds of title I children are served by the program. 
   That is very important. Currently, only two-thirds of title I children are served by the title I program. Under our program all disadvantaged children are going to receive the educational opportunities they deserve. 
   States and school districts would be required to establish specific goals for improving the academic performance of eligible children and a system to measure progress to ensure that student performance is improving. States would be required to annually submit student performance data, disaggregated by race, family income, gender, and limited English proficiency, to the Secretary. The accountability system is similar to the strong accountability provisions in both the Teacher Empowerment Act and Straight A's. 
   GAO would be required to evaluate the program's effects on student achievement and parental satisfaction. 
   We must cease to think of title I education programs as investments in programs or populations, and begin to view them as ``student-based, portable entitlements for individual children.'' 
   One of the experts I have often turned to for advice on the appropriate Federal role in education is the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, Lisa Graham Keegan, one of the leading education reformers in the Nation. In endorsing the concept of portability, this is what she said:  
   Presently, there is no guarantee that a poor child will necessarily receive any benefit from the Title I funds he or she generates for a school district, regardless of how needy that child might be. What I am required by law to do is to distribute this money to central offices of school districts, which are then under no legal obligation to spend the money on particular children. They simply provide the services they want to provide in the schools they wish to provide them in, which many benefit some disadvantaged children, but not all of them. Putting it bluntly, Title I is an entitlement for bureaucracy, not an entitlement for a child.  
   This bill changes that. It makes title I something aimed directly at the child--strapping it to that child's back under this portability demonstration as opposed to funding systems and bureaucracies. 
   Portability is already standard practice in federal higher education policy, where an historic choice was made in 1972: students rather than colleges became the main recipients of federal aid. A low-income college student establishes his own eligibility for a Pell grant, or Stafford loan, etc., and then carries it with him to the college of his choice. That might mean Stanford or Michigan State, Assumption College, or the Acme Truck Driving School. The institution only gets its hands on the cash if it succeeds in attracting and retaining that student. 
   The same thing could be done with federal education programs meant to aid needy elementary and secondary students. The big title I program, for example, spends almost $8 billion annually to provide ``compensatory'' education to some 6.5 million low-income youngsters. That's about $1,250 apiece. What if that money went straight to  those families to purchase their compensatory education wherever they like. To be sure, title I would turn into millions of mini-scholarships, like Pell grants. 
   In addition to Straight A's, the Teacher Empowerment Act, and child-centered funding, the Educational Opportunities Act also includes an important provision for children trapped in failing schools. 
   Listen to the statistics: Over 5,000 title I schools have been identified as ``failing'' schools for over 2 years; over 1,000 for at least 4 years; and over 100 for over 10 years. 
   And yet, we continue to subsidize this failure by keeping the stream of title I funding flowing to these substandard schools. In this bill we have a public school choice provision that seeks to remedy this problem. 
   Under the ``choice for failing schools proposal,'' once a school has been identified as failing, they have 2 years to improve. If after 2 years, the school has failed to improve student performance, the school district would be required to use the school's 
   title I allotment to allow children in the failed school to attend another higher performing public school. This proposal has the dual effect of terminating federal funds to schools that consistently failed to show any signs of improvement while simultaneously providing the option to low-income parents to take their children out of a failing school and put them in a better school. 
   No child should be permanently consigned to a sub-par school. No child should be trapped in a failing school. This bill begins to show a way out. 
   Another important provision in this bill addresses the needs of small, rural school districts that receive small amounts of formula funds and are not able to compete effectively for competitive grants. This program is based on the Rural School Initiative introduced last year by Senator COLLINS of Maine, which I cosponsored. 
   This initiative has two parts. The first provision allows small, rural school districts with under 600 students to combine the funds from three current formula grant programs: title II--the Teacher Empowerment Act, title IV--Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and title VI--the Innovative Education Strategies grant. Small school districts often receive such small amounts under these separate funding streams that they cannot effectively use the funds. This initiative allows them to combine the funds to develop an effective program to improve student achievement. 
   The second provision authorizes supplementary grants to small, rural school districts that forgo eligibility to participate in competitive grant programs. A participating district receives a minimum total of $20,000 and a maximum of $60,000 from the existing formula programs plus the supplementary grant. 
   This new initiative solves two problems. It recognizes that formula grants to schools are often too small to implement any real changes, and it recognizes the limited resources of small districts and the enormous amount of paperwork that are required by applying for competitive grants. Small school districts often lack grant writers and the expertise and time needed to apply for competitive grants. I know in my home state of Arkansas that one school district had to take two teachers out of the classroom for an entire week just to fill out the required paperwork to apply for a federal competitive grant. We need teachers in our classrooms, not filling out paperwork. 
   This initiative will have a great impact on my home state; 111 of the 311 total school districts in Arkansas will be eligible to participate in this initiative, and every educator that I have spoken with about this has been supportive of this initiative. 
   Every educator I have spoken to in Arkansas about this initiative has been supportive. 
   Although the United States spends $664 billion annually--more than 8 percent of its gross domestic product, GDP--on education, nearly 60 percent of our low-income 4th graders, and 40 percent of all 4th graders, cannot read at a basic level. On recent international tests of math and science, our high school seniors ranked near the bottom of industrialized nations; in mathematics, only Cyprus and South Africa fared worse. 
   Our children deserve better. The current system, the top-down bureaucratic restrictive model has failed American students--tried, tested, and failed. 
   Today, one-third of all college freshmen enroll in at least one remedial class before attempting college-level course work. 
   Listen to the words of former Education Secretary Bill Bennett: ``We have not yet begun to look at performance or accountability in the spending of federal dollars. Of 60 plus programs authorized under ESEA, not one rewards school districts or states for doing well. Not one inflicts meaningful punishment on schools that do badly. For the results of such policies, one need only look at the performance of our disadvantaged students. Forty percent of inner-city students cannot read by the fourth grade. And 77 percent of low-income fourth-graders in urban high-poverty schools are reading below basic reading levels. 
   I read this morning in the CongressDaily that Democrats were considering offering a whole host of extraneous amendments. I hope that is not the case--everything from guns to campaign finance reform. Those proposals are worthy of debate but nothing should distract this Chamber from what is first and foremost on the minds of the American people--the education of our children. 
   I hope those who might consider such a stalling tactic or those who seek to move this debate and shift this debate from student performance, student achievement, and improving our schools will reconsider and realize this bill not only deserves debate--the differences will be clear between the two sides--but this bill deserves a vote. As the debate moves forward and the American people express themselves, the Educational Opportunities Act deserves to be passed by this Chamber and sent to the President. 
   What we have done for 34 years under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has demonstrably failed. Senator KENNEDY said it is tried and tested. It was tried and tested and it has failed the test. It is time we change. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman WARNER in bringing this enhanced military medical improvement legislation to the floor today. As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I have chaired several oversight hearings which have contributed to identifying areas of improvements to the original legislation. While the pharmacy benefit included in S. 2087 is significant, beneficiaries have expressed concern over meeting their acute prescription drug needs. 
   The version of the Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000 that I join the chairman in introducing today, builds upon the previous legislation and provides for enhancement of the pharmacy benefit by adding a retail component on the pharmacy program to address the acute medical needs of our military retiree population. The new legislation provides for system wide expansion of the Base Realignment and Closure of ``BRAC'' pharmacy benefit. The BRAC benefit includes access to retail networks with a 20 percent beneficiary cost share. The benefit also includes the mail order pharmacy program with current co-pays of $8 for a 90 day supply of drugs with no enrollment fees for deductibles. 
   I feel it is critically important to provide a uniform benefit for all our military retirees and their families. Revised cost assumptions associated with S. 2087, and a provision in the Budget Resolution, allow us to enhance the original provision to more closely meet the needs of those who were promised health care. 
   Mr. President, as I travel and meet with military beneficiaries, I will continue to examine opportunities to improve and enhance the health care package provided to our service members, their families, retirees, their dependents, and survivors. The medical component of the compensation package continues to grow in significance as health care costs increase and the recruiting environment becomes more difficult. Meeting the commitment to military retirees sends a strong message to those young people we seek to draw to military service. 
   This enhanced legislation continues the ongoing process of working toward meeting the needs of the military population. As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee I am committed to further examination of follow on opportunities to improve the military health care system.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Roth marriage tax relief plan. The clock is ticking, Mr. President. In less than forty-eight hours, Americans across the country will empty their pockets to pay the government thousands of dollars in taxes. 
   For approximately 42 American couples, tax day will have an extra sting to it, because they will have to pay an average of $1,400 extra in taxes to accommodate an outdated and discriminatory tax system. 
   When we first adopted the tax code, women made up only about three percent of the work force. But today, women are full time entrepreneurs. Some seventy percent of mothers work, only to find their income penalized. Our tax system did not anticipate this dramatic growth in dual income families. So now an outdated system discriminates against women and married couples. 
   When Mr. and Mrs. Smith get married, they look forward to a bright and prosperous future--to have and to hold, for richer and for poorer. But they soon find that Uncle Sam has moved in and cast his low shadow over them. And they are undoubtedly poorer. 
   The marriage penalty cuts two ways--by pushing married couples into a higher tax bracket and by lowering the couple's standard deduction. Two married income earners, with their combined income, must pay their income tax at a higher rate with a lower deduction than they would if they were two single people. 
   This is not a one time penalty. Under our tax system, marriage is not a freeway. It is a toll road. For ten years of marriage, couples must pay an average of $14,000 extra. For twenty years, couples must pay $28,000 extra. And they must forgo money that they could have invested in a car, a house, or their children's education. Mr. President, we must update the tax system and we must lift this extra burden on the backs of American couples. 
   The Roth plan takes solid steps on the path of tax relief. It increases the standard deduction for a married couple filing a joint return to twice the basic standard deduction for a single individual beginning in 2001. This standard deduction increase will help 25 million couples filing joint returns. The Roth plan expands the 15-percent and 28-percent tax brackets for a married couple filing a joint return to twice the size for a single individual. Twenty-one million couples will benefit from these tax bracket expansions. This legislation also expands the Earned Income Credit (EIC) beginning and ending income levels by $2,500, removing the disadvantage of receiving a smaller EIC after marriage. Finally, the Roth plan exempts family tax credits from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   Mr. President, all week I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim their support for marriage penalty relief. Yet they insist on quenching the thirst of American couples with only a raindrop relief. They offer nearly $100 billion less in tax relief for American couples in the next ten years. Fifty percent of the benefits under their plan do not occur until 2008. 
   We must be serious about tax relief for American couples. If you talk to any marriage counselor, he or she will quickly tell you that the number one cause of problems in marriage is money--specifically, the lack of it. If we want to support American families, if we want to support the future of America, we can start by reducing the money problems of married couples. 
   Mr. President, there are 207,677 couples in my home state of Arkansas suffering from the marriage penalty. They have called for marriage penalty relief. I want to give it to them. 
   I hope that when the clock stops ticking on Saturday, the Senate will have lightened the load on the couples and the American family. I urge my colleagues to support the Roth marriage penalty relief plan.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators GRASSLEY, HATCH, CRAIG, THOMAS, and FRIST to submit a resolution which states that it is the Sense of the Senate that $10 million should be immediately reprogrammed within the United States Department of Justice's (DOJ) budget to allow the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to support the cleanup of State and local methamphetamine laboratories in Fiscal Year 2000. I do so with a sense of urgency as my home State of Arkansas has suffered a terrible and great increase in the production, distribution, and use of methamphetamine and is desperately in need of federal assistance to bear the financial burden inherent in the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories. 
   In March, Governor Huckabee informed me that the DEA had exhausted all of the funding available to cleanup State and local methamphetamine labs and that the State of Arkansas was paying over $7,500 a day despite the much-appreciated efforts undertaken by ENSCO, an El Dorado, Arkansas company, to dispose of methamphetamine labs at no cost to the State. As the costs associated with the cleanup of a single lab range anywhere from $3,000 to $100,000 and average about $5,000 and, with over 200 labs seized to date, Arkansas will seize over 800 labs this year, it is imperative that funding be provided to the DEA so that it may continue to assist in State and local methamphetamine lab cleanups. 
   On March 28, 2000, Senators GRASSLEY, KYL, CRAIG, ASHCROFT, and I asked United States Attorney General Reno to identify $10 million in funding within the DOJ's budget which could be reprogrammed to provide the DEA with the monies necessary for it to administer the cleanup of labs seized by State and local law enforcement agencies. I was greatly encouraged and highly appreciative when she quickly responded by requesting that $10 million in Community Orientated Policing Service (COPS) recovery funds be reprogrammed. Despite an April 3, 2000, letter from Senators INHOFE, CRAIG, THOMAS, THOMPSON, FRIST, ASHCROFT, HATCH, ENZI, and I supporting this request, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has informed me that a determination has not been made. While I appreciate the fact that Director Lew and the OMB continue to look for this critical funding, I ask them to put aside politics and act quickly to meet this need.  
   This Resolution is intended to make it clear to this Administration that the United States Congress is serious about solving this problem. I implore the President to take a firm stand against methamphetamine and establish an effective policy to address this exponentially increasing problem. I am firmly convinced that we can solve this problem with Congressional support and Presidential leadership. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to take the first step toward a solution by joining me in supporting this Resolution.

Mr. President, since this is coming off our time on the marriage tax penalty bill, I commend Senator HUTCHISON and all those who have worked so diligently on both sides of the aisle and in the House of Representatives to provide relief on this onerous and perverse provision in our Tax Code that puts the institution of marriage in a disadvantageous position and costs American families thousands of dollars each year. It is something that should have been eliminated long ago. 
   I look forward to supporting the Marriage Penalty Relief Act. I hope there will be an overwhelming vote in the Senate for this bill.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. 2397, the Military Recruiter Access Enhancement Act of 2000. This bill is designed to assist armed services recruiters in gaining access to secondary schools and school student directory information for military recruiting purposes. 
   The matter of recruiting and retaining military personnel of the highest quality and in the quantity needed to maintain the optimal personnel strength of our armed services has been a topic of great interest to myself and my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. 
   I have heard detailed testimony in hearings this year from top Department of Defense manpower officials and actual military recruiters--those on the front lines doing the recruiting--regarding the challenges of contacting and informing young people today about the benefits of a career in the military. As I have contemplated the detailed testimony received on the subject, it is clear there are several factors combining to make the tough job of recruiting young people for military service even tougher. 
   We found the following: The combined effects of the strongest economy in 40 years, the lowest unemployment rate since the establishment of an all-volunteer force, and a declining propensity on the part of America's youth to serve in the military make the recruitment of persons for the Armed Forces unusually challenging in the economic climate in which we exist. 
   For the recruitment of high quality men and women, each of the Armed Forces face intense competition from the other branches of the Armed Forces. They face competition from the private sector, and they face competition from postsecondary educational institutions recruiting young people as well. 
   It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Armed Forces to meet their respective recruiting goals. Despite a variety of innovative approaches taken by recruiters and the extensive programs of benefits that are available for recruits, recruiters have to devote extraordinary time and effort to fill monthly requirements for immediate accessions. 
   Unfortunately--and this is, I think, dismaying and surprising to most Americans--a number of high schools, thousands of high schools, have denied recruiters for the Armed Forces access to the students or to the student directory information of those high schools.  
   In 1999, there were 4,515 instances of denial of access to the Army. There were an additional 4,364 instances in the case of the Navy, 4,884 instances in the case of the Marine Corps, and 5,465 instances of denial of access to Air Force recruiters. In total, there were over 600 high schools across this country that denied access to at least three branches of the services, the largest of those school districts is San Diego, CA. 
   As of the beginning of 2000, nearly one-fourth of all high schools nationwide did not release student directory information to Armed Forces recruiters. 
   In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, recruiters of the Armed Forces stated that the single biggest obstacle to carrying out their recruiting mission is the denial of access to directory information about students, for a directory listing of high school students is the recruiter's basic tool. When directory information is not provided by schools, recruiters must spend valuable time, otherwise available for pursuing recruiting contacts, to construct a list from school yearbooks and other sources. This dramatically reduces both the number of students each recruiter can reach and the time available communicating with the students that the recruiters can eventually locate. 
   The denial of direct access to students and denial of access to directory information unfairly hurts America's young people. 
   High schools that deny access to military recruiters prevent students from receiving all of the information on the educational and training incentives offered by the Armed Forces, thus impairing the career decisionmaking process of students by limiting the availability of complete information on what options they have before them. 
   The denial of access for Armed Forces recruiters to students or to directory information ultimately undermines our national defense by making it harder for our Armed Forces to recruit young Americans in the quantity and of the quality necessary for maintaining the readiness of the Armed Forces to provide national defense. 
   The bill I have introduced legislates a series of formal steps to be taken with secondary schools that deny access to students or student directory information to recruiters. 
   Step 1: The Department of Defense will be required to send a general officer or flag officer to visit the local education agency to arrange for recruiting access within 120 days following a report of access denial. 
   Should a school say, no, we are not going to let military recruiters access, the first step is, negotiations. They would try to work this out. You would have a flag officer, or a general officer, who would go to the school, visit with the superintendent, the principal, the counselors, and find out what the problem is. 
   Step 2: Should access still be denied, within 60 days of the visit in step 1, the Secretary of Defense must then notify the State's chief executive--presumably the Governor--of the denial and request his or her assistance. A copy of this request is also sent to the Secretary of Education. 
   Step 3: If access for recruiters is still not achieved a year after the Governor has been notified--a full 18 months since the initial discovery that they are denying access--and if it is found that the school in question denies access for two or more of the Armed Services, that school will be placed on a list maintained by the Department of Defense and will be denied Federal funds until such time as recruiter access is restored. 
   People may say that is having a heavy hand. May I say, there is no school in America that ought to ever lose Federal funding under this law because no school should ever have to deny access to military recruiters. There is an ample amount of time--a full 18 months--for negotiations, discussion, in bringing in the Governor of the State, to try the reconcile whatever problems there might be. 
   I think the importance of this bill cannot be overstated. We have an obligation to provide an environment for our recruiters that, at the very least, places them on a level playing field with the recruiters of colleges and universities and with representatives from private industry. 
   Today, the recruiting of high school students actually starts in junior high school for colleges, for universities, and even for private-sector jobs. To say a recruiter cannot have contact until that student is out of high school puts them at an incredible disadvantage. 
   While DOD has had the ability to withhold Federal funding from colleges and universities which denied access to military recruiters, there has not been any significant recourse available at the secondary school level. 
   In some cases, a few select administrators can make decisions about recruiter access based on their own personal bias or lack of familiarity with the positive aspects of military service. These ``gatekeepers'' effectively block information from students by denying access to recruiters. These nonaccess policies may actually exist when the community at large in the school's area is very much supportive of the Armed Forces and recruiting efforts. 
   We must work collectively as a nation to keep our military 
    ``connected'' with the people they serve. The concept of an all-volunteer force will only continue to be successful when the compensatory benefit package we offer young people is competitive and the career information on current educational and financial incentives is readily available to potential recruits. 
   There are those who are understandably concerned about maintaining the privacy of personal contact information. It is ironic, however, that student directory information is often shared by high schools with cap and gown companies, college recruiters, and private industry representatives, but denied to Armed Forces recruiters. We must take active steps to eliminate that sort of bias, whether intended or not, and reestablish an equal footing for our Armed Forces recruiters with other groups seeking to contact students. We must remember that recruiters represent the primary tool of not only the Department of Defense but Congress, as well, in fulfilling our constitutional requirements to raise and maintain an army, the Armed Forces. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that the recruiting professionals in all branches of our Armed Forces are top-notch role models, fully capable of succeeding in their respective recruiting missions, but they need to have a supportive and conducive contact environment. 
   This bill will provide school officials of institutions currently restricting access to recruiters with additional incentive to improve or restore that access. 
   This bill will bring attention locally and nationally to the problems of access restriction to Armed Forces recruiters. 
   This bill sends a clear signal to DOD leaders and to the people of our country that we recognize the problem recruiters face in supporting the concept of our all-volunteer force. 
   This bill provides a reasonable and calculated approach to improving access with a phased escalation in the negative consequences for schools insisting upon perpetuating nonaccess policies. It is nonantagonistic, it is nonconfrontational, but it is firm. 
   This bill does not attempt to dictate local practices from Washington, as some may charge. This bill merely requires schools to provide--and I quote from the bill's language--  
   ......the same access to secondary school students, and to directory information concerning such students, as is provided generally to post-secondary educational institutions or to prospective employers of those students.  
   We are just simply saying: Make the playing field level. If you are going to deny access to Army recruiters, Air Force recruiters, Marine recruiters, Navy recruiters, then we expect the same denial would be applied across the board to private industry recruiters and to colleges and universities. If you are going to provide access to private industry and to colleges and universities, likewise, that access must be provided under this legislation to those seeking to recruit for our Armed Forces. 
   The size of our Armed Forces has decreased significantly over the past decade. The number of veterans is decreasing daily. Fewer and fewer young people today have a close relative or friend with military service experience. We have in the Congress a corporate responsibility to make an extra effort to  invite young men and women to bring their talent into the service of their country and to take advantage of the outstanding educational and training benefits currently available. Few occupations offer the patriotic satisfaction of military service. 
   A healthy all-volunteer force does not just happen. When I asked recruiters appearing before a recent Personnel Subcommittee hearing what Congress could do to help them bring the best and brightest into today's military, of course they responded that educational benefits would help, they responded that health care benefits would help, they responded that improving housing would 
    help. But equally important was their request for help in convincing parents and educators that enlisting their children and students was ``not the last choice'' but a first choice, and to help them gain access to students on school grounds and access to student directory information. 
   In response to the DOD request for assistance, I would like to respond in two ways: 
   First, by inviting all of my colleagues in the Senate, regardless of where they hail from, to join with me in pledging to visit one or more high schools in their home States this year and to promote military service as an attractive career opportunity while addressing students and facility members. This is one positive step we can all take to demonstrate our support for a healthy Armed Forces recruiting process. 
   Secondly, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, the Military Recruiter Access Enhancement Act of 2000, in an enthusiastic and bipartisan fashion. We want and need the brightest and the best to serve in our Armed Forces. I cannot help but think of the many outstanding citizens in all walks of life, indeed, including many of my esteemed colleagues right here in the Senate, who began their adult lives with service to our Nation in one of the branches of the Armed Services. We owe it to the recruiters of our services to do all we can to help them succeed in their tireless efforts to bring in quality men and women for the defense of our country. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence and thank the Senator from Texas for her willingness to yield to me this time and for her tireless efforts on behalf of tax relief for the families in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2390 which Senator DEWINE introduced yesterday. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. I know that, unlike additional infringements on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, this bill will effectively reduce gun violence and save lives. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I am extremely concerned about gun violence. In my home state of Arkansas, there are several cities which have long been plagued by extraordinarily high levels of violence and murder, largely fueled by illegal guns, gangs, and drug trafficking. According to the 1998 Uniform Crime Reports, Little Rock, with a population of 176,377, North Little Rock with a population of 60,619, and Pine Bluff, with a population of 54,062, had 25, 8, and 17 murders respectively. The rate of murder per 100,000 inhabitants in North Little Rock-Little Rock was 10.3 and it was 33.8 in Pine Bluff and significantly exceeded the national rate of 6.3 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Nonetheless, I have received literally thousands of letters from Arkansas asking me not to support additional gun control measures, but rather to simply enforce the laws already in effect. 
   My constituents are right. We do not need more gun laws. We just need to enforce those already on the books. The facts show that the Clinton Administration has not done this; from 1992 to 1998 prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in connection with a felony have decreased nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800. In addition, while more than 500,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers have been prevented from purchasing firearms from federally, licensed firearms dealers under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevent Act, only 200 of these persons have been referred to the United States Department of Justice for prosecution. I have carefully studied the Project Exile program in Richmond, Virginia and am convinced that it saves lives. Before Project Exile was implemented, Richmond was one of the nation's murder capitals, and Project Exile resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the number of murders committed with firearms. That is why for the past several months, I have been working to implement Arkansas Exile. By supporting S. 2390, I hope to obtain the additional funding necessary to allow Arkansas and other states to implement a program proven to reduce gun violence. 
   Finally, I support S. 2390 because it is the right approach. The President and many of my Senate colleagues condemn firearms, which are inanimate objects, and the gun industry while ignoring and working to overturn the well-established legal principle and a third-party's criminal act is an unforeseeable event for which a merchant may not be held liable. I am saddened and alarmed that the President and cities throughout the nation are using the vast resources for their governments to force the gun industry to take responsibility for the acts of criminals, and I am determined to do all I can do that the criminals, not the gun industry and law-abiding Americans, are held responsible for gun violence.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment earlier this week which calls for a doubling of funding for community health centers over the next 5 years, and I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator BOND and HOLLINGS, in a similar amendment, which I hope will pass the Senate unanimously. 
   In my home State of Arkansas, Community Health Centers serve rural, low-income areas where access to primary health care is limited, if even existent. They serve anyone who walks through their door, whether they have money or not, or whether they have insurance or not. 
   Back when there was a great ice storm in Arkansas, a 75-year-old farm laborer came into the community health center in Portland, AR, complaining of terrible tiredness. 
   Upon examination and an electrocardiogram, it was found that he was in severe heart failure. His heart rate was so slow, it could barely be detected. 
   With no money and no transportation, he had walked to the clinic. The clinic staff immediately got to work and gave him medication and arranged for ambulance transfer to a larger hospital in Little Rock. 
   With ice forming, ambulances were hesitant to go, but one finally agreed. He and his wife were transferred and he arrived in time for live-saving surgery. 
   In Dermott AR, a 2-year-old child was rushed into the Mainline Health Clinic with convulsions. A blood test was performed and he was diagnosed with meningitis, which is normally fatal for such a young child. Life-saving medication was given, and he was transferred to Arkansas Children's Hospital for intensive treatment. 
   If it were not for these community health centers, both the farmer and this little child would be dead. 
   Community health centers serve where no other medical professionals usually want to go and they are often the difference between life and death. They are the front line in rural America and their mission must be supported by Congress.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 14, which would amend the United States Constitution to prohibit the desecration of our flag. Opponents to this measure contend that the right to desecrate the flag is the ultimate expression of speech and freedom. I reject the proposition as I believe that the desecration of our flag is a reprehensible act which should be prohibited. It is an affront to the brave and terrible scarifies made by millions of American men and women who willingly left their limbs, lives, and loved ones on battlefields around the world. 
   It is an affront to these Americans who have given the greatest sacrifices because of what the flag symbolizes. To explain what our flag represents, former United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in his work, ``National Symbol,'' said. 
 The Flag is the symbol of our national unity, our national endeavor, our national aspiration. The flag tells of the struggle for independence, of union preserved, of liberty and union one and inseparable, of the sacrifices of brave men and women to whom the ideals and honor of this nation have been dearer than life. It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance. It means America united, strong and efficient, equal to her tasks. It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion of your ancestors, that to each generation comes it patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness to sacrifice and endure as those before you have sacrificed and endured rests the national hope. It speaks of equal rights, of the inspiration of free institutions exemplified and vindicated, of liberty under law intelligently conceived and impartially administered. There is not a thread in it but scorns self-indulgence, weakness, and rapacity. It is eloquent of our community interests, outweighting all divergencies of opinion, and of our common destiny.  
   Former President Calvin Coolidge, echoed Chief Justice Hughes in ``Rights and Duties.'' 
 We do honor to the stars and stripes as the emblem of our country and the symbol of all that our patriotism means. We identify the flag with almost everything we hold dear on earth. It represents our peace and security, our civil and political liberty, our freedom of religious worship, our family, our friends, our home. We see it in the great multitude of blessings, of rights and privileges that make up our country. But when we look at our flag and behold it emblazoned with all our rights, we must remember that it is equally a symbol of our duties. Every glory that we associate with it is the result of duty done. A yearly contemplation of our flag strengthens and purifies the national conscience.  
   Given what our flag symbolizes, I find that incomprehensible that anyone would desecrate the flag and inexplicable that our Supreme Court would hold that burning a flag is protected speech rather than conduct which may be prohibited. I find it odd that one can be imprisoned for destroying a bald eagle's egg, but may freely burn our nation's greatest symbol. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to pass S.J. Res. 14 so that our flag and all that it symbolizes may be forever protected.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, tomorrow, March 24, is the 2-year anniversary of the day on which Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson, Brittheny Varner, and Shannon Wright were the victims of senseless violence at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR. Today, I rise simply to offer my condolences to their families and friends and to the other victims of that tragedy. They are, and will continue to be, in my thoughts and prayers.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I associate myself with the eloquent remarks of the Senator from Maine regarding the elimination of the Social Security earnings test. 
   I rise in support of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, H.R. 5. I am pleased the Senate is considering this legislation expeditiously and that the legislation reflects the intent of Senator ASHCROFT's bill, S. 2074, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   Arkansas is a State that has one of the highest percentages of senior citizens in the Nation. We traditionally are just behind Arizona and Florida--very high. When you look at the population of our State, there are about 2.6 million senior citizens. 
   But when you look at low-income or lower income senior citizens, we are easily at the top and by far the leading State as a percentage of our population that has senior citizens who are in economic deprivation or lower income. These are the individuals, as the Senator from Maine so eloquently said, who are most in need of equity in the way we treat their Social Security income. 
   Earlier today I had lunch with a doctor who is a dentist in Arkansas and has his practice in primarily a retirement population area. He was relating to me how many of his patients are now 65-plus, many 70, 75 years old, and about the remarkable health that they enjoy today and the opportunity, from a physical standpoint, that they have to go out and be a part of 
   our labor market. In being a part of that labor market, they can use the experience and the expertise they have gained through a lifetime in our society and contribute that to the economy of today. 
   I think this is long overdue. The law that we are proposing to change is truly a vestige of the 1930s. It begs for its elimination. Our Nation's working seniors deserve immediate relief from the earnings limit--a longstanding and outdated provision of law. Persons aged 65 to 69 are losing $1 in program benefits for every $3 they earn beyond $17,000, creating a very clear and a very real disincentive to work at all. 
   According to the Social Security Administration, more than 800,000 seniors lose either part or all of their Social Security benefits because of the program's earnings limitation. That is almost one million working seniors. That is 12,755 people in the State of Arkansas whose lives will improve if we pass this legislation and the President signs it into law. 
   Since I was elected to Federal office on the House side a few years ago, I have witnessed a steady commitment among the Republican leadership to provide greater flexibility, training, and financial relief to our Nation's workforce. We have advocated legislation that would provide private sector workers with the choice of flexible weekly work schedules--a perk that has been enjoyed by all of us on the Federal payroll for over 20 years. 
   In 1998, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of America's job training laws, giving more funding and flexibility to States, municipalities, and businesses to provide essential job skills to its employees. More importantly, though, we have an impressive record for putting taxpayer money back into the pockets of those who need it most, the American people. 
   The legislation before us complements our leadership's commitment to giving advantages to the worker--in this case, our country's most seasoned and experienced employees. 
   This bill would end that longstanding practice of penalizing seniors for working--something that we ought to encourage; something we should commend. No different than providing tax relief to all working Americans, we want to help senior employees who choose to remain in the workforce. 
   I disagree with the notion that ``you can't teach an old dog new tricks.'' In fact, we could learn a thing or two from our seniors. We could learn a lot from our seniors. That is why we are debating this bill. 
   This legislation would not just help our senior workers; it also benefits employers, too. President Lincoln said: ``You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.'' Social Security's antiquated barriers not only  penalize seniors who want to work but employers who want to hire them. Seniors are turning down employment opportunities that business owners need to fill in order to compete in the global economy. 
   America posts one of the lowest unemployment rates in four decades, making good, plentiful workers harder than ever to find. Employers and our most experienced employees stand to gain considerably from the passage of this legislation. 
   H.R. 5 passed the House of Representatives 422-0. I anticipate it will pass the Senate with a similar kind of margin with great success. 
   The bill's language has the support of a bipartisan coalition of Senators who advocate comprehensive Social Security reform--reform based on a continuation of existing benefits while ensuring the program's financial long-term solvency. In fact, H.R. 5 is part of many of the comprehensive reform packages introduced in the last 2 years. It has been included in a lot of the plans to totally reform Social Security. 
   We all understand that if left unchanged, the future of Social Security is in jeopardy as the program begins running deficits in about 2013 when 71 million of my fellow baby boomers begin collecting their retirement benefits. We know the number of retirees will double between 2008 and 2018, narrowing the ratio of workers to beneficiaries to less than 3 to 1. When Social Security first started, there were 45 people working to take care of 1 retiree. In 1950, there were 16 workers working for every beneficiary. We all know that all trust funds will be completely exhausted in the next 30 years when the beneficiaries far outnumber the working contributors. 
   I remember back in December 1998, when the President hosted the White House Conference on Social Security, Members of Congress were asked to participate and share their ideas, with the common understanding that restoring the program's financial solvency was not only necessary but imminent. The Speaker and the majority leader reserved the first bill in the House and Senate for the President's legislation. It was to be accompanied by several bipartisan bills offered by our colleagues. Although several bipartisan bills were introduced by Members of this body, H.R. 1 and S. 1 remain vacant. 
   Although H.R. 5 represents an important step toward equitable reform, it definitely sets aside provisions that would address the future financial stability of this vital program. We must not allow the passage of this legislation to be the ``last rites'' of Social Security reform. Frankly, I am disappointed by the President's lack of participation in this important debate. 
   The next step after passing H.R. 5 should be to lock up the Social Security surplus. Not only do our working and retired seniors need penalty relief, they deserve assurances that their future benefit checks are not being spent on other Federal programs, no matter how good those other programs may be. 
   The very reason Social Security has a solvency problem is that it is a federally administered program that has IOUs disguised as trust funds. Our Nation's seniors deserve a program that delivers long term and is based on real money. I am confident that passage of H.R. 5 will open the door for more bipartisan legislation that enhances the strength of the Social Security program. 
   In time, Presidential leadership will mean more than words and with it will bring forth reform that preserves the program's financial stability for our children and our children's children. I ask my colleagues to continue supporting that cause and join me in supporting H.R. 5. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have heard from hundreds of private landowners, forest owners, and farmers in Arkansas who are greatly concerned about the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to rewrite portions of the Clean Water Act. 
   I know the Senator from Idaho has been very much involved in this issue, has had hearings on this, and has been a leader in determining exactly what the EPA intends to do. 
   In August of last year, as the occupant of the chair knows, the EPA proposed a regulation which requires States to renew their efforts to fully implement a so-called voluntary total maximum daily load, or TMDL, program. 
   The States, in conjunction with the EPA, would establish TMDLs for water bodies statewide. If States fail to meet those TMDL guidelines, the EPA would then have the authority to enforce the new water quality standards. I believe that is what this agency had in mind all along. 
   Should the EPA be successful in carrying out their plans, this regulation will have a direct impact on two of my State's most important industries: agriculture and timber. Agriculture and forestry activity, which the EPA currently treats as potential ``non-point source'' polluters, could be regulated as point source pollution. 
   A regulation requiring foresters, private landowners and farmers to obtain discharge permits for traditional forestry and agriculture activities is costly, overly burdensome and unnecessary. 
   I believe this is yet another deliberate attempt to circumvent the Clean Water Act and legislate through regulation. Rewriting TMDL requirements and redefining point source pollution should be addressed when Congress, the elected representatives of the people, reauthorizes the Clean Water Act. 
   Arkansas has put forth a tremendous effort to implement statewide Best Management Practices and other water quality regulations. 
   If my State is required to establish and enforce expanded federal, one-size-fits-all TMDL standards, it must redirect already limited funds and resources away from successful State implementation programs and hand them over to bureaucratic EPA procedures and oversight. 
   These are some of the reasons why landowners in Arkansas are so upset. In early January I spoke at a meeting in El Dorado, AR, where 1,500 people attended to voice their concerns. 
   A few weeks later, 3,000 people attended a similar meeting in Texarkana, AR. Although the public comment period for this proposed regulation is over, a third meeting scheduled for later this month is expected to draw similar crowds. 
   The thousands of people who attend these meetings have families, busy schedules, and many other responsibilities, but they are willing to sacrifice their time to learn more about this proposed regulation and how it will affect their livelihood. 
   One of the core issues motivating Arkansans to attend public meetings by the thousand is trust. Ultimately, the people of my State do not trust the EPA. In other words, the EPA has not earned the trust of my constituents. 
   Clearly, the EPA has done an incredibly poor job communicating their proposal to those whom it will affect the most. During my time in public service, I have never seen this kind of public outcry to anything the EPA has done. 
   In response to the reaction from foresters, private landowners and farmers, private landowners and farmers in Arkansas, I have introduced S. 2139, the Timber and Agriculture Fairness Act. 
   My bill consists of two simple parts: First, it exempts silviculture operations and agriculture stormwater discharges from EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting requirements; and, second, it defines nonpoint source pollution relating to both agriculture stormwater discharges and silviculture operations. 
   This two-prong approach, I believe, is the sensible way to winning back the trust of Arkansans and the American people. 
   We must remind ourselves that we have a Government ``of the people, by  the people, and for the people.'' By passing this legislation, we will give the Government back to its original owners. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2139. 
   I express my appreciation to the Senator from California for fitting me in between her comments. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in late-December 1999, the Federal Communications Commission took the unusual and aggressive step to restrict the programming of noncommercial television stations by not allowing certain types of religious programming. 
   Within the context of a license transfer involving a noncommercial television station in Pittsburgh, PA, the FCC attempted to establish guidelines for what they felt were ``acceptable'' educational religious programming. 
   The commission states in the Additional Guidance section of their decision document that, ``..... programming primarily devoted to religious exhortation, proselytizing, or statements of personally-held religious views or beliefs generally would not qualify as `general educational' programming.'' 
   As a former religious broadcaster, this type of misguided agenda coming from a nonelected agency of the federal government is very disturbing. My office was flooded with letters and phone calls from Arkansans who were worried that the Federal Government had finally made an overt attempt to restrict what religious programming we watch on television or listen to on the radio. 
   Surprisingly, the national media remained strangely quiet despite the serious free speech implications and first amendment violation by the commission's ruling. 
   Soon after the FCC's controversial decision, I sent a letter to Chairman Kennard, along with Senators NICKLES, HELMS, ENZI, and INHOFE, criticizing the commission's actions. Congressman OXLEY introduced legislation in the House to address this issue. 
   Although I am a cosponsor of Senator BROWNBACK's companion bill to Congressman OXLEY's bill, I do not believe this legislation to prevent future attempts by the FCC to restrict religious programming goes far enough. 
   That is why I am introducing S. 2215, the ``Noncommercial Broadcasting Eligibility Act of 2000.''  
   Simply put, my bill would effectively deny the FCC the ability to create new rules defining what is appropriate and eligible programming for noncommercial television and radio stations, while creating a ``clear and simple test'' and guidance as to what programming noncommercial television and radio broadcasters may broadcast. 
   This ``clear and simple test'' is based on the well-established guidelines from section 501(c)(3) and 513 (a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
   By requiring the FCC to look to the well-established guidance used by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts in defining what is ``substantially related'' programming, my legislation gives noncommercial broadcasters the ability to broadcast programming that is ``substantially related'' to their tax-exempt purpose, whether it be educational, religious, or charitable. 
   It is clear that the FCC intended to restrict religious programming and may be inclined to do so in the future. The commission should not be allowed to circumvent the United States Constitution and pursue its own political agenda. 
   Again, the Noncommercial Broadcasting Eligibility Act of 2000 will help prevent future misguided attempts by the FCC to limit our rights which are protected by the first amendment to the United States Constitution. 
   I ask that my colleagues join me by cosponsoring this bill and making it clear that the Senate will not stand idly by as the FCC attempts to unilaterally decide what religious programming is in the public's best interest. 
   I think it is outrageous for a nonelected agency to decide that a church service is not educational or that certain choral presentations do not fit their accepted definition of religious education. It is time that we draw the line. This legislation will do that. I ask my colleagues to join me in it.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Command Sergeant Major Charles J. Johnson of the U.S. Army Communication-Electronics Command who is retiring from the United States Army after 30 years of active duty. Sergeant Major Johnson is an exceptional leader, a ``soldier's'' soldier and has served this great country with honor and dignity. He understands soldiering, leadership and selfless service. He is known for his dedication and integrity. He has tackled the tough issues that our Army has faced the passed few years while consistently focused on the proper care and concern for our soldiers and families. Through his hard work and efforts and the most significant contributions he has made our United States Army enters this new millennium as a strong, well-trained, proud fighting force. This wonderful American deserves a tremendous praise and thanks from a nation for which he has given so much and loves. 
   Sergeant Major Johnson was born on August 8, 1949. He was raised in Canton, Georgia, and entered the Army in April 1970 at Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he was trained in Basic Soldiering and Basic Combat Skills. Upon the completion of Basic Training he received advanced individual training as a Communications Center Specialist at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Throughout his career, Sergeant Major Johnson continued his military education completing numerous military schools but most notable: Defense Race Relations Institute, Advance Noncommissioned Course, Organizational Effectiveness Staff Officers Course, First Sergeant Course and the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. Sergeant Major Johnson was also awarded a Bachelor of Science Degree from the University of Maryland. 
   Sergeant Major Johnson's initial assignment was with the Defense Communications Agency Southwest Asia Mainland Region (Vietnam). He was assigned to the Defense Communication Agency in Washington, DC, following duty in Vietnam. Sergeant Major Johnson has served over 24 years overseas to include six tours in Germany, one tour in Korea, and another combat tour in Southwest Asia. 
   Sergeant Major Johnson has served with distinction in every leadership position from Team Chief to Command Sergeant Major. He served as a First Sergeant of B Company, 440th Signal Battalion (Darmstardt, Germany) and as Command Sergeant Major of the 44th Signal Battalion (Mannheim, Germany), 22d Signal Brigade (Corps) (Darmstardt, Germany), U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and the Command Sergeant Major of the 1st Signal Brigade ``Voice of the ROK'' in Yongsan, Korea.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think that underscores, once again, the bipartisan nature of this legislation. I appreciate the Senator pointing out that omission. 
   Like the rest of our country's health care system, the military health care delivery system is in great need of reform. Over the years, I have met with and heard from countless veterans, military retirees, and their families, who have informed me of the many and varied problems of every aspect of the military medical care system--including access to proper care, dissatisfaction with the current TriCare program, loss of coverage at age 65 when they become eligible for Medicare, and, especially, availability of needed pharmaceutical drugs. 
   Last month, in fact, I had the privilege of leading a congressional delegation overseas to visit U.S. service men and women serving in Japan and South Korea. The most common complaints I heard, aside from the high OPTEMPO that keeps families apart, were complaints about the military health care system and how it treats dependents. Too many had trouble scheduling appointments for dependents, and too many had trouble being reimbursed for the cost of care provided to their loved ones. 
   This is unacceptable. The men and women who choose to wear America's uniform have too many other important things to worry about than dependable health care for themselves and their families. Millions of Americans made the sacrifice to defend our country with the understanding that health care would be available to them upon retirement if they served at least 20 years. Unfortunately, for too many military retirees this commitment has simply not been honored. 
   Since the establishment of CHAMPUS, and its successor, TriCare, we have seen that the idea of space-available health care at military treatment facilities for military retirees is simply not adequate. 
   With base closures, military downsizing, and reduced services at military treatment facilities, it is nearly impossible for military retirees to access quality health care without having to travel hundreds of miles. 
   It should come as no surprise that problems with military medicine are often cited by troops as a key reason for leaving the force. In fact, a GAO study found that access to medical and dental care in retirement was the No. 5 career dissatisfier among active-duty officers in retention-critical specialties.  
   One of the critical challenges now is how best to reconfigure military health care delivery systems so that it might continue to meet its military readiness and peacetime obligations at a time when our base and force structure is continually changing. 
   Let me briefly give a summary of legislative provisions in the bill that we are introducing. 
   Section A deals with our over-65 retirees. It extends the demonstration programs that have been in place. It allows expansion of ``Medicare subvention,'' which is critically important as a funding stream for military retiree health care. It allows expansion of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program Demonstration--a program that I believe will still work, though there have been too few enrolled in it. We need to adequately publicize it, adequately promote it, and allow it to be expanded. This bill does that. 
   It expands the National Mail Order Pharmacy Program to all beneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, with only a $150 deductible. Addressing of the needs of retirees for pharmaceuticals is probably the most critical part of the entire bill and will provide great relief for our military retirees in the area of prescription drugs. 
   It directs modification to DOD's implementation of a legislatively directed pharmacy pilot program by reducing participation fees and alternative payment methods. 
   Section C deals with TriCare Prime. It makes improvements to the TriCare program, especially for active duty and their family members. It requires expansion of TriCare Prime Remote for active-duty family members of those members in remote locations. We hear many complaints from those who are serving in remote locations, and who are not near military hospitals, and this would allow expansion of that Prime Remote for those important service members. 
   It eliminates copays for TriCare Prime for active-duty family members, a very important provision. It directs improvement in business practices used in administering provision of health care services through the TriCare program to include access, availability, and scheduling of appointments; claims filing, processing, and payment; and national enrollment. It continues and caps previous provisions related to custodial care. 
   Section D provides for further collaboration between the DOD and the VA in the cooperative programs that exist in the areas of patient safety and pharmaceutical safety. All of these are critically important provisions, and there are other provisions that are going to help our military health care situation. 
   As we know, retirees especially have had problems with access to health care. These over-65 retirees and their families are seeing a critical problem develop. These beneficiaries believe--and rightly so--that a lifetime commitment was made and that lifetime commitment is not being honored. Service members thought they were assured free lifetime health care. This was promised by recruiters in recruiting materials as late as the 1990s. We must honor that promise to our retirees. 
   Our active-duty service men and women find that access to care is very often difficult. Young families find it especially difficult to navigate the often cumbersome process of getting their young children to the care they need. Implementation of the managed care program appears inconsistent across the country. Families don't know what to expect when they move to different regions of the country because administration of the program appears to be handled differently at different locations. 
   We must show these active-duty service men and women that we care. We can do that by the passage of this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this legislation enacted. This is a very doable, very achievable first step in improving our military health care provision for our service men and women. 
   I thank the Chair for his willingness to serve a little extra today so I could make my comments regarding what I think is very important legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I was deeply distressed with the news over the weekend of China's new ultimatum regarding Taiwan and the front-page, above-the-fold story in the Washington Post today. I think the headline summarizes the situation:  
   China Issues New Taiwan Ultimatum: Delay in Reunification Would Spur Use of Force.  
   It seems that mainland China cannot stand democracy. It is almost as if they have a visceral antipathy to freedom. I went to Taiwan last month--the Presiding Officer accompanied me on that visit to the Pacific rim--and had the opportunity to visit with the President of Taiwan and numerous officials. One of the things that struck me as we disembarked the plane and I looked off the tarmac was a whole press contingent, more than we had seen in, say, Japan or South Korea; a media contingent--cameras, reporters--shouting questions at us. I thought, even as we walked toward them, democracy has certainly arrived and democracy has blossomed in Taiwan because one of the signal signposts, I believe, of democracy is an independent and a vigorous and aggressive media. That was certainly evident in Taiwan. 
   One of the first questions shouted to our delegation, the Senator from Wyoming will remember, was: Will China attempt to disrupt our Presidential elections as they did before? 
   My answer was: I certainly hope not because it did not succeed before and it won't succeed this time. 
   Four years ago, China launched missiles off the coast of Taiwan, hoping to disrupt a cornerstone of democracy in Taiwan, its Presidential elections. That effort failed both because of American aircraft carriers and the determination of the Taiwanese people not to be intimidated out of their freedom. 
   Next month, on March 18, the thriving democracy of Taiwan will once again hold Presidential elections, and once again it seems that the Chinese Government hopes to disrupt those elections. 
   Just yesterday, China issued a new threat to democratic Taiwan. In an official new white paper on Taiwan, the Chinese Government stated that:  
   If the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations, then the Chinese government will be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force.  
   In other words, ``Negotiate or face invasion'' was effectively the ultimatum issued by the Chinese Government. 
   No longer is the bar set at a declaration of independence or occupation by a foreign power; now it includes refusing to negotiate reunification--a dialog that was broken off by the Chinese Government. This is, in effect, a blank check that the Chinese Government has written themselves, making a subjective judgment on this new, ambiguous standard they have established. 
   Taiwan is not a military threat to China, and no one in the world believes it is. If it is a threat, it is an ideological threat. A burgeoning Chinese society, less than 100 miles across the Strait, with increasing freedoms of religion, speech, and press--freedoms that are stifled on the mainland--the Chinese Government can't stand this shining contrast to its own totalitarian system. That is why China is pulling down the threshold for invasion and building up its arms pointed at Taiwan. 
   I suggest it is no accident that earlier this month the first of four Russian Sovremenny-class guided missile destroyers sailed into Chinese waters. I suggest it is no accident this destroyer is equipped with surface-to-surface missiles designed specifically to destroy American Aegis ships and aircraft carriers, America's ships that would come to the defense of Taiwan. 
   It is no accident that China has ordered Kilo-class submarines equipped with torpedoes designed to evade detection. It is no accident that China has deployed short-range ballistic missiles in the provinces just across the Taiwan Strait. It is no accident that China has flown over 100 sorties over the Taiwan Strait, many with Russian-bought SU-27s. 
   We must not tempt intimidation with ambiguity. We must not tempt aggression with weakness. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1838, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. 
   Opponents of this act have held this out as being somehow bellicose, somehow threatening. I suggest to all my colleagues in the Senate they simply read what the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act says. Our colleagues in the other body passed this legislation by an overwhelming vote of 341-70 earlier this month. The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act will bring 
   greater clarity to our relations with Taiwan and China by increasing military exchanges with Taiwan, by establishing a direct military communications link with Taiwan, and by reestablishing Congress as a consultant in the annual arms sales process--as intended and required by the Taiwan Relations Act--which at least, supposedly, governs our relations with Taiwan. 
   Just last month, General Xiong Guangkai, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army and a former head of Chinese intelligence said, ``..... we will never commit ourselves to renouncing the use of force.'' The irony is that this general did not make this statement while he was in China. He said this right here in Washington while he was being hosted by the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   This reveals the irony of the situation. We have greater military exchanges with a country that points ballistic missiles at us than we do with a democratic ally. The State Department prohibits our senior military officers from meeting with their Taiwanese counterparts. Instead, the focus is on their Chinese counterparts. 
   Isn't it ironic. I was visiting--I will not mention their names--with leading Army officials, some of whom had served in Taiwan many years ago, and they pointed out to me the irony that while they can hold talks with leading Communist Chinese military leaders, they cannot so much as go to Taiwan  and meet with the military leadership in Taiwan, a democratic entity. 
   It is only a matter of common sense that in the event of a crisis--a crisis now more likely--we should be able to communicate with the Taiwanese military--the people we may be called to defend. 
   Opponents of this bill claim that ambiguity is good. But there is nothing ambiguous about the Chinese position. The Chinese White Paper even specifically opposed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. 
   I suggest we should not be ambiguous about our support for democracy in Asia, nor should we apologize to China for helping Taiwan to defend itself. 
   I believe China has made itself clear on the Taiwan issue. So should we. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, last month we had a very serious, severe snow and ice storm in Arkansas. It brought life in Arkansas to a halt. Schools and businesses closed, airports, including the Little Rock Airport, were snowed in, and highways were littered with hundreds of stranded motorists. It was not too unlike the situation we had in the Nation's Capital, except it blanketed the entire State of Arkansas. Fortunately, there were very few human fatalities that were reported, but Arkansas's poultry farmers and the poultry industry suffered very heavy losses. Snow and ice built up on poultry houses across the State, and the sheer weight caused the roofs on almost 800 poultry houses to collapse, killing an estimated 10.5 million chickens. 
   Dennis Richie, a poultry farmer in Nashville, AR, had six poultry houses the morning of Thursday, January 27. By Friday evening, half of his houses were destroyed, along with the income he needs to provide for his family. 
   Hubert Hardin, another poultry farmer near Nashville, AR, and a single parent, lost all of his poultry houses in the storm. That means fewer options for him in supporting his family, his children. 
   The poultry industry is a pillar of Arkansas's agricultural industry and one of my State's leading employers. These losses represent a very real danger to my constituents and to Arkansas's economy. That is why, today, I am introducing the Poultry Farmer Disaster Relief Act of 2000. 
   This bill would amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to allow a loosening of the restrictions currently in place for emergency loans through FSA. It would allow active poultry producers who were previously ineligible for insurance to apply for emergency loans through FSA. The current law prohibits growers whose structures were uninsured from receiving these low-interest loans. If the individuals did not seek insurance and chose to risk not insuring their structures, they would not qualify. 
   Under the bill I am introducing, these folks, who tried to get insurance, tried to do the responsible thing, tried to do the right thing and were unable to get insurance, would be allowed to qualify for these low-interest loans. This act will also allow growers whose structures were insured to apply for the same low-interest loans to cover the difference between what the houses were insured for and the cost of rebuilding their structures to current industry standards. It is very important for them to be able to do that. The need for upgrading poultry houses comes from the new regulations within the industry. Many poultry producers must increase the size of their houses and improve the safety of their facilities to meet these new regulations. 
   Without the availability of these new low-interest loans to cover the difference, FSA officials in Arkansas estimate almost half of the growers who lost houses will not be able to rebuild, that is, half of the poultry growers would be out of the business and unable to rebuild unless we pass this legislation. Currently, the FSA requires those seeking these emergency loans to prove they are unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere before the loans are approved. 
   Due to the severity of the destruction and the impact it could have on poultry producers throughout Arkansas, this bill waives that requirement, should there be a disaster designation  from the President. This would allow the victims of this storm to apply for and receive aid in the most expeditious manner possible. Finally, this bill would require farmers who receive these FSA loans to insure the new structures. 
   Poultry farmers in Arkansas are critical to the survival of the State's agricultural economy. Losses such as those suffered last month not only create financial hardships for the growers, but dramatic disruptions for poultry processors. 
   I ask my colleagues to look favorably upon this relief bill. The poultry processors and growers in Arkansas and across this country deserve that. It certainly is in an area where we had a natural disaster that has affected literally thousands of individuals now in the State. This is a compassionate act and something I trust we will act upon in an expeditious manner.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a special program that is having a positive impact on schools throughout my home State of Arkansas. This program is called WatchDOGS, and was founded to combat school violence in the wake of the Jonesboro tragedy by Jim Moore, PTA President of Gene George Elementary School in Sprindgale, Arkansas. Jim has informed me that the program has rapidly expanded to about 35 schools and I share in his goal of seeing it implemented in schools throughout the State of Arkansas. Furthermore, it is my hope that this program will be implemented in schools throughout the nation. 
   In a WatchDOGS program, fathers and grandfathers of students volunteer to spend at least one day a year in their child's school. By doing so, they not only provide unobtrusive security, but they also serve as positive role models for the children. Each school has a WatchDOGS coordinator who schedules the shifts to ensure that there is a father or grandfather on the premises at all times. WatchDOGS participate in a wide variety of school activities. For example, they read to and tutor students, participate in playground activities, eat lunch with students, and assist in the loading and unloading of school buses. 
   I believe that this program can be a great tool in our efforts to prevent school violence and to improve student performance because it increase parental initiative and involvement in their children's education. It can often be implemented without any expenditure of school funds as the only supplies necessary are a pair of walkie-talkies and identifying t-shirts, which are usually donated by local merchants or the PTA. 
   I hope that my colleagues will ask the school superintendents and principals in their respective home states to consider implementing this program in their schools. Finally, I wish to thank Jim Moore, Gene George Elementary School Principal Jim Lewis,  and all the other people who have worked so hard to develop and implement the WatchDOGS program. Thank you for helping to make Arkansas schools the safe havens of learning that they are meant to be.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 217, which calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to release all prisoners of conscience, to end its persecution of people of faith, and to abide by internationally accepted human rights standards. This resolution is cosponsored by Senators LOTT, NICKLES, MACK, COVERDELL, COLLINS, FEINGOLD, DURBIN, LEAHY, SNOWE, GORTON, and WELLSTONE. 
   Mr. President, the crackdown in China is escalating. The most immediate target is Falun Gong--a movement which combines traditional breathing exercises with elements of Buddhism, Taoism and the beliefs of its founder. Since April, when more than 10,000 practitioners of Falun Gong shocked the Chinese government by gathering in front of the leadership compound in Beijing, the Chinese government has tried to systematically eradicate the practice. 
   The Beijing regime rounded up thousands of practitioners, arrested its leaders, ransacked homes, confiscated and burned Falun Gong materials, and forced adherents to renounce their beliefs. The government then banned the practice of Falun Gong in July and officially labeled it a cult as part of a nationwide propaganda campaign to discredit practitioners. But this was not enough. On October 30, 1999, in a perverse maneuver, the National People's Congress raised the stakes of persecution by adopting a new law banning and criminalizing groups deemed by the Chinese government to be cults--perverse because this is the Chinese government's way of legitimizing their abuses of human rights--perverse because the law is being applied retroactively. 
   Protestors of this law faced police who beat, kicked, and yanked the hair of several elderly women protestors. Practitioners, mostly middle-aged or senior citizens, sitting or standing in silent meditation were dragged away from Tiananmen square. But they remained peaceful. 
   The Chinese government has wasted no time in arresting Falun Gong leaders and charging them under this law. As of November 9, 1999, according to Chinese officials, 111 people had been formally arrested on charges ranging from disrupting state security to stealing state secrets. Many more have been detained and sent to re-education programs or labor camps. Now, at least four leaders have been convicted, with sentences ranging from two to twelve years. Many more will be convicted. 
   The truth of the matter is that the Chinese government is insecure and cannot tolerate any group that is outside of its control. That is why it is engaged in this crackdown. That is why it sentenced four pro-democracy activists to jail terms ranging from four to 11 years. That is why it continues to persecute people of faith. 
   In August, police detained a 65-year-old bishop of China's underground Roman Catholic Church in Hebei province and convicted seven lay members of the underground Catholic church in Jiangxi province. 
   In October, in Guangzhou, some 200 police officers demolished a shelter used by House Church Christians. They detained, brutalized, and warned five House Church Christians against preaching or practicing their faith. I am extremely concerned about the well being of Christians who are suffering in detention for their faith, including Pastor Li Dexian, one of the Guangzhou House Church members, Zhang Ronglian from Henan, and Zheng Xinqi from Anhui. 
   These incidents re simply anecdotal. They reflect a greater pattern of ongoing religious persecution. 
   Mr. President, at the same time that the Chinese government is cracking down on its own citizens, at the same time it is authorizing harsher punishments for believing outside of government control, the Beijing regime is flouting international norms, and even tossing aside its own constitution, which supposedly provides for the freedom of religious belief and the freedom not to believe. 
   The freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, expression, and assembly are not ``western values'' or ``American values'' that we are trying to impose on China. These values have been embraced by the international community. And it is up to the international community to uphold them when they are being trampled--to speak out in the face of injustice. 
   This resolution is part of our responsibility. With this resolution, we urge the Chinese government to step back into the realm of international standards, to end its crackdown, and to release its prisoners of conscience. We urge the Chinese government to end its ``campaign for stability,'' which has only caused far greater instability. 
   Mr. President, I expect that this resolution will be adopted. I also expect that the Clinton Administration will not offer silence as a hidden concession for the WTO agreement signed with China but will instead use this statement by the Senate to strengthen its hand in advocating an end to persecution in China.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 65, which commends the World War II veterans who fought bravely in the Battle of the Bulge. This resolution was passed unanimously by the House on October 5, 1999 and mirrors S.J. Res. 32, which I introduced earlier this year. 
   Mr. President, in mid-1994, the Allies were hopeful. The Russian Red Army was closing in on the German army on the Eastern front and German cities were being devastated by American bombing. The Allies had taken Paris, Casablanca, Tripoli, Naples, and Rome, and they were looking toward an end to the war in Europe. Hitler was on the run. 
   In desperation, Hitler planned a surprise counterattack on the Allies on an 80 mile front running from southern Belgium to the middle of Luxembourg. Hitler hoped to break through this thinly held line in the Ardennes forest region, cripple Allied fuel supply lines, and inflame tensions within the alliance. 
   On the harsh winter morning of December 16, 1944, five months after the Allied landings at Normandy, France, eight German armored divisions and thirteen Germany infantry divisions launched a brutal onslaught against five divisions of the United States first Army. A screaming hail of artillery fire sent many men to their deaths. Roger Rutland, First Sergeant in the 106th Infantry, described the devastation. ``We lost many men that first day. An infantry company was approximately 200 men. A Company was 21 men after the first day. C Company could account for 59 men, and in my company, I lost only 28 men the first day. Every company commander was missing the first day except my company's commander ..... some of my better men in garrison were some of the first to crack under combat conditions. They were like hugging each other and just shivering ..... They never had seen such a thing before.'' The American forces were pushed back. Many ran out of ammunition. After three days of fighting, more than 4,000 of the 106th were forced to surrender. But the American forces regrouped and pressed on. 
   For forty-one days, American forces fought against two enemies, German forces and the worst European winter in memory. Freezing conditions made it difficult to see more than ten or twenty yards ahead, much less fight out of frozen foxholes. Halfway through the battle, American troops were still waiting for the main shipment of winter boots. Men became cut off from their division. They lost the feeling in their feet as their toes froze. Some had to have their feet amputated at the ankles. Fifteen thousand soldiers were taken off the line because they suffered from frostbite. Some wounded soldiers froze to death. But the American forces did not give in. They pushed on. They were met with brutality. 
   On December 17th, 140 Americans were taken prisoner at Baugnez. While on the road headed for Malmedy, 86 of these unarmed American soldiers were shot by their German captors in cold blood in what is now known as the Malmedy Massacre. 
   In spite of this horror, American soldiers fought on and took the key Belgian town of Bastogne. One of the heroes at Bastogne was James Hendrix, a Private in the 53rd Armored Infantry Battalion. 4th Armored Division and a native of Lepanto, Arkansas. On the night of December 26th, Private Hendrix was part of the leading element in the final thrust to break through to Bastogne. He and his fellow soldiers were met with fierce artillery and small arms fire. But he did not back down. Instead, he advanced against two 88mm guns and overpowered them. He saved two of his fellow soldiers who were wounded, helpless, and at the mercy of intense machine gun fire. He fought on and in another selfless act, Private Hendrix ran through sniper fire and exploding mines to pull a soldier out of a burning half-track. Because of his courage and valor, because of men who fought like him, because of the heroic efforts of the 101st Airborne. American forces fought successfully at Bastogne. Private Hendrix was later awarded a Medal of Honor for his selfless heroism. 
   When the skies cleared at the end of December, Allied air forces were able to assist the ground forces. By early January 1945, Allied forces began pushing Hitler's troops back. At the end of January, American troops made their way back to the lines they had held when the battle began. Three months later, Allied forces put an end to Nazi Germany. 
   Six hundred thousand American troops, 55,000 British soldiers, and other Allied participated in the Battle of the Bulge. With catastrophic casualties, the Army constantly had to find  new men to take the place of fallen soldiers. Training was cut. Physical standards were lowered. Many of these soldiers were only 18 or 19 years old. At the end of these forty-one days, over 80,000 American soldiers were maimed, captured, or killed. Nineteen thousand gave their lives to stave off the forces of tyranny. 
   They made sure that we could live in freedom today. I believe that Ronald Reagan put it well when he said. ``If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people of Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high. But we have never been unwilling to pay that price.'' 
   Mr. President, the soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge bought with their lives a precious gift for all Americans--freedom. it is this gift that we must continually cherish. 
   We cannot forget these sons, husbands, and fathers who died for our great country. We cannot forget their families, who endured through days of worry and nights of grief. We cannot forget those men who were exposed to blistering cold, to unyielding enemy fire--to this unimaginable nightmare. 
   For those who died at Ardennes--for those who were massacred at Malmedy--for those who won at Bastogne, we must remember their sacrifices. There is no more appropriate time than now, for the Senate and the Congress to honor those who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator WELLSTONE's amendment. I know that my friend and colleague from Minnesota is proposing this amendment with the welfare of America's family farmer in mind. I, too, think of America's family farmer, but I have concerns that placing a moratorium on agribusiness mergers and acquisitions now may do more harm in my State than good. This is an important issue and I commend Senator HATCH's willingness to hold hearings on this matter in the Antitrust Subcommittee. We need to have the time to carefully consider how agribusiness mergers and acquisitions affect America's producers. 
   I am very proud of the farmers in my State. Arkansas ranks in the top 10 rice, chicken, catfish, turkey, cotton, sorghum, eggs, and soybean producing States in America. Despite their productivity, there are fewer this season than last season. An ailing national agriculture economy has pushed many farmers to the breaking point. I visited 27 counties in Arkansas over the August recess and saw the strain on their faces and heard the frustration in their voices. Their deep concern for the future of farming comes from knowing that agriculture is the lifeblood of my State's economy. 
   Arkansas is dominated by small farms and cooperatives, but Arkansas is also home to national processors like Tyson Foods. I do not believe that we should trade the interests of one for another. Instead, we must develop a balanced policy that will help small farmers and not penalize those companies which are helping drive my State's agriculture recovery. In many communities, these cooperatives and agribusinesses are the foundation of the farm economy in that area. Right now, many of those communities are still hurting. That is why I am more concerned about the overall survivability of the cooperatives and agribusinesses in Arkansas than the possibility that some of them may someday decide to merge with a larger entity. In reality, if an agribusiness in Arkansas is struggling to stay alive, and Senator WELLSTONE's moratorium on agribusiness mergers and acquisitions is imposed, that greatly limits an ailing business' ability to sell to survive. In other words, if the owners of an agribusiness have only two choices to survive--either sell or declare bankruptcy--and the option to sell is denied, then their going out of business doesn't help anyone. 
   While America's farmers are slowly recovering from low commodity prices, high production costs and poor trade, I believe now is not the time to destabilize agribusinesses in Arkansas. On the other hand, I know that producers in many farm states have serious concerns about the impact larger agribusinesses, especially the meat processing industry, have on their ability to recover from poor prices. Let me be clear, I do not advocate inaction, but I am concerned that producers and processors in my state, both large and small, may be unintentionally harmed by the Wellstone amendment. 
   Many meat processing agribusinesses in Arkansas provide stability for producers and have good working relationships with them. Because most of their producers work under contract, both the agribusinesses and producers suffer when prices are low. Tyson Foods, known for their poultry processing, is involved in raising hogs. As the price for hogs began to fall, Tyson felt the financial strain of production without the ability to process. In the mind of Tyson's contract pork producers, the company's situation had reached a critical level when they received letters telling them that sustained low hog prices were forcing Tyson to only offer 30-day contracts. Producers were left wondering how they would pay off debt and survive if Tyson could not renew their contracts. Recently, Smithfield announced that it will be taking over Tyson's Pork Group, effectively stabilizing the future of Tyson's contract producers. Unlike Tyson who only raised hogs, Smithfield has the capacity to both raise and process their livestock. 
   Clearly, if Senator WELLSTONE's moratorium on mergers and acquisitions was in pace at the time of the Smithfield acquistion of Tyson's Pork Group, contract producers would still be living under a cloud of uncertainty in an ailing hog market. With that in mind, I encourage my colleagues to vote against the Wellstone amendment so that Senator HATCH may be afforded  the time to thoroughly address the impact agribusiness mergers and acquisitions are having on the American family farmer.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate amendment 2771 to S. 625 because it will provide additional federal resources to combat the dramatic increase in the production, use and distribution of methamphetamine which I believe must be stopped. 
   Methamphetamine is particularly insidious because it is highly addictive, cheap, easy to produce and distribute, popular with youth, and tends to make its users paranoid and violent. Thus, crimes like burglaries, theft, shoplifting, robberies, and murder can be traced to methamphetamine use. In fact, the prosecuting attorney of my home county, Benton County, Arkansas, estimates that 70% of the felony court docket is directly or indirectly related to methamphetamine. Another, often-forgotten but tragic problem which accompanies methamphetamine use is child abuse. Children of methamphetamine users have specific problems associated with their parents' drug addictions: medical, environmental, and educational neglect; malnutrition; and sometimes physical abuse. According to child welfare workers, parents who use meth are more likely to physically abuse their children than parents who use other drugs. 
   Methamphetamine is a serious and growing problem in my home state of Arkansas because the state of Arkansas possesses many of the characteristics which allow drug trafficking to flourish: it is sparsely populated with remote areas; it suffers from a high rate of poverty and joblessness and a low per capita income; it has a large population of illegal immigrants; and it has two major interstate highways which facilitate the transportation of drugs to Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Memphis, St. Louis, and throughout the rest of the nation. 
   The rapid increase and magnitude of the methamphetamine problem is illustrated in my home state's experience. In 1995, the Arkansas State Police seized 24 methamphetamine labs; in 1996, the number of labs seized more than tripled to 95, then more than tripled again to 242 in 1997, and doubled again to 434 labs in 1998. Recently, the DEA identified Arkansas as one of the top three methamphetamine-producing states in the nation, based on per-capita figures. The growth of the methamphetamine problem in my home state is also seen by the increase in the amount spent to clean up clandestine lab sites, which is one of the most dangerous activities law enforcement officers must undertake. In 1998, $567,000 was spent on clandestine lab cleanups associated with federal agencies in Arkansas whereas five years before, only $71,000 was expended. 
   I support this amendment because it provides an additional $15 million a year to the Office of National Drug Control Policy to facilitate the hiring of federal, state, and local enforcement personnel to combat methamphetamine trafficking in designated HIDTAs. It is my hope that such an increase will result in the designation of additional HIDTAs in areas, like my home state, where the greatest increase in the methamphetamine problem is occurring. I also support this amendment because of the additional $9.5 million it provides to enable the DEA to hire new agents to help state and local enforcement officials in the small and mid-sized towns with limited resources where methamphetamine is so often found to conduct more methamphetamine investigations. This amendment also will provide an additional $5.5 million for the DEA to train state and local law enforcement officials in one of their most dangerous duties, the cleanup of methamphetamine labs. 
   Finally, I wish to commend and thank Senators HATCH, ASHCROFT, GRASSLEY, and my other colleagues who have worked so tirelessly on this bill and to address the methamphetamine problem and urge my colleagues to pass this amendment.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today before the Senate to praise one of the true heroes of the civil rights movement, Daisy Bates. In her death yesterday at age 84, America has lost one of the most courageous advocates for justice and equality between races. 
   Daisy Bates' life was one of conviction and resolve. Her character was a model of grace and dignity. 
   Mrs. Bates was born in 1914, the small town of Huttig, Arkansas in the southern part of the state. Her life was touched by the violence of racial hatred at a young age, when her mother was killed while resisting the advances of three white men. Her father left soon thereafter, and Daisy was raised by friends of her family. 
   Daisy moved to Little rock and married L.C. Bates, a former newspaperman, in 1942. For eighteen years, the two published the Arkansas State Press, the largest black newspaper in the state. The Arkansas State Press was an influential voice in the state of Arkansas which played a key role in the civil rights movement. Daisy and L.C. used the State Press to focus attention on issues of inequity in the criminal justice system, police brutality and segregation. 
   In 1952, Daisy was elected president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It was from this position that she was thrust into the national spotlight, as a leader during the crisis of Central High School in 1957, when black students attempting to enter the school were blocked by rioters and the National Guard. 
   Throughout the crisis, the Little Rock Nine would gather in her tiny home before and after school to strategize about their survival. It was her home from which the Little Rock Nine were picked up from every morning by federal troops to take them to Central High, to face the rioters and the hatred. It was her home that was attacked by the segregationists. 
   Even after the Little Rock Nine finally received federal protection to attend Central High, Daisy Bates continued to face violence and harassment. Threats were made against her life. Bombs made of dynamite were thrown at her house. KKK crosses were burned on her lawn. On two separate occasions, her house was set on fire and all the glass in the front of the house was broken out. 
   It's hard to imagine how difficult it must have been for Daisy Bates to continue pursuing her convictions under such circumstances, but her perseverance is true testament to the strength of her character. Despite the violence, harassment and intimidation, Daisy Bates would not be deterred. She spent several more decades actively advancing the cause of civil rights, and helped the town of Mitchellville, Arkansas to elect its first black mayor and city council. 
   I am saddened that Mrs. Bates will not be on hand next week when the Little Rock Nine is presented the Congressional Medal of Honor. That honor is truly one that belongs to her, the woman who shepherded those brave young men and women through those extremely difficult days forty years ago. My prayers go out to the family and the many friends of Daisy Bates. I know that God is throwing open the gates of heaven today for Daisy, a woman who helped so many others enter doors that were once barred to them.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this legislation to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his passionate, eloquent, and articulate explanation in defense of this legislation. 
   I had the privilege of presiding during Senator SANTORUM's statement. I cannot say as well, I cannot say as passionately what the Senator from Pennsylvania said so very well in explaining the need for this legislation and why we are taking the time on the floor of the Senate to debate it and to vote on it. I am here so he might not stand alone, and he does not stand alone. 
   There will be better than 60 percent of the Senate voting for this legislation, and better than 80 percent of the American people support a ban on this horrible procedure. But this is not a subject, it is not a topic, it is not an issue about which people like to talk. It is not something Senators feel comfortable coming down and talking about; it is not something I feel comfortable talking about, but I do think it is very important. 
   Once again, I commend my colleague for the leadership he has shown on this issue. 
   Mr. President, the Nation was shaken with a sense of disbelief over 5 years ago in 1994 when we discovered that a young mother in South Carolina, Susan Smith, had murdered her own children and then pretended they had been kidnapped. 
   In my home State of Arkansas, in recent days, a young woman in her ninth month of pregnancy was savagely attacked by three young men who had been hired by the woman's boyfriend and the father of her unborn child to force her to lose her baby. That was the reason he contracted with these thugs, to, in effect, murder that unborn child. They beat her with severe blows to her stomach and explicitly told her that their intent was to kill her child, a child the father did not want. 
   As we were dealing with the shock of this gruesome tragedy, we learned of a Memphis man who confessed to driving across the river last summer into the Arkansas Delta with his wife and throwing the couple's 18-month-old child down into a 15-foot levee, leaving the child to die a slow and painful death of exposure to the elements. After this horrific event, the same couple allegedly returned 3 days later and drowned their other child in a pond. 
   Last month, the Washington papers were filled with the news of a Maryland man who stands accused of killing his two small children and then reporting their deaths as the result of a carjacking. 
   Unfortunately, these kinds of incidents become all too frequent today. The list goes on and on. 
   The question I raise is, Are the tragedies I have recounted, and the scores of others that could be enumerated, related to the debate that we are having about partial-birth abortion? 
   I know there are people who will howl there is no connection. There will be people who would object strenuously to even the suggestion being made that the all-too-frequent violence toward children could be related to a society's permissive attitude toward a procedure that would allow a baby to be partially born and then killed. 
   But I would suggest that, in fact, there is a connection; that violence begets violence; that dehumanizing one part of mankind contributes to the dehumanizing of all vulnerable human beings--whether they are the disabled, whether they are the elderly, or whether they are the newborn. 
   Many Americans were shocked--I was shocked--to hear of the Princeton professor of bioethics, who was recently hired, assumed a seat on the faculty at Princeton University, one of our most distinguished universities--a professor of bioethics, ironically--who said:  
   I do not think it is always wrong to kill an innocent human being. Simply killing an infant is never equivalent to killing a person.  
   A professor of bioethics, at a major American university, who can say that publicly and be defended. 
   The questions Senator SANTORUM posed a few moments ago to the Senator from California--well, Professor Singer would not have had difficulty in answering the questions that he posed. He simply says: It is not always wrong to kill an innocent human being. Killing an infant is not the equivalent of killing a person. 
   Is this where we are going? 
   This professor believes parents should be allowed, 28 days after the birth of a severely disabled child, to decide whether or not they want to kill the child or keep the child. 
   It was suggested earlier in the opening comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania that the debate we are having about this kind of procedure, 40 years ago, would have been unheard of in our society. No one can doubt that in this so-called age of enlightenment we have moved so far in what we view as acceptable in the area of taking the lives of those who are innocent. 
   I listened very closely to the objections to this legislation as I presided in  the chair during the opening statements of both sides earlier today. It seemed to me that every issue that was raised in opposition to this legislation was an effort to divert attention from the horror of this procedure. 
   There was the issue of the timing of the vote. Whether this vote occurs this week or whether this vote would have occurred last week or next week does not change the horror of what we are talking about; it does not change the terrible nature of a procedure that kills a child that is partially born. 
   I think every objection that has been raised is an effort to turn our attention away, divert our attention away from that chart that Senator SANTORUM had on the floor earlier today, which was far from being a cartoon but was very similar to medical charts. 
   Then there was the objection that we were practicing medicine; that the Senate was seeking to practice medicine; that we should not make this decision; that it is a decision that should be made within the profession. 
   It was Thomas Jefferson who said--and I will say it as close to his words as I can: The first and fundamental purpose of Government is the protection of innocent 
   human life. 
   There is no more fundamental goal and object of Government than the protection of its citizens, the protection of human life. We could not find a subject more relevant to what Government ought to be doing than this subject. 
   To say we should not be involved in it because it is a medical issue is simply an effort to divert us from what really is the issue; that is, whether human life should be protected by law or not. 
   It is always ironic to me that those who say Government should not be involved in this issue are the first to say Government should pay for this procedure, or at least abortions in general. 
   Then there was the argument that the courts may rule this unconstitutional; therefore we should not even be voting on this because the courts, and the Supreme Court eventually, might rule this legislation unconstitutional. 
   Isn't that ironic? Because I just listened to 4 days of debate in which the constitutionality of campaign finance reform proposals were argued on the floor of this Senate. No one said, well, we shouldn't even debate this proposal because the courts--in fact, the evidence is the courts have and will rule many portions of the so-called Shays-Meehan legislation unconstitutional as a violation of the first amendment--but it did not prevent us from having a healthy, prolonged debate about the need for campaign finance reform. 
   I think it is an absolute red herring to say: Well, ultimately when the Supreme Court makes a definitive ruling on this subject, they may or may not rule that it is constitutional. That, in no way, abrogates our responsibility to debate it and to pass legislation that we believe is not only constitutional but in the best interests of this country. 
   Then it was said: Well, we have had repeated votes on this before. We have had repeated votes on a lot of issues. The fact is, we have new Senators now. We are going to have some different votes. We voted repeatedly on campaign finance reform. It is a debate, I suspect, that will go on year after year. 
   Because we have voted on this legislation before is no reason that we should not, once again, raise what many believe is the fundamental moral issue facing our culture today; that is, the issue of life. 
   Senator SANTORUM so eloquently demonstrated the folly of where this ultimately leads. If killing an unborn child, who is partially delivered, with only his or her head still within the body of the mother, is legal, where then do we draw the line? Could we have a more basic, fundamental issue of gravity before this body than that? So time and time again we will hear, during the debate, the effort to take our attention away from where the focus should be, and that is unborn child and this horrible procedure. 
   Every effort will be made to bring up the timing of the vote, the issue of whether or not this is in our purview, the practicing of medicine, which, of course, is very much within our purview, this issue of human life; the fact of what the courts have ruled or may yet rule on this or similar legislation--all of these are efforts to take the Nation's eyes off what this legislation is all about, and that is eliminating a barbaric, uncivilized procedure that no right-minded person can surely defend. 
   It is a Federal crime to harm a spotted owl or a bald eagle or even its egg, but a helpless infant, completely dependent on its mother, is not accorded the same protections we afford the spotted owl or the bald eagle. 
   In this body--I say to my colleagues who say we shouldn't take the time of the Senate to debate this issue--in this body, we debated an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill that would have prohibited the use of steel leg hold traps. Perhaps that was a debate we should have had, but I believe it pales in comparison to the gravity and the seriousness of the issue we are now debating. We would protect the spotted owl, the bald eagle, or the inhuman practice of steel leg hold traps, but we have trouble protecting infants who are pulled from their mother's womb by the legs and killed. 
   One of the finest writers in this Nation, I believe, hails from the State of Arkansas. He is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist whose name is Paul Greenberg. He is one of the most brilliant and, I think, articulate defenders of human life I have ever had the opportunity to read. I want to read for the record a couple of short paragraphs from the many columns this Pulitzer Prize winner has written:  
   As always, verbal engineering has preceded social engineering. The least of these must be aborted in words before it becomes permissible to abort them in deed. Those whom we want out of the way must first be dehumanized or something within might hold us back.  
   I wonder why there was such objection to even the term ``partial-birth abortion.'' Clearly, it describes what this procedure is. I think the author, Mr. Greenberg, has said it right: We have to do the verbal engineering before we do the 
   social engineering, because to use the term ``partial-birth abortion'' suggests the humanity of that child. 
   Then Greenberg wrote:  
   What once would have inspired horror is now the mundane, even the scientific, the advanced, the enlightened. What once might have inspired dread is now sanctioned in the elastic name of constitutional right and individual freedom.  
   That is what we are hearing today. We are hearing the defense of an indefensible procedure, sanctioned in the elastic name of constitutional right and individual freedom. When a question is raised, it is simply: I support Roe v. Wade; that is our right. What an elastic right it has become, to defend under Roe v. Wade a procedure that no one, no civilized person, could suggest is either good medicine or humane practice. 
   I ask my colleagues to not be diverted from the issue but to think about the baby, think about the procedure, this horrible procedure, think about the pain that little baby feels, think about what kind of country we want to be. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, one of the highest compliments a person can receive is to be called a ``servant,'' someone who gives of himself for others. A man I've known for many years, a man of outstanding reputation, a man who has given a large part of his life in service to his neighbors, a man respected by his peers, is about to make a major change in his life. The people of the Fair State of Arkansas would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that change. 
   Andrew Whisenhunt of Bradley, in Lafayette County in southwest Arkansas, was born in the town of Hallsville, TX. However, his family moved to the Natural State while Andrew was still a baby. So, technically he is not a native. However, Andrew is an Arkansas through and through. 
   He has long been in the public eye. Yet, soon, Andrew will step down from the presidency of Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation after 13 years. A modern-day tiller of the soil, he has been a farmer for as long as he can remember--and his father before him. With loving support form his wife, Polly, and with help from his five children--Warren, Terri, Tim, Julie, and Bryan--Andrew has built the farm where he's lived almost all his life into what has been called a model of modern agriculture. And testimony to that has been the Whisenhunts' selection as ``Arkansas Farm Family of the Year'' in 1970, and Andrew's choice as ``Progressive Farmer Magazine's Man of the Year in Arkansas Agriculture'' in 1984. 
   His love for his chosen profession has carried him far beyond the fence rows of his 2,000-acre cotton, rice, soybean, and wheat-and-feed grain operation. The journey began when he joined Lafayette County Farm Bureau in 1955. By the time Andrew was elected to the Board of Directors of Arkansas Farm Bureau in 1968, he had served in almost every office in his county organization, including president. In his early years on the Farm Bureau State board, he worked on several key board panels, including the Executive and Building committees. (The latter's work resulted in construction of Farm Bureau Center in Little Rock in 1978.) 
   His fellow board members thought enough of his personal industry and leadership abilities that they elected him their secretary-treasurer in 1976, an office he filled for 10 years. During that time, Andrew also was active outside the Farm Bureau arena as, among other things, a charter member of Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board, and as a former president of both the American Soybean Development Foundation and the Arkansas Association of Soil Conservation Districts. Then he was elected president of Arkansas Farm Bureau in 1986. 
   During his tenure, the organization has enjoyed unprecedented growth in membership, influence and prestige. When Andrew accepted the mantle of top leadership, Farm Bureau represented some 121,000 farm and rural families in the State. Today, that figure stands at almost 215,000--and Arkansas has become the 8th largest Farm Bureau of the 50 States and Puerto Rico. 
   As Arkansas Farm Bureau has grown, Andrew's leadership has done likewise. As an influential member of American Farm Bureau Federation's Executive Committee, he has traveled far and wide as an advocate not just for Arkansas farmers, but to advance American interests in international trade and relations. He was a member of the Farm Bureau delegation that visited Russia after the Iron Curtain shredded, to experience that nation's agriculture firsthand and to offer help to farmers there. Andrew also was a key player in delegations to China, Japan, and the Far East, and to South America. He was among U.S. farm leaders who traveled to Cuba recently to see how trade with that nation might be re-established. He even led a group of Arkansas farm leaders first to pre-NAFTA Mexico; then to deliver rice the Farm Bureau had donated to a Central American village devastated by Hurricane Mitch. 
   Andrew's influence and tireless work ethic embrace the nonfarm sector as well. His service to his local community includes county and city school boards, his local hospital board, the Bradley Chamber of Commerce and his church. He also is a board member of Florida College in Tampa. 
   When Andrew steps down as president of Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation in December, the members of that great organization will miss him greatly. But he has never been one to sit still, and chances are, that won't change. As the new century unfolds, Farm Bureau's loss undoubtedly will be a gain somewhere else for all Arkansans.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for a provision by Senator ASHCROFT included in the Senate version of the Agricultural Appropriations Act for FY2000. This provision passed with 70 votes in the Senate but it was subsequently stripped out of the conference report after the conference stalled and never reconvened. 
   The Ashcroft provision is simple. It substantially curtails the use of unilateral sanctions of food and medicines without removing them absolutely from the palette of foreign policy options. If the President decided to include food and medicine in future sanctions, he would have to receive the approval of Congress, through an expedited procedure. 
   Mr. President, American farmers have spoken and they want help. In the past year, cotton prices have tumbled 46 percent and wheat is down more than 60 percent. Corn sells for as low as $1.50 for a bushel in some places. It is not surprising that net farm income dropped almost one billion dollars between 1996 and 1998. Storms and drought have destroyed our Nation's crops. We must help our struggling farmers out of this crisis. 
   The farmers in my home State of Arkansas have made it clear to me that one measure needed to help them out of the current crisis is an expansion of export markets. Indeed, our farmers are missing out on millions of dollars in exports each year. It is estimated that agricultural sanctions have robbed U.S. farmers out of an estimated ten percent of the world wheat market and half a billion dollars in sales. Before agricultural sanctions were placed on Cuba in 1963, that country was the largest U.S. export market  for rice, taking more than 50 percent of total rice exports. Even today, American farmers are losing out to farmers in Canada, Europe, and Asia who sell $600 million worth of food products to Cuba. 
   While President Clinton issued an executive order in April of this year allowing food and medicine sales to Sudan, Libya, and Iran, these sales would still face significant restrictions. Sales would be licensed on a case-by-case basis and made only to non-governmental entities. In some cases, where there are no non-governmental entities buying food for the people, no sales could be made. 
   It is true that the regimes that are sanctioned from food and medicine, including the governments of the Sudan, Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Cuba, are reprehensible. But we must also consider the populations of the these countries--people with whom we have no argument, people who are starving, people who are sick because they do not have enough food or medicine. While governments may intentionally withhold food and medicine from their populations, both to foster anti-American sentiment and to keep the people under subjection, we benefit no one by denying our farmers the opportunity to sell their crops. If we allow these sales--if we rein back our food and medicine sanctions, then we leave these regimes without an excuse for not providing their people with food. We close off a channel of resentment and make clear to people living under repression that their government is solely responsible for leaving them hungry. And we leave these governments with less money for weapons. Senator ASHCROFT's provision accomplishes all of these things. 
   Mr. President, I am not arguing for a provision that has been defeated and will never reappear. Let me say again that the Senate passed this provision with 70 votes. I am confident that it will advance this legislation favorably again.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes to speak in opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I also sat through a week of hearings last week. I also, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, had the opportunity to hear our intelligence community, to hear representatives from the Department of Defense, and to hear the Directors of our laboratories. I respectfully reached a different conclusion as to what the evidence is. In fact, in my estimation, the evidence is strong enough to raise serious doubts about the wisdom of ratifying this treaty. The evidence, I believe, indicates that in fact Russia is currently testing low-level nuclear weapons and is seeking to develop, from their own public statements and the Russian media, a new type of tactical weapon, and there were suspected Russian tests as recently as September 8, 1999, and September 23, 1999. 
   I believe when we have these kinds of issues of the gravest weight to our Nation and to our Nation's security, when there are doubts about verification--and I think it is overwhelmingly clear from what I heard from the intelligence community--we cannot have assurance that we will be able to verify a zero-yield treaty. That was very plain and very clear from the testimony we heard. Verification is not possible. Therefore, it is not in the best interests of our Nation to ratify this treaty. 
   There are numerous reasons to oppose the treaty. We have heard many of them during the debate on the floor of the Senate. Many have been discussed very clearly. I will focus on one particular feature of this agreement which, in my view, is sufficient in and of itself to reject ratification of this treaty. That is the issue of the treaty's duration. 
   This is an agreement of unlimited duration. It is an agreement that is in perpetuity. That means if it is ratified, the United States will be committing itself forever not to conduct another nuclear test. It would make us dependent upon, totally reliant upon, the Stockpile Stewardship Program. From what we heard from the Directors of the labs last week, the Stockpile Stewardship Program is, by all accounts, a work in progress. Some said it would take 5 years to reach the point where we could have confidence in the program; some said 10. One said it would be as long as 15 to 20 years before we could know whether or not this program was going to be of a sufficient confidence level that we could count upon it without reliance upon tests. 
   There are two major questions about this program. One is, Will it work? We are not going to know that for many years. Will it work sufficiently that we can rely upon high-speed computers and modeling and annual examinations without any kind of test to have the confidence that they are reliant and safe and that, should they tragically ever need to be used, we could count on them actually working? 
   The second very big issue is whether it will be funded adequately so the program can be developed to that level of confidence. We have every indication that this will be an area in which Congress in the future will seek to cut, an area in which there will not be the kind of commitment, the kind of resources to ensure the development of this Stockpile Stewardship Program to a point we can have absolute confidence in it. 
   I want Members to think about the duration of this treaty--forever. Are we so confident today that we will never again need nuclear testing, so certain that we are willing to deprive all future Commanders in Chief, all future military leaders, all future Congresses of the one means that can actually prove the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent? Are we that confident? I suggest we are not. 
   Proponents of the treaty will say that that is not the case, that this commitment is not forever. They will point to the fact that the treaty allows for withdrawal if our national interest requires it. Proponents of the treaty promise that if we reach a point where the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent cannot be guaranteed without testing, then all we need to do is exercise our right to withdraw and we would, at that point, resume testing. 
   This so-called ``supreme national interest'' clause, along with safeguard F, in which President Clinton gives us his solemn word that he will ``consider'' a resumption of testing if our deterrent cannot be certified, is supposed to give us a sense of reassurance. 
   The fact is, this reassurance is a hollow promise. I think supporters of the treaty realize it. The fact is, if the critical moment arrives and there is irrefutable evidence that we must conduct nuclear testing to ensure our deterrent is safe, reliable, and credible, those same treaty supporters will be shouting from the highest mountain that the very act of withdrawing from this treaty would be too provocative to ever be  justified, that no narrow security need of the United States could ever override the solemn commitment we made to the world in agreeing to be bound by this treaty. 
   If Members don't believe that will happen, they need only to look at our current difficulties with the 1972 ABM Treaty. I believe it provides a chilling glimpse of our nuclear future should we ratify an ill-conceived test ban at this time. As is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the ABM Treaty is of unlimited duration. There are many parallels. That is one of them. The ABM Treaty includes a provision allowing the United States to withdraw if our national interests so demand, another very clear parallel 
   and treaty obligations are more clearly mismatched than with the ABM Treaty today. It is very difficult to imagine a situation in which the national security interests we have could be more clearly mismatched than with the ABM Treaty. Its supporters insist, though, that withdrawal is not just ill advised, but supporters would say it is unthinkable. The voices wailing loudest about changing this obsolete agreement are the same ones urging us today to entangle ourselves in another treaty of unlimited duration. 
   Earlier, Senator KYL rightly pointed out that the negotiators for this treaty originally wanted a 10-year treaty. Previous Presidents wanted a treaty of limited duration, but we have before us one that would lock us into a commitment in perpetuity. 
   Think of the ways in which the ABM Treaty is mismatched with our modern security needs. Yet we confront our absolute unwillingness to consider any option to withdraw. The treaty was conceived in a strategic context utterly unlike today's, a bipolar world in which two superpowers were engaged in both a global rivalry and an accompanying buildup in strategic nuclear forces. Now, today, is a totally different context and situation. One of those superpowers no longer exists at all. What remains of that superpower struggles to secure its own borders against poorly armed militants. 
   The arms race that supposedly justified the ABM Treaty's perverse deification of vulnerability has not just halted, it has reversed, no thanks to arms control. Today, Russian nuclear forces are plummeting due not to the START II agreement--which Russia has refused to ratify for nearly 7 years--but to economic constraints and the end of the cold war. In fact, their forces are falling far faster than treaties can keep up with; arms control isn't ``controlling'' anything; economic and strategic considerations are. Similar forces have led the United States to conclude that its forces can also be reduced. Thus, despite a strategic environment completely different from the one that gave birth to the ABM Treaty, its supporters stubbornly insist we must remain a party to it. 
   In 1972, only the Soviet Union had the capability to target the United States with long-range ballistic missiles. Today, numerous rogue states are diligently working to acquire long-range missiles with which to coerce the United States or deter it from acting in its interests, and these weapons are so attractive precisely because we have no defense against them; indeed, we are legally prohibited from defending against them by the ABM Treaty of 1972. 
   Technologically, too, the ABM Treaty is obsolete. The kinetic kill vehicle that destroyed an ICBM high over the Pacific Ocean on October 2 was undreamed of in 1972. So was the idea of a 747 equipped with a missile-killing laser, which is under construction now in Washington State, or space-based tracking satellites like SBIRS-Low, so precise that they may make traditional ground-based radars superfluous in missile defense. Yet this ABM Treaty, negotiated almost three decades ago, stands in the way of many of these technological innovations that could provide the United States with the protection it needs against the world's new threats. 
   Now proponents of this new treaty will say we can always pull out, that if situations and circumstances change, we can always invoke our national security provision and we can withdraw from this treaty. If in the future we find we must 
   test in order to ensure the stability and reliability and safety of our nuclear deterrent, we can pull out and do that. I suggest that that is not even a remote possibility. Once we make this commitment, just as we did on the 1972 ABM Treaty, there will be no withdrawing, there will not even be consideration of the possibility that it might be in our national interest to withdraw from a treaty to which we have made a commitment. 
   These new threats today have led to a consensus that the United States must deploy a national missile defense system and a recognition that we are behind the curve in deploying one. The National Missile Defense Act, calling for deployment of such a system as soon as technologically feasible, passed this body by a vote of 97-3, with a similar ratio of support in the House. 
   Just as obvious as the need for this capability is the fact that the ABM Treaty prohibits us from deploying the very system we voted to deploy. But does anybody talk about withdrawing from the ABM Treaty because it is in our national security interests? Absolutely not. I suggest we will be in the same kind of context should we ratify the treaty that is before us today. 
   Clearly, the ABM Treaty must be amended or jettisoned. The Russians have so far refused to consider amending it, so withdrawal is the most obvious course of action if United States security interests are to be served. 
   Listen to the hue and cry at even the mention of such an option today. From Russia to China to France, and even to here on the floor of the Senate, we have heard the cry that the United States cannot withdraw from the ABM Treaty because it has become too important to the world community. Those who see arms control as an end in itself oppose even the consideration of withdrawal, claiming passionately that the United States owes it to the world to remain vulnerable to missile attack. Our participation in this treaty transcends narrow U.S. security interests, they claim; we have a higher obligation to the international community, they claim. After all, if the United States is protected from attack, won't that just encourage others to build more missiles in order to retain the ability to coerce us, thus threatening the simplistic ideal of ``strategic stability''? That phrase, translated, means that citizens of the United States must be vulnerable to incineration or attack by biological weapons so other nations in the world may do as they please. 
   Even though the ABM Treaty is hopelessly outdated--almost 30 years old--and prevents the United States from defending its citizens against the new threats of the 21st century, supporters of arms control insist that withdrawal is unthinkable. Its very existence is too important to be overridden by the mere security interests of the United States. 
   Absurd as such a proposition sounds, it is the current policy of this administration, and it is supported by the very same voices who now urge us to ratify this comprehensive test ban. 
   The Clinton administration has been reluctantly forced by the Congress into taking serious action on missile defenses--thankfully. It admits that the system it needs to meet our security requirements cannot be deployed under the ABM Treaty. Yet so powerful are the voices calling on the United States to subjugate its own security interests to arms control that the administration is proposing changes to the ABM Treaty that, by 
   its own admission, will not allow a missile defense system that will meet our requirements. It has declared what must be done as ``too hard to do'' and intends to leave the mess it created for another administration to clean up. All because arms control becomes an end in itself. 
   That sorry state of affairs is where we will end up if the Senate consents to ratification of the CTBT. Those treaty supporters who are saying now, ``Don't worry, there is an escape clause,'' will be the same ones who, 5 or 10 years from now--when there is a problem with our stockpile and the National Ignition Facility is not finished and we find out we overestimated our ability to simulate the workings of a nuclear weapon--will be saying we dare not withdraw from this treaty because we owe a higher debt to the international community. That is what we will hear. 
   I don't represent the international community; I represent the people of the State of Arkansas. Our decision here must serve the best interests of  the United States and its citizens. Our experience with the ABM Treaty is a perfect example of how arms control agreements assume an importance far beyond their contribution to the security of our Nation. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's unlimited duration is a virtual guarantee that this agreement will prevent us from conducting nuclear testing long past the point at which we decide such testing is necessary. As our ABM experience shows, we should take no comfort from the presence of a so-called ``supreme national interest'' clause. 
   Now, should we just put it off or should we vote on it? I believe our responsibility is not the world opinion. Our responsibility is, frankly, not the public opinion polls of the United States. The American people, as a whole, have not had the benefit of hearing the Directors of our National Labs or the DOD come and testify before us as to the difficulties of verification and the difficulties of developing our Stockpile Stewardship Program. If it is a flawed treaty--and I believe it is--if it is a defective treaty--and I believe it is--if it is not in our national security interest--and I believe it is not--then we should vote, and we should vote to defeat the treaty and not ratify it. 
   This is a treaty that I believe will not get better with age. It will not get better by putting it on a shelf for consideration at some future date. I believe it is flawed. I believe it is defective. I believe it is not in our national security interest. I believe it is our constitutional responsibility not to put it off but to vote our conscience. 
   I urge the defeat of what I believe is a flawed treaty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment about why I think this amendment is so important. 
   When I travel through Arkansas and with the opportunities I have had to be in other parts of the country where we have had hearings on workforce protections, one of the complaints I hear so frequently from my constituents is that regulatory agencies in general exceed the authority that has been delegated by the Congress. One of the frustrations I hear expressed from so many small businesspeople and others is: If you in the Senate and the House are the ones elected by us to represent us, why do these regulatory agencies seem to go off on their own, contrary to what you have expressed in legislation? 
   It is a question that is always difficult to answer. Frankly, too often we have allowed, whether it be OSHA or the IRS, regulatory agencies to exceed their statutory authority, and we have done an insufficient job in reining in what they are doing. 
   In this particular case, I think we see exactly that. OSHA is an agency to which we have delegated power. It seems to be determined to extend its regulatory power in a negative way through the imminent implementation of this ergonomic standard, regardless of that standard's effectiveness in protecting workers or its cost to American industry. 
   So, yes, there is an issue of safety; yes, there is an issue of cost; and, yes, there is an issue of what is the scientific basis for what OSHA is propounding to do. 
   So often what we find regulatory agencies doing ends up having unintended consequences which the Congress must go back and try to rectify at some later date or which results in a reversal of the rulemaking process in these various agencies. 
   We have already heard, in evidence presented on the floor of the Senate today, that there is concern that a premature ergonomic standard could have counterproductive consequences. 
   I say to my colleagues, if you are concerned about the health and welfare of the American workplace, if you are concerned about the safety of the American worker, then let's be sure that when OSHA implements a rule, they do so with a sound scientific basis for what they are doing. 
   Now, I don't know. If we can't count on the nonpartisan, highly respected Congressional Research Service, then who do we look to? That is why we pay them. That is why we have established them. They are well-respected. This is what they said. Senator NICKLES earlier quoted part of the CRS report. Let me quote an additional part of what they said. They said:  
   ..... because of the wide variety of tasks, equipment, stresses and injuries involved, any comprehensive standard would probably have to be complex and costly.  
   They continue:  
   ..... ergonomics is a difficult issue because, while there is substantial evidence of a problem, it is very complex and only partially understood.  
   I think it is not prudent to move forward with a rule when the CRS has concluded the issue is complex and we do not understand it. It is only partially understood. How can you implement a rule that is in the best interest of the American worker, much less the American economy, if we do not understand what the problem is and we can only acknowledge it is partially understood and it is complex? 
   As an example, the CRS cites that while a whole ``host of new products and services have become popular--such as back braces and newly designed keyboards--there is little in the way of scientific evidence about whether they do any good.'' 
   What the opponents of this amendment are suggesting is that though we do not understand the issue, though it is acknowledged to be complex, though the CRS says we have a host of new products and services out there but there is no scientific evidence as to whether they do any good or not, we should nonetheless give the green light for OSHA to move ahead in a rulemaking process without substantial scientific basis for that rule. 
   Proponents of the ergonomics standard claim this issue has been adequately studied, if not overstudied--and that is what my friend and colleague from Minnesota was just saying--but it is simply not the case. 
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, after conducting an extensive review of the literature, stated that there are ``huge, fundamental gaps in our understanding'' which ``make it clear how little we really know about ergonomics.'' 
   So those who would say, well, we have studied it--we have studied it and studied it--we have studied it enough, so let's go ahead with the rule, they are ignoring the basic conclusion, the overwhelming conclusion of the evidence and the literature on this issue, which concludes we simply do not understand ergonomics. 
   There are ``huge, fundamental gaps in our understanding.'' 
   To my colleagues, I say it is for that reason that the Congress wisely, I believe, last year, in the omnibus appropriations bill, appropriated $890,000 so that we could fill those huge, fundamental gaps in our understanding concerning the issue of ergonomics--$890,000 for a more thorough review of literature by the National Academy of Sciences, a thorough study by the NAS, which, if there is a more respected group than the CRS, certainly in the area of science, it would be the NAS. 
   We want a rule, but we want a rule to be based upon good science, not something that is moved forward without adequate study and without adequate scientific basis, that could have negative impacts upon workers, and certainly will have negative impacts upon the workplace and the economics of the workplace. 
   Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that we authorized, we spent, we appropriated $890,000, OSHA has refused to wait for the results of that study. They already released a discussion draft of the ergonomic standard in February of this year. 
   I simply find it inexplicable why OSHA cannot wait for this definitive study to be completed. To me, it does not seem prudent to rush to judgment. To me, it does not seem prudent to rush 
   to implement a rule without knowing exactly what the consequence  of that rule would be, how much it would help workers, or how much it might hurt workers, or exactly how much of a burden it would be to businesses. We do not know the answers to those questions. We need to know the answers before we allow OSHA to move forward with the rule. 
   Finally, I do not know that I can justify to my constituents in Arkansas, and to the average Arkansas worker who makes a median income of $27,000, how the Federal Government effectively wasted $890,000 of their hard-earned tax dollars by not even waiting for the completion of this study. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to adopt the Bond amendment and make OSHA await the outcome of the NAS study so they can devise an ergonomics standard that will be effective in protecting American workers without unnecessarily burdening American businesses. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the Communist party celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the People's Republic of China on October 1. Unfortunately, many Chinese people had little reason to celebrate. Indeed, this was not a celebration of the Chinese people but an orchestrated celebration of the Communist party--a party of purges. 
   From the formative decade of Yenan, where the party was headquartered, and Mao Tse-tung soundly crushed challenges to his power, to the killing of hundreds of landlords in the 1950s; to the anti-rightist purging of half a million people following the Hundred Flowers period and during the Great Leap Forward; to the Cultural Revolution, during which millions were murdered or died in confinement; to the massacre at Tiananmen square just ten years ago--the Communist party under Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping sustained its existence not by the consent of the people, but through the violent elimination of dissent. 
   Even today, we see the party of purges in action on a daily basis. The Communist party under Jiang Zemin is deeply engaged in a piercing campaign to silence the voices of faith and freedom--to purge from society, anyone they see as a threat to their power. The Chinese government continues to imprison members of the Chinese Democracy Party. In August, the government sentenced Liu Xianbin to thirteen years in prison on charges of subversion. His real crime was his desire for democracy. Another Democracy Party member, Mao Qingxiang, was formally arrested in September after being held in detention since June. He will likely languish in prison for ten years because of his desire to be free. I could go on, but some human rights groups estimate that there could be as many as 10,000 political prisoners suffering in Chinese prisons. The party is determined to purge from society those people it finds unsavory. 
   And the Chinese government will not tolerate people worshiping outside its official churches. So when it began cracking down on the Falun Gong meditation group, which it considers a cult, the government used this inexcusable action to perpetrate another--an intensified assault on Christians. In August, the government arrested thirty-one Christian house church members in Henan province. Henan province must be a wellspring of faith because over 230 Christians have been arrested there since October. Now I am concerned that eight of these House church leaders may face execution if they are labeled and treated as leaders of a cult. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that the eyes of the international community are watching. I hope that these peaceful people will be released. 
   In the months leading up to this fiftieth anniversary celebration, everything and everyone were swept aside to cast a glamorous light on the Communist party. But the reality was quite ugly. Hundreds of street children, homeless, and mentally and physically disabled people were rounded up and forced into Custody and Repatriation centers across the country. There they were beaten, they were given poor food in unsanitary conditions, and they had to pay rent. 
   In fact, only 500,000 carefully selected citizens were allowed to participate in the celebration in Beijing. Non-Beijing residents could not enter the city and migrant workers were sent home. They did not see the Communist Party in all its glory, as it displayed the DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile and other arms, nor did they see the tanks rolling past Tiananmen Square. And Tibetans in Lhasa, who certainly did not want to celebrate, were forced to participate under threat of losing their pay or their pensions. Mr. President, this was a celebration of the party, not the people. 
   But this gilded celebration will not obscure the corrosion beneath. We must recognize the nature of this corrupt regime. We must never turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to cries of those suffering in China. We must face reality when we deal with the Chinese government. 
   So when Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin courts President Jiang Zemin even when Time Magazine's China issue is banned, when our top executives are silent on human rights, when we put profit over principle, we are shielding our eyes from the stark reality of persecution in China. As Ronald Reagan said, ``..... we demean the valor of every person who struggles for human dignity and freedom. And we also demean all those who have given that last full measure of devotion.'' 
   It is my sincere hope and desire that in the next fifty years, the Chinese people will truly have something to celebrate. I hope that they will no longer be suppressed by a regime that extracts dissent like weeds from a garden, but that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of a government accountable to the people. I hope that the self-congratulatory shouts of the Communist party will be drowned out by the voices of a free people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to the appropriations bill on Labor-HHS. I think it is one that should be easy for Members to support. Let me very basically explain it, and then I will go into more detail. 
   This would shift $25.472 million from the National Labor Relations Board to the Consolidated Health Centers Program. The $25.472 million is the increase in spending that has been added to the budget of the NLRB. I will explain this in further detail, but this would take that expense and shift it to what is a critical program for underserved areas in health care in this country. 
   The NLRB requested an increase of $25.472 million in funding for the fiscal year 2000. Their argument is they need that increase in funding to reduce their backlog in cases. However, when one looks at the situation at the NLRB and looks at their own statistics provided by the National Labor Relations Board, justification for an increase is simply not there. 
   In its annual report, the NLRB stated the number of cases that were pending before the NLRB declined from 37,249 in fiscal year 1997 to 34,664 in fiscal year  1998. The NLRB further reported the number of cases the NLRB is receiving declined from 39,618 in fiscal year 1997 to 36,657 in fiscal year 1998. 
   From their own statistics, it is clear that the National Labor Relations Board can fulfill its statutory mandate to administer the National Labor Relations Acts without the better than $25 million increase in funding. In fact, the NLRB did not receive an increase last year and was not only able to fulfill their mandate but achieved these results which I have cited in seeing a decrease in the number of cases. 
   How is that possible? When adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 1998, while the NLRB budget declined by 21 percent, the number of charges received and processed has declined by 31 percent. While the NLRB can rightly say they have had a declining budget, if you look at the number of charges they have received and processed, it has had an even more dramatic decline. 
   In his statement before the House Subcommittee on Labor-HHS, on March 25, the NLRB general counsel, Fred Feinstein, stated that the NLRB has adopted a program called Impact Analysis through which the NLRB has moved beyond the first-in-first-out approach in an effort to assure that the cases it gets to first are those that are central to its core mission. 
   He further stated that the Impact Analysis Program has allowed the NLRB to assure that its backlog consists of lower priority cases. Not only has the backlog decreased but the cases that are in their own system are not of a lower priority. 
   The NLRB estimates that of the 35,000 total charges filed each year, only approximately one-third--or 10,500--are found to have merit. The NLRB further estimates that of the 10,500 charges each year that are found to be meritorious, 86 percent--or 9,030--are settled. 
   Therefore, the NLRB adjudicates only approximately 4 percent--or 1,470--of the charges it receives each year. So over 35,000 total charges, less than 4 percent, or about 4 
   percent, are ever adjudicated. So from the NLRB's own numbers, only 10,500 of the 35,000 charges have merit and 65 percent of all unfair labor practice charges are dismissed or withdrawn. 
   Let me reiterate. Sixty-five percent of all unfair labor charges are dismissed or withdrawn because they are found to be without merit. 
   Where does that leave us as a body? How do we justify funding their request at better than a $25 million increase at a time that the number of cases is decreasing and the number of adjudications is down 40 percent? How do we justify that? 
   I know. I simply can't justify that. I think many of my colleagues will agree. 
   If a society can be judged by how it treats its less fortunate, if a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, then we must and the NLRB must make better use of resources and decide that we will tip the scales this time in favor of individuals, particularly children, who need health care. 
   That is why my amendment will shift $25.472 million from the NLRB to the Consolidated Health Centers. It is not a cut in NLRB funding but a shifting of what would have been an increase in their funding to a critically urgent program, the Consolidated Health Centers. 
   The Consolidated Health Centers Program is a Federal grant program funded under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act to provide for primary care health services in medically underserved areas throughout the United States. 
   I suspect that the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Kansas, knows well about these kinds of underserved areas. In my home State of Arkansas--we have many in the Mississippi Delta region--they are desperately in need of these kinds of community health clinics. Specifically, this program makes grants to public and nonprofit private entities for the development and operation of community, migrant, and homeless health centers. 
   Key to the mission of the Consolidated Health Centers Program is its recognition of the contours of our country and its diverse geography. Health care is needed in areas where economic, geographic, and cultural barriers limit access to primary health care for a substantial portion of the population. It might surprise a lot of folks, but today one-fifth of Americans live in rural areas. And many are in desperate need of health care. 
   I grew up in a little town of 894. It is now up to 1,300. It is in a rural part of Arkansas. I wouldn't trade that place for growing up for any place in the world. But I know that while we have serenity, we have low crime--we had wide open spaces to run on the farm, and it was a wonderful place to grow up--there are also a lot of amenities most people take for granted which we didn't have. Whether it is in Kansas or Arkansas or Iowa, people living in those rural areas may be willing for the benefits they receive not to have the metro system, not to have a nice theater, not have the grand malls, and some of the things we enjoy so much in the Nation's Capital. 
   However, the tragedy is not only do they give up those amenities but too often in Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, across the Mississippi Delta and other rural areas, they also give up opportunities because of the economic deprivation of some of the areas that have good quality health care. Indeed, some don't have adequate health care facilities at all, while we take for granted such areas as the Pentagon City Mall, Tysons Corner, full service hospitals, dental centers, podiatrists, chiropractors, virtually a doctor for every part of your body. 
   But that does not happen in the Mississippi Delta, rural Kansas, or Iowa. These health centers provide access to basic yet essential health services, including preventive health and dental services, acute and chronic care services, appropriate hospitalization, and specialty referrals. These centers are the safety net providers for those who fall through the cracks in our current health insurance marketplace. We may fight and we may argue on the floor of this Senate as to what we should do about managed care reform, what we should do about providing health care for those uninsured, but we don't need to argue about the need to increase funding for these vital community health centers. They are the ultimate safety net in our society. 
   Health centers provide health care to people regardless of their ability to pay. By law they serve anyone who walks in through their doors--rich or poor, insured or not. Of the clients received by community health centers, 44 percent are children, 66 percent have incomes below poverty level. That is the issue before the Senate in this amendment: Are we going to fund more bureaucracy at the NLRB at a time they have a declining number of cases or are we going to shift the increase for small rural communities desperately in need of greater health care? In Arkansas alone, 41 health centers currently serve 80,000 Arkansans. Once again, 44 percent are children and two-thirds have incomes below the poverty level. 
   Last month, during our August recess, I had the opportunity to visit 13 counties in the delta region. They are the poorest of the poor. They don't need a handout, but they need a helping hand, especially in the area of health care. I recently visited a new health clinic in Parkin, AR, made possible through a grant in this program, Consolidated Health Centers Program. I commend all the dedicated public servants and health care professionals at the Parkin Medical Clinic and all of the health centers in Arkansas for the invaluable contributions they make to their communities and commitment to improving public health. 
   At a time when the number of uninsured in our country is over 40 million and growing, the community health centers play a pivotal role in providing care to those who need it most, the uninsured. By spending $25 million more for the health centers, we will enable them to serve 83,000 more people. That won't cover the expected need, but it is a step in the right direction. They say they need $264 million more to maintain current levels of coverage and care. Last year, we increased funding by $100 million for the health centers. Senator SPECTER--and I applaud his efforts in this appropriations bill--increases funding for the health centers by $99 million in addition. That is a good start, but they say in order to maintain current service they need $264 million. 
   I believe this is a good investment and it is an easy choice. The choice is funding more bureaucracy at the NLRB  at a time caseload is falling or shifting that increase to the communities, to the 
   deprived and neglected communities of this country in which there is a high percentage of uninsured and a high percentage of children who don't have access to health care. We can help that situation and provide tens of thousands of people health care by the simple passage of this amendment. 
   How much time remains?

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just respond to the Senator from Iowa. 
   I do not know who he spoke to at the health centers. I suppose whoever it was is a spokesman for all of them. But the ones I would like to speak for are the 83,000 people who could be served if this amendment were adopted. The $25 million, it is estimated, would allow these health centers to be able to serve 83,000 more people. Those are the ones I am concerned about. I am not so much concerned about whoever in Washington, DC, decided that the NLRB needed a big increase. 
   The fact is, the NLRB has said with this increased funding they will hire 122 more people, and they will buy an $11 million computer system. So I would say to the Senator from Minnesota, that is the issue. Do you want an $11 million computer system for the NLRB and 122 more employees or do you want to help 83,000 more people to get health care in the delta and the poor areas of this country who are currently not receiving it? 
   It is a pretty simple issue. We can try to cloud it with parliamentary questions. We can try to cloud it with questions about a UC that was adopted. But there is a very fundamental question in which I believe very strongly. 
   I oftentimes hear the Senator from Minnesota speak with great passion and the Senator from Iowa speak with great passion as to how they are prepared to create a problem in the Senate in order to further their goals. I admire them. I respect them for their commitment. 
   I just say, I have a deep belief about those who are being served by these community health centers. I have visited them. I see the good work they do. I see the fact that poor people can walk in and not have to worry about presenting an insurance policy in order to get help. I know the value of helping those little children in the delta when they get preventive health care services now and what that is going to save us down the line, not only in terms of our budget but in terms of the quality of life that they are going to be able to live. 
   Once again, I reiterate the numbers concerning the NLRB. We have seen, over the last 25 years, their budget cut by 21 percent, while the caseloads have dropped 31 percent. This isn't a new thing. Last year, we flat-lined their budget, and the result was they had fewer cases filed and a smaller backlog with a flat-line budget. 
   I think anybody who will listen to the arguments and look at the numbers will have a difficult time accepting the logic that they need to hire 122 more people and buy an $11 million computer system, having a $25 million increase in their budget at a time we could be helping poor people get health care around this country. 
   So it is a very clear question. I think clouding it is not the answer as to how we resolve it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, my staff talked to the community health centers, and they clarified that they do not oppose this amendment. In fact, while they may have concerns about how they are getting involved in a political fight before the Senate that may affect their relationship with the appropriators, in fact I think they would very much welcome the additional $25 million for health care in rural areas. That is where their heart is. They want to help people. They are not going to turn away $25 million to help. 
   The Senator from Iowa is concerned about why I didn't take this from the Department of Defense bill or shift it from something else, and why we chose the NLRB. I think I made that case very convincingly. They have done an excellent job. They ought to be commended for their priorities and their impact analysis system by which the most critical cases are taken first. 
   They have seen a decrease in the backlog. They have seen a decrease in the number of cases being filed--all the time not seeing an increase in their budget. To increase it by $25 million so they can buy an $11 million computer and hire 122 more people at a time when there are tens of thousands of people in the poor areas of this country being left uninsured and without access to basic health care, I think, is a pretty easy call. 
   While I think I can make a strong case for why we need to increase defense spending, when we have treatment goals failing in virtually every branch of the military, with the exception of the Marines, and when we see tens of thousands of our men and women in uniform on food stamps, I can tell you why I didn't take it from defense. But the more important question is why NLRB? Because it is a Washington bureaucracy that is going to get bigger under that plan to buy a computer and hire 122 more people at a time when they have seen a decrease in the workload. That is why. It is very simple. 
   I know there is a need in the community health centers, and I want to help them. This is a little bit of help. It is enough help to provide health care for an additional 83,000 people nationwide. And some of those folks are going to be in the delta of Arkansas. 
   This is not a difficult amendment to vote for. It is a pretty easy case. I have had to come down and defend a lot of amendments on this floor, but I don't think I have ever had one that I felt more strongly about personally or for which it was easier to make the case. 
   The budget for the NLRB has been cut over the years. From 1980 to 1998--over that 18-year period--their budget declined 21 percent. That sounds pretty bad until you realize the number of charges received and processed declined 10 percent more than that--31 percent. 
   To stand on the floor of the Senate and say we are disenfranchising, that we are denying justice by not increasing by $25 million the budget for a Washington bureaucracy, I am sorry; I don't think that sells. And I don't think it is too convincing to those who are going to be denied health care by the defeat of this amendment. 
   They have done a good job in reducing the backlog. They have done a good job in seeing a fewer number of charges. And they have done so with lower budgets over the last 18 years. It doesn't make any sense now to increase it dramatically by $25 million so they can hire 122 more people and buy an $11 million computer system. 
   I suggest that money would be better used by people in the poor communities, in the rural areas of this country, to ensure that they can walk in--44 percent of them are children--and not have to worry about presenting insurance documentation when they go  into these health centers; that they can get treatment. Eighty-three thousand more people would be served. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I regret that the Senator from Illinois implies that I deny the employees of this country their right under the National Labor Relations Act. I certainly would not imply by his position that he supports denying 83,000 Americans health care served under the $25 million added to the budget of the health centers. I wouldn't make such a suggestion. I regret he made such a suggestion before the Senate. 
   If we were denying justice for employees, I would not offer this amendment. The reality is, we are not cutting a dime from the NLRB. We are only eliminating the $25 million increase so they can hire 122 more employees and a computer system at a time when the caseload is decreasing. Mr. President, a 31-percent decrease in caseload I don't think justifies a $25 million increase in funding. 
   It is not hard to understand. Make that case to the American people. I will go out and say this is what we should do, flat-line their budget at a time they have decreasing workload and put more money into community health centers. That is what this amendment does. 
   If Members want to vote against community health centers and vote for more bureaucracy, Members have their opportunity. I want to serve those 83,000 people who will receive health care because of this $25 million infusion into this very worthwhile program. It is bureaucrats at the NLRB--122 more employees--or serving people who need health care, primarily children. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the children of this country, not the bureaucrats in Washington.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Enzi amendment. I compliment the Senator. He has been a tireless worker and leader in the area of OSHA reform. I think on both sides of the aisle no one would dispute Senator ENZI has been the foremost student of OSHA, the way it works, where its failings are. The legislation he has brought forward and his efforts to reform this agency deserve the praise and the appreciation of the American people. I appreciate very much his willingness to offer this amendment. 
   I think a few things need to be clarified. It does not cut enforcement. The Senator from Minnesota said this cuts enforcement. No, it doesn't. It takes the $33 million increased spending and says half of that will be used for compliance. Over last year's level, there is no cut in what will be available for enforcement. In fact, half of the $33 million increase will continue to go into the enforcement area. 
   The Senator from Minnesota said the amendment was flawed. It is not this amendment that is flawed. It is the ``find and fine'' approach of OSHA that is flawed and that needs reform. This is a small step, but a significant step that the Senator from Wyoming has offered that will help move away from the ``find and fine'' approach, the enforcement-only approach, the punitive approach to a program and a system that will assist small businesspeople who want to do the right thing, who want to have a healthy workplace, who want a safe workplace and want to comply with OSHA but they need help. 
   Anybody who has ever worked with OSHA, anyone who has ever looked at the OSHA regulation book, knows a small businessman, if he is to comply, needs assistance. So I think this is a very well thought out and a very important amendment. 
   The Senator from Minnesota, as so many others do, likes to put everything in terms of class warfare. This is not a class issue. It is not in any way an inference that blue-collar workers should not have protection and should not be assured they are going to work in a healthy workplace and a safe workplace. It is a difference on what is the best approach, on how we best achieve that common goal. It is not a class issue. It is not a class warfare issue, as some would like to make it. 
   OSHA itself has estimated that 95 percent of small businesses--95 percent of the workplace, employers--want to comply, that they are good actors who want to be in compliance. It is among those 95 percent so many accidents are happening and that is where this kind of amendment increasing employer assistance is going to help. It is going to assist that small businessperson who wants to comply with OSHA but needs help in doing so. It is going to assure them that they are going to have the resources to be good actors and to have a safe workplace. 
   I do not know what the experience of the Senator from Minnesota has been, or that of others who may be voting on this, but I do know my experience. I was a small businessperson. I know it is unconstitutional, but I almost wish it were a requirement, before serving in the Senate, to be an employer; that you had to deal with Federal agencies  and you had to deal with this Tax Code and you had to deal with the regulatory agencies like OSHA. My brother and I owned a radio station and we did just that. 
   From my experience, let me tell you, we wanted to comply with every OSHA rule, all 1,275 pages. We wanted to comply. But we were a small business that had just a handful of employees, less than a dozen. Frankly, we did not understand. We understood radio, but we did not understand every minute, highly technical safety regulation that OSHA put forward. That is where this amendment would help. It doesn't cut OSHA's funding; it just says let's put half of the increase into compliance, into consultation service for small businesspeople. 
   It is hard for me to imagine why anybody would oppose this. The Senator from Wyoming has hit upon something. It is very logical. It is very much common sense. The American people out there understand this amendment. Those who may have the opportunity to see this debate and hear this debate, they will understand the difficulty that good actors, people who want to be in compliance, law-abiding businesspeople have in complying with an OSHA regulation book over 1,200 pages long. 
   We are not saying decrease enforcement. But I will tell you this: OSHA could send an army, we could quadruple the enforcement budget, let OSHA send an army of inspectors out across this country; they still could not get into every workplace in the country. That is simply the wrong approach if we want a safe workplace. The right approach is to put more into consultation services, work with the 95 percent of businesspeople who want to have a good workplace, assist them in ensuring they have it, and we will do more to save lives than under the ``find and fine,'' punitive, enforcement-oriented approach that OSHA has had in the past. 
   Again, I commend Senator ENZI for remarkable leadership, 
   leadership that has been praised on both sides of the aisle in his tireless efforts to improve the way OSHA operates. I commend him and am glad to be supportive of his amendment today. 
   I have a chart I will just point to briefly. It shows 61.5 percent of the current budget is going to enforcement; less than a quarter of their budget going to compliance assistance. Senator ENZI has taken the approach that at least half of what we are putting into OSHA's budget ought to go into assistance, not taking a hammer and beating up on the small businessperson who is trying to comply with OSHA's thousands of regulations. 
   Once again, I am glad to be a supporter of this amendment and ask my colleagues to support Senator ENZI and his continued efforts to make OSHA a better agency and to make the workplace in this country a safer place for American workers. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I certainly associate my remarks with those of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire who truly has displayed not only great leadership but great expertise on this whole subject area, and who, I think, very eloquently and very articulately explained the differences in philosophy and approach, and while sincere, the misguided efforts of the proponents of this amendment. 
   I take a few minutes to make a couple of observations about what the other side said about their amendment and then will outline my objections and what I think are the flaws in the approach advanced by the Senator from Washington. Certainly, I think Senator GREGG was right. The Republican approach is superior because it emphasizes the qualities of the teacher, not simply putting more teachers out there. 
   I recall very well, in the third grade, when there was an overabundance of third graders in a small rural school in Arkansas that I attended, we were placed in the second grade class. There were 7 third graders placed in the second grade class. Our teacher, Mrs. Hare--I remember her well--had 30 students in her class: 23 second graders and seven third graders. It was not an ideal situation by any means. It was not what anybody desired. We would have liked it if they had smaller classes. But I will tell you this: I am glad I had a quality teacher and that quality teacher was able to turn what would have been a disadvantage in having a combined class into an advantage for every student in that classroom. It is far more important that we have good teachers, qualified teachers, and teachers who have a heart for those students than it is for us, with a command-and-control approach from Washington, DC, to simply put more teachers out there and hire more teachers at the Federal level. 
   It struck me that the Senator from Washington, in her arguments on behalf of her amendment, wanted to have it both ways. In one breath she said: The Class Size Reduction Program was dramatically effective, so effective that we had to continue it. In virtually the next breath she said: Yes, it is impossible in 1 year to judge the effects of the program; therefore, we need to fund it again so we can give it time to judge its effectiveness. 
   You cannot have it both ways. So I think, as in many of the sincere arguments from the other side, they are, in fact, quite misguided. 
   Let me outline a few of my concerns. Senator GREGG rightly pointed out it is a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a command-and-control educational system in which the Federal Government micromanages what the local school districts can and should be doing. It is highly inflexible. 
   Lisa Graham Keegan, from the State of Arizona, who is one of the great education reformers in this country, stated recently that:  
   President Clinton made it abundantly clear that he decided smaller class sizes are a good thing, even though research has provided no clear indicators of the impact that class size has on a child's ability to learn.  
   Time and time again, I heard the other side say they have lots of conclusive studies, that reduction of class size inevitably improves educational achievement. But I have heard very few studies cited, other than one, in fact, from the State of Tennessee. 
   She continued:  
   Nevertheless, because [smaller] class size had been a good thing in some of the classrooms the President had visited, then smaller class sizes had to be a good thing for every classroom in America.  
   There, I think, is the flaw in the argument. Because it helps in some situations does not necessarily mean it is the panacea for educational reform across this country. 
   Second, I believe the approach cited by the Senator from Washington will reward States that have failed to address this issue. Education is primarily a State and local issue. Most States now address class size. In fact, 25 States have had class size reduction initiatives: California, Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and on and on. Twenty-five States have already addressed this. Yet this Federal program, in which we 
   fund from the Federal level 100,000 new teachers, basically says that failure to act will be rewarded by the Federal Government stepping in and assisting States. So it has a negative incentive. It rewards States that have failed to address this issue. 
   Third, it creates either a new entitlement program or an annual battle such as we have now had for two successive years in the appropriations process, pulling the rug out from under school districts that have hired teachers based upon this Federal program. It is a Band-Aid approach to a more systemic problem. It will either create a new entitlement which we feel obligated to keep funding year after year after year because school districts have acted on  the basis of this Federal program, or we will go through this annual exercise, the schools never knowing for sure whether or not there is going to be this Federal program, and therefore we would be accused of pulling the rug out from under them. 
   The Democrats keep mentioning we need to fulfill the promise we made last fall in the omnibus appropriations bill, which funded the Class Size Reduction Program at $1.2 billion. I simply ask the question: What happens if we do it this year and next year? At the end of the 7 years, what happens? 
   I will tell you what will happen. Every school district that has acted on the basis of this program will be saying: Reenact it, keep on because we are now dependent on this Federal program for the hiring of teachers. 
   As usual, in Federal education programs, it will continue to grow from year to year. It will become a new restrictive program that places more regulations on the localities and further contributes to Federal oversight of a local issue. Many school districts in Arkansas have declined to participate simply because of the amount of red tape and bureaucracy involved in the program. In fact, it feeds Federal dependence. It encourages those schools to look to Washington for funding. It encourages schools into a kind of Federal dependency. 
   No. 5, needy, small districts oftentimes do not even qualify for one single teacher. I think one of the saddest results of this legislation was that some of the neediest school districts, because of their size, were unable to qualify for even one. They were unable to form the consortia required to allow them to receive even partial funding for additional teachers. So in a State like Arkansas those schools that are the neediest are those that are least able to avail themselves of this program. 
   I might add, we have heard time and time again from the other side that failure to pass the Murray amendment will result in the firing of thousands of teachers across this country. That is not the case. Funds are only now flowing into the school districts from last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill. It is for this school year the teachers who have been hired are already funded, all the way through to the end of this school year. The way this should be addressed is through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which the education committee is addressing, and they will be bringing forth a reauthorization bill. That is the proper way for this issue to be addressed. But the issue of firing teachers, that is an absolute red herring; no teacher will be fired by the passage or failure of the amendment before us today. 
   I might add also, listening to the other side, you would think when the $1.2 billion, 1-year appropriation for this program was enacted last year, that there was bipartisan, 
   universal consensus that this was what we ought to do. That was far from the case. It is a revision of history. The fact is, when the Murray amendment was offered last year, it was defeated on the floor of the Senate, and it was only in the huge omnibus appropriations bill at the end of the session that, in order to reach an agreement with the President to prevent a Government shutdown, there was a resolution of the issue by a 1-year funding of the program. But there was not a 7-year authorization under ESEA, nor was there ever any consensus of this body that this was a proper Federal approach. 
   The sixth reason I think this is a flawed approach is, while it is very expensive, it will make minimal difference in academic achievement. We have already discovered decreased class size oftentimes does not result in any marked improvement in achievement. Between 1955 and 1997, school class size has dropped from 27.4 students per classroom to 17 students per classroom, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The number of teachers has grown at a far faster rate than the number of students.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I only have a few more remarks. 
   The point I was making, my sixth point, is why I think theirs is a flawed approach. The evidence is very clear that a simple reduction in class size does not improve academic achievement. In Arkansas, we have seen enrollment decrease from 1970 to 1996 by only 1.3 percent, but there has been a reduction in the number of students.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if I may return to the State of Arkansas where we had a reduction in the number of students by 1.3 percent over the 25 years from 1970 on; the number of teachers grew by 17,407 in 1965 to almost 30,000 in 1997. That is an increase of 70 percent in the number of teachers, while we saw a decrease in the number of students. That is dramatic class size reduction. 
   Unfortunately, we have not seen a comparable increase in academic achievement. I believe, if you look nationwide, that will be the story in State after State. While student-teacher ratios have decreased, we have not seen a comparable increase in academic achievement. Why would we then put this huge investment, dictating from Washington what the solution should be? 
   If I were to make no other point in these remarks, it would be this seventh concern, that a one-size-fits-all approach from Washington will actually have a negative impact on the poorest students in this country. It will actually penalize poor children in districts across this country.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, as I rode to the office this afternoon, I was listening to news accounts which were reporting that the President was making a series of speeches in which he was criticizing the congressional majority and their plans for education and education improvement in this country. 
   It seemed to me as I listened to the news accounts--assuming they were accurate--the President was basing his criticism on two counts: No. 1, if you did not believe that his priorities in education were the proper priorities, then you did not really value education in this country and you were failing in your commitment to public schools. His second criterion was the amount of money that was going to be spent on public education at the Federal level. 
   So really two criteria: You have to spend it where he wants to, and you have to spend the amount he desires, or else you have failed in some kind of litmus test as to a commitment to education. 
   I reject both of those tests. I think, as you look at the amount of money and the increases in funding for education nationally over the last 25 years, you have to conclude that simply spending more money is not the answer to improving education--that that criterion fails. If that is going to be the criterion, well, then, there may be a lot of people who can say they are committed to education but with very little evidence of success or results. 
   Because we, as Republicans, disagree with the President's particular priorities, which are funding a new program for 100,000 teachers, whether or not that happens to be the great need in a particular area; and increased funding for the construction of schools, though we know there are many dilapidated schools, many schools that are in need of construction, that may or may not be the priority, the great need in a particular area--because we disagree with his priorities and his effort to further nationalize education in this country, he would deem us then as lacking commitment to education. 
   I believe, with the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act this year, we have a golden opportunity to dramatically improve Federal education programs that for years have not provided a good return for every dollar. 
   If we are going to spend taxpayers' money on education--and poll after poll indicates that this is a high priority with the American people; it is high on their list of where they believe emphasis should be placed--then I suggest we must hold the States, we must hold school districts, we must hold even individual schools accountable for the funds they are receiving. 
   In the past, ESEA has not rewarded success nor has it punished failure. Instead, money is allocated only for specific uses, with no results demanded or expected. 
   For example, we allocate funding for technology in schools, but in no way do we require schools to show us how this is helping kids to learn. We only require them to use the funding appropriately, but there is no link to the ultimate goal, which is and should be student achievement. In category after category, we find this to be the case. We provide the funds and so long as the States can demonstrate they are spending it appropriately--that is, for the appropriate category--there is no requirement that they demonstrate student achievement. 
   I believe this system must change. We must allow schools more flexibility in how they use funding to meet their individual needs and show how they are improving student achievement for all students. The bottom line should be, the bottom line must be, in education: Are students learning? Not are we spending more money, not is our funding increasing, not are they meeting a set of regulations that can fill out the forms and demonstrate that they, in fact, have spent technology money on technology, but are students learning, are student achievement scores increasing? That must be the ultimate test. 
   It is in that area that Federal education programs have abysmally failed. Schools currently receive Federal funding with so many strings attached they cannot effectively use the funding they receive. I believe those strings must be reduced so that the only requirement is the dollars are being spent in the classroom to enable children to learn. 
   Over the past 34 years, since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was first passed, it has grown dramatically in size and scope. The Department of Education currently administers 47 K-through-12 programs that are authorized under ESEA. In his fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, the President wanted to create 5 new programs in addition to the 47 currently administered by the Department of Education. I suggest to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the last thing this Congress should do is add 5 new programs to ESEA, when all the evidence is that we are failing in the 47 that currently are authorized. 
   Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Assistant Secretary of Education, who has testified on numerous occasions before congressional committees, puts it this way:  
   At present, American education is mired in patterns of low productivity, uncertain standards, and a lack of accountability. Federal education programs have tended to reinforce these regularities by adding additional layers of rules, mandates, and bureaucracy. The most important national priority must be to redesign policies and programs so that education funding is used to educate children, not to preserve the system.  
   The proposal from the President to add five new programs to ESEA simply reinforces the status quo. In fact, it expands the existing system which has failed American students so terribly. 
   A study by the Ohio State Legislature reported that more than 50 percent of the paperwork required by a  local school in Ohio was the result of Federal education programs and mandates, even though the Federal funding in that Ohio district accounted for only 7 percent of the total education spending--7 percent of the funding, 50 percent of the paperwork. I am afraid that is all too typical of what we find with regard to Federal education spending and Federal education programs. 
   While spending on education has increased, there has been no corresponding rise in academic achievement. According to Investor's Business Daily, over the past 25 years, inflation-adjusted, per-pupil spending for grades kindergarten through 12 has climbed 88 percent. 
   Republicans are not opposed to more education spending. In fact, we have proposed that we dramatically increase education spending. But we believe that simply increasing education spending without a corresponding reform of the system is money ill spent. In Arkansas, total education spending since 1970, adjusted for inflation, Federal, State and local, has grown by almost 58 percent. Since 1970, we have seen in Arkansas a dramatic increase in per-student spending, the expenditures on each child, in the public schools in the State of Arkansas. Unfortunately, overall performance of the average 17-year-old student on the NAEP test changed little between the early 1970s and 1990. 
   Before we decide the answer to improving our education system is to throw in more money and create more programs, may I suggest we examine closely the programs as we reauthorize them and that we change the current system to allow schools to innovatively use their funding to address their problems as they see fit and as they know best. 
   Now, in the area of IDEA, funding for disabilities, I think that is an area all of us could agree we have done too little. During the reauthorization of IDEA in 1997, the Federal Government was authorized to pay up to 40 percent of the excess cost of educating special education students. However, the President, who lauds his record on education, has consistently funded special education at only about 10 percent of the excess costs. For fiscal year 2000, the President has requested $4.31 
   billion. That is the same amount appropriated in fiscal year 1999. This is an area Democrats and Republicans have agreed we have not met our Federal commitment and our pledge to the States and local school districts. Yet the President, who wants to create five new programs, has level funded the area of IDEA. 
   Reduced funding for special education causes the local school districts to pay the cost of educating children with disabilities. Often these costs, as we all know, can be three to four times the amount spent on other students. Therefore, what is happening is that those local schools are taking money from other programs and other services because the Federal law requires them to provide that education for special ed students. As a result, they are shortchanging other needed educational programs because the Federal Government has failed to meet its commitment. 
   Another area I think we have failed is in the area of impact aid. The President's fiscal year 2000 budget requests $736 million for impact aid. That is an increase of $128 million from 1999. But impact aid provides support to school districts affected by Federal activities, children living on Indian lands and children who live on Federal property who have a parent on active duty in the uniform services. This is one area in which I believe it is very clear that the Federal Government has a role in education. Yet the President's budget does not reflect that priority, that clear responsibility that we have on the Federal level. 
   Education is mainly a State and local responsibility, where funding is generated from local and State taxes. Yet children who live on Federal lands or on military bases are being cheated out of an equal education. In Arkansas, we have the Ouachita National Forest. We have the Ozark National Forest, the St. Francis National Forest, the Buffalo National River. We have, though many don't realize, because Arkansas is not a far western land, hundreds of thousands of acres in the public domain, school districts that are dependent upon impact aid to fund the educational base because they do not have a tax base upon which they can rely. There is no tax base for these areas. 
   Any decline in impact aid funding requires State and local school districts to find additional funding to give their children a good education. It is an area that Congress clearly has a role in providing funding. Yet the President continually tries to reduce funding and deemphasize this priority and this responsibility of the Federal Government. In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2000, the President seeks to increase administrative spending for the Direct Loan Program by $115 million. That is a 26-percent increase in the Direct Loan Program for administration. Perhaps nothing reflects the misguided priorities of this administration more than their effort to increase administrative spending in a student assistance program by 26 percent. 
   Adding programs--the wrong priorities in spending--I think reflects the misguided effort of this administration to further nationalize, further remove local control, and, I believe, continue a system that has demonstrated itself to be broken, which has not given us the results students in this country deserve. 
   They want to promote the Direct Loan Program--there is no doubt about that--and particularly increase the area of administration that is the very area in which we need to be reducing spending. Then in other areas of student assistance, while the maximum Pell grant award would increase from $3,125 to $3,250, total Pell grant funding would be cut by $241 million. They are particularly important in higher education in States such as Arkansas or any State that has a rural population and a relatively low per capita income. 
   In Arkansas, that is exacerbated because we have a rather low percentage going on to higher education. The reason for that, many times, is because there is not adequate student assistance available. So while we increase the total amount of a Pell grant, we don't increase--in fact, what would be available is cut in the President's budget dramatically. The result is we have fewer Pell grants available, even though the demand is greater than ever before. 
   Madam President, let me reiterate my point and my concern about the President's priorities in education and his very ill-timed attacks upon the Republican majority in the House and the Senate. Because we disagree on priorities, his judgment is we are not committed to education. Because we disagree in the amount and where that money should be spent, his conclusion is that we are not committed to education. 
   I believe Republicans have come forward with one of the most creative, innovative educational priorities since taking control of the House and the Senate: The idea of taking 21 Federal education programs under ESEA and telling the States that, on a cafeteria basis, they can choose which ones of those programs they wish to have consolidated with new flexibility to find creative and innovative solutions at the State and local level. That is what we need to be doing. 
   But there are those entrenched in the status quo who say: Let's reauthorize what we have been doing; let's put more money into a system that has not given us greater educational achievement. They think that demonstrates greater commitment to our children. I think we do have a golden opportunity this year, and I think the line could not be clearer between those who believe the Federal Government is the solution and those of us who believe we need local control with greater local flexibility, while demonstrating a commitment on the Federal level but giving maximum flexibility for local policymakers to decide how the local issues can be best solved. 
   I look forward to the education debate in the coming hours and weeks as we conclude this session. I hope that as we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will do so in a way that truly demonstrates our love, our commitment, and our concern for the public school students of this country. I look forward to working with Senator GORTON, who has been so active in this whole education area, and Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, and all on the Education Committee, to fashion an Elementary and Secondary Education Act that will take us  in a new direction and result in higher student achievement, better results, better education, as we compete in a world economy. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for overwhelming passage of the conference report to accompany S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. I would like to express my sincere appreciation and thanks to Chairman WARNER and ranking Member LEVIN for their efforts in crafting this important legislation. 
   This bill authorizes for the military the funds they need to adequately defend our country and protect our vital interests worldwide, $288.8 billion, which is $8.3 billion more than the President's inadequate request. After years of declining budgets and increased deployments, this legislation provides the military with their first funding increase since the end of the Cold War. 
   This bill carefully addresses a variety of important issues, from pay raises for our soldiers to restructuring the nation's nuclear laboratories in order to prevent any further espionage at our nation's nuclear laboratories. 
   While the Clinton Administration has over-extended and under-funded our military and has provided inexplicably slow and ineffective responses to Chinese spying, this Committee and the Congress as a whole has stepped up to face these challenges, and protect our national interests. 
   I would now like to take the opportunity to highlight some of the important provisions championed by the three subcommittees I serve on. 
   Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support.--Before I had even joined the Armed Services Committee in January of this year, tangible evidence of a debilitating readiness crisis had emerged, a crisis that threatened the well being of America's armed forces. 
   On September 28th of last year, General Shelton confessed:  
   I must admit up front that our forces are showing increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal and now measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the long term health of the Total Force is in jeopardy.  
   I would note that General Shelton is not a soldier prone to hyperbole. 
   For their excellent work to combat the ``fraying of readiness'' described by General Shelton, Senators INHOFE and ROBB, respectively the Chairman and Ranking member of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, deserve congratulations for the excellent work they have done in this area. 
   They have added more than $1.46 billion to the primary readiness accounts including funds for ammunition, training, base operations and essential infrastructure repairs including $380 million for base operations, $788 million for real property maintenance, and $172.9 million for training and war reserve ammunition. 
   In the area of military construction, the Subcommittee adopted significant changes to the law on economic development conveyances of base closure properties. Rural communities that have suffered through the closure of a military installation will no longer have to pay the government for the privilege of redeveloping their economies. 
   The Readiness Subcommittee also correctly rejected the President's irresponsible budgetary maneuvering which would have incrementally funded military construction projects. 
   Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.--The Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, capably led by Chairman SMITH of New Hampshire and Senator LANDRIEU of Louisiana, worked hard to ensure that American soldiers deployed overseas and American citizens asleep in their beds will be a little safer from the threat of ballistic missile attack. 
   The Subcommittee authorized an increase of $212 million for the Patriot PAC-3 anti-ballistic missile system to complete research and development and begin production soon. 
   If I can take a minute, I would like to repeat the last portion of that sentence and proudly brag about a product built by hundreds hardworking employees in my home state of Arkansas. The Patriot PAC-3 was the first dedicated, hit-to-kill, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system that has successfully destroyed a target in a test. 
   But I digress. The Subcommittee authorized an additional $112 million for upgrades to the B-2 bomber system, which I would note for the benefit of the program's detractors, performed brilliantly during Operation Allied Force. 
   The Subcommittee also included a provision regarding DOD's theater missile defense upper-tier strategy, which would require that the Navy Upper Tier and THAAD systems be managed and funded as separate programs. The Administration must be reminded that it has repeatedly testified before this Committee that these programs are not interchangeable. They are complementary, both urgently needed, and must be treated as such.  
   But perhaps most importantly, it is within the Strategic Forces Subcommittee that the Armed Services Committee took the several important legislative actions to address the criminally lax security at our nation's nuclear laboratories. Lax security that allowed the People's Republic of China to steal the secrets produced by billions of dollars and four decades worth of taxpayer funded nuclear research. 
   Among the provisions recommended by the Subcommittee: The establishment of a semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security Administration within DOE under which all national security functions will be consolidated. Create a new Under Secretary of Energy to head the new Administration. 
   Created a new counterintelligence office reporting directly to the Secretary. Established clear lines of management authority for national security missions of the department. Protected the authority of the Secretary to ensure full compliance with all applicable environmental laws. 
   As millions of Americans woke up this year to be repeatedly confronted by the shocking truth of the Clinton Administration's casual, almost lackadaisical response to the systematic theft of highly classified nuclear secrets as reported in the Cox Committee's unanimous report, I hope they will find at least a little comfort in the knowledge that this Committee was ready to step forward, accept a challenge and shoulder the responsibility for our nation's nuclear security that this Administration repeatedly forfeited. 
   Subcommittee on AirLand Forces: Subcommittee Chairman RICK SANTORUM and Ranking Member JOSEPH LIEBERMAN also rolled up their sleeves, tackling the difficult readiness and modernization challenges posed by years of Clinton Administration neglect. 
   Most significantly, the Subcommittee fully authorized the budget request for the development and procurement of the F-22 Raptor aircraft. This aircraft is absolutely essential if Air Force is to continue its proud record of air-dominance over far away battlefields. America's military should never be forced by its Congress to fight a fair fight. When this nation must bear arms to protect its interests, it should always be aiming for a lopsided victory. 
   Also focusing on unfunded requirements identified by each of the services, the AirLand Forces Subcommittee made a number of changes to the President's request, addressing, among others, Army aviation shortfalls and night vision equipment shortfalls. 
   To conclude, I would like to again thank Chairman WARNER, and his dedicated, tireless staff, for their leadership and dedicated service. 
   Mr. President, I urge each of my colleagues to support this important legislation which contains many provisions which are vital to our nation's military. And I urge the President to sign this legislation into law as soon as he receives it. This bill will make needed improvements in the areas of military readiness, quality of life and modernization, and I hope the U.S. Senate will send a strong, bipartisan message in support of our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to address for a few minutes the tax relief package that the Senate passed before the August recess. 
   I had the opportunity during the August recess to travel much of Arkansas.  I was in 27 counties in Arkansas in about a month. So we were very busy. In each one of those counties there were opportunities for people to express their opinions and to talk about issues that were of concern to them. We heard much about the farm crisis. I know the Presiding Officer has been very involved in trying to fashion a farm policy that is going to allow family farmers to survive, be viable, and has been very involved in the ag policy of this country. We have heard a lot of concerns about agriculture. 
   I also heard a lot about the tax package, and there were a lot of questions. I want to take a few minutes today to talk about what I heard and what I shared about the tax relief package that we passed in the Senate and the conference that was agreed upon with the House. I think it is responsible and provides much-needed relief for the American taxpayer. 
   I think that is the first thing we have to realize--how much there is a need for tax relief. People say, well, the economy is booming; we are doing fine; people are fine; no one really wants a tax cut. I think the reality is far different. 
   Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest level in peacetime history--almost 21 percent of the gross domestic product. When you compare that to the 1950s and the Eisenhower years, the tax burden upon the American people measured--there are lots of ways of measuring ``tax burden,'' but one of the most helpful, I think, is in terms of the gross domestic product. At that time, it was about 15 percent of GDP; it is now 21 percent of GDP. And it took that last leap when Congress passed and the President signed the 1993 tax hike. 
   When we are talking in terms of the tax relief package, the $792 billion--and for a farm boy from north Arkansas that is a lot of money, $792 billion--it is over 10 years, and when you realize that what we are doing is rolling back the tax burden on the American people by a grand total of 1 percentage point of GDP; we would take it from about 21 percent to about 20 percent, there is nothing draconian--an overused word these days--there is nothing irresponsible about the tax relief package that was passed by the House and Senate. 
   According to the Office of Management and Budget, total Federal receipts amounted to 19.9 percent of GDP in 1998 and will be 20.1 percent of GDP in 1999. 
   Now, in Arkansas, that amounts to about $7,352 in taxes per capita, in 1998. 
   In a State such as Connecticut, it is about twice that; $15,525 was paid in taxes for every man, woman, and child in Connecticut. It was Ben Franklin who said a penny saved is a penny earned. I think maybe we could adjust that motto and say: A dollar earned is 38 cents spent by the Federal Government. The typical American family sees 38 percent of its income paid in taxes, as opposed to 28 percent of its income for food, clothing, and housing and only 3.6 percent that goes to savings. 
   I believe at a time of surplus, it would be unthinkable, it would be unconscionable for us not to allow the American people to keep more of what they have worked so hard to make. As Ronald Reagan once remarked: The taxpayer is someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a Civil Service exam. When we think about the increasing percentage of our income going to taxes, that is, unfortunately, more true today than it was when President Reagan said it. The American people are laboring under a heavy burden of taxation and an intrusive Tax Code and tax system. 
   There are many provisions in the tax relief package. I want to address two that are particularly compelling. One is the marriage penalty tax. 
   Approximately 42 million American couples, including 6 million senior citizens, must pay an average of $1,400 extra in taxes for simply being married. The marriage penalty punishes in two ways. It pushes married couples into a higher tax bracket, and it lowers couples' standard deduction. So two married income earners with combined income must pay their income tax at a higher rate with a lower deduction than they would if they were two single people. It is unfair. It is wrong. Most Americans are absolutely perplexed why such a quirk in the Tax Code would be allowed to continue. 
   Keep in mind, it is not a one-time penalty. Under our tax system, marriage is not a freeway; it is a toll road. For 10 years of marriage, couples must pay an average of $14,000 extra; for 20 years, couples must pay $28,000 extra. The tax relief package that passed would finally achieve equity and fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. 
   The other aspect of the tax relief package we passed that I think is especially helpful and important and about which people feel strongly in Arkansas is the death tax. Small business owners and farmers can lose their lives and all they have saved for their children because of death taxes. Since the value of a business is added to the estate and taxed after exemption, sometimes as high as 55 percent, many small businesses and farms must be sold in order to pay the death tax. It is wrong. Just as the marriage penalty, it is something we should not allow, it is something we should not tolerate, and it is something we have the ability and capacity to change this year. It is a form of double taxation. The most obvious inequity is the death tax. 
   It also doesn't make a lot of sense. It taxes investment and savings. It taxes the American dream. Part of the American dream is, if you work hard and save and invest well and are able to accumulate something in life, you will be able to pass that on to your children and your grandchildren so they can start their lives with better prospects than what you did. It is not all of the American dream, but it is part of the American dream. The death tax is absolutely contrary to what we hold out as being something Americans should strive toward--investment, savings, building for the future. 
   Right now, the survival rate for a family farm from the 
   first to the second generation is only about 30 percent. The odds are against a family farmer being able to pass along that farm to their children or grandchildren. I know our farmers are working hard, and these are difficult times for them. We keep having emergency bills to help alleviate the problems, but they are kind of a Band-Aid solution. We have one the Senate passed before the August recess. 
   Eliminating the death tax is something we can do that will permanently benefit agriculture and farmers in this country. Only a fraction of 1 percent of small businesses make it through to four generations. Just as the family farm, which is, in effect, a small business, other small businesses are also having a difficult time surviving and certainly being passed on to future generations. 
   Consider the case of Clarence who owns a farming and lumber business in North Carolina. He provides jobs to 720 people in his community through three small farms, a fertilizer and tobacco warehouse, and a small lumber mill. His family has worked hard for four generations to build this business to what it is today. All of that may well be lost when Clarence dies and his family is faced with a huge Government death tax bill. Clarence has worked hard to try to reduce the burden of the death tax. He slowed the growth of his business. He has hired lawyers. He has purchased life insurance. He has established trusts--all with the hope that he could create a plan to enable his children to keep the family business when he dies. All of that work and planning still may not be enough. 
   Clarence figures that his son will owe the Federal Government about $1.5 million upon his death, an impossible amount to pay for a man who makes only $31,000 a year. His son will almost certainly have to sell all or part of the business in order to pay the consequences of the death tax. Over four generations, Clarence's family businesses have been whittled down to a sliver of what they once were. 
   Then consider the case of Mr. Kennard, whose spirit of free enterprise is being stifled by the death tax. He owns a small septic tank company in Virginia. He began his business in 1963. Today, he employs 15 people, including his son and daughter who have worked with him since they were teenagers. His son runs one of the businesses and takes home about $30,000 a year, hardly enough to pay the $2 million bill the Government will hand him when his father dies. 
   Death should not be a taxable experience. In order to reduce the estate tax,  Mr. Kennard has stopped expanding his businesses and is considering transferring shares of his business to his children now rather than wait until his death. He would like to invest in insurance and put some of his money back into the business, but it doesn't make sense when his family will have to pay exorbitant taxes on any new appreciation. In fact, Mr. Kennard may have to liquidate one or two of his businesses in order to pay the death tax on the remaining businesses. 
   The tax refund bill would provide relief by lowering the 5-percent surtax on estates and replace the unified credit with the unified exemption of $1.5 million. We would ultimately be rid of the death tax altogether. It is something we should do. It is something we have within our power to do. We have passed it. We will send it to the President. It is our hope, still, that the President will change his mind and not veto this very important legislation. 
   There are many other important 
   provisions in the bill as well. People say: Why spend your time on tax relief when the President said he is going to veto it? Because it is important, because it is the right thing to do, because our responsibility to our constituents is not what the President may or may not do. I recall well my early years in the House when we passed welfare reform and had to send it to the President not once, not twice, but three times, before the President finally decided the American people wanted welfare reform. He signed an important piece of reform legislation that has transformed welfare in this country and cut the rolls in half in State after State, including my home State of Arkansas. 
   I hope the President will reconsider, and I hope the American people will let us and the administration know how important tax relief is. When they understand what is in it, they do support it. In 27 counties in Arkansas, I did hear some concerns, primarily because of the myths that have been perpetrated about this tax relief bill. 
   One of the concerns was the myth that this tax relief bill somehow trades debt reduction for tax cuts. The fact is, the budget and the tax relief bill we passed will reduce public debt by 60 percent and achieve over $200 billion more in public debt reduction than the President's plan over the next 10 years. It is not a matter of either/or. It is not a matter of whether you are going to have debt reduction or we are going to have tax relief. We can and should have both. 
   Another one of the myths people are concerned about, and understandably concerned, is that somehow, if you pass a meaningful tax relief bill, as we did, it is going to erode and eat into the Social Security surplus. In fact, that is nothing but a myth. We would lockbox Social Security. We would not touch any of the Social Security surpluses, and we shouldn't. We should not perpetrate the wrong that has been done by previous Congresses by dipping in and using those revenues which are designated and should be designated for Social Security only. 
   Then there is, perhaps, one of the greatest myths of all; that is, the tax relief bill will primarily benefit the wealthy. This tax relief package would provide broad-based tax relief. It cuts every bracket 1 percent. That is not much. 
   But it cuts across the board of tax brackets by 1 percent. It doesn't take somebody trained in math to figure out that if you are in the 15-percent tax bracket and you lower it from 15 to 14 percent, it is a much bigger personal tax cut than for somebody who is in a lower tax bracket who also sees only a 1-percent reduction in taxes. 
   The fact is that this tax relief package benefits low-income earners in the lowest tax bracket more than any other taxable group. We not only lower the rate, we expand the bracket to include yet more hard-working Americans. 
   In a State such as Arkansas, where we have one of the lowest per capita incomes, lowering the tax by even 1 percent for the lowest tax bracket has a significant benefit for hard-working Arkansans and hard-working Americans. 
   One of the other myths I heard while I was traveling across Arkansas was that there was concern that somehow these surpluses might not become reality. Conservative Arkansans who look at the Congressional Budget Office projections a decade out, I think, are right to say: What happens if, in fact, the surpluses don't become reality? Are you going to give all of this back in tax cuts? And are we going to go back up in deficit spending? 
   I was glad to be able to report that there was an important provision including a trigger--maybe it is better to call it a safety valve--that ensures that if the surpluses do not become reality, the tax cuts don't kick in. They don't become reality either. That, I think, is the ultimate fallback to ensure that we don't return to the big spending, red-ink, deficit spending ways of the past. 
   The bottom line is that in Arkansas 683,741 people would have tax reductions under this bill. That is, 750 million Americans would see their tax bills reduced. It is not something targeted for the wealthy, but it is something that would benefit every taxpaying American. 
   Opponents of tax relief insist that money must be left on the table in the name of debt reduction. The reality is that if you leave it on the table in Washington, it will be spent. 
   Therein is the great divide philosophically between those who believe the American people can better decide and determine how they ought to spend what they have earned and what they have worked for than people in Washington, DC--Government officials and bureaucrats in Washington. For those who believe we have to keep that money up here because we have to reserve it on the table for more spending programs because, truly, wisdom is found here inside the beltway, we reject that. I reject that. 
   I ask my colleagues to request of the President his reconsideration of what is desperately needed for the American people--lowering that tax burden from 21 percent to 20 percent. There is nothing too dramatic nor too drastic about it, but it is a small step in providing the American people the tax relief they deserve and they desire. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I thank Senator THOMAS for providing this time and this opportunity to discuss what we have done in the area of tax relief. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for clearly laying out the issues in this debate, and I associate my remarks with his. 
   I rise to strongly speak against the Bryan-Wyden amendment for a variety of reasons but, most importantly, because it simply does not support healthy and sustainable national forests. Many Senators, I suspect, will speak today claiming this reduction to the Timber Management Program makes sound fiscal and environmental sense. 
   From my perspective as an Arkansan, as a Senator from Arkansas, I can tell you that is far from the truth and that there are 35,440 workers in my home State who make up the forest products industry who strongly oppose this amendment. If our forests are not healthy and if we continue to ignore the problems facing these public lands, we run the risk of jeopardizing these jobs and the future health and sustainability of our Nation's forests. 
   During the August recess, I met with the Forest Service on the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas. Sometimes our distinguished Senators from the West forget that there are national forests all across the South, and in the State of Arkansas, I say to my good friend, the Senator from Oregon, we have two large national forests, the Ouachita National Forest and the Ozark National Forest. 
   In a meeting with the National Forest Service on the Ouachita National Forest last month, I discovered, because of decreasing budgets in the timber sales account, they are doing only one-third of the vegetation management required by the forest plan. So forgive me if I find it ironic that this second-degree amendment, the substitute amendment, would shift 
   $10 million from the Timber Management Program to the surveys in the Northwest when, in the State of Arkansas, in our national forests, they are only doing one-third of the vegetation management required by the forest plan. 
   Because of the severe erosion of funding that the Senator from Idaho has alluded to, the forest is unable to achieve the desired future conditions required for a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. Extremists, litigation, appeals, or lack of public support did not bring about this crisis. It is the result of a misguided effort by the administration to reduce timber harvests without taking into consideration the real impacts on the conditions of the forests and the communities associated with these national forests. 
   The Timber Management Program is funded at a level equal to the fiscal year 1999 funding level. There was level funding before this amendment. Before these additional cuts, there was level funding, no increase, and yet the demands on the program have increased dramatically. 
   The program objective for the timber sales program is ``a sustainable yield of forest products that contributes to meeting the Nation's demands and restoring, improving, or maintaining the forest ecosystem health.'' Yet the amendment before us reduces the funding level when more than 40 million acres of our national forests are at high risk of catastrophic fire due to an accumulation of dead and dying trees and an additional 26 million acres are at risk of insect and disease infestation. 
   We have a crisis now; we risk a catastrophe. We have level funding in the appropriations bill before us, and the amendment suggests we should cut even further in a program that has not the resources to do the job it has been charged with doing as it stands. 
   The addition of Senator WYDEN as a cosponsor of the amendment, the second-degree amendment, only exacerbates the problem that the underlying amendment creates in shifting an additional $10 million out of timber management and moving it to the Northwest. This impacts every national forest, every timber management program in the Nation. It dilutes what can be done in those areas where they are already suffering, where they are already short to move additional resources because of the situation faced in the Northwest. I think that is wrong. It is not economically or environmentally advisable. 
   The debate today will speak about doing right by the environment. How can you justify reducing a level-funded program that is dealing with millions of acres of land that are too crowded for new and healthy trees to grow? 
   We will also hear talk today about how the Timber Management Program is antienvironmental or environmentally destructive. That is not what I have seen in the management that is being done in the Ouachita, the Ozark, St. Francis National Forests in Arkansas. Our national forests are adding 23 billion board feet each year. While 3 billion board feet are being harvested each year, 6 billion board feet die each year from insects, disease, fire, and other causes, and the amendment before us will only make that situation worse. 
   The majority of the timber sales in the program are done for other ecosystem objectives--improving habitat for wildlife, reducing fuels that may increase fire risk, especially in the urban interface areas, combating insect and disease infestations, and improving true growth for future timber. 
   We cannot ignore the contributions that the Timber 
   Management Program makes each year, even if it might sound politically advantageous. The byproduct of a healthy, sustainable timber program is equally as important as healthy rural communities. The timber sales program generates regional income of $2 billion--over $2 billion; in fact, $2.3 billion--in Federal income tax receipts. Seventy percent of  the timber from national forests is sold to small businesses that could be forced to close their doors if we support further reductions to the program. 
   A $1 million reduction in the timber sales program on the Ouachita, Ozark, or St. Francis National Forests simply means 10,000 acres of forest designated for treatment by the forest plan will go untreated. That is what it will mean: a $1 million reduction, 10,000 acres that will go unmanaged, untreated. Perhaps that is the goal. Perhaps that is the backdoor objective of such an amendment. The byproducts--round wood and saw logs --will be unavailable. Communities will lose 500 years of work and over $15 million from the local economy. 
   By any reasonable standard, the U.S. forest practices are the best in the world, ensuring forests are regenerated and that water quality and wildlife habitat are protected or enhanced. Decreasing this program is wrongheaded. It will only set us back environmentally. It will surely negatively impact us economically. 
   I suggest we do the right thing and support no less than level funding for this important program and oppose the Bryan-Wyden amendment. 
   I thank the chairman. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator ROBB's amendment to strike section 329 from the Interior appropriations bill. This effort is misguided and I urge my colleagues to understand the need for this Section if our National Forests are going to continue to function. 
   The ability of my home State's national forests to provide timber and other important resources is critical to the survival of many communities. I know the supervisors of both the Ozark-St. Francis and Ouachita National Forests in Arkansas. They are dedicated to preserving the forests' survival and natural beauty, while providing a healthy source of timber. The timber purchase program in Arkansas is one of the few in the country that consistently makes a profit. Not only does Arkansas' timber industry benefit, but so do school children who receive a portion of the earnings from the timber sales. 
   Section 329 simply clarifies that despite a recent circuit court decision, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior should maintain the discretion to implement current regulations as they have been doing for nearly 20 years. Specifically, on February 18, 1999, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Forest Service must conduct forest-wide wildlife population surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, and management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national forest plans on all ``ground disturbing activity.'' Never  before has such an extensive and impossible standard been set by the courts. In the end, this ruling results in paralysis by analysis. 
   It would require the Forest Service to examine every square inch of a project area and count the animals and plant life before it approved any ``ground disturbing activity.'' The cost to carry out such extensive studies--studies which have never been required before--could be as much as $9 billion nationwide. How do we know this? Because the Forest Service does contract for population inventorying on occasion. 
   If one were to extrapolate from the $8,000 cost of one plant inventory, they will reach $38.1 million for the 864,000 acres within the Chattahoochee National Forest where the 11th Circuit Court decision originated. When applied to Arkansas, one could deduce that this action could cost my state's industry roughly $78 million. If applied to the 188-million acre national forest system, the cost reaches $8.3 billion. During the past two decades, nine separate court decisions have backed the way the Forest Service has been conducting their surveying populations by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population data. 
   We appropriate roughly $70 million for forest inventory and monitoring. Are we prepared to shift the $9 billion necessary for this new standard? If not, this recent interpretation forces the Forest Service to shut down until they can apply the new standard. 
   The purpose of section 329 is not to change the court decision or set a new lower standard. It is simply to clarify that the existing regulation gives the discretion to the Forest Service and the BLM when determining what kind of surveys are needed when management activities are being considered. 
   Some of my colleagues would argue that this is an issue for the authorizing committees to deal with. I agree. This is an issue that absolutely should be dealt with by those committees. They need to determine whether the agencies have been correctly interpreting their regulation for the past 17 years. They need to determine whether it is sufficient to inventory habitat, rely on existing populations, consult with state and Federal agencies and conduct population inventories only for specific reasons. But I argue that the appropriations process should not be made to bear the burden while the authorizing committees study the question. 
   All section 329 seeks to do is preserve the status quo, as the already limited resources of our home States' National Forests would be further stretched if they are required to fund this new standard. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support sensible management.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I also associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Wyoming commending Senator ROTH and the Finance Committee for their work on this very important landmark tax relief legislation the Senate passed today. I believe, in taking the step we did today, in lowering the tax burden upon the American people from 21 percent of GDP to 20 percent of the gross domestic product, we have taken a modest but a very important step in providing relief to all Americans. I commend the Senate today, and the staff, and ask the President to reconsider his proposed veto.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced the Hutchinson-Lincoln Wetlands Reserve Program Enhancement Act to help strengthen the popular Wetlands Reserve Program administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Simply put, this legislation will act to strengthen the current WRP which provides financial incentives to farmers and private landowners who voluntarily set aside marginal lands and restore them to optimal wetland wildlife habitat. 
   These restored wildlife areas are some of the best wildlife conservation habitat in America and are critical to the future of waterfowl throughout our Nation. Established by the 1990 farm bill as a long-term conservation option for farmers, the WRP protects farm wetlands using 10-year, 30-year, and permanent easements. Land which is eligible for WRP is characterized by wetlands that are farmed, lands adjacent to protected wetlands, and croplands and pastures which are naturally prone to flooding. 
   If eligible, the landowner voluntarily limits the use of the lands while retaining private ownership and access to the land. In addition, they may also lease the land for hunting, fishing, and other undeveloped recreational activities. The NRCS, in conjunction with the landowner, then develops a plan for the restoration and the maintenance of the wetland. 
   Once restored, wetlands act to: No. 1, improve water quality by filtering sediments; No. 2, reduce flooding; No. 3, recharge ground water; No. 4, promote biological diversity; and No. 5, furnish educational, recreational, and aesthetic benefits. These benefits, as a result of the WRP, have helped landowners throughout the 46 States where farmers have currently enrolled in what has become a very successful program. 
   At the local level, I want to mention three farmers in Arkansas who are benefiting from the WRP. Hattie Neely of Moro, AR, in Lee County, grows soybeans and has enrolled 31 acres in this very important program. Then there is Donald Wallace of Gillett, AR, in Arkansas County, who grows soybeans, and he has enrolled 30 acres in the WRP. And Dick Carmichael of Monticello, AR, in Drew County, grows soybeans and rice and has enrolled 115 acres in the WRP. 
   In each case, these farmers are using the WRP to restore bottom land hardwood forests and a natural wildlife habitat. Other farmers in Arkansas are using WRP to retire agricultural lands unsuited for crop production because of elevated levels of salt from irrigation water. In this case, WRP lands filter runoffs, keeping salts and sediments in the wetlands and out of the natural waterways. 
   Despite the benefits to farmers across America, the WRP will soon become a victim of its own success. The current WRP is authorized to enroll up to 975,000 acres nationally through the year 2002. WRP is in such high demand from America's farmers that it will reach its acreage cap next year. The top 10 States--Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, California, Missouri, Iowa, Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Illinois--have a combined enrollment of almost 427,000 acres in these States alone. 
   In response to the success of WRP, my bill seeks to expand the acreage cap from the proposed 180,000 acres in fiscal year 2000 to a newly authorized maximum of 250,000 acres per year through the year 2005. This will help to ensure that farmers who want to enroll in the program will have the option to do so. 
   There is no doubt that the American farmer faces an industry that is in crisis. In the race to find solutions for the many challenges facing farmers, I want to ensure that my colleagues in the Senate do not overlook the importance of conservation to family farmers, both as a way to protect valuable wildlife resources and as a source of additional income. 
   In the Mississippi Delta, family farmers are using the WRP to move frequently flooded farmland away from high-risk, high-cost farming back to original hardwood timberlands. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of family farmers who care about protecting the natural resources with which they are entrusted. I ask my colleagues to consider the importance of wildlife conservation in the life of family farmers. Join me in the support of what I think is very good, very important, bipartisan conservation legislation.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Bingaman amendment. As I read the amendment, it suggests we shift $132 billion from tax breaks that disproportionately benefit upper-income taxpayers to sustain our investment in public education and prepare children for the 21st century, including our investment programs such as IDEA, special education, Pell grant, Head Start, and to fully fund the class size initiative. 
   I will comment on every aspect of that particular statement. This amendment presents a false choice. It suggests to my colleagues and to the American people Members either have to be for tax relief for the American people or to be for public education, but Members can't be for both. If Members really support public education, then they will want to shift $132 billion out of the suggested tax relief and put it into various aspects of public education. That is a false choice. 
   It proves one thing conclusively, the concern many Members have had as we hear the arguments on the other side as they repeatedly say: We shouldn't give tax relief to the American people because we need to pay down the national debt. 
   We have suggested it won't ever go to pay down the national debt but any left will immediately be used for more spending. Before the ink is even dry from the passage of this tax relief bill, the proposals are coming forth in a torrent as to how we should spend the $792 billion proposed tax relief package for the American people. 
   If we do not pass the $792 billion tax relief, that money will not go to paying down the national debt. It will, as already suggested in the speeches on the other side in the last few minutes, immediately go into more spending. 
   IDEA funding is an important issue for school districts across the Nation. It is important in Arkansas but not an issue to be addressed by reducing the amount of hard-earned dollars that are returned to American taxpayers. 
   In addition, the Class Size Reduction Program is only in its first year. It has not even been authorized. It was first included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill and is being considered during this year's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is where it should be considered. We should not be setting aside funds for a program that has never been authorized and has, quite frankly, done very little right now in reducing class size across the country. 
   The Class Size Reduction Program already forces too many regulations on to school districts. Many States have already implemented class size reduction programs at a level of 19 or 20 students per year. The Federal class size program mandates a ratio of 18 students for every teacher. This forces States to slightly alter their State plan to receive any Federal funding. Many school districts in my home State have chosen not to participate in the Class Size Reduction Program because of the excessive regulations that  govern the use of funds. Any school district that does not receive enough funds to hire a new teacher must form a consortium in order to do so. 
   Given the fact in my home State of Arkansas there are 311 school districts, 167 school districts, 54 percent will be forced to form a consortium even to hire a single teacher because their allocations are less than $20,000. Some school districts, such as Randolph County, report they cannot form a consortium and they share a teacher within the consortium 
   because of geographic reasons. 
   Class size reduction has not proven to be effective unless class size is significantly reduced to 12 or 13 students, which is not even envisioned in the President's Class Size Reduction Program. 
   Class size has been reduced significantly over the past 30 years, from 27.4 students per classroom in 1955 to 17 students per classroom in 1997, but the interesting thing is, as we have seen this dramatic decrease in average class size across the country, we have not seen a corresponding increase in academic achievement and standardized tests across the country. 
   The State of Arkansas will receive about 1.15 new teachers per school district, or half a teacher per elementary school. This program has not been authorized, and to suggest we will take well-deserved tax relief from the American people and put it into a program not yet authorized I think fails to make a lot of sense. 
   Once again this year we are authorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have spent months conducting hearings to learn about Federal elementary and secondary education policy. We will continue to work on ESEA throughout the year. I believe that is the appropriate place for class size reduction and many of these other education issues to be addressed properly. 
   Before we set aside Federal funds that should be rightly returned to the taxpayers, we should consider whether we even want this program authorized and appropriated in this year's legislation. This is the wrong way to do it. 
   As I think about the need for IDEA, I support increased funding for IDEA. We have done a terrible job in appropriately funding IDEA. But if we think about what is being suggested, taking it from tax relief for the American people, it is the wrong way to go. 
   In the $3 trillion surplus, $13 to $14 billion can be found to fully fund IDEA without taking it away from tax relief for the American people. IDEA is currently funded at $4.3 billion, which is about 10 percent of the cost of educating special education students. Therefore, about $17 billion would be needed to meet the federally-authorized commitment of 40 percent. This works out to an appropriation of an additional $13 billion to fully fund IDEA. I suggest to my colleagues, that $13 billion can certainly be found in the projected $3 trillion surplus for this obligation over the next 10 years. 
   This is a wrongheaded amendment, and it is the wrong place to do this. But it certainly proves that this $792 billion will not go to debt reduction. It will go to extensive additional spending programs. 
   I could not vote for this proposed amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, apart from the $132 billion that it suggests we take away from tax relief, because it improperly characterizes the Republican tax relief package by saying it disproportionately benefits upper-income taxpayers. I suggest this is one of the great myths being perpetrated about Senator ROTH's tax relief package that has been produced by the Finance Committee. 
   This proposal will reduce the lowest personal income tax rate, the lowest rate, from 15 percent to 14 percent, beginning in 2001 and then would gradually expand the bracket so more people would pay that lowest rate. It would benefit 70 million Americans; 55 percent of Americans would benefit from that provision alone. That is not a tax break for the wealthy, and I wish my honest and true colleagues on the other side would quit characterizing it as such. This amendment should not be voted for because it says it ``disproportionately benefits the wealthy,'' and it does not. 
   In the State of Arkansas there will be 683,000 people, 61 percent of the taxpayers in Arkansas, who will receive tax relief from this single provision, apart from the marriage penalty, apart from the estate tax relief. The single provision of lowering that rate from 15 percent to 14 percent and expanding the bracket will benefit 61 percent of the poorest people in Arkansas. 
   So, in all honesty, let's tell the American people the truth. This is not a tax break for the wealthy. It is a tax break for hard-working Americans who are paying far more than they should be in taxes. 
   Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest level in peacetime, a level of 21 percent of GDP--21 percent. In my home State of Arkansas, that amount translates into $7,352 in taxes per capita in 1998. I plead with my colleagues, let us not agree to this amendment. Let us not begin to dilute that which is already far too little relief for hard-working Americans who have a difficult enough time making ends meet each month. 
   Oh, we can talk about wonderful Federal programs to benefit people, and they do. But if we start down that road, there is no stopping point. Let's take more of the $800 billion tax cut and let's spend it on this program and this program and this program because, after all, don't we know best here in Washington? And we do not. 
   At the root and at the core of the debate going on in the Senate is more than just a debate over a tax package. It is more than a debate over how much relief we can provide the American people. It is a debate over philosophy. It is a debate whether your faith is in Government and your faith is in Washington and your faith is in more taxes and central control, or whether your faith is in the people of this country. We will do well to put our faith in the people and return that which belongs to them in passing the Roth tax cut bill.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to support restoring funding for the National Endowment for Democracy and commend Senator LUGAR for offering this amendment. As reported from the Appropriations Committee, the National Endowment would receive zero funding for fiscal year 2000 with the assumption that the Department of State would provide money from its democracy and human rights accounts. 
   Since its inception in 1983, NED has sought to maintain an ideological balance, with a bipartisan, multisectoral core structure, as well as a bipartisan board. Its status of being simultaneously public and private has provided insulation from shifts and tides in changing administrations, allowing NED to focus on long-term democracy development. This independent role would be compromised if NED were subjected to State Department control. 
   For almost 16 years, NED has been instrumental in building the foundations of democracy in over 80 countries, including peaceful transitions in Poland, Chile, and South Africa. Today NED continues to support a diverse portfolio of democracy building initiatives. In the Sudan, NED funds support human rights monitoring and reporting. In the Newly Independent States (NIS) and in Russia, NED has been supporting anti-corruption efforts, market-based reforms, independent media, and civic education. These programs lie in the long term interest of the U.S. because they will help to promote stability in a region plagued by instability. They will help these countries to emerge from the mire of communism. 
   NED programs are also important in the People's Republic of China. Mr. President, I think we are all aware of the egregious human rights abuses perpetrated by the authoritarian government in China. The insecure government controls pastors and church members through state apparatus, imprisons prodemocracy advocates for their activities, and suppresses the truth through propaganda instead of allowing open media. Thousands of political prisoners languish in prison, many sentenced after unfair trials, others without any trial whatsoever. 
   Under the totalitarian regime in China, the political system is a sealed door with no clear signs of opening. Many in the United States have placed their faith in economic progress to produce some sort of eventual political change in China. I do not believe that we can afford to make such a dangerous assumption. Even as the Chinese people suffer, so too will the advocates of ``trade at all costs'' under the current political system, because of the absence of the rule of law. When trying to conduct business in China, American companies must deal with bureaucrats rather than regulations, evasions rather than enforcement, and convolution rather than competition--because there is no judicious rule of law. 
   We all want to see democracy in China. But we cannot assume that it will happen by itself. Instead, we must take steps to foster democracy. That is exactly what NED is about. NED funds over twenty programs to promote human 
   rights and democracy in China. 
   With money from NED, the International Republican Institute supports electoral and legal reform. 
   The National Democratic Institute monitors civil and political liberties in Hong Kong following its transfer to China. 
   The Laogai Research Foundation, run by former dissident and prisoner Harry Wu, conducts in-depth research into China's forced labor prison camps. 
   Another NED grantee is run by chairman Lie Qing, who spent eleven years in prison for his involvement in the Democracy Wall movement. This organization has been invaluable in monitoring human rights conditions in China and has been helping victims' families bring criminal charges against Chinese leaders responsible for the 1989 Tiananmen killings. 
   NED also supports VIP Reference, an organization that has taken advantage of the Internet to promote the free flow of information in China--news that has not been filtered or altered by the Chinese government. Besides opening this conduit to freedom, NED also supports research and publications on democracy and constitutionalism, symposia on private enterprise and market economics, and publications relevant to Tibet. 
   Mr. President, these organizations are not rich by any means. In many cases, their staff works on a volunteer basis, out of their conviction to see freedom in China. They rely on funding from NED to stay in operation because other sources of funding from Hong Kong and Taiwan are scarce. Those potential sources fear offending China. Private businesses often will not fund these groups because they consider it too great a risk in light of their business interests in China. Only Congress has remained committed to funding these advocates of democracy. Without NED funding, we will cripple these programs and remove a key fulcrum in the push for democracy in China. 
   Democracy building is not a quick fix for totalitarianism, nor will it produce instant change. But in the long run, these programs will produce a result worth far more than they cost today. 
   I commend Senator LUGAR for taking this leadership role, for offering this amendment. I believe it is critically important we support and pass this amendment, not just for China but for advocates of democracy all over this world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a restoration in the National Endowment for Democracy's funding for fiscal year 2000. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator SNOWE to voice my deep concerns regarding the substantial cut to the economic Development Administration's Fiscal Year 2000 budget. The FY 2000 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill being considered by the Senate cuts EDA's budget by $164.1 million--from $392.4 million in FY 1999 to $228.3 million for FY 2000. This represents a  42 percent cut. Clearly, this reduction will have a dramatic affect on the EDA's ability to serve distressed rural and urban communities in states like Arkansas, New Hampshire, Maine, Alaska, New Mexico, Kentucky, and Colorado. 
   My colleagues will remember that last November we passed the Economic Development Administration Reform Act of 1998. In response, the EDA has become a more efficient and effective agency by reducing regulations by 60 percent; they have trimmed the period of processing applications to 60 days; and they are now requiring applicants to demonstrate both eligibility and need at the time of application. I firmly believe that these achievements will only strengthen the EDA's history of providing critical assistance to distressed areas. 
   In its 34 years of service to Americans, the EDA has created 2.9 million private sector jobs; investing $16.8 billion in distressed communities. Currently, every $1 invested by the EDA generates $3 in outside investment. With an administrative overhead of less than 8%, more Americans in economically distressed areas benefit from their tax dollars. 
   This is good news for my home state. As a rural state with many economically distressed communities, Arkansas relies heavily on the EDA and their invaluable services. Sam Spearman, who heads EDA in Arkansas, is a true servant and a great asset to my constituents. From the tornadoes that tore through northeast and central Arkansas this January, to the Levi-Strauss and Arrow Automotive closing in Morrilton, Arkansas, the EDA is helping communities stay alive. To help grow the economies in some depressed areas, the EDA has been assisting in planning and developing inter-modal facilities in Marion and West Memphis. 
   My state was not immune to BRAC in the early 1990s. A Strategic Air Command bomber base in Blytheville and an Army training facility in Fort Smith were closed. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am happy to report to my colleagues that both communities are slowly recovering, but not without ongoing assistance from EDA. 
   Again, last November we passed legislation to restructure and reform the EDA. I believe that they have responded well to Congressional direction, however, reducing their funding by 42% greatly limits their ability to implement the changes we thought were necessary. I thank my colleagues and hope that they will support increasing funding to EDA in FY 2000.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I applaud the Senator from Maine for her outstanding leadership on this legislation and particularly for this amendment and the tax provisions which I believe are going to provide significant tax relief. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 3.8 million taxpayers benefit from this provision on long-term care. It is an important provision. Senator COLLINS and Senator GRASSLEY have been great leaders in pushing for this. I applaud their efforts. 
   I will briefly address the provisions in this amendment regarding access to emergency services, an issue we debated at some length yesterday. I think the provisions in this amendment adequately and significantly improve the Republican bill and address the concerns that have been expressed. 
   Let me compare briefly the Kennedy bill and the Republican bill in this area. Both bills, with the adoption of this amendment, will eliminate prior authorization for visiting the emergency room. This was included in the committee bill as it came out. We reaffirmed that in the amendment. It eliminates the need for the requirement for prior authorization, something that is obvious, something that is common sense. If you have an emergency event, you don't want to get preauthorization before you go to the emergency room. We eliminate that requirement for prior authorization. For policies that have it, we prohibit that. 
   Both bills require coverage for medical screening exams and stabilization services under the prudent layperson standard for emergency. 
   That language, that provision, is included in both the Democrat bill and the Republican bill. Both bills, with the adoption of this amendment, will ensure that patients will not have to pay more for emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider than an in-network provider. Many of the stories and examples we have heard on the floor of the Senate regarded individuals who had to pass by an emergency room when something tragic occurred, drive across town to find a provider that was in the network. 
   That should never happen. It should not ever be required. No one should bypass an emergency room that is close to them because they are afraid of having to pay a penalty or pay a higher copay because that emergency room is not in the network. So we would prohibit that kind of differential. The Democrat bill has that provision. With the adoption of this amendment, we would prohibit that. You would go to the closest emergency room. 
   Both bills, with the adoption of this amendment, would provide the coverage of poststabilization services. The Republican amendment will do the following. It will require coverage of services to maintain the stability of the patient, those services which are related to the emergency condition, treatment related to the emergency condition, provided in the emergency room, and under the condition that the health plan has been contacted by the nonparticipating provider regarding approval for such services. 
   If the plan has not responded within 1 hour--this is exactly what is required under Medicare--to arrange for transfer, discharge, or for further care at a nonnetwork facility, the plan continues to be liable for the care needed to maintain stability and those conditions related to the emergency situation. 
   So we believe this is very strong language. It provides the kind of protections we need for poststabilization services. What it does not do--and this is the difference, this is the distinction--it does not allow someone to go into the emergency room with a genuine emergency and then ask for treatment of a condition totally unrelated to the emergency event. If you go in and you have a knee injury because of a fall and then, after you have been stabilized, you tell the doctor you have not had your heart checked and you haven't had an x ray and you want this done or that done, on conditions totally unrelated to the emergency event, that should not be required to be covered by the insurance policy. 
   We clarified what we believe was ambiguous language, where there had been abuses, to ensure that in fact treatment has to be related to the emergency event. 
   I think it is a very strong provision, and I urge my colleagues to support the overall amendment and this provision regarding access to emergency services.

I respond to the Senator from Florida by, first of all, complimenting him for his concern and interest in this issue and for, I think, pointing out clearly some improvements that were needed in the committee bill.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator, the change in the amendment is in in-network uniform cost sharing. That was the intent to be permitted. The amendment, on page 19, on out-of-network care, makes it abundantly clear that such differentials in going to an emergency room that may not be in the network and requiring a penalty, requiring an additional copayment because you went to an out-of-network, would not be permissible.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I don't think it is ambiguous at all. There has been a misunderstanding of the language in the amendment. 
   Certainly, there can be a differential in a network plan between going to an emergency room and going to a provider other than an emergency room. That is what is clear both in the bill and in the amendment. If you will listen to the language of the out-of-network case, I think it is as unambiguous as any language can be:  
   The plan shall cover emergency medical care under the plan in a manner so that, if such care is provided to a participant or beneficiary by a nonparticipating health care provider, the participant or beneficiary is not liable for amounts that exceed the amounts of liability that would be incurred if the services were provided by a participating provider.  
   I believe that is as clear and unambiguous as language can be. It was our intent that you should not have any incentive to drive across town while your child or your spouse is in jeopardy, that you should be able and would be able to go to the closest emergency room without incurring additional costs. That is what the amendment does, and that is what I think should be done.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I express not only my appreciation but the appreciation of all Senators for the expertise that Senator FRIST brings to this important issue, as well as the care and compassion he has demonstrated throughout his career, even during his time in the Senate, in caring for other people in emergencies. He certainly brings a great deal of personal experience and expertise to this issue. 
   I rise to speak on this issue of access to emergency services and to explain why I believe my colleagues should oppose the Graham amendment. The amendment tree to which the Graham amendment was filed is now full. I alert my colleagues to an amendment I will be offering further along in the debate--I have been assured of the opportunity to do that--which will address the concerns raised by Senator Graham but, I think, addresses them in a far more responsible way.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator from Texas asks for that clarification. 
   I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment by Senator GRAHAM of Florida, knowing they will have an opportunity to vote for a clarification amendment dealing with emergency services later on. 
   My amendment will remove the ambiguity that I think is so evident in the Graham amendment which will create such problems. The Republican provision, as reported out of the HELP Committee, requires group health plans covered by the scope of our bill to pay, without prior authorization, for an emergency medical screening exam and any additional emergency care required to stabilize the emergency condition for an individual who has sought emergency medical services as a prudent layperson. 
   As I listened to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Maryland, it is clear that what the Republican bill does and what my amendment will do needs clarification for my colleagues, because Jackie, the example that was given, would be covered, very clearly. The prior authorization issue is clearly covered. The closest emergency room issue is covered. The prudent layperson definition is repeatedly used. 
   Prudent layperson is defined as an individual who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that a person who has a reason to believe they are experiencing an emergency, according to the prudent layperson standard, will not, cannot, be denied coverage. If they are diagnosed with heartburn instead of a heart attack, they are still going to be covered under the prudent layperson definition. 
   In addition, by eliminating the requirement for prior authorization, no prior authorization will be required. Jackie doesn't have to make a phone call while she is unconscious; no one has to make a phone call asking for prior authorization. We ensure that individuals can go to the nearest emergency facility. 
   On the issue of cost sharing, plans may impose cost sharing on emergency services, but the cost-sharing requirement cannot be greater for out-of-network emergency services than they require for in-network services.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield when I conclude my comments. Let me go ahead because I think I may answer many of those questions as I go through. 
   An individual who has sought emergency services from a nonparticipating provider cannot be held liable for charges beyond what that individual would have paid for services from a participating provider. 
   Senator ENZI and I offered an amendment to this effect in the committee, and it was adopted by the committee. That amendment and the provision that is in the underlying Republican bill says that if a group health plan, other than a fully insured group health plan, provides any benefits with respect to emergency medical care as defined in subsection (c), the plan shall cover emergency medical care under the plan in a manner so that if such care is provided to a participant or beneficiary by a nonparticipating health care provider, the participant or beneficiary is not liable for amounts that exceed the amounts of liability that would be incurred if the services were provided by a participating provider. It is not going to cost the patient more if they go to a nonparticipating provider in that emergency room than they would if they went to one that was within their network. 
   As I think was pointed out by my colleague, Senator FRIST, and Senator GRAHAM of Florida last evening, the committee report language needs clarification on the committee's intention on cost sharing for in- and out-of-network emergency services. My amendment will certainly make that clarification. 
   My amendment will also improve the access to emergency services provision reported by the HELP Committee by requiring the plan to pay for necessary care provided in the emergency room to maintain medical stability following the stabilization of an emergency medical condition until the plan contacts the nonparticipating provider to arrange for transfer or discharge. If the plan fails to respond within a very narrow, specific time period, the plan is responsible for necessary stabilizing care in any setting, including in-patient admission. 
   We clearly state in the amendment which I will offer that these stabilizing services must be directly related to the emergency condition that has been stabilized. I think this was the point Senator FRIST made so very eloquently: If you do not make that connection, if you do not have the requirement that it has to be related to the emergency condition that has been stabilized, then you truly have a loophole. You open the door that totally undermines the concept of coordinated care. 
   To understand the true impact of the Republican access to emergency services provision as clarified and improved  by my amendment, let me offer the following scenarios and show how they are addressed by our provision in the bill. 
   Several examples have been repeated a number of times by my colleagues across the aisle. Let me use their examples. They specifically mentioned the case of a mother with a febrile child who called her health plan before going to the emergency room and was required to go to an in-network emergency facility, passing several nearby facilities on the way. Her child, tragically, had a serious infection which, due to the delay in care, resulted in amputation. There were very moving pictures of this particular child. Under our bill, a mother with a sick child will be able to access the closest emergency room, and she won't get stuck with the bill because she did not get prior authorization. 
   In a case referred to by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, if someone has taken a 40-foot fall and has been helicoptered to a hospital and delivered to an emergency room in a state of unconsciousness with fractured bones in three parts of her body, does that person have a right to emergency care under the Republican bill? The answer is yes, 
   because we eliminate the prior authorization requirement. The case cited by my colleague from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, where a woman came into an emergency room after falling and sustaining a complex fracture to her elbow, and the emergency physician diagnosed the problem and stabilized the patient. The stabilization process took less than 2 hours, but the patient's stay in the emergency room lasted for another 10 hours while the staff attempted to coordinate the care with the patient's health plan. The plan was unable to make a timely decision. 
   Under the Republican bill, the woman in this case will not have to wait hours on end for a response from her health plan. Under our provision, as improved by my amendment, the health plan must respond to the nonparticipating provider within a specific timeframe to arrange for further care. 
   Under the Democrats' bill, plans are required to pay, without prior authorization, for emergency services and ``maintenance and post stabilization services as defined by HCFA [Health Care Financing Administration] and Federal regulations to implement the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.'' I believe this is where the Democrat provision goes wrong and, quite frankly, it shows where we can make a much-needed improvement to the Balanced Budget Act language. 
   In the September 28th Federal Register, Volume 63, HCFA defines poststabilization as ``medically necessary, nonemergency services furnished to an enrollee after he or she is stabilized following an emergency medical condition.'' 
   Now, that definition is completely vague and completely open-ended. I think it would be a serious mistake to take that language and to transport it into this very important bill. 
   Under this definition, a plan could conceivably be required to pay for services by a nonparticipating provider that are completely unrelated to the emergency conditions for which that patient was treated. To go in for one particular emergency, and while you are in that poststabilization period, to say: By the way, I also have a problem here and here; can you deal with that? And then require the plan to cover it, I think that would be a very serious mistake. The confusion and the ambiguity in the language is further perpetuated by conflicting statements on the meaning of ``poststabilization'' found in other places in the regulations. 
   So my amendment will provide for timely coordination of care. It ensures that the patient will receive the appropriate stabilizing services related to their emergency medical condition. The prudent layperson standard assures that a plan cannot retrospectively deny coverage for an event that was felt to be an emergency medical condition at the time the individual sought emergency care. It eliminates the prior authorization requirement so an individual can go to the nearest emergency facility and not have to worry about whether they are going to be covered if they go to a nonparticipating provider and that they might get stuck with the bill. 
   While my colleagues say they are simply adopting what was passed under Medicare, it is my contention that the provision I am offering will be an improvement on what is in Medicare because of the open-endedness and ambiguity of the language. I suggest that at some point we are going to have to revisit the Medicare provision and improve it as well. 
   In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Graham of Florida emergency room amendment and vote for the amendment I will be offering later in the debate. Since this amendment tree 
   is now full, I will have to offer that at a later point.

In responding to the Senator, if there are no abuses, there should be no concern about clarifying language to ensure that, in fact, poststabilization treatment is related to the emergency room event. That is what I believe needs to be done. I think whether or not we can point to specific abuses in Medicare or not, the ambiguity in the language in Medicare is open to those kinds of abuses, and we will certainly see that occur if it is expanded to all managed care plans in the country. We certainly need to clarify that and ensure that the poststabilizations are related to the emergency room event.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to take just one moment to respond to the question that was posed as to our specific concern about the language in the Graham of Florida amendment. The Graham of Florida amendment adopts the Medicare language. I will quote that Medicare language, from the September 28 Federal Register, volume 63. HCFA defines poststabilization, and I quote as I did before:  
   ..... medically necessary nonemergency services furnished to an enrollee after he or she is stabilized following an emergency medical condition.  
   That is as vague and open-ended as any language I could conceive. It is, in  effect, a blank check for the emergency room, for the provider, for the patient. That is the language that needs clarification. 
   We believe the poststabilization medical services that are provided must be related to the emergency event that caused the individual to go to the emergency room. That is the clarification that is necessary. I will be delighted to once again go through the amendment summary that I will be offering, but that is a critical flaw in the Graham of Florida amendment. Because of that flaw in the language, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Graham of Florida amendment.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, in the area of emergency group services, both bills eliminate prior authorization, and they should. You should not have to call your insurance company before you go to the emergency room. Both bills establish a process for timely coordination of care, including services to maintain stability of the patient. 
   I will be offering an amendment that will make it perfectly clear in the Republican bill that there can be no greater costs charged for those going to an out-of-network emergency room as those going to an in-network emergency room. There should not be a differential. I will make very certain in my amendment that there is no such differential. 
   The Graham amendment is flawed, and it is seriously flawed because it uses language that is confusing for patients, confusing for plans and providers, it is vague and ambiguous, and it does not ensure that poststabilization services are related to the emergency condition. That is a gaping loophole. It is a blank check to say you have to provide services for a condition that is absolutely unrelated to the reason you went to the emergency room. 
   My amendment I will be offering will fix that vague and ambiguous language to be sure that what is provided in the emergency room for poststabilization services are related to the condition for which the patient went to the emergency room. 
   This is a very dangerous amendment in that it is vague and ambiguous and leaves a blank check, a gaping loophole that needs to be fixed. I ask my colleagues to reject the Graham amendment.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, the sense of the Senate regarding the State being the primary regulator of health insurance plans, as well as the provision supporting 100 percent deductibility for the self-employed. 
   We talk about scope. We talk about increasing the number of people in this country who have health insurance. This is one of the most important steps we could possibly take. 
   Over the next 3 days, the Senate will debate legislation that will impact the lives of every American in terms of health care benefits they receive. The Kennedy bill that we will talk a lot about in the next few days, while called the Patients' Bill of Rights, is certainly not as simple as it sounds. It involves decreased access; it involves higher costs; and it involves the quality of our Nation's health care. 
   In 1997, the percentage of uninsured individuals under the age of 65 in my home State of Arkansas was 28.2 percent. Arkansas ranks the lowest in the country in terms of the percentage of individuals covered by private insurance and is second to dead last in terms of the percentage of workers covered by employment-based health insurance. 
   An even more alarming figure is that Arkansas has the highest rate of uninsured children in the Nation. I applaud the efforts of our Governor in Arkansas and the State legislature in trying to change that, but still it is a very alarming figure. 
   Any legislation this body passes will have a direct impact on Arkansas workers and families. The bill introduced by Senator KENNEDY and his colleagues would increase premiums by as much as 6.1 percent according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we pass the Kennedy bill and were it signed into law, over 1.8 million people would lose their health insurance coverage. 
   We see heartrending portrayals of those who have been denied care under managed care plans, and we ought to be concerned about that. That is why we have a bill that is going to provide protections for 48 million Americans  under self-insured ERISA plans. But as Senator FRIST from Tennessee well pointed out, let's not forget the millions, over 40 million Americans, who are without any health insurance at all and whose numbers are going up by the day. 
   The Kennedy bill, by increasing premiums over 6 percent, will result in over 1 million, nearly 2 million more Americans being added to the ranks of the uninsured. Let's not forget those. Those are the ones who are most vulnerable. If we could only put up their portraits, portrayals of those millions of Americans who, day in and day out, are living without the protection that most Americans take for granted in their health insurance plans, I think we would see the Kennedy bill, the so-called Bill of Rights, in a different light altogether. 
   If we pass the Kennedy bill, 1.8 million people will lose health insurance coverage they now have. That is demonstrated by a Lewin study commissioned by the AFL-CIO which shows that for every 1 percent increase in premiums an additional 300,000 people will become uninsured. 
   My colleague, Senator KENNEDY, during the markup of the Republicans' Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, stated that this premium increase would be spread out over several years; therefore somehow that made it acceptable. I suspect that the 6-plus percent increase in premiums being spread out over several years and the additional 1.8 million people added to the ranks of the uninsured which occurs over several years is of little comfort to those who will lose their insurance as a result of this bill. No matter how you slice it, the total number of people impacted, the 1.8 million people impacted, remains the same. That is simply unacceptable. 
   Last year, 98 Members of the Senate voted for an amendment expressing their belief that Congress should not increase the number of uninsured. Clearly, the Kennedy health care bill violates this statement of belief. The uninsured population in the United States grew from 32 million to, most recently, 43 million in 1997. It is certain the Kennedy legislation will only make this growing problem even worse. 
   The result of passing the Kennedy health care bill is more hard-working Arkansas families, more American families will go without health care insurance. The Kennedy bill gives quality health care only to those who can afford it. On average, the Kennedy bill would cost employees an additional $183 per year according to the Congressional Budget Office, and the cost for families under the Kennedy bill is estimated to be an additional $275 per year. Whether it is $183 or $275 per year, the Kennedy bill places a huge additional expense on American families which many simply cannot afford. What the Democrats give with one hand, they take away with the other. How can you say you are protecting people when you are taking their insurance away from them? 
   By contrast, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, I believe, is both rational and responsible. It protects those who are not covered by State regulations. It ensures that health insurance premiums will not rise more than a fraction of a percent according to CBO. It also provides important tax incentives to increase access to health insurance for the current uninsured population, including the 100 percent deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed and the expansion of medical savings accounts. 
   There are few more effective things we could do in the area of patients' rights to expand access than to include the self-employed and give them that 100-percent deductibility that they so deserve. According to one recent poll by Public Opinion Strategies, 82 percent of the public want Congress to make health care more affordable. The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act responds to that need and that overwhelming desire of the American people. 
   Does the Kennedy bill do anything for the 43 million uninsured Americans in this country? The answer to that is very simple, it is very plain, and I think it is absolutely undisputed. The Kennedy bill does nothing to assist 43 million Americans who do not currently have health insurance get that insurance they so desperately need. It does nothing. So while we hear from bleeding hearts, while we hear emotional stories, I ask my colleagues to remember, I ask the American people to remember, the 43 million who currently do not have insurance need to have it more accessible. The Republican bill does that while providing greatly enhanced protections for the 43 million Americans who are in self-insured plans under ERISA. 
   Not only does the Kennedy bill increase cost and decrease access, it creates a whole new system of Government-run health care. The Kennedy bill would create 359 new Federal mandates, 59 new sets of Federal regulations, and would require 3,828 new Federal bureaucrats to enforce the legislation at a cost to taxpayers of $155 million per year. The question begs to be asked: Who will benefit from this new bureaucracy and maze of Government regulation? Patients? Or the bureaucrats? I think we know the answer. 
   It is illustrated by a chart we have already seen today. The bottom of this chart, a summary of the effects of the Kennedy bill, are all of the new mandates that would be imposed as a result of the Kennedy legislation. Flowing from these mandates are the arrows and all of the various bureaucratic agencies required to enforce the Kennedy health care bill. 
   It is simply a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating health care in this country. It disregards the good work that has already been done by the States in this area, as opposed to what the Republican bill does, building upon the good works the States have already done in patient protections. 
   Mr. President, 42 States have already enacted a Patients' Bill of Rights; 47 States already enforce consumer protections regarding gag clauses on doctor-patient communications; 40 States already enforce consumer protections for access to emergency care services; 50 States, every State already has requirements for grievance procedures; and 36 States already require direct access to an OB/GYN. 
   The Kennedy bill imposes a blanket of heavy-handed Federal mandates on States and throws away the States' hard work to tailor patient protections for their populations' specific needs. One size does not fit all. What may be appropriate for California may not be appropriate for a rural State such as Arkansas. 
   When the Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, it agreed that States should have primary responsibility for the regulation of insurance. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has also spoken on this issue. We have heard about this on the floor of the Senate today. In a March 16, 1999, letter to members of the Health and Education Committee, the commissioners stated their concern. They said:  
   It is our belief that states should and will continue the efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.  
   That is precisely what the Republican bill does. Congress needs to act to protect the 48 million Americans covered by self-insured ERISA plans. It should not override the States in the area that they have primary responsibility. 
   My colleague, Mr. KENNEDY, says the Republican bill leaves millions of Americans without any protection. That is false. If you are not covered by an ERISA self-insured plan, you fall under the protections enacted by your State legislature, a group in which most Americans have greater confidence, I daresay, than in their Federal officials hundreds of miles away. This is why the Republican bill applies patient protections to the 48 million Americans who currently do not have any protections. It is sound policy and it makes good sense. 
   The Republican bill also creates new rights for millions more Americans. For instance, all 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored health plans will have an improved internal appeals process available to them as well as a new, independent, external review process. These 124 million Americans will also be entitled to clear and complete information about their health plan, about what their health plan does  and what it does not cover, about copayments, and about other plan procedures and policies. 
   Our bill also improves existing Federal law on insurance underwriting with regard to preexisting conditions by ensuring that all 140 million Americans' group and individual plans will not be discriminated against by health insurers on the basis of predicted genetic information. Ironically, Senator KENNEDY's bill includes several provisions that were specifically rejected by the President's Advisory Commission on health care quality. 
   For example, State-run ombudsman programs were rejected by the Commission. Yet they are included in the Kennedy bill. This is the President's Advisory Commission on health care quality. 
   The Kennedy bill also includes 12 other Federal mandates that were not specifically recommended by the President's Advisory Commission. 
   In its report, the Commission states that it sought to ``balance the need for stronger consumer rights with the need to keep coverage affordable.'' 
   That is the balance we have sought to maintain in our Republican bill. It is rejected by the Democrats in the Kennedy bill; it is embodied in the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. 
   The bottom line is that cost does matter because cost is directly related to access and the number of uninsured in our country. If cost was not such a factor, why have the Democrats tried to reduce CBO's scoring of their own bill? It is a factor. It is a big factor. It is an important factor because it affects who can buy insurance and how many millions of Americans are going to go without insurance protection. 
   Guess how the Democrats thought about trying to reduce that CBO scoring. They sought to reduce the CBO scoring by taking away legal remedies currently available to those in ERISA health plans.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the State Department authorization bill. Specifically, I would like to commend Chairman HELMS for the inclusion of a number of provisions dealing with China. These provisions closely mirror legislation that I introduced last year and earlier this year as Senate bill 89. 
   Section 701 of this act contains a number of findings on the human rights situation in China from the State Department's Annual Report on human rights practices. The government of the People's Republic of China continues to commit widespread and egregious abuses of internationally recognized human rights. Its prisons are overflowing with tortured and mistreated citizens who would dare to practice their faiths or exercise a political voice. Religious persecution, crackdowns on political dissent, restrictions on the press, forced labor, forced abortions, repression of people in Tibet and Xinjiang province are, unfortunately, still a part of daily life in China. 
   In order to shed light on the dark practices of the Chinese government, section 702 of this bill earmarks $2.2 million of money authorized for the Department of State for additional personnel in U.S. embassies and consulates for each of FY2000 and FY2001 to monitor political and economic conditions, particularly human rights. These new personnel, along with the creation of a prison information registry for the People's Republic of China in section 703, will make it all the more difficult for the Chinese government to deny that these abuses persist. With more centralized and accessible information, we will be able to better advocate for the release of these prisoners of conscience or faith. 
   It is also important that the people of China have access to the truth. The U.S. may have accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, but it was no accident that the people did not hear President Clinton's repeated apologies. Section 502 of this bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia, bringing objective reporting to the people of China. 
   Section 705 strongly condemns the practice of organ harvesting, where organs from executed prisoners are sold on the black market or where prisoners are executed for their organs. According to our own State Department, ``In recent years, credible reports have alleged that organs from some executed  prisoners were removed, sold, and transplanted. Officials have confirmed that executed prisoners are among the sources of organs for transplant but maintain that consent is required from prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed *.*.* there were credible reports that patients from Taiwan had undergone organ transplant operations on the mainland, using organs removed from executed criminals.'' Where and when organ harvesting is taking place in China, it must be stopped. 
   Equally horrific is the practice of forcing women to undergo forced abortions or forced sterilization under the Chinese government's population control policies. Women who are pregnant with a second child find themselves and their relatives harassed, fined, and sometimes even have their homes destroyed until they are ultimately forced to undergo an abortion, even in the latest stages of pregnancy. Last June, the House International Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights heard testimony of these practices from Gao Xiao Duan, a former administrator of forced abortion, as well as Zhou Shiu Yon, a victim of these policies. I believe that it is only appropriate that Congress act in response to this horrid devaluation of human life. Section 721 restricts visas for any foreign national whom the Secretary of State finds to have been directly involved in the establishment or enforcement of population control policies involving forced abortion or forced sterilization. There is no reason why we should welcome into our country those individuals who have no respect for human life. 
   United States-China relations are strained at this time. Amidst the whirlwind of controversy, including espionage, campaign donations, the accidental embassy bombing, and a near $60 billion trade deficit, there are some who would argue that we should be quiet about human rights in order to preserve the relationship. But I would argue that human rights must not be swept off our agenda. The Chinese government would like nothing more than for us to censor ourselves. I believe that this legislation will help to ensure that human rights and the defense of internationally recognized standards are kept intact. 
   Mr. President, there are two additional provisions it this legislation. Section 704 requires the Secretary of State to report within 180 days on the feasibility and utility of establishing an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Asia, modeled after the OSCE. Section 722 requires semiannual reports to Congress on the status of U.S. efforts to support the membership of Taiwan in international organizations that do not require statehood, and the appropriate level of participation in international organizations that do require statehood for full membership. Taiwan's entry into international organizations has been held hostage to China's wishes for too long. In many instances, such as World Trade Organization membership, Taiwan is more qualified to join than China, yet simply because of China's sensitivities, it has been prevented from joining. 
   In the long run, we must recognize that the Chinese government is a totalitarian regime. This dictatorship does not represent the people of China, rather it abuses them in any way necessary to maintain its power. Similarly, this regime will use any necessary means to expand its power in Asia. If we are to effectively manage these aims, we will need the help of our neglected allies in the region, namely Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. 
   We cannot recover stolen information, but we must prevent future theft through increased security at our national labs and other facilities, more stringent background checks, controls on technology transfers, and a Justice Department that does not hinder its own FBI's investigations. We cannot afford to give the Chinese government the means to fulfill its military aims. 
   We should, however, give the people of China the means to build their own democracy. Increased funding for Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America, democracy building programs, and rule of law initiatives are vital because they represent an engagement with the people of China rather than the regime at the top. We must recognize the limits to engaging an insecure, transient government that is on the wrong side of history. 
   Finally, Mr. President, industry must do its part and aggressively advocate human rights. Americans doing business in China must be active advocates for human rights, to the Beijing government and to the people. They must not be complicit in slave labor or other human rights violations. The simple fact is that China desperately wants American trade and American business. U.S. companies must use this leverage to advance more than profits. 
   China is not yet our enemy, but neither is it our friend. Our China-centered foreign policy must be replaced with a regional policy. We must break off this Administration's obsession with trying to acede to Beijing's every demand. Such a policy can only strengthen a regime that will seek to extinguish the flames of democracy abroad as it has done so effectively at home.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the speedy passage of S. 1205, the fiscal year 2000 military construction appropriations bill. I compliment both Chairman BURNS and the ranking member, Senator Murray, for their excellent work in producing a bill that won the unanimous endorsement of the subcommittee. I am sure the bill will receive a similar degree of support from the entire Senate. I must also commend Senators BURNS and MURRAY for rejecting the President's premature and irresponsible attempt to incrementally fund these essential projects. The Congress must continue to send this President the clear and consistent message that his fiscal negligence toward our Armed Forces will not be tolerated. 
   I would like to take a moment to highlight two of the four important military construction projects for Arkansas included in this bill. The first is an $8.7 million project for Little Rock Air Force Base. This project is comprised of three new facilities, and the renovation of a fourth, that will greatly enhance the mission capabilities of the 189th Airlift Wing, Arkansas National Guard. The new Communications, Vehicle Maintenance and Civil Engineering/Medical Services facilities along with the renovated Aircraft Support building will stand as visible reminders of the Federal Government's commitment of Little Rock Air Force Base's bright future as an essential component of our nation's security. 
   The other military construction project I would like to highlight is one that the Subcommittee wisely added to the President's insufficient proposal. I am speaking about the inclusion of an $18 million Chemical Defense Quality Evaluation Facility to be constructed at the Pine Bluff Arsenal. 
   Pine Bluff Arsenal presently serves as the Department of Defense's primary maintenance and certification facility for chemical and biological defense equipment such as gas masks for our soldiers and air filters for M-1 tanks. The Department of Defense describes the present facility as:  
   operating at maximum capacity, beyond levels consistent with good laboratory practice, with no space for [expansion]. 
   According to the Department of Defense:  
   if this project is not provided, inadequate ..... stockpile surveillance testing will continue, with an undefined chance that defective, deteriorated or damaged protective equipment or components could be accepted or retained in stock for issue. This risk directly endangers the worker in a toxic chemical environment or the soldier facing toxic chemicals in a combat situation. [DOD] cannot ensure reliability of [chemical and biological] equipment without ..... a suitable test facility. 
   The construction of this new Chemical Defense Quality Evaluation Facility will reaffirm that defense against Weapons of Mass Destruction remains a national priority, and that the Pine Bluff Arsenal remains at the forefront of America's efforts in that endeavor. 
   I will finish by again complimenting the subcommittee for its efforts in producing this legislation, and urge my colleagues to vote for its quick adoption.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kyl amendment, which brings new security accountability and intelligent administration to the Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear weapons program. 
   The Cox report has shown us that we have ceded design information on all of our most sensitive nuclear warheads and the neutron bomb to China. These designs, our legacy codes, and our computer data have been lost because of lax security at our national labs (Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, Oak Ridge, and Sandia), incompetent administrations, and possibly, obstructions of investigations. 
   What have we lost because of this espionage? According to the Cox report, ``Information on seven U.S. thermonuclear warheads, including every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile arsenal.'' These warheads are the W-88, W-87, W-78, W-76, W-70, W-62, and W-56. China has also obtained information on a number of associated reentry vehicles. But it does not end there. China also has classified design information for the neutron bomb, which no nation has yet deployed. Other classified information, not available to the pubic, has also been stolen. 
   With this information, China has made a quantum leap in the modernization of its nuclear arsenal. China will now be able to deploy a mobile nuclear force, with its first deployment as soon as 2002. 
   The cost of these nuclear thefts is the security of the U.S. and the security of our allies in the Asia-Pacific.  The ability to miniaturize and place multiple warheads on a single ballistic missile will have serious destabilizing effects in the region. India is watching China warily, as are Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 
   I hope that our troops in the Asia-Pacific will not have to suffer for a domestic security failure. I hope that we will not have to pay for these thefts in American lives. 
   But the costs will not be limited to the Asia-Pacific region. We can bet that this information will not stay in the hands of China. China has supplied Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and Libya with sensitive military technology in the past. We have no real guarantees that China will not spread our lost secrets again. 
   This fiasco of security did not happen by accident. There was a concerted effort on behalf of the Chinese government to obtain this information and a lack of effort on part of certain individuals to protect those secrets. Janet Reno must be held accountable if she denied her own FBI the authority to investigate suspected spies. Likewise, Sandy Berger must be held accountable if he delayed notification of the President of the United States or if he delayed action on these security breaches. 
   Mr. President, for two decades we have left the door to our DOE facilities open to thieves. We have exposed our most sensitive details to China. It is time to secure the door of security. 
   We cannot reverse what has taken place. We cannot take back the information that has been stolen. But we must prevent further theft of our secrets. 
   The Kyl amendment takes necessary steps in enhancing security at our DOE facilities. It establishes increased reporting requirements to Congress and the President, as well as layers of checks and balances to knock down the stone walls of silence. This amendment also gives the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Weapons programs statutory authority to competently administer our nuclear programs and enforce regulations. 
   But we must also recognize that this measure is not an iron sheath for our weapons secrets. Beyond espionage at our national labs, there have also been illegal transfers of sensitive missile design information by Loral and Hughes, two U.S. satellite manufacturers, to China. With this information, China can improve its military command and control through communications satellites. 
   In its efforts to engage a ``strategic partner,'' the Clinton Administration loosened export controls, allowing satellite and high performance computer experts. Within two years of relaxing export controls, a steady stream of high performance computers flowed from the U.S. to China, giving China 600 supercomputers. Once again, China is using these supercomputers to advance its military capabilities. These high performance computers are useful for enhancing almost every sector of the military, including the development of nuclear weapons. 
   We have not reached the bottom of this pit of security failures. The investigations will continue and Congress will hold the Administration accountable. In the meantime I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank Senator KYL and Senator MURKOWSKI for their efforts in this area. 
   I, along with every Member of this body, received the three volumes of the Cox report. I share the absolute shock at the indescribable breach of our national security at our labs. I think it is inexcusable that we would leave for the Memorial Day recess without taking even this step. 
   Senator KYL has presented to us--and I am glad to cosponsor the amendment--an amendment that makes eminent good sense. It calls for the head of DOE counterintelligence to report immediately to the President and the Congress on any actual or potential significant loss or threatened loss of national security information. That is an indisputable need. It is clear in the Cox report that that was one area of failure. 
   For the Democrats, at a time when this Nation is at war, to threaten that they are going to block, through filibuster, a national security reauthorization bill because they do not want us to debate an amendment to address this shocking failure of security, I think is inexplicable, disappointing, and is going to be hard to explain to our constituents. 
   I wish we had debated the Kyl amendment, had enough time to spend on it, have a vote on it, and take the kind of step Senator KYL has proposed in this amendment. 
   I leave with disappointment and dismay that such a filibuster would be threatened on an amendment that is so important to the security of the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my honor today to introduce the ``Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act'' (the ``FAIR Act''), which will amend the National Labor Relations Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act to provide that a small employer prevailing against either agency will be automatically entitled to recover the attorney's fees and expenses it incurred to defend itself. 
   The FAIR Act is necessary because the National Labor Relations Board (``NLRB'') and Occupational Safety and Health Agency (``OSHA'') are two aggressive, well-funded agencies which share a ``find and fine'' philosophy. The destructive consequences that small businesses suffer as a result of these agencies' ``find and fine'' approach are magnified by the abuse of ``salting'' or the placement of paid union organizers and their agents in non-union workplaces for the sole purpose of disrupting the workforce. ``Salting abuse'' occurs when ``salts'' create labor law violations or workplace hazards and then file frivolous claims with the NLRB or OSHA. Businesses are then often forced to spend thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves against NLRB or OSHA as these agencies vigorously prosecute these frivolous claims. Accordingly, many businesses, when faced with the cost of a successful defense, make a bottom-line decision to settle these frivolous claims rather than going out of business or laying off employees in order to finance costly litigation. 
   The ``FAIR Act'' will allow these employers to defend themselves rather than settling, and, more importantly, it will force the NLRB or OSHA to ensure that the claims they pursue are worthy of their efforts. The FAIR Act will accomplish this by allowing employers with up to 100 employees and a net worth of up to $7,000,000 to recover their attorneys fees and litigation expense directly from the NLRB or OSHA, regardless of whether those agencies' decision to pursue the case was ``substantially justified'' or ``special circumstances'' make an award of attorneys fees unjust. Thus, the Congressional intent behind the broadly supported, bi-partisan ``Equal Access to Justice Act'' (``EAJA'') to ``level the playing field'' for small businesses will finally be realized. 
   The ``FAIR Act'' is solid legislation; it is a common sense attempt to give small businesses the means to defend themselves against unfair actions. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues for their cooperation and assistance as I work to ensure that the ``FAIR Act'' is enacted into law.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 103, a resolution concerning the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre on June 4, 1999. This bipartisan resolution expresses sympathy for the families of those killed in the Tiananmen protests, and calls on the government of China to live up to international standards by releasing prisoners of conscience, ending harassment of Chinese citizens, and ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
   Mr. President, we must never forget. For the past ten years, the Tiananmen Square massacre has been a dark cloud hanging over China. Hundreds of democracy activists still languish in prison for their involvement in the demonstrations of 1989. We must not forget because to this very day, the U.S. is dealing with a regime that will not release these prisoners of conscience. 
   The Beijing protests began in April 1989 as a call for the government to explain itself--to explain its 1987 dismissal of Hu Yaobang, an official who had been sympathetic to students demanding political reform in 1986. The demonstrators, students and workers, asked that the government take action against corruption. Their demands eventually came to include freedom of the press, more money for education, and democratic reforms. Students of Beijing University and 40 other universities, as well as Beijing residents, protested in and around Tiananmen Square. They held hunger strikes and defied martial law. They were met with brutal repression. 
   Mr. President, we must never forget that heroic young man who stood in the path of a column of PLA tanks. 
   We must never forget the brave men like Wang Dan who spent years in prison for daring to exercise his inalienable right to self-expression.  
   We must never forget those students who were so inspired by our own experiment in self-government that they erected a 37 foot model of our statue of liberty. 
   We must never forget those who still languish in prison in China today for their democratic aspirations, for their religious convictions, for their desire to be free. 
   We must never forget men like Wang Wenjiang and Wang Zechen, members of the Chinese Democracy Party, detained for circulating a petition calling for a reassessment of the Tiananmen verdict. We must not forget prodemocracy activist, Yang Tao, who was arrested for planning a commemoration to mark the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen Square. We must not forget Jiang Qisheng, taken from his home in Beijing on May 18th for urging Chinese to light candles in commemoration of those killed in Tiananmen Square. 
   According to the Wall Street Journal, over 50 dissidents have been detained in the days leading up to the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and at least fourteen are still being held. 
   The Chinese government knows what is has done and it is afraid--afraid of its own people. Otherwise, these series of arrests would not occur. 
   This resolution asks the Chinese government to face reality, to listen to its people, to release prisoners of conscience. 
   On June 3, 1989, police officers attacked students with tear gas, rubber bullets, and electric truncheons. People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers armed with AK-47s opened fire on the innocent people who would dare stand in their way. They sent convoys of tanks to Tiananmen Square to absolutely crush the demonstrators. Their armored vehicles rammed the Goddess of Democracy, a 37 foot plaster likeness of the Statue of Liberty, knocking it down, flattening it beneath their steel treads. They killed a symbol of democracy and massacred their own people. On June 4, the PLA and security forces killed 1,500 and wounded 10,000. By June 7, the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,600 people aspiring to democracy dead. In the end, the Chinese government killed and wounded thousands of demonstrators. They imprisoned thousands more for their participation. 
   The simple fact is that the Chinese government is a totalitarian regime. President Clinton would do well to recognize this simple fact and recognize the failures of his engagement policy, rather than simply decrying any criticism as isolationism. If the hundreds of prisoners of conscience still languishing in prison today is not telling enough of the character of this regime, then perhaps the Chinese reaction to the embassy bombing is. 
   NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a tragic accident. And the Chinese people had a reason to be upset. But there was no accident in the Chinese government's control of the media and manipulation of Chinese citizens to stir up anti-American sentiment. The Chinese government blocked reports of President Clinton's repeated apologies for the bombing. They bused students out from universities to orchestrated protests, pelting rocks at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, holding 
   Ambassador Sasser and his staff hostage in the embassy, burning the American consulate in Chengdu. 
   It was no accident that after several days, the Chinese government made sure that the protests came to an end when they were no longer useful for the government's purposes. 
   Ethan Gutmann, a television producer living in Beijing, witnessed the protests. 
   ``After a while, when the chanting lost its steam, the megaphone leader would strike up a short sing-along of the national anthem. This was the signal to leave, to shuffle along and give the next university its chance to demonstrate. The cycle continued, fresh waves of students, monotony. Several British journalists discussed the numbers.'' They felt it was low, about 3,000; in a kind of Chinese scarf trick, the same student groups kept reappearing after an hour or so. The students, when isolated and interviewed, were naively forthcoming; the university authorities had told them to come, told them to make banners, arranged the buses. The whole demonstration was canned .....'' 
   It was no accident that the Chinese government played the victim, trying to squeeze the Administration for concessions, trying to get the U.S. to exclude Taiwan from any defense umbrella in Asia. 
   It was no accident that the Chinese government called off its human rights dialogue and nonproliferation talks. 
   Mr. President, the moral high ground that the Chinese regime attempted to seize from the accidental bombing has no equivalency to its own treatment of its citizens, to the massacre of the 
   students in Beijing ten years ago. 
   We must never forget the nature of the regime in China. The leaders may be different, but the treatment of Chinese citizens is the same. 
   Even this week, pro-democracy activist, Yang Tao, was arrested for planning a commemoration to mark the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen Square. 
   This week it was reported that police took Jiang Qisheng (chee sheng) from his home in Beijing on May 18 for urging Chinese to light candles in commemoration of those killed in Tiananmen Square. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in supporting this bipartisan resolution--to recognize this regime for what it truly is and to never forget the tragedy that occurred ten years ago on June 3 and June 4, 1989.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of S.  Res. 103, a resolution concerning the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre which occurred on June 4, 1989. This bipartisan resolution expresses sympathy for the families of those killed in the peaceful protests, calls on the Government of China to live up to international standards by releasing prisoners of conscience, ending the harassment of Chinese citizens, and calls upon the Chinese Government to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
   We must never forget the heroic young man who stood in the path of a column of PLA tanks 10 years ago. We must never forget the brave men like Wang Dan, who spent years in prison for daring to exercise his inalienable rights to self-expression. We must never forget those students who were so inspired by our own experiment in self-government and freedom and democracy that they erected a 37-foot model of our Statue of Liberty. We must never forget those who still languish in prison in China today, simply because they have democratic aspirations, because they have religious convictions, because they have a desire to be free. 
   We must never forget men like Wang Wenjiang and Wang Zechen, members of the Chinese Democracy Party, 
   who were detained for circulating a petition calling for a reassessment of the Tiananmen verdict. We must never forget pro democracy activist Yang Tao arrested for planning a commemoration tomorrow of the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. We must not forget Jiang Qisheng, who was taken from his home in Beijing on May 18 for urging the Chinese to light candles in commemoration of those killed in the massacre ten years ago. For asking for a peaceful memorial, the lighting of candles, he has been arrested. 
   According to the Wall Street Journal today, over 50 dissidents have been detained in recent days leading up to the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and at least 14 are currently being held. The Chinese government knows what it has done. It is afraid of its own people. Otherwise, these series of arrests would not have occurred. This resolution asks the Chinese government to face reality, listen to its people, and to release prisoners of conscience. 
   Mr. President, I am just afraid that in the midst of all of our talk of the espionage of the Chinese government--which well we should pay attention to--with all of the talk of the unfortunate, tragic bombing of the Chinese embassy, with all of the talk about accession of China to the WTO and a permanent normal trading status for China, we will forget that there are tens of thousands today who are oppressed, and hundreds remain in prison, and there are multitudes who desire freedom and want a better political system for their country, who want democracy, and I am afraid they will be forgotten in all of the milieu concerning our relationship with China. 
   So this resolution calls upon us to remember. And I will--if no one else does--offer this resolution year after year. It is a special anniversary. It is the tenth anniversary of the tragedy that occurred.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will begin the DOD appropriations bill on Monday, June 7, and hopefully will complete action on that bill by close of business on Tuesday, June 8. In addition, on Monday, it will be the leader's intention to move to proceed to S. 1138, the new compromised Y2K bill on Monday and file a cloture motion on the motion for a cloture vote on Wednesday, June 9. 
   Also, on Tuesday, June 8, it will be the leader's intention prior to the recess or adjournment that evening to move to proceed to the lockbox issue and file a cloture motion on that matter for a cloture vote on Thursday, June 10. Members who have an interest in the important Social Security savings bill should plan to participate in that debate Tuesday evening and Tuesday night. 
   Needless to say, when the Senate reconvenes following the Memorial Day recess, there will be a tremendous amount of legislation needing passage by the Senate. Therefore, the leader wishes all Members a safe and restful Memorial Day and looks forward to the cooperation of all Members when the Senate reconvenes.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I take a moment to express my appreciation to our guest Chaplain, Pastor Ronnie Floyd, Pastor of the First Baptist Church, Springdale, AR, who led the Senate in our opening prayer today. Chaplain Ogilvie was gracious enough to allow Pastor Floyd to lead us in prayer. 
   Pastor Floyd has been a dear friend of mine for many years; he has had a tremendous impact upon my family and my children. I have a son and daughter-in-law who today still worship in his church and have been greatly impacted by his ministry. Pastor Floyd has a national television ministry and has touched lives all across this country. It is a great privilege today to have him in our Nation's Capitol ministering to us in the Senate. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, also reserving the right to object, I share Senator ENZI's concern and making this UC request to introduce a bill that would allow us to have offsets. We have an appropriations bill, as so often is the case with these emergency spending bills that come before us, traveling like a freight train. The ``freight train'' has little stowaways hidden all through it. So in the very short period of time that I began to look at some of the little stowaways hidden on this ``freight train,'' I found $1.8 million for safety renovations of the O'Neill House Office Building, $1.9 million for the Northeast Multi-Species Fishery, $250,000 for the L.A. Civic Center, $1.5 million for the University of DC, and $3.76 million for the House page dormitory. These may all be good things, but they are certainly not going through the right process. 
   There is $100 million for aid to Jordan; $77 million to the Census Bureau, Postal Service, USTR, et cetera. The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians gets $22 million. I don't see how that can be termed an emergency coming before us. There is $8 million dollars for an access road to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. On and on go these little stowaways. There is a high school, White River High School, which receives $239,000. 
   The point is, Mr. President, we have a process that is being perverted, a process that is being circumvented.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators WELLSTONE, FEINGOLD, BOB SMITH, BUNNING, COLLINS, KYL, SESSIONS, GRASSLEY, ABRAHAM, SNOWE, and JEFFORDS, am submitting a resolution commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Ten years ago, the Chinese Communist government unleashed lethal force on peaceful demonstrators in Beijing. For ten years, demonstrators from Tiananmen have been suffering in prison. 
   The resolution that I am submitting today simply calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to make amends. To reevaluate the verdict of Tiananmen Square. To release the prisoners. To stop harassing Chinese citizens seeking freedom. It says that if they are serious about being a respected member of the international community, then they will implement and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They will respect universal standards and they will respect their own citizens. 
   At the moment, there is a great deal of tension between the U.S. and China. Chinese espionage of sensitive technology, allegations of illegal campaign donations, competing security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and disagreements over Kosovo are just a few problems--problems that illuminate the adversarial behavior of the Chinese Communist government. 
   Most recently, there has been a great deal of Chinese furor over the mistaken bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. I do not take lightly this egregious error and this tragic loss of life. But as regrettable as this mistake was, the Chinese government has been using this event as a catch-all refutation of the United States. It was no accident that the human rights dialogue and the ongoing arms talks were other casualties of the embassy bombing--the two areas where the Chinese government refuses to be responsible. It was no accident that the Chinese government bused demonstrators from universities to the U.S. embassy where they pelted rocks at American property, breaking windows, keeping Ambassador Sasser and his staff hostage at the embassy. It was no accident that the Chinese government used propaganda to inflame the emotions of the Chinese people. 
   But Mr. President, there is no moral equivalency in the accidental bombing of the embassy and the Tiananmen Square massacre. I the midst of the high stack of issues surrounding U.S.-China relations, I hope that human rights does not tumble to the bottom. The well-being of the Chinese people, the ability to express themselves, is fundamental to any future relationship between the U.S. and China. That is why I am submitting this resolution. 
   Mr. President, the Beijing protests began in April 1989 as a call for the government to explain itself--to explain its dismissal of an official who had been sympathetic to students demanding political reform in 1986. The demonstrators, students and workers, asked that the government take action against corruption. They asked for freedom for the independent press. They asked for democratic reforms. These students from Beijing University and 40 other universities, these Beijing residents protested in and around Tiananmen Square. They held hunger strikes. They defied martial law. They were met with brutal repression. 
   On May 30, after almost a month of student demonstrations in support of increased democratization in the Peoples Republic of China, the protest leaders erected a symbol of their growing movement--a symbol to be a ``powerful cementing force to strengthen our resolve'' and to ``declare to the world that the great awakening of the Chinese people to democratic ideas has reached a new stage.'' The symbol these students chose was the Goddess of Democracy--a thirty-seven foot high monument of foam and plaster with a striking resemblance to the Statute of Liberty. This symbol of democracy gave those thousands of onlookers a hope for a future free of communism. 
   But on June 3, 1989, police officers attacked students with tear gas, rubber bullets, and electric truncheons. People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers armed with AK-47s opened fire on the innocent people who would dare stand in their way. But that was not enough for the government. They sent convoys of tanks to Tiananmen Square to absolutely crush the demonstrators. Their armored vehicles rammed the Goddess of Democracy, knocking it down, flattening it beneath their steel treads. They killed a symbol of democracy and massacred their own people. On June 4, the PLA and security forces killed 1,500 and wounded 10,000. By June 7, the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,600 people aspiring to democracy dead, In the end, the Chinese government killed and wounded thousands of demonstrators. They imprisoned thousands more for their participation. 
   But the nightmare did not end there. For the hundreds that remain in prison, for their families, each passing day is a living horror. This ten year terror must stop. The resolution that we are introducing today simply calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to do what is right--to do what is consistent with their constitution and international standards. It is a message to those fighting for democracy--we will not forget the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators by police and PLA forces on June 3 and 4. We will not forget the suffering of those who saw their friends die for freedom. We will not forget that with each passing day, hundreds of prisoners still languish in prison simply because they desire freedom in China. 
   Mr. President, I believe that it is time to move to a post-Tiananmen era. But this cannot happen without the release of Tiananmen Square prisoners. And it will not happen until we shed the scales of the Clinton Administrations' blind China policy and open our eyes. 
   Let me suggest four tenets for an open-eye China policy. First, we must re-engage our allies. Our relationship with China has come at the expense of our relationships with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. We need to rebuild a realistic picture of security in the Asia-Pacific and recognize China's aggressive military aims in the region--aims that will only be reached at the expense of our allies. 
   Second, we must protect our sensitive technology. Recent investigations show that we need increased security at our national labs and other facilities, common sense background checks, controls on technology transfers, and a Justice Department that does not hinder its own FBI's investigations. While espionage may be a fact of life, we can still take comprehensive measures to minimize foreign spying. Serious theft of nuclear and technological secrets have already increased China's military prowess. 
   Third, we must engage the people of China, rather than the Communist regime. We need sustained engagement, not just one time, highly publicized political visits. I therefore advocate increased funding for Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America, democracy building programs, and rule of law initiatives. 
   Finally, businesses must do their part and aggressively advocate human rights. The door for China's entry to the WTO is still open, but a WTO deal is not just a deal between the U.S. and China. It is also a deal between the U.S. government and American businesses. A WTO deal must include an understanding that American businesses in China must not be complicit with slave labor or other human rights violations. Instead, American businesses must be advocates for human rights, to the Beijing government and to the people. The simple fact is that China desperately wants American trade and American business. U.S. companies must use this leverage to advance more than profits. 
   Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in supporting this bipartisan resolution--to recognize this regime for what it truly is and to never forget the tragedy that occurred ten years ago on June 3 and June 4, 1989.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize National Hospital Week, when we pay tribute to our Nation's hospitals, and the millions of workers, health care professionals, and volunteers who have dedicated themselves to caring for those who are sick and in need. 
   I would like to give special recognition to Washington Regional Medical Center, located in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and a 1999 recipient of the American Hospital Association's NOVA award. This award highlights innovative community partnerships that respond to a particular community's needs. 
   Washington Regional Medical Center is a 1999 NOVA award winner for its outstanding commitment to the children in Washington County. Chronic disease and disability, which can lead to death, are often attributed to poor health habits that are formed during childhood. The Washington Regional Medical Center is working to reverse this trend through its Kids For Health program. By partnering with the Washington County school system, the medical center has been able to teach more than 8,000 children about the importance of general health, nutrition, fitness, hygiene, safety, environmental health, and self-esteem. 
   A sign of the program's success, Kids For Health is the recipient of a five-year grant from the Harvey and Beatrice Jones Charitable Foundation. Kids For Health is a stellar example of how a hospital can make a difference in its community, and I commend Washington Regional Medical Center and all those who have made this program possible for their excellent achievements.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man of extraordinary courage. A fellow Arkansan. A soldier and a hero. His name was Carlos N. Hathcock II. 
   Carlos was born on May 20, 1942, in Little Rock, Arkansas, the son of a welder. At the age of eight, Carlos saw his first Marine in full uniform. The sight left an indelible impression--a mark that would lead him to commit his life to the military. But in the meantime, he had some growing up to do. Carlos spent a great deal of time in the woods of North Little Rock, hunting squirrels and rabbits and bringing them home to eat. He had no problem filling the table. It seemed as if he was anticipating his future career. 
   Carlos could hardly wait to start his career in the military. In May 1959, at the age of seventeen, he signed up with the Marines with the permission of his father. The moment he turned eighteen, Carlos went into the Corps. He quickly realized his talent as an effective rifleman and began to carve out his niche in the Marines as a sniper. The intramurals of the Marine Shooting Team was his first official match, a match that he won handily. This victory would certainly not be the last. Carlos won many more shooting competitions and rose steadily through the ranks, with a only a few minor bumps along the way. Indeed, the months and years could be counted by championships and promotions, and marked by his marriage to his wife Jo and the birth of his son, ``Sonny'' Hathcock. 
   But soon enough, the skills of Sergeant Carlos Hathcock II were put to use and put to the test. In 1966, the Marines sent him to Vietnam. His tour of duty was no doubt difficult, but Carlos' amazing rifle skill made him a valuable asset to the Marines and an opponent to be dreaded by the North Vietnamese. For his great service, Carlos was presented with the Navy Commendation Medal with combat ``V.'' 
   Carlos proved himself again on his fateful second tour of duty in Vietnam in 1969. By this time, Carlos knew the sweltering jungles of Vietnam. He could become one with his surroundings. With painstaking patience, he crawled and lay in wait--his hands controlled, resisting the urge to scratch or stretch, his body still as death--until that moment when he struck. Carlos was an expert. He even gained a reputation among the Viet Cong who dubbed him ``Long Tra'ng,'' or white feather, for the single white feather in his hat. But as precise and deadly as he was, Carlos did not enjoy killing people. In fact, he saved the lives of his comrades in the 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. 
   On September 16, 1969, the amphibious assault vehicle Carlos was riding ran over a landmine and exploded. Carlos, sprayed with burning gasoline and his flesh melting away, focused only on helping his comrades. Carlos went back to the vehicle and dragged his companions away to safety. He was burned almost beyond recognition. 
   Fortunately, Carlos was able to recover. For his heroism in Vietnam, Carlos was awarded a Purple Heart and Gold Star. And with swift dedication, Carlos went back to the Marines, serving almost ten more years, retiring on March 1, 1975, after nineteen years, ten months, and five days of service. He had entered the Marines as a callow youth and left a Gunnery Sergeant, a veteran, and a hero. 
   He carried on his patriotism and service to America, speaking at military gatherings and teaching his sniper skills to the Virginia Beach Police Department. And in 1996, he was again awarded for his heroism in Vietnam, this time with a Silver Star. 
   Carlos Hathcock II passed away on February 23, 1999. But he lives on in the minds of many. His son, Carlos Hathcock III, is also a gunnery sergeant in the Marines. The Marines have a library in Carlos' name and an annual award presented to the best marksman in the Marine Corps. Marksmanship of legendary proportions will remain synonymous with the name Hathcock.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is not often that I rise to speak about specific individuals, but the individual I want to talk about today was a man of extraordinary character, Brandon Burlsworth. 
   Last Wednesday, I was saddened to learn about the tragic and untimely death of Brandon Burlsworth. Brandon was only 22 years old when a car accident ended his life. While his time on this earth was short, his impact on our world will be long lasting. Brandon was a hero to the community of Harrison, the Razorback family, and the entire state of Arkansas. 
   Brandon lived the kind of life that would make any parent proud. He led a wholesome life, and was a devout Christian who used his faith and strong work ethic to become a success in every facet of life. 
   Brandon was not a highly recruited athlete coming out of Harrison High School. Several small colleges expressed interest in him, but Brandon had his sights on walking on at Fayetteville and becoming a Razorback. While the odds were long, Brandon worked hard and not only made the team, but went on to start for the Razorbacks for three years. Last year, he earned All-American honors, while leading Arkansas to the SEC West Co-Championship and a berth in the Citrus Bowl. Last month, the Indianapolis Colts selected Brandon in the third round of the National Football League draft. 
   Not only was Brandon a disciplined player on the field, he was an outstanding student in the classroom as well. Brandon earned a bachelor's degree in marketing management and a master's in business administration, all in 4 1/2 years. In addition, he was a three time member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. 
   Today, newspapers and newscasts are often filled with stories about athletes and their brushes with the law. Brandon became a symbol of how student athletes should conduct themselves. The manner in which he conducted himself on and off the field will be Brandon's legacy. He was a young man of great character and dedication. While I recognize that words alone provide little comfort in times such as these, I hope that Brandon's family knows how many lives this young man has touched.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I especially thank him for his strong leadership on this issue and for pushing this issue to the point that we are having this debate on the floor of the Senate. 
   I have believed for some time that this debate has been sorely needed and greatly lacking. Senator MCCAIN is truly an American hero. He is one that I respect immensely, along with Senator HAGEL and the other cosponsors of this resolution. 
   Though I disagree with them and though I rise in opposition to the resolution, I believe they have taken a principled position, a principled stand that is justifiable and behind which there are rational arguments. I believe they reciprocate that respect for the principled position and belief that we do not have a vital national interest in the Balkans and that we have made a policy mistake and that given where we are, the placement of ground troops is not the next step that we should be taking. 
   I regret the silence that has characterized Congress to this point, particularly the Senate. I applaud those who have pushed that we might have this time today. 
   As I read the resolution, I read that it authorizes the use of all necessary force and other means. That, I do believe, is a blank check. I believe it grants blanket authority, and it does take us out of what is a very, very important role for the Congress. I read also that all necessary force and other means is granted to accomplish NATO's objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro. 
   One of the questions I have is, what are our objectives? I do not believe those objectives have been clearly outlined. Does the resolution refer to military objectives, which we have been told means to degrade the military capability of Milosevic--whatever that term ``degrade'' may mean, subjective as it is--or does this reference to the objectives of NATO refer to political objectives, which have been defined in a much broader sense in reference to the withdrawal of Milosevic, the incorporation of an international peacekeeping force, humanitarian aid and a number of things? 
   So I am not certain what objectives are in mind in the resolution or how one would determine whether or not they have been achieved. 
   When I made reference to the silence that I think has been embarrassing for the Senate, I think Members of the Senate have been reluctant to speak on this for a couple of reasons. We have been reticent to speak out because nobody wants to be portrayed as not being in support of American troops. 
   I went to Aviano. We have the bravest young men and women imaginable involved in this. They are willing and have been risking their lives daily in pursuit of this policy and the orders they have been given. I support them and I believe in them. I believe in their effectiveness and I believe in their courage. But I think that is one reason people have been hesitant to get into this debate, because they are afraid of being portrayed as not being supportive of the military, and also because of the horrible atrocities that have been committed by the Serbs and the Milosevic war machine. 
   Nobody wants to be portrayed as being uncaring or not having a humanitarian concern for the ethnic cleansing and for the killing and massacres that have gone on, which truly are deplorable and ought to be condemned by all right-thinking people. I care about that just as I care about the 1.3 million-plus civilians who have died in the Sudan in the Sudanese civil war, and just as I care about those who died in the Ethiopian civil war, and just as I care about those who died in Rwanda, and just as I care about the oppression that goes on today in China. I care about those tragedies that are going on all over the world, not just in the Balkans. 
   I have agonized a great deal about what is the right position not only on this resolution but on this, what I believe is a misguided conflict. The war in Kosovo reveals the extent to which we have overstretched our armed services. They are overdeployed and underfunded. For example, over the last 3 fiscal years, the Congress has added $21 billion to the President's meager defense requests. Unfortunately, even these increases have not kept pace with the military's increased tempo of operations. The President has committed United States forces to Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, Macedonia, the Taiwan Strait, and now Kosovo. Each of these much-needed congressional plus-ups was passed over the administration's objections, and the administration simply said the Pentagon hadn't asked for the additional money. 
   Between the years 1945 and 1990, the U.S. Army was deployed only 10 times, Mr. President. But since 1991, the U.S. Army has been deployed 32 times. That is an increase in deployments of over 300 percent. Simultaneous with our 300-percent increase in deployments around the world, we have cut funding for the U.S. armed services by one-third. That is a simple calculation that, if you ask the armed services to do 300 percent more and you give them one-third less, you are inviting a disaster and you are creating a crisis, and that is what we face today. 
   This overuse of America's limited military might threatens our ability to execute our national security strategy to be able to fight--and this is our stated strategy--and win two near-simultaneous, medium, regional conflicts. This past Friday in the Washington Post, Bradley Graham authored an important article on this very point. In the article, General Richard Hawley, who heads the Air Combat Command, told reporters--and General Hawley is retiring in June and therefore he spoke with 
   particular candor--that 5 weeks of bombing Yugoslavia have left United States munitions critically short, not just of air-launched cruise missiles, as previously reported, but also of another precision weapon, the joint direct attack munition dropped by B-2 bombers. So low is the inventory of the new satellite-guided weapons, Hawley said, that as the bombing campaign accelerates, the Air Force risks exhausting its prewar supply of JDAMs before the next scheduled delivery sometime in May. 
   In the past 8 years, the U.S. military has been weakened appreciably. While we are occupied in Kosovo, United States intelligence assets are necessarily focused on military operations there. If another country conducts a ballistic missile test while the bulk of United States intelligence assets are focused in Kosovo, and if that country only needs one test before deployment, like North Korea, for instance, then we will not have missed simply the one test, but we will have missed all the tests necessary to know what they are deploying and when they will deploy it. 
   There is a great deal going on in our world, including a deteriorating relationship with Japan, with the People's Republic of China, with Russia; a dangerous situation in North Korea; Iraq is busy again on their ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, with no U.N. inspections to inhibit them; India and Pakistan launching ballistic missiles and testing nuclear weapons; Iran, and other surprises yet to come. The United States needs to be sure it has the resources to focus on more than one troubled spot at a time. We need to decide what is important and see that we have the necessary capabilities. 
   As reported in this most recent edition of National Review:   
   General Henry Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress, ``Anecdotal and now measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the long-term health of the total force is in jeopardy.'' 
   Today's military is 36 percent smaller than it was during the Gulf War. Last year, the Pentagon determined that there was a high risk of being unable to [fight and] win two [near] simultaneous wars, a capability that current U.S. strategic doctrine demands. And even though [the Pentagon doesn't consider] the Kosovo assaults.......as one of these major engagements, they have led to fewer patrols being flown over Iraq, and a [substantial] gap in naval forces in the Pacific.  
   President Clinton responded to the readiness alert sounded by his military chiefs by proposing an additional $12 billion for next year's defense budget. But $8 billion of this ``increase'' represents savings from lower fuel costs and inflation rates that would be going to the military anyway. A good portion of the remaining $4 billion is dedicated to items like commissary operations and renovation of the Pentagon, which leaves precious little to meet our crying readiness demands. 
   I believe that since we started what I believe is a misguided war in the Balkans, it has been flawed since its implementation. President Clinton and his national security team have mismanaged this operation from the very beginning.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I am glad to join my colleague from Arkansas in supporting the Ed-Flex bill, also in joining all of my colleagues in our expressions of grief for the families who are suffering such a loss in Colorado today. I have been struck, as I have listened to my colleagues on the Senate floor. Time and time again words fail me to express the grief, the sorrow, that we all feel and really the lack of answers that we have. 
   As I presided a few moments ago, Mr. President, and listened to Senator WELLSTONE, he made the statement that if he could snap his fingers and somehow make yesterday not happen, he would do that. I think all of us feel that way. 
   I would add that if we could somehow pass a law today, if we knew the silver bullet, if we knew what it is that we could pass legislatively from Washington, DC, and put it in statutes, and that it would prevent these kinds of tragedies from occurring, I think we would have a 100-0 vote this evening in the Senate. 
   Unfortunately, the solutions are not so simple. The answers are not so obvious. Perhaps it goes to the cheapening of life in our society. Perhaps it goes to the culture of violence that permeates so much of the popular media today. I do not know all the answers, and perhaps today isn't the day to even talk about what the answers are or whether we can do something from Washington, but certainly there is agreement that it is a deep and shocking problem in our society. What is it in America that allows this to happen? 
   I will join my colleagues in seeking to find answers and trying to make this the kind of society where these tragedies are fewer and fewer. 
   I am glad to rise in support of the Ed-Flex bill. Certainly this is a step in the right direction in education reform in our country. 
   The Ed-Flex program is about cutting the unnecessary strings attached to Federal education funds. It does not cede accountability. In fact, the States must use the funds for the purpose intended; the money must remain targeted to the population it is designated to serve. 
   This bill, though, is recognition that when limited Federal funding is spread so thinly over such a wide area, the result is ineffective programs that fail to provide students with the basic skills they need to succeed. 
   If we are to expect schools to increase their performance and provide a better education for our children, then we must allow them to coordinate school reform plans and to implement plans that coordinate program funds. We do not need to compartmentalize education, and this bill makes that coordination between programs easier. 
   In States such as Arkansas, where there are many small school districts, rural school districts that receive only small grants through various Federal programs, flexibility is the key. We must allow local school districts to decide how to spend Federal dollars in the way that will work for them, not the way that Washington tells them to do it. 
   That is why, in addition to supporting this bill, I have introduced the Dollars to the Classroom Act, which also gives more flexibility to local school districts. It would eliminate the bureaucracy and allow schools to continue the reform efforts that they have already started to implement. 
   Why do we think that Washington bureaucrats, who are over 1,100 miles from Arkansas school districts, can decide how to improve our children's education better than the parents, the teachers, the principals who live there? 
   We must give schools the tools that are necessary to let them address the needs they are facing. 
   It is time to stop the one-size-fits-all approach to education, and allow those at the State and local level to decide what is best for their children. The problems facing Arkansas schools are not necessarily the same as those facing schools in other parts of the Nation. Ed-Flex allows States and local school districts to address these problems without restrictions that can inhibit school reform. 
   If Congress expects improvement in our Nation's schools, then we must not add any additional regulatory burdens that only create more paperwork for our teachers and principals. If we really want teachers to spend more time with their students, then we must cut the red tape that occupies so much of their time. 
   In his testimony before the Senate Health and Education Committee on February 23, as we well remember, Michigan Governor John Engler stated:  
   Many governors feel so strongly that the bureaucracy is the problem that we cannot imagine being unable to improve education with greater funding flexibility.  
   In fact, he and the 49 other Governors support this legislation, along with the President and, most importantly, the teachers, the principals, the school boards and the administrators of this country.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if today I were not in my home state of Arkansas, I would surely be on the floor of the Senate casting an affirmative vote for H.R. 1376. I believe this Congress should pass this important legislation unanimously, so that it can be quickly sent to the President for enrollment into public law. 
   Any time the men and women of our great country choose to wear our nation's uniform, they are making a statement. They are saying that principles like duty, honor and freedom are more important than personal gain and personal comfort. Any reasonable action the Congress can undertake to ease the Federal burden weighing on our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines is one that should be considered and acted upon quickly. 
   Recognizing the area around Kosovo, where our military is deployed under orders from the President, as a hazardous duty area for Internal Revenue code purposes will grant service members a small degree of relief. Allowing service members an additional 180 days to file their federal income tax return, and exempting a portion of their income from taxation may be only a small gesture of support, but it is one that has already been earned. 
   I will continue to keep the men and women participating in Operation Allied Force in my thoughts and prayers, and I look forward to their safe and speedy return.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate expects to begin consideration of S. 767, the uniformed services tax filing fairness bill. Passage of that bill is expected, and it will then be the leader's intention to begin consideration of the budget resolution conference report. There are 10 hours for debate on the conference report, but it is hoped that a significant portion of that time will be yielded back. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues about some of my thoughts about Amendment 211 that was authored by my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM. This Amendment to S. Con. Res. 20, was accepted by the Senate by unanimous consent. 
   Mr. President, I know that I am not alone in stating that many of us in the Senate believe that, first and foremost, we believe that the Davis-Bacon Act should be repealed. If full repeal is not possible at this time, there are meaningful steps we should take in the meantime to get us to that end. 
   Mr. President, we must allow widespread use of ``helpers'' on federal construction projects. Considering our nation's changing welfare-to-work environment and with the importance of revitalizing disadvantaged communities, it is particularly critical that the government not limit opportunities for entry-level jobs. 
   Congress should exempt schools from the outdated rules and restrictions and give local school districts the flexibility to spend resources where they will most effectively meet students' educational needs. 
   The Davis-Bacon wage process has been shown to be inaccurate, subject to bias, and used as a tool to defraud taxpayers. In March 1997, a DOL Inspector General's report confirmed that 2/3 of the wage surveys were inaccurate. In January 1999, a General Accounting Office report found errors in 70% of the wage forms, and confirmed frequent errors go undetected and the high proportion of erroneous data ``poses a threat to the reliability'' of prevailing wage determinations. 
   Mr. President, again, I know that I am not the only Senator who would prefer repealing Davis-Bacon, but in light of the spirit of Senator SANTORUM'S Amendment to the FY2000 budget measure, I ask that we at least consider the reform points I outlined above.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my colleague, Senator LINCOLN, my other colleague in the Senate, to honor our Nation's children and citizens who have been victimized by school violence. 
   The Senate just adopted Senate Resolution 53 which designates March 24, today, as ``National School Violence Victims Memorial Day.'' As you know, 1 year ago today at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR, five children and one teacher lost their lives to an inexplicable and cowardly act of violence. Ten others were left wounded, and countless parents, relatives, and friends were left permanently scarred. In addition, the entire State of Arkansas was left numb with shock, horror, and grief. 
   I cannot express the loss and the pain that we feel as a result of this tragedy. But I ask you and my fellow colleagues in the Senate to reflect on the loss of Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson, Britthney Verner, and Shannon Wright. 
   We hurt for these families. I know that the simplest things in life will forever cause them pain. For instance, I know that Floyd Brooks will never see another frog without thinking of the frog collection which his daughter Natalie was so proud of. 
   We remember that Paige Ann Herring was a very bright, intelligent 12-year-old girl who loved life and enjoyed it to the fullest through such activities as playing the piano, softball, volleyball, basketball, singing in the school choir. It saddens me, and I think all of us, so much that we will no longer hear her voice. 
   It is the little things. Stephanie Johnson believed that a ladybug's landing on her brought her good luck. And her mother knew that her prayers for peace were answered when she asked God for a sign that Steph was OK and then upon her next visit saw ladybugs on Stephanie's gravestone. 
   We remember today that Britthney Varner was an extremely caring and loving little girl who got good grades and loved daffodils. 
   I know that Mitchell Wright will never look at his son, Zane, without thinking of Zane's mother, Shannon, who gave her life to save the lives of her students. 
   I want these families to know that while we can never fully know the pain they feel today, we will certainly never forget their loved ones. 
   As I close, I want to give a special message to Zane Wright, Shannon Wright's infant son Zane. 
   Your mother was a genuine heroine. Scripture teaches us that there is no greater love than the love it takes to lay down your life for another. So whenever you wonder what you mother was like, remember her as an incredibly brave woman who loved others like few others in this world ever have. 
   In addition, to the families of the victims of school violence in Bethel, AK; Pearl, MS; West Paducah, KY; Edinboro, PA; Pomona, CA; Springfield, OR; and the rest of the Nation--we want them to know that we stand today to honor their loved ones. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor to my colleague from Arkansas.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I rise in opposition to the resolution. I have all the confidence in the world in the capability of our military. But I think this is an ill-advised mission. I heard my good friend from Delaware, and I also heard the Senator from Massachusetts use the word ``hopefully.'' In fact, that word was used repeatedly. ``Hopefully,'' the airstrikes will work. ``Hopefully,'' the airstrikes will bring Milosevic to the bargaining table. ``Hopefully,'' there will be a peace agreement. 
   The question I ask is, What if our best hopes are not realized? What if it doesn't work? What happens then? I raised that question to Secretary of Defense Cohen. I don't believe the answers were sufficient or satisfactory. There were far more questions than answers. The President has not made the case to the American people or to the Congress. We all know the great limits there are on airstrikes, the capability of airstrikes in changing behavior. There will be limits on these airstrikes and how successful they can be. Our hearts go out to those who are suffering, and they should. But I remind my colleagues that there are massacres taking place in many places in this world, including Sudan, where the level of carnage is far greater than what we have seen in Kosovo. 
   I asked the Secretary this afternoon what will be the cost in financial terms? To my dismay, there is no estimate of what kind of dollars or costs, budgetary costs there will be. But the far greater cost will be in potential American casualties. We all know that the probability is high that there will be the loss of American lives. So this afternoon I did a lot of soul searching. I thought about my 20-year-old son, Joshua. 
   If it were him going in, could I in my mind justify sending him in, and the tens of thousands of Joshes who are 20 years old? 
   I believe stability in the Balkans is not a satisfactory answer.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. 
   This is a very straightforward amendment that simply says that before China can be admitted to the World Trade Organization, there will have to be a joint resolution passed by the Congress supporting that accession of China to the World Trade Organization. 
   It is very simple. It is simply saying we should have a voice in this. We should not have the administration arbitrarily and unilaterally making a very, very significant and major decision without the input of the U.S. Congress and this body. It does not prejudge what should happen. It does not say whether China should be in or not. There may be very compelling arguments that could be presented in such a debate. But it does say that before China is admitted to the World Trade Organization, every Senator in this body ought to have an opportunity to look at the evidence and have a say in the outcome of that debate. That is why we need this amendment, because Congress needs to, once again, assert its constitutional responsibility in the area of foreign commerce. 
   I believe we must do it now for a couple of reasons. It is the only opportunity we are going to have before the recess, and our only opportunity before Zhu Rongji visits this Nation next month. He will come during our Easter recess. So, if Congress is going to have any kind of statement on this, if we are going to be able to take any kind of action on this, we must take it now. 
   I know some of my colleagues will say this should have gone through committee. In an ideal world I would agree. It is very straightforward. I do not think it would require a great deal of debate, as to whether someone is for it or against it, but ideally that is where it should have gone. But, once again, the stream of negotiations that have taken place in recent weeks between our country and the Chinese Government, with our officials going to China--Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Secretary of State Albright, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky have all been making repeated trips to 
   China--negotiating, obviously; attempting to broker a deal on the World Trade Organization accession of China. 
   If we wait for an announcement by the administration that a deal has been reached, an announcement by the administration that the outlines of an agreement have been reached, we will make China's membership in the WTO a fait accompli. Any effort to stop it after the fact, after the negotiations are completed and after an agreement has been announced, I think will be too late for this body to really make a difference. 
   The amendment is, as I said, very straightforward. It would require a joint resolution to be passed before the United States could support admission of China into the WTO. Again, it does not preclude our support for China's entry. It simply sends a clear statement that Congress should be involved in the process of deciding U.S. support for China's accession into the WTO. The administration should not make any hasty deals with China. We must give careful consideration to the timing as well as to the consequences of Chinese accession. Congress must be thoroughly involved in that debate. 
   We cannot negotiate a trade deal with the most populous nation in the world, and, as we hear so often, the largest market in the world, in a vacuum. There are certain facts that we must face; there is a political environment in which all of these negotiations are occurring. The Chinese have used espionage to obtain important nuclear secrets from the United States. That is a matter that must be fully investigated. I believe it will be. I believe the appropriate oversight committees are moving expeditiously to investigate. But it certainly is not going to happen before we go out on the Easter recess. We may have hearings next week, but we will not see the end of this, we will not have all the facts on the table, before the Easter recess and before Zhu Rongji visits this country. 
   Another fact that faces us is our trade deficit with the Chinese is at an alarming all-time high of $56.9 billion for 1998. It is rising exponentially every year. That reality ought to cause us to pause before we see the administration rush into a WTO deal. The Chinese continue to keep many of their markets closed, particularly to our agricultural sector, our farmers, who are in such crisis. 
   The Chinese have signed and blatantly disregarded the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and have engaged in a widespread crackdown on prodemocracy activists in China, effectively silencing all political dissent. We cannot give WTO membership in a vacuum, ignoring all other realities that face us. The 1999 State Department report on China, released in the last few weeks, demonstrably proves China's ignoring of the very covenant on civil and political rights that they signed last year. If we cannot trust them to live up to a human rights covenant that they signed, how can we assume they are going to live according to the rules and the obligations of the World Trade Organization? There is an issue of trust. They have not justified the trust we would show in placing them in the World Trade Organization. 
   Article I of the Constitution gives Congress express power over foreign commerce. There is no question but that this is our right. There is no question in this Senator's mind that it is our responsibility to step forward and say: WTO membership for China will not be granted without a debate in the House and Senate and a joint resolution. 
   There are serious questions that the House and the Senate 
   need to address. For us to sit back and go off on our Easter vacation, to go off on recess, to hold our town meetings or to take our trips around the world, and to have been silent on this issue, I think, at this time, will be indefensible. I suspect there will be some kind of announcement on the U.S. position on China's membership in the WTO while we are gone. Then we would never have had the opportunity to debate very important questions. 
   I do not have all of the answers to these questions, but I know they are serious questions and I know the Senator from Montana, the Senator from Alabama, who was on the floor just a moment ago, and myself ought to have a right, before we have the United States taking a position on WTO membership, to debate that on the floor of the Senate, to thoroughly examine the questions that have not yet been answered. 
   One question I would have is this: Are we lowering the WTO bar for China, to rush them into membership? 
   Since 1995, four countries have completed negotiations on accession protocol: Ecuador, Mongolia, Bulgaria, and Panama. All four of these nations were required to eliminate, on the date of accession or with very short transitions, trade practices that were incompatible with WTO rules. That has been the standard. Since 1995 the four nations that have sought to enter the WTO have been required to eliminate their trade practices that were incompatible with WTO rules. But China has firmly and continuously and repeatedly said they want a different standard. They want a longer transition period. They do not want to meet those WTO rules at the time of or soon after their accession to the WTO. That is a question I believe this body deserves the opportunity to investigate and debate thoroughly before we announce a national position regarding China's admission. 
   Another question I think is a serious question for debate: Are we allowing China into the WTO before they have made the kind of market reforms to bring them into conformity with WTO standards? The administration argues if we will just let China in, we will have greater influence on China's reform efforts than we do now while they are outside of the World Trade Organization. I suppose that is debatable. But we ought to have the opportunity to have that debate. 
   In my estimation, our influence on China would be far greater before they are admitted to the World Trade Organization than afterwards. Our ability to influence the kind of reforms the World Trade Organization would desire will be far greater if we say you are going to accrue the benefits of trade under the WTO only after these market reforms have taken place, these trade barriers have been lowered. Reforms should first be enacted, changes should first occur, and then membership should be granted --not vice versa. 
   I think this question deserves debate: Can China be trusted on trade issues? When we look at our exploding trade deficit with China, can they be trusted on trade issues if admitted to the World Trade Organization, or will we admit them to the World Trade Organization and then find them cavalierly ignoring the standards and the rules of the World Trade Organization? Our administration's own Trade Representative Barshefsky stated in her testimony, a little over 2 years ago, in reference to China, that ``China imposes new import barriers to replace those it removed.'' In other words, there can be the appearance of reform taking place, but if there are new barriers that are being erected while the old ones are being brought down, you really have not achieved the reforms necessary for World Trade Organization membership. 
   China has almost one-third of its industrial production controlled by the state. Almost two-thirds of urban workers are employed in state-owned enterprises. These state-owned enterprises are notorious for their ability to destroy wealth. Some economists estimate that it would be cheaper for China to close down their state-owned enterprises and keep paying the workers--close down the enterprises, go ahead and pay them their salaries, they would still come out ahead, than to keep operating. But because the state-owned enterprises would be vulnerable to foreign competition, the Chinese Government has a strong disincentive to the state-owned enterprises that are heavily subsidized through China's centralized and insolvent banking system. 
   One of the pledges that the Chinese Government made was that they would rapidly privatize the state-owned enterprises, shutting down those that they had to, privatizing others, allowing them to create capital by selling stock, but because of the recent economic downturn in China in which their robust growth rate has dropped appreciably, China now has backed off that pledge and has once again begun a round of bank loans to these very unprofitable, state-owned enterprises to subsidize them and to keep them in business. 
   This is backpedaling already on the kinds of reforms that would be expected if China were in fact ready for admission to the World Trade Organization. 
   Another question that this body needs to debate is, Should China be admitted as a developing country with far less stringent expectations and longer transition than allowed for other nations? That is what they desire. They say we are a developing Nation; therefore, we should be treated more leniently. They base their claim primarily upon their per capita gross domestic product. By every other measure, China is a major economic power in the world today and they want to be treated as such. They want to be recognized as a major economic power. 
   China will argue that as a developing country, they are entitled to use subsidies. They are entitled to put limits on exports and other policies to promote development of certain key industries such as automobiles and telecommunications and heavy industrial equipment. 
   China maintains that such programs are a part of China's industrial policy and not related to its application to the World Trade Organization. Many trade officials simply disagree with that assertion by the Chinese Government. That is a question and that is an issue the Senate should have the opportunity to debate, not after the fact but before China is admitted to the World Trade Organization and before the U.S. 
   Government announces its position on Chinese accession.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   If I might just briefly respond to a few of the points that my good friend from Montana made in his excellent statement. 
   It seems to me to be a difficult proposition to come to the floor of the Senate and argue that we should not have a debate and to argue we should not have a vote on the admission of China to the World Trade Organization. Yet that is the posture which the opponents of this amendment must be. 
   The Senator from Montana has said it would be an ``alarming precedent''--I believe those are the exact words--that has never happened before. In many ways, China is unprecedented. They are unprecedented in their size, their population, and their impact upon world events. And in many ways the abuses that are currently going on by their government to their own people are unprecedented. It is unprecedented to have a nation in the World Trade Organization with 40 percent of the economy controlled by the state. That is unprecedented. 
   Perhaps that is a good reason to have a debate on this issue and have a vote on who should be admitted to the World Trade Organization, since it would be unprecedented for a nation of this size, with such a mixed economic system, to be admitted to the World Trade Organization. It is unprecedented to admit to this trade organization a nation that views us as a hostile power and, as evidence indicates, has aggressively spied on the United States and stolen nuclear secrets from the United States. 
   To say it is an ``alarming precedent,'' I think is a great overstatement. In fact, if there was ever a reason to change the precedent, it would be because of China's behavior. 
   The Senator from Montana said amendments would certainly be messy. That is what democracy is about. That is what happens; that is what debates are about; that is what freedom is about. It might be messy; it might be unpleasant to vote on amendments that might be offered. But to respond to the question of the Senator from Montana, I am more than delighted to have a straight up-or-down vote with no 
   amendments. If we were in the House of Representatives, we could have the Rules Committee provide such an order; we would have no amendments, and we would vote up or down on whether China ought to go into the World Trade Organization. I am delighted to have such an opportunity, and I make a commitment to that right now. If we have a unanimous consent, at the appropriate time, I support having a clean vote on China's accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   I was somewhat surprised to hear my colleague from Montana say China has not been a bad boy, they have been a good boy; a number of things they helped us with--Pakistan and India. They had signed international agreements. They had shown restraint. 
   They have been adjudged one of the greatest proliferators of weapons of mass destruction in the world today. In fact, they were a great contributor to the problems and the arms race that has developed between Pakistan and India. 
   Signed international agreements--indeed, they have signed international agreements. Last year, they signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and since they signed that international agreement our State Department has adjudged their behavior on civil and political rights abysmal. They have a new and vicious and brutal crackdown upon the rights of their own people. That is the international agreement. 
   My colleague said they have shown restraint, not like the adventuresome nature of their politics 25 years ago; they have shown restraint. Well, I don't believe it is restraint for them to vigorously modernize their weapon systems and to vigorously seek American technology through legal and illegal means. 
   All of that aside, some of the questions were answered, but many of the questions I raised were not addressed at all and have nothing to do with anything other than trade and the economy. But they are questions that need to be debated, questions that need to be answered. Are we lowering the WTO bar for access to the Chinese? To say that we can deny them permanent MFN after the fact, after they have been admitted to the WTO, and that will be our vote, I think begs the question. There will be such international pressure for permanent MFN if we have already supported their admission to the WTO that it will be inexorable. It will be a fait accompli. But the evidence clearly is that we are setting a different standard for China. 
   In my discussions with the State Department over a year ago, they made it very clear to me that they were debating within the State Department whether we would have greater influence on China with them in at a lower standard, or out waiting for them to change and to make the necessary reforms. It is very clear that the administration has pursued the idea of lowering the standards so that China could be brought in prematurely. Admitting them as a developing country is changing the standards for China. These are issues which have not been addressed today in our debate but need to be addressed by the U.S. Senate. 
   I will not go through all of those questions again, but they are important questions. The Senate and the Congress should not keep ``punting'' on trade issues. We have a constitutional role. We are a coequal power with the executive branch. This is an opportunity for us to regain our voice on those very, very important issues that affect the lives of every American. The issue today is not do we want China in the WTO; 
   the issue is do we want to have an opportunity to debate that and to vote on that. That is the issue. 
   I have said, and I will say again, I want China in the World Trade Organization at the right time and under the right circumstances. But I do not believe that we should allow the administration to make a unilateral decision coopting the constitutional right of the House and Senate to express itself on this very, very important issue. 
   I hope that this amendment will be passed, that we will have the opportunity at the appropriate time to vote yes or no on China's admission to the World Trade Organization. I hope that the reforms are made in China so that I could vote yes on that. I would like to see that, but I believe that we have the greatest leverage we will ever have in bringing about reforms before we concede ahead of time that they should go into the WTO. 
   I believe this is an eminently reasonable amendment because we are not prejudging what the outcome should be. We are simply saying we should have the right to vote. We should say yes or no--not trade negotiators in a vacuum apart from those who were elected by the people to represent. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will take a moment, and then I will yield my remaining time. 
   I say that the leverage of which I speak--I think the Senator from Montana knows and agrees that the leverage is greater now before China goes into the World Trade Organization. The issues of which I speak deal primarily with trade issues. I hope we will use that leverage for human rights and nuclear nonproliferation across the board. But certainly there are trade issues that are critically important. 
   We have almost a $60 billion deficit with China. They have great barriers there, and we cannot lower the standards just so we can have a political announcement and have a gift that we are providing the Chinese by saying we are going to support your accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   I didn't want to offer this amendment today. I would much rather that this had gone through the committee. I would rather we had a different vehicle. But we are going out on Easter recess and the Premier is coming to this country. The negotiations are coming to a head. This is the only opportunity we have to ensure that we will have a voice on whether or not they should go into the WTO. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment--not to table it but pass the amendment and let the administration know how seriously we take this issue, and that as a coequal branch of Government we should be able to approve or disapprove whether China goes into the WTO. 
   There are serious issues that were not raised in this debate. We have had a good debate, but there needs to be a much more thorough debate, with many more Members involved. That will take place at the appropriate time if this amendment is passed. I ask colleagues to support it at the appropriate time. 
   I yield the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support, along with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, for the National Missile Defense Act. It is, in my opinion, long overdue and will correct a serious deficiency in our defense policy, one that leaves us utterly defenseless against a threat that is real today and promises to get worse tomorrow. 
   Last week, Thursday, in the Wall Street Journal, this headline greeted us:  
   China Buys...... 
   Stolen information about the U.S.'s most advanced miniature W-88 nuclear warhead from Los Alamos helped the Chinese close a generation gap in the development of its nuclear force.  
   This, of course, is a very abbreviated account of what the New York Times expanded on in great detail and great length. I think it describes for us not only a serious breach in our national security but a quantum leap in the ability of the Chinese Government to not only threaten the security of their neighbors in Asia but ultimately and eventually to threaten the security of American cities; thus, the importance of a National Missile Defense Act. 
   Mr. President, the Clinton administration is in its sunset, but the effects of its failed, flawed China policy are clearly on the horizon. We are faced today with a very disturbing situation. At the same time that the administration is fostering what it calls ``constructive engagement'' with the People's Republic of China, the Government of China is increasingly posing a threat to the United States and its interests. This policy is nothing if not contradictory and inconsistent. It is no less than a threat to American security. 
   China has made significant advances in its nuclear weapons program in recent years. By achieving the miniaturization of its bombs, the Chinese military can now attach multiple nuclear warheads to a single missile and hit several targets. China's technical advance means it can now deploy a modern nuclear force and pose an even greater threat to Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, not to mention the United States. The sad fact is that this technical advance was made possible by sensitive W-88 design information stolen from Los Alamos National Laboratory, a facility that we have discovered has very lax security. 
   The details that I am going to recount in the next few minutes are those that have all been published and have been available to the public in news accounts in recent days. 
   The W-88 is the smallest and most advanced warhead of the U.S. arsenal. It is typically attached to the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. With smaller warheads, the Chinese military will be able to deploy intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads. 
   In the last 2 days, I have attended two briefings with the Secretary of Energy. To me, the accounts that we heard were chilling and alarming. The secret information on the W-88 was  probably stolen in the mid-1980s. This active espionage went undetected until April of 1995, when nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos studying Chinese underground tests detected similarities to the W-88. The CIA found corroborating information 2 months later. The FBI and the Department of Energy's intelligence group, under Notra Trulock, investigated 
   the matter and were able to narrow its list of suspects to five, including Wen Ho Lee, an employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory with access to sensitive and classified information. Lee has since been dismissed but not arrested. The other four suspects remain employed. 
   DOE briefed CIA officials and then Deputy National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on the espionage in early 1996. The FBI subsequently opened a limited investigation in mid-1996 and recommended improved security at DOE labs in April of 1997. But DOE, under Federico Pena, shelved Trulock's counterintelligence program and ignored FBI recommendations, and although some of these accounts in the press have been contested and all of the facts are not yet out, according to press accounts, they ignored FBI recommendations to reinstate background checks. Instead, Chinese officials continued to visit DOE facilities without proper clearances. Meanwhile, Trulock, aware of other possible spy operations at DOE facilities, sought to inform Secretary Pena. It was 4 months before he could get an appointment. 
   Finally, in July of 1997, DOE briefed National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on the situation and the possibility of current espionage efforts, and Berger kept President Clinton informed. 
   What was the administration's response? It was back in the 1980s when we believe most of the theft on the W-88 took place. When it became evident in the mid-1990s, what was the administration's response? Unfortunately, the administration swept the matter under the red carpet they were preparing to roll out for President Jiang Zemin of China. 
   The National Counterintelligence Policy Board made recommendations for strengthening lab security in September of 1997. It was 5 months before President Clinton signed a Presidential decision directive in February 1998. The recommendations occurred in September as to the changes that should be made as to the strengthening of security requirements at our Laboratories. It was 5 months later when President Clinton finally signed a PDD February of 1998 mandating a more vigorous counterintelligence effort at DOE. It took 9 more months to implement those changes that were first recommended back in September of 1997, PDD in February of 1998, and then 9 more months before implementation occurs. 
   In addition, it is alleged that Acting Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler ordered Trulock to withhold information from Congress. 
   That is an allegation, and it is an allegation that is a serious allegation. And it is one that needs to be investigated by this Congress. 
   She reportedly ordered him not to brief the House Intelligence Committee on the espionage matter, and not to deliver written testimony to the House National Security Committee. It was only when Trulock testified before Congressman COX' committee investigating this whole matter that Trulock was then able to fully inform Congress. If what Trulock claims is true--that he was hindered, that obstacles were placed before him and he was ordered not to testify, not to provide that vital information to Congress--then I think we have not just a security breach that resulted in stolen secrets, but it involves, in effect, a refusal to give vital information to Congress so that the administration's China policy could move 
   forward without criticism--significant criticism--from Congress. 
   Only in the last several weeks was a lie detector test administered to Wen Ho Lee, the main suspect in this espionage. He has now been dismissed. Only now will periodic polygraph examinations be required of certain employees. 
   The administration's response to this situation seems puzzling at best. But then--if you put it in context of what is going on with our relations with China--it at least raises troubling questions. The administration was fostering its policy of constructive engagement, engaging China by in part selling nuclear technology, supercomputers, and satellites to China. 
   To bring up this vital issue of national security spying, espionage stealing of secrets--to have brought that up would have disturbed the flow of high-tech trade to China. And so it simply never was brought up. 
   At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese efforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, it certified that China was no longer assisting other countries in their nuclear weapons program. 
   It is amazing that when the administration knew that espionage was occurring at our Laboratories, that secrets were being stolen, it went ahead and certified that China was no longer assisting other countries in their nuclear weapons program. 
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American nuclear technology to China. 
   Why would we want to assist China in nuclear technology at the very time we are discovering their intensive efforts to infiltrate our Laboratories? 
   At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese efforts to steal militarily sensitive technology, it loosened export control laws on supercomputers and satellites. 
   Once again, it becomes not just a spy case. It becomes a situation in which the administration was pursuing a policy that to have disclosed what was happening in the security realm would have interfered with the pursuit of that policy goal by the administration. So it loosened export control laws on supercomputers and satellites at the very time the investigation was going on at Los Alamos. 
   At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese efforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, President Clinton was seeking reelection, receiving donations from Chinese sources, and allowing White House access to military intelligence officials. 
   At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese efforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, administration officials were preparing for a visit by President Jiang Zemin. 
   At the same time that Congress was investigating illegal campaign contributions with Chinese sources, the Clinton administration withheld vital information regarding security breaches at our National Laboratories from Congress and the American people. 
   How many briefs there were is yet in dispute. Who was providing the information and who was not, if anyone, is yet in dispute. 
   But it is troubling that there is evidence of an effort on the part of administration officials to preclude those who 
   should have known, those who had oversight responsibilities, those who had appropriations responsibilities, from knowing the full extent of the security breaches at our National Laboratories. 
   President Clinton's China policy, I believe, has been a failure. And I believe that these most recent revelations fit into the broader context of the failure of this administration's policy toward the People's Republic of China. 
   ``Constructive engagement'' has proven constructive, but it has been constructive only for the Chinese military. 
   The implications of this policy extend beyond the United States. In East Asia, our allies, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan will face a new and greater threat because of China's nuclear capabilities. It is ironic that the Chinese Government warns us not to develop a theater missile defense system while it aims more missiles at Taiwan and develops multiple nuclear warheads. The Chinese nuclear advancements will certainly inflame anxieties in India, which may lead to further proliferation in both India and Pakistan. 
   So President Clinton has left us with a ``strategic partner,'' as he terms it, pointing 13 of its 19 long-range missiles at us--a strategic partner building new long-range missiles, the DF-31 and DF-41; a strategic partner well on its way to developing multiple warhead missiles. These are the bitter fruits of a policy borne out of warped motives.  
   There were some in the administration who would like to dismiss this espionage case as a failure of the Reagan administration. I agree. There should have been greater security measures taken at that time. But this administration cannot blame its failure to uphold American security interests on past administrations. National security is a bipartisan issue. But it cannot blame its failure to adequately notify Congress on past administrations. This administration is responsible for a comprehensive policy failure in regard to China. The American people will be suffering the consequences long after the President has left office. 
   Mr. President, it is a fact that, while there are many facts yet in dispute, and while there are many questions that have gone unanswered, and it is my sincere desire that the appropriate committees of the U.S. Senate will begin immediate hearings and fulfillment of oversight responsibilities--while there are facts in dispute, and while there are questions to be answered, there are some facts that are indisputable. 
   It is an indisputable fact that the Chinese Government stole nuclear secrets allowing it to build smaller and more efficient warheads. 
   We can argue and we can debate as to whether it was a 2-year loss of technology or a decade, whether it was a generation, or whether it was less than that, but it is not disputable that China stole nuclear secrets allowing it to build a smaller and more efficient nuclear capability. 
   It is indisputable that the Chinese Government continues to aggressively seek to obtain technology from U.S. companies allowing it to better target their ICBMs. That is indisputable. Whether legitimate means, whether legal means, or whether serreptitious means, it is indisputable that China today continues on an aggressive pattern of seeking to obtain technology from the U.S. companies. 
   It is an indisputable fact that the Chinese Government is engaging in an expensive modernization of their weapons system. 
   While there may be much debate, that is a fact. That is beyond dispute. China today is expending vast amounts of its budget in order to modernize their weapons systems. 
   Mr. President, while there is much in dispute, it is a fact beyond dispute that the Chinese Government continues to be a major nuclear proliferator in the world, giving North Korea the missile capability even to hit American cities. 
   It is a fact beyond dispute that the Chinese Government continues to menace our allies in Asia with military threats. And it is a fact that the Chinese Government has again brutally clamped down on democracy advocates within China and seeks to extinguish free expression, whether religious or political. 
   In the face of all these facts, the administration is still determined to give an irresponsible actor in the world arena a major role by offering to China World Trade Organization accession. It is my sincere desire, it is my sincere hope, that the administration will not seek to bring China into the WTO, will not bend the rules, will not allow China to enter as a developing nation as they desire, and that we will, in dealing with the largest, most populous nation on the globe, take our rightful place and we will regain our voice where, when it comes to the World Trade Organization, we will require that Congress approve China's membership in the WTO before they are allowed to enter. 
   These facts, all incontrovertible and indisputable, reveal what I think is already obvious. The administration must reexamine its China policy and restore American security as its main priority. It must take responsibility for defending the American people, and it must commit to a national missile defense system. I applaud the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, for his leadership and his perseverance and his determination to bring this bill forward and to ensure its enactment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Alabama and thank him for his kind remarks concerning the Dollars to the Classroom proposal. I look forward to working with him on the committee. 
   I am dismayed that a bill that has the kind of bipartisan support--support in this Chamber, support across the country among educators, support among our Nation's Governors--would have been held up as long as this has been held up and would have had the kind of amendments, many of them worthy of debate but that would have been far more germane to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which, as the chairman has said, will be debated and will be marked up in committee later this year. I think it is  unfortunate that we have had all of these amendments filed. 
   As Senator SESSIONS said, I have a bill, that I feel very strongly about, that would go further than Ed-Flex. I have resisted offering that as an amendment. We could have brought that to the floor. We could have offered that to the Ed-Flex bill. However, it is important that this piece of legislation move forward uncluttered, clean, with the support of both parties, and be presented to the President for his signature. 
   I want to especially address in the next few minutes one of those amendments which has been offered, an amendment that sounds so good: The 100,000 teachers funded at the Federal level over the next 7 years. I think it is kind of a cotton candy amendment: It looks good, it is sweet, it tastes good, but it is not very filling, it is not very satisfying, and it is not very good for you. The 100,000 teachers--when you say that at first blush to the average American, that sounds very, very appealing, but I think when you look in greater depth and you look more closely at what that amendment would do, then, I think in fact it is not worthy of our support. 
   We have already decreased class size across this country. 
   At the same time we have seen a dramatic reduction in class size across the United States, we have not seen a comparable improvement in achievement. Between 1955 and 1997, over 42 years, school class size has dropped in the United States from 27.4 students per classroom to about 17 students per classroom, according to the National Center for Education Statistics--a very dramatic drop, from 27 to 17. At the same time, the number of teachers has grown at a faster rate than the number of students. This chart illustrates that very clearly. We see a very dramatic increase in the number of teachers and the student ratio decreasing appreciably. 
   While public school enrollment has decreased in Arkansas, in my home State, going from the broad international statistic to what it looks like in Arkansas, we have seen our public school enrollment drop slightly, by 1.3 percent, during the last quarter century. The number of teachers during that same period of time has dramatically increased in Arkansas, from 17,407 in 1965 to 29,574 in 1997. Now, that represents a 70-percent increase in teachers in the State of Arkansas. At the same time, we saw a slight decrease in the number of students in our public schools. What that represents is a very dramatic improvement in classroom size. We have smaller classes, we have more teachers teaching those classes, but studies have shown that unless the class is very, very large to begin with, modest reductions in the size of the class do not correlate with gains in student performance. 
   Here is the point: Effective teachers can generally handle, studies indicate, an ordinary class of 19 students as easily as they can handle a class of 14 students. 
   I want teachers to have smaller classes. I think that is a desirable goal. It is a goal that is being achieved in States all across this country. But I do not believe it is something we should mandate from Washington, DC, nor fund from Washington, DC. Senator SESSIONS said it better than I can: I don't believe we need the 100 Members of the U.S. Senate to become some kind of super school board making those kinds of decisions as to what schools need most. 
   At the same time teacher-student ratio has dropped in Arkansas from 21.9, almost 22, in every class in 1970, to 17 per class in 1995, student achievement has failed to show a measurable increase during that same time period. I want to say that again: We have seen classes drop from about 22 per class to 17 per class over the last 25 years in Arkansas. It has dropped more dramatically nationally, but in Arkansas we have seen it drop from 22 to 17. We have not seen student achievement show comparable improvement during the time that classes got smaller. 
   Now, the initiative that has been presented by Senator KENNEDY, the amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY and Senator MURRAY, is expensive indeed, and there is no demonstrable evidence that for what we will be paying for this new program, we will see a corresponding improvement in academic performance. If enacted, the President's teacher initiative will provide enough money to hire only 361 additional teachers in the entire State of Arkansas in the first 2 years. All of the hoopla, all of the excitement about the 100,000 new teachers--which sounds like such a dramatic number--over the next 2 years in the entire State of Arkansas, it means 361 additional teachers. 
   Now, we have in Arkansas 314 school districts. Many have argued we need fewer. Perhaps that is true; perhaps we need to consolidate some. But we have 314 school districts. We are going to receive 361 new teachers. That is 1.15 new teachers per school district. If we want to break that down a little more, it amounts to about half a teacher per elementary school. Since the focus of the amendment and the initiative is supposed to be grades 1 through 3, when you calculate that, it means .18 new teachers. 
   Here we have that clearly outlined: In the State of Arkansas, 1.15 new teachers per school district; a half a teacher per elementary school; or .18 new teachers for each grade 1 through 3. 
   It is simply not enough of a commitment if that is what we are trying to do, it is not enough of a commitment on reducing class size, to make an appreciable difference in Arkansas or the Nation. If this initiative were carried out for the full 7 years, Arkansas would be able to hire only 939 new teachers for the whole State over the whole 7-year period. That equals 3 new teachers per school district, or 1.4 teachers per elementary school, or half a teacher in grades 1 through 3, to do the whole program for the whole 7 years. For such an expensive proposal, I believe Americans expect more results than that. 
   This will do little to actually reduce the student-teacher ratio when there is only one new teacher in an entire school district, which is the result we would have under this initiative. 
   Lisa Graham Keegan, one of the most innovative directors of public instruction in the country, superintendent of public instruction for the State of Arizona states:  
   In the first year of the President's new program, Arizona will receive more than $17 million. $17 million is a lot of money; what do we get for that kind of investment? At $30,000 per year--a good, but not great wage--we can pay for a little over 500 new teachers, as the program asks. In Arizona, that comes to a bit under 2 teachers per school district. Not per school, but per school district.  
   They would average two new teachers per school district in the State of Arizona. Not every school district--and I think this is so important--finds that their greatest need is having more teachers or smaller classes. Many school districts do not need more teachers. They may need more books or more computers. Maybe they just need better-trained teachers. A one-size-fits-all approach is not what States and school districts need or want. 
   Again quoting Lisa Graham Keegan, she states:  
   President Clinton made it abundantly clear that he had decided that smaller class sizes are a good thing, even though research has provided no clear indicators of the impact that class size has on a child's ability to learn. Nevertheless, because class size had been a good thing in some of the classrooms the President had visited, then smaller class sizes had to be a good thing for every classroom in America.  
   Well, that is a pretty strong allegation. But I think it is accurate on the basis of effectively anecdotal evidence. The President concluded this sounds good, looks good, this is appealing, and this was going to be his education initiative: 100,000 new teachers, paid for by the Federal Government, without having the research to demonstrate that, in fact, it correlates to better academic performance. 
   This program requires that the money be used for new teachers. Yet, many States have already implemented class size reduction programs on their own. At least 25 States, including California, Florida, Nevada, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Maryland, have either tried a class size reduction program or are currently considering a class size reduction program. 
   What about the 25 States that, on their own, many times at the expense of their constituents and their school patrons, have implemented their own class size reduction programs? What about those who are ahead of the curve  and have sought to address this at the local level? Are we now going to say we are imposing this upon you, that you have to hire these new teachers if you want the benefit of this Federal program? 
   In his testimony before the Senate Health and Education Committee, on February 23, Michigan Governor John Engler said this. I know our Presiding Officer, the Senator from Michigan, will concur with this. Governor Engler has been one of the most creative and innovative Governors both in the area of welfare--pushing welfare reform a number of years ago and seeing a tremendous revolution in the welfare system in Michigan--and he has now been pushing hard for greater flexibility for the schools in Michigan and the schools across this country. He said in his testimony before our committee:  
   Many Governors feel so strongly that the bureaucracy is the problem that we cannot imagine being unable to improve education with greater funding flexibility.  
   He didn't say send us more money. He might not turn that 
   down, I don't know; but he didn't say that was the greater need. He said the problem is the bureaucracy. Give us greater flexibility and we will improve education. 
   Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania said in his testimony before our committee:  
   We all care about teacher competency, social promotion and class size and many other things, yet, we must recognize that the States themselves are designing programs that meet their unique needs.  
   The States themselves are designing programs. Once again, it is a matter of trust. Who are we to conclude in the U.S. Senate that we can be trusted to know what is best for local schools in Michigan, Arkansas, Vermont, and Washington State, but the Governors don't, the school superintendents don't, or that the local elected school boards can't be trusted? I think that is a misconception and an insult to those local leaders who care as much about the welfare and the education of children as we do here in the Senate. 
   Reducing class size simply does not necessarily mean we are going to have improved performance. It does not deliver the results. States performing exceptionally well on achievement tests do not have an extraordinarily high number of teachers per student. For example, the State of Minnesota ranked third in the 1996 NAEP test scores for eighth grade mathematics. They ranked third on the NAEP test in eighth grade math. They rank 42nd in students per teacher. 
   If lowering class size were the panacea, then Minnesota, I think, would have a hard time explaining why they rank third in the Nation in eighth grade math and 42nd in class size. There simply is no clear correlation. Without the research, without the hearings, without the evidence, why would we want to pass it? Is it because, like cotton candy, it looks good and sweet? 
   On the other hand, schools that have a low student/teacher ratio do not necessarily have a high achievement score. Example: The District of Columbia has the lowest number of students per teacher--13.7--of any State or Federal jurisdiction. It is 13.7. Yet, it ranked 41st in its 1996 NAEP test scores for eighth grade math. In contrast, we have Minnesota. I know there are a lot of factors that can be involved, but that tells me there is not a clear correlation between class size and academic performance. 
   Eric Hanushek, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Rochester, maintains that teacher quality ``has 20 times the impact of class size. Teacher quality just swamps all the evidence we have on class size. If I had a choice between a large class with a good teacher and a small class with a lousy one, I'd take the large class any day.'' 
   The teacher quality is far more critical in ensuring the quality of the education of our children than the student/teacher ratio, the class size. 
   I remember, vaguely, when I was in the second grade we had too many second graders; we had 37. And so the superintendent decided we were going to take 7 of the second graders--me being one of them--and put them in a joint class with second and third grade. Mrs. Hare was the teacher. Some of the parents expressed concern that we were going to have a combined class because the class was too big. But we had an extraordinary teacher, a quality teacher, in a combined class of 7 from one grade and 20 from another grade. But it worked. It worked not because the class size was perfect, or because the student/teacher ratio was perfect, but because, as Senator SESSIONS referred to it, the magic of learning in a classroom was taking place. We had a quality teacher who cared about the kids and instilled in us students a desire to learn. That is what we can do about education--improve the quality of teachers in the classroom, not some feel-good measure of hiring 100,000 teachers, whether that be the need or not. 
   Mr. President, about 1,100 studies have been made of class size. Out of those 1,100, only a very small few made any link at all between small classes and improved achievement. The research and the evidence is simply not there. 
   The proponents of this measure keep mentioning that we need to fulfill the promise made last fall in the omnibus appropriations bill, which funded the Class Size Reduction Program, at a price tag of $1.2 billion. 
   What I would ask is this: What happens at the end of the 7 years when this authorization expires? We then have a new mandate that must be funded, or the States and localities will bear the burden of continuing the program which we started. Hiring 100,000 new teachers with the spending schedule to expire at the end of 7 years will result in one of two things: Either a new heavier tax burden upon our States in trying to pay for these teacher salaries, or a permanent entitlement established at the Federal level, and another step in nationalizing education control in this country. 
   What happens with new Federal education programs? Once in place, they grow. They grow. Year after year, they grow. And this will become a new prescriptive program that places more regulations on the localities and further contributes to a Federal oversight of what should be and has always been a local issue. 
   Some Members have been talking about the urgency with which we must enact class size legislation. But, before we create a new Federal program, shouldn't we, I ask my colleagues, fully fund the mandates that Congress has already placed on school districts? 
   Every time I meet with parents, teachers, principals and local school board members from across Arkansas, they have one common theme and one common complaint. And it is this: Senator HUTCHINSON, please fully fund special education. 
   When we placed that mandate upon the schools, we made a commitment and a pledge that we were going to provide 40 percent of the funding of that mandate at the Federal level. Now, before we have even gotten close to meeting that commitment, we start a host of new programs, including the initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers. 
   During the 1995-1996 school year, 53,880 students in Arkansas were served under IDEA. That is about 12 percent of all students in the State served under IDEA special education. 
   Funding for special education affects all schools and all school districts. It is not a problem limited to Little Rock, or Rogers, AR, or to the State of Arkansas. Every State has to deal with this critical funding problem. 
   We are failing to miss a critical point: If we provide more funding for special education, then schools will have more money available to hire more teachers, create afterschool programs, or build new schools, whatever the need is at the local level. 
   If we would, rather than funding 100,000 new teachers ``one size fits all'', whether that is the need at the local level or not, if we would instead take that funding, place it in IDEA special education funding, it then would allow the local school districts to determine with the resources that are now free where the greatest need is--computers, books, tutors, or even school construction. But the decisions would be made locally. 
   In 1975, Congress first mandated a free appropriate public education for school-age children with disabilities. We have, Mr. President, not fulfilled the responsibility to which we committed. 
   The formula for providing grants to States is authorized at 40 percent, the national average per-pupil expenditure. Congress has never provided more than 12 1/2 percent of IDEA funding, and that  was back in 1979, 20 years ago. For fiscal year 1999, allocations to States represented only 11.7 percent of average per-pupil expenditures. Schools get only 11 percent of the funding, but 100 percent of the Federal mandates, and what an expensive mandate it is. 
   This shortfall in funding does not just affect special education students. Because schools are mandated by Federal law to provide a free and an appropriate public education, they must provide these services. 
   As Fort Smith public schools superintendent, Dr. Benny Gooden, wrote in a letter last week--one of our outstanding superintendents in Fort Smith, AR, who writes regularly about the burden that IDEA places upon local resources:  
   For almost 25 years, local elementary and secondary schools and their governing boards of education have attempted to deliver essential educational services to children with disabilities under these Federal guidelines. During this time period, the costs associated with providing these services have escalated dramatically, while the level of Federal support has never approached the promised 40 percent of applicable costs which accompanied the initial passage of the legislation.  
   While providing an education to disabled students is necessary and desirable, we must recognize the effect of imposing unfunded mandates on our school districts. 
   The more that we fail to pay our fair share of the cost of educating disabled students, the more we force local school districts to take money away from other programs to fulfill their duty to special education students. 
   With all of the talk about the importance of enacting class size reduction programs now when school districts are working on their budgets, it is important to fully fund IDEA and allow school districts to free up more money for other uses. 
   The costs for educating a special education student can be 5 to 10 times the district average. 
   In addition, as we all are aware, the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that the related services provision in IDEA includes medical services. This is going to dramatically increase this figure even more. 
   Whether this was the intent of Congress or not, we made a commitment to fund 40 percent of IDEA costs. And we simply have not kept our promise. 
   How can we in good conscience make more promises? We are going to give you 100,000 new teachers across this Nation. In Arkansas, it is about one per school district. How can we think of making more promises when we have not fulfilled the ones we already made to them in regard to special education? We are imposing an undue burden on school districts. And, if school districts had to spend less money on special education, they could use the available funds in the way they see fit. If that is entirely for teachers, so be it. If it means professional development, so be it. If it means buying new computers, we 
   ought to let those local districts make those decisions. 
   I see Senator COVERDELL, who has been one of the great leaders on educational reform in meeting our Republican vision for education, and I have spoken quite a while on this at this point. 
   I hope my colleagues know how strongly I feel about this. This is an important bill. It is an important step that we are taking. 
   Senator JEFFORDS did an outstanding job. I can't say enough about the leadership of Senator FRIST on this. We need not clutter this bill with amendments. We certainly don't need to start a new mandate on our schools. I hope that we will pass the bill quickly, pass a clean bill and send it to the President. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota. I don't know of a Senator who has been more consistent, more persistent, more  determined, more resolute in trying to reduce the tax burden under which the American people labor, trying to simplify this very onerous Tax Code under which we operate, than Senator ROD GRAMS of Minnesota. I am glad to associate myself with his comments today. 
   I suppose it is inappropriate to say, ``Happy anniversary,'' because the anniversary we remember today is not one that is a source of happiness. Mr. President, 86 years ago today--March 8, 86 years ago today--the Federal Government implemented the 16th amendment, ratified in 1913, and began at that point eating away at the income of the American worker. 
   Perhaps that date, March 8, is a day that ought to ``live in infamy.'' But, then, maybe we should not be too hard on those who enacted the income tax amendment. I believe they could never have envisioned, they never could have imagined, what would have happened under the guise of the income tax. In fact, I understand there was actually a proposal during the time that was being debated in Congress to cap what the income tax could ever reach--a ceiling--and it was dismissed because it was concluded that Congress would never raise the income tax to such an exorbitant level. 
   During the 1930s, Federal income taxes never, never were more than 1.4 percent of the Gross National Product--1.4 percent. In the 1990s the income tax now represents, as a percentage of the GNP, about 9 percent. So it has just skyrocketed. 
   The amendment originally passed said this:  
   The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census of enumeration.  
   That is the way it began--just a little sliver, just a small portion from Americans' wallets, at the turn of the century. That has turned into an enormous chunk of the pie, of the American family's reward for a hard day's work. 
   According to the Office of Management and Budget, individual income taxes constituted only 14.6 percent of the total revenue of the Federal Government in 1935. Less than 15 percent of all revenues generated for the Federal Government came from the Federal income tax in 1935. Today, individual income taxes constitute a whopping, staggering 45 percent of the total Federal revenue, better than three times what it was in the 1930s. 
   The rate has grown so rapidly, the Tax Code has become so onerous, that Senator GRAMS and I are black-marking this day in American tax history. It is only a prelude to the dreaded date, April 15. It is only in May, on or about May 7, that hard-working Americans can breathe a sigh of relief, on what is called Tax Freedom Day. Only on that day, May 7, can Americans begin to keep their hard-earned money, after having spent 4 months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax bill. It is for no small reason that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 36, stated:  
   Many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation, to excite the apprehensions of the people.  
   That was written 210 years ago. Today, we know exactly what Alexander Hamilton meant. The Federal Government has used the power of internal taxation to create broad distrust in the American people and create a Tax Code 7,500 pages in length containing over 800,000 words. 
   We in the Senate have an opportunity to replace these dreadful anniversaries with a new one--the elimination of the present Tax Code on December 31, 2003. The Tax Code Termination Act, which I will, as Senator GRAMS alluded, introduce in the near future, would eliminate, terminate, sunset the existing Tax Code by December 31, 2003. 
   Congress, the President, and the American people would then replace the current Tax Code with a leaner, simpler, fairer, and more honest tax system by no later than Independence Day, July 4, 2003, the beginning of a new era of freedom in this country. Senator GRAMS will be introducing a simpler, fairer tax system; others have proposed other alternatives. I will make my decision. I say this: The Tax Code Termination Act, the sunsetting of the Tax Code, is not relying upon which kind of solution, it does not determine which direction we should go, but, I assert, we cannot do worse than the current inexplicable, incomprehensible Tax Code by which we are governed. 
   I applaud and commend Senator GRAMS for being bold enough, creative enough and, I might add, courageous enough to introduce a very broad, comprehensive proposal to replace the current, clearly inequitable tax system. For too long the American people have suffered under the heavy chains of the oppressive regime we call our Tax Code. Each year, Americans spend over 5.4 billion hours slaving away to comply with tax provisions. That 5.4 billion hours is the equivalent amount of time it takes to produce all the cars, all the trucks, and all the airplanes in this country in 1 year. All of that energy, all of that productivity going to comply with the Tax Code. 
   A humble family of four will spend the equivalent of 2 weeks for Tax Code compliance. Ironically, every year $13.7 billion of the money that taxpayers struggle to pay the Federal Government is expended in enforcing the code. They pay their taxes. They pay their tax bill, $13.7 billion of which goes to enforce that code. Yet the IRS, a bureaucracy of 110,000 people in over 650 offices around the country, provides misinformation one out of every four times a taxpayer calls to seek assistance. 
   It is time that we act. We have made the Tax Code ever more complex. In 1997, Senator GRAMS was very much involved in this. I am sure if Senator SESSIONS had been in the U.S. Senate at the time, he would have been involved in it. We made a serious attempt to ease the tax burden on the American people. Senator GRAMS and I, on the House side, introduced the $500-per-child tax credit. We said working families deserved to have that; that the cost of rearing a child has increased and was never indexed for inflation. The per-child tax deduction nowhere near compensated for what it cost. We, in effect, said public policy did not really value families, and we didn't really value children. We pushed for that, not only the $500-per child tax credit, but this Senate and this Congress, for the first time in 16 years, reduced the tax burden on working Americans. 
   Even after that successful effort, the tax burden remains so high that the average American family will spend more on taxes at the Federal, State, and local level than they will spend for food, for clothing, for housing, education and recreation all combined. That is how much we are taking. 
   Even in 1997, when we sought to reduce the tax burden on the American people, we had an undesired consequence. We were unwitting contributors to the complexity of the Tax Code, and we created even new complications, new deductions, new credits at that time when we were trying to reduce taxes. 
   Mr. President, in the Senate we have a number of options before us in 1999. We can ignore the plight of the American taxpayer, continue to celebrate, so-called, these tax anniversaries. That is one option that we have. No one has suggested we should not meet a full commitment to Social Security. Sixty-two percent of the projected revenue surplus should be set aside for Social Security. There is no debate about that. Both parties agree about that. 
   We need to do much more. We need to take the opportunity with the remainder not to create new spending programs, but to lessen the burden upon the American people. We cannot ignore the plight of the American taxpayer. We can continue with the status quo, or we can implement incremental reforms and try our best to make repairs to a house built on shifting sand, as we have almost every year for the last 12 years. 
   Finally, we can lay a solid foundation for a new house by voting for real reform. We can sunset the existing Tax Code, and we can pass a fairer and simpler and more understandable tax system, one that the American people deserve. 
   I thank my colleague for his leadership. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill. This is an important piece of legislation in which there is bipartisan support. I just plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--who are being obstructionists and are holding up a piece of legislation that the National Governors' Association supports, Republicans and Democrats support, educators across this country support, and which makes good sense--let's vote for cloture and move on to the debate so that we can give the American people what they deserve in better education. 
   In voting for cloture, we will be voting to cut educational bureaucracy and ensure greater resources going to the children. In the State of Arizona--

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. The five amendments that have been proposed add billions and billions of dollars in costs when the first obligation, the commitment the Senator speaks of, has already been made to the educators in IDEA, in providing the full funding for special education across this country. 
   Reclaiming my time, to vote for this cloture is to vote to cut educational bureaucracy. In Arizona, 165 employees--nearly half of the whole workforce of their Department of Education-- oversee only Federal programs accounting for only 6 percent of the funding. I say that is where we can take a step in the right direction in the passage of this bill. 
   We should not be funding new programs. This amendment that Senator KENNEDY refers to is a $12.635 billion amendment. That is the kind of amendment that will destroy the possibility of passing this bill into law and ensuring better education for our children. We don't need new spending programs until we have made the commitment that we made to the Nation's Governors in providing a full 40 percent of funding for special education. If there is a complaint from local schools, it is not that we are not starting enough new programs, it is that we are not funding the programs that we already mandated to them. 
   I look forward to debating the amendment for 100,000 new teachers--$12 billion. Let me just refer to my home State of Arkansas where, between 1955 and 1997, class size dropped from 27.4 students per classroom to 17 students per classroom. We are doing the job on cutting the size of classrooms, but we have not seen a comparable improvement in academic performance. Why do we assume that this is the only great need that schools have and we are going to decide it in Washington, DC? While public school enrollment in Arkansas has decreased by 1.3 percent in the last 26 years, the number of teachers has grown by over 12,000--from 17,000 to 29,000. 
   We don't need to give them the .3 teachers per classroom that they will get under this amendment. We need to give them greater flexibility so they can do a better job. I ask my colleagues: After 7 years, if we do this, after we fund this, if we fund these 100,000 teachers for 7 years, what then? How will the schools fund those teachers then? I suggest to you that it will be the COPS Program all over again. 
   I had a call this week from the director of the State police in Arkansas who said, ``We hired 90 State police officers under the COPS Program, and now the money is ending. What do we do? How do we pay for them? You have to keep the money coming.'' 
   After 7 years, what we will have done is either pull the rug out from under local educators, where they have to come up with additional local funding--schools that are already strapped--or they are going to look to Washington, as they have before, and we will have created another new entitlement in permanently funding teachers from Washington, DC. 
   That is not what we need to do to improve education in this country. That is not what we need to do for the children of this country. What we do need to do is to pass this bill, eliminate some of the hoops we currently make the States jump through, allow them greater flexibility in doing reforms, and improve education creatively at the local level where the decisions can best be made. 
   Let's reject the ``one-size-fits-all'' solution from Washington. Let's approve this cloture motion and move on to provide educational flexibility for the schools of this country. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am happy to rise in support of the Ed-Flex legislation. I want to commend Chairman JEFFORDS and Senator FRIST for their outstanding work, as well as Senator WYDEN for his bipartisan efforts on behalf of this legislation which I think takes a tremendous step--a bold step--toward improving education in our Nation's schools. 
   I listened closely to some of those who spoke earlier today and yesterday in opposition to this legislation. Time and time again, I heard the advocacy of greater spending, as if spending were the sole gauge for our commitment to better education in this country. 
   I heard time and time again that Ed-Flex was nothing or that it did nothing. The fact is that providing greater flexibility for our State departments of education, providing greater flexibility for local school districts, is the single best thing that we can do to untie their hands, to take the straitjackets off local educators and ensure that they, in fact, have the ability to make the decisions that are going to be in the best interests of the students in this country. 
   I remember well when I came to the House of Representatives, the U.S. Congress, in 1993, and the great debate was on what we should do about welfare reform. We had established across this country a process by which States could apply for waivers from the burdensome welfare regulations mandated on the Federal level. While not all of the analogy between welfare reform and education reform today fit--there are many differences--there are also a number of similarities. 
   The first step toward what became comprehensive welfare reform was the ability for States to apply for waivers and escape the heavy-handed mandates coming out of Washington, DC. That first step on waivers led us to the much broader step of block grants and comprehensive welfare reform, which has worked, and which has taken thousands and thousands of people who were living lives of dependency on welfare to now lives of independence, lives of hope and greater prosperity. 
   It has worked in spite of the dire predictions about giving the States the  flexibility to enact what they believed would work in their States in welfare reform; it has, in fact, accomplished the stated goals. 
   I believe that while this, as has often been said, is not an end-all, it is not a cure-all for educational woes in this country, providing the States an ability to escape Washington mandates so long as they are accomplishing intended purposes with proper accountability is an important first step to take. I hope we will go further. I hope we go to dollars to the classroom that will consolidate a number of Federal education programs. But this is bold and this is important. I commend the bipartisan efforts to bring us to this point. 
   I think what we are addressing in this legislation is the tragedy of bureaucratic waste. We have heard repeatedly the statistics that have been cited, and I think accurately cited, that we have 760 Federal education programs; that those 760 Federal education programs spend approximately 6 or 7 cents on the dollar in funding for our local schools, while mandating 50 percent of the paperwork required for our educational programs. 
   When PETE HOEKSTRA in the House of Representatives began his Crossroads Project, looking at education in America, one of the first things he did was to try to catalog the number of Federal education programs. I have the transcript of Secretary Riley before Congressman HOEKSTRA's committee.  
   Chairman HOEKSTRA: How many education programs do you estimate that we have throughout the Federal Government? [A rather straightforward question to ask of the Secretary of Education.] 
   Secretary RILEY: We have--what is the page? It's around 200. I've got it here. One thing that I do think is misleading is to talk about 760-- 
   Chairman HOEKSTRA: Well, how many do you think there are? 
   Secretary RILEY: We have--I've got a page here with it. 
   Chairman HOEKSTRA: Just the Department of Education alone or is this including all other agencies? 
   Secretary RILEY: It is just a couple less than 200. 
   Chairman HOEKSTRA: Is this just the Department of Education? 
   Secretary RILEY: Just the Department of Education. 
   Chairman HOEKSTRA: Well, how about including other agencies and those kinds of things. 
   Secretary RILEY: Well, that is where I was going to get into the 760.  
   It goes on. Congressman HOEKSTRA explains the process they had to go through to actually come up with the figure 760 Federal education programs, 
   and, in fact, it is quite well verified. So 760 programs that had never even been cataloged, when you asked the Department, they didn't even know how many there actually were. What we are suggesting is that those 760 education programs place an enormous paperwork burden on classroom teachers, local educators, and on a State's department of education. It is in that area that we can address the enormous bureaucratic waste. 
   Now, it was said repeatedly that this bill is nothing. I want to quote a man I admire greatly, and he is quoted in the Fordham Foundation report entitled ``New Directions.'' That individual is the Rev. Floyd Flake. Many of you will recognize that name because Floyd Flake was a Congressman from New York State for many, many years, representing his constituents very well, but who was willing to step outside of the box and, in fact, he was so committed to education reform and improving the lives of the children of his constituents in New York, he left the U.S. Congress--a safe seat for sure--and went back to his home district to run a school and pastor a church. This is what Rev. Floyd Flake said, an African American pastor who served in the U.S. House as a Democrat:  
   While over $100 billion in title I funds have been expended on behalf of these children--  
   that is, children at risk--  
   these funds have not made much difference. Study after study has shown that this important Federal program has failed to narrow the achievement gap. The result for America's neediest girls and boys is nothing short of tragedy. Real education reform will transform the future prospects of America's minority and low-income children, but this cannot come primarily from Washington. What the Federal Government can do is get out of the way of States and communities that are serious about pursuing real education reform of their own devising.  
   I believe Reverend Flake, Congressman Flake, has hit the nail on the head. We have heard much very strong, emotional and passionate talk about the needs of disadvantaged children. I don't believe anybody can question Pastor Flake's commitment to disadvantaged children. He said the best thing we can do is get Washington out of the way. So I believe we can address the tragedy of bureaucratic waste by passing Ed-Flex. 
   Secondly, we address the logic that one size fits all; that wisdom flows only from Washington, DC; that the U.S. Congress has the wisdom and ability to micromanage our schools. So we hear much about accountability and that somehow by providing States broad, new flexibility we are going to water down or minimize accountability. 
   Well, I believe it is a very high form of arrogance to say that we don't trust local elected officials, we don't trust local school superintendents who are hired by that local school board, that we don't trust the Governors of our States, that, in fact, only we can make those decisions about what accountability should be. ``One size fits all'' rarely works in a country as diverse as the United States of America. To believe that we can micromanage local schools from Washington, whether they are in inner-city New York City or Desha County, AR, or whether it be in Detroit or in Miami, the differences in our cultures, our social backgrounds, and our needs across this country are so great, we are so diverse, that to believe that we can properly diagnose and then treat educational problems from Washington, I think, is foolish, indeed. 
   In fact, as you look over the history of the last 30 years 
   of education in this country, we have seen, by every objective measurement, a deterioration in academic success. I suggest to those who oppose this bill that they are attempting to defend a status quo that is demonstrably flawed. We can address the tragedy of ``Washington knows best'' and that we don't trust those local officials. What brings us to the floor today--what brings this legislation to the floor today is the crisis that exists in American education. 
   I listened to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. He used many of the same statistics that I quote. He quoted many of the same reports that I have before me, which emphasize and underscore the crisis we face in American education. But it seems to me that the opponents are saying it is a terrible crisis and therefore we need to keep the status quo, we need to fund current programs at higher levels, when what we have been doing has clearly failed. 
   So what this bipartisan bill does is to say, let's try a new approach, and that innovation, creativity, and new ideas are coming from the States and local schools. Let's give them the flexibility to enact those reforms, and I believe we will see education truly improve. 
   The federally funded National Assessment of Educational Progress, the NAEP report, reports that 38 percent of 4th grade students do not even attain ``basic'' achievement levels in reading. In math, 38 percent of 8th graders score below basic level, as do 43 percent of 12th graders in science. 
   I point out that there is an obvious trend there. In the lower grades, we do better; in the higher grades, we do worse. That reality was further emphasized in the TIMSS test report, which is the best measurement of an international comparison of student achievement. The TIMSS report shows that while we do quite well in math and science in grade 4, compared to students in other countries, by the time those students reach the 12th grade, they are almost at the bottom, internationally. So something has clearly gone awry between grade 4 and grade 12. 
   I believe that is a strong incentive for us to change the direction of education in this country. The Fordham Foundation report is well named: New Directions. It is high time that we find new directions in education, and that is what Ed-Flex does. It is a first step, but it is an important step, freeing us from bureaucratic waste and inefficiency. As President Ronald Reagan used to say, ``The only thing that saves us from bureaucracy is its inefficiency.'' The tragedy is when you look at the inefficiency in the education bureaucracy, those whom it is hurting are those who are most vulnerable--our children, our students. 
   Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona State Superintendent of Public Instruction, recognizes this. She has stated that it  is ``the lure of Federal dollars tied to programs with hazily defined goals,'' and compliance with those Federal programs is a big cause of the problems we face in education today. Keegan specifically indicates that 165 employees in the Arizona Department of Education are responsible for one thing, and one thing only, and that is managing Federal programs--165 employees just to manage the Federal programs, which account for 6 percent of Arizona's total spending on education. 
   Now, those 165 employees work out to be 45 percent of her total staff. She has 45 percent of her educational staff in the educational department in Arizona doing nothing more than complying with Federal programs that account for only 6 percent of the funding for Arizona schools. 
   Something is badly out of kilter when that happens. And it happens not only in Arizona, but you can echo those same sentiments by directors of education across this country. 
   This is an opportunity for us to move in a new direction. 
   President Clinton has made it very clear that he decided the problem with education is class size; that smaller class size is a good thing, and that even if the Federal Government has to step in and do it, that is what we should do. No research indicates what the impact of class size is going to have on a child's ability to learn. Despite this there is a $1.2 billion proposal to spend tax dollars to reduce class size. That will be a debate for another time. But I think once again it reflects the traditional thinking that we can only solve education problems with Washington solutions. 
   In 1996, then-Governor VOINOVICH of the State of Ohio who is now our colleague in the U.S. Senate noted that local schools in his State had to submit as many as 170 Federal reports totaling more than 700 pages during a single year. This report also noted that more than 50 percent of the paperwork required by a local school in Ohio is a result of Federal programs; this despite the fact that the Federal Government accounts for only 6 percent of Ohio's educational spending. One-hundred and seventy Federal reports, Governor VOINOVICH said, 700 pages in length, and 50 percent of the paperwork, and once again only 6 percent of the educational spending in Ohio. 
   Then I think the experience in Boston illustrates this need for Ed-Flex as well. I quote again from this very important report. It states:  
   Unfortunately, even this estimate is likely to underestimate the true paperwork burden to local schools and universities across the country.  
   According to the President of Boston University, John Wesley, Boston University spent 14 weeks and 2,700 employee hours completing the paperwork required to qualify for Federal title IV funding. They were slowed by repeated corrections and clarifications requested by the Department of Education. And, in the end, the university spent the equivalent of 1 1/2 personnel years compiling what turned out to be a 9-pound application. 
   I wish that were unusual. It may be unusual. But they actually compute it where it can be quantified. But I am afraid that reflects the experience of the education establishment all across this country. 
   I know that there are many others who want to speak on this bill. I, once again, applaud so much of the efforts of Senator FRIST, Senator WYDEN and Chairman JEFFORDS. 
   My sister is a public schoolteacher in Rogers, AR. She, right now, I suppose is teaching her third-grade class in Reagan Elementary School in Rogers, AR. 
   I was thinking last evening about my experience in elementary school in a little town with a population of less than 1,000. And I can to this day name every elementary teacher I had. The first grade, Ms. Jones; the second grade, Ms. Harris; the third grade, Ms. Miller; the fourth grade, Ms. Shinpaugh; the fifth grade, Mrs. Allen; the sixth grade, Mrs. Comstock. I can't do that with junior high school or college. 
   But the impact that an elementary teacher makes upon those students is beyond exaggeration, I think. Most of us, I suspect, can look back at those elementary teachers who had an incredible impact upon our lives. There is a kind of magic that takes place in a classroom. Chairman JEFFORDS sees it every time he goes over and reads to those disadvantaged children. All of us who have taught, whether it was in junior high teaching civics, as I did, or whether it is teaching third grade in the public schools just like my sister does, have experienced that magic where the light comes on, where those students connect with their teacher, the thrill of learning and where the experience of education catches on in a classroom. 
   I suggest to those who want to talk about the need for greater control in Washington and who want to oppose providing flexibility to local schools that they remember that the magic happens in the classroom. 
   I want my sister, Geri, spending her day teaching those students, creating the magic, inspiring those kids to learn and to appreciate the value of education rather than spending her day filling out forms for the 6 percent of funding that comes from Washington, DC. I don't want her having to spend her prep hour filling out more forms for bureaucrats in Little Rock and Washington. 
   Mr. President, I believe this is a bold step. I hope it is not the last one that we take. But it is an important step. I applaud, once again, and am glad to be a part of supporting this effort today. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am grateful to our leadership for affording us this time this morning to debate and to vote on Senate Resolution 45. Some would say this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution so this isn't important and that this is filling time, or whatever. I suggest that there are a couple of things that have happened just recently which underscore the value and the importance of the time we are spending on the Senate floor this morning and the vote on this resolution. 
   Mr. President, just this morning the Associated Press reported that two more members of the Chinese Democracy Party were detained. They were taken from their homes for trying to set up a human rights meeting in Wuhan. That was reported just this morning. It has become all too frequent, and almost daily, that there are news reports of the continued crackdown on human rights in China. 
   These today were detained only for being members of the Chinese Democracy Party, the fledgling opposition party advocating democracy and human rights in China. I think this incident, just reported this morning, underscores the value and 
   the importance of what we are doing and what we are about today. 
   Then it is reported this morning as well that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, said the administration is still deciding the most effective way for the United States to persuade China to improve its human rights record. 
   The fact that the Secretary of State admitted before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that the administration has not yet decided what they are going to do, that they have not yet determined what course of action they will take to try to persuade the Chinese to improve their human rights record, I believe, underscores the importance and the value of the resolution that is before us, one that is incredibly important. 
   One of my colleagues yesterday, in seeing the agenda for today, said, ``Well, TIM, there you are slamming the Chinese again.'' Let me say that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the Chinese people. In fact, I cannot think of any group that I have higher admiration for than those Chinese citizens today who are fighting courageously and standing up for human rights within their own country and fighting for the democracy movement in China. 
   This resolution today has nothing to do with the Chinese people, but it has everything to do with the intolerable practices of the Chinese Government in which they continue to abuse the basic fundamental human rights of the Chinese people. This resolution is important because the administration has all but said they are looking for a signal from Capitol Hill. They are looking for direction from the Congress as to whether or not they should sponsor a resolution in Geneva this summer calling the world's attention to those abuses that are ongoing in China today. We need to send them that signal. This resolution affords us that opportunity. 
   If there is one thing the Chinese Government does take seriously, it is international opinion. To the extent that by this resolution and by our Government offering a resolution in Geneva this summer we can marshal the international community in protest to the ongoing human rights crackdown in China, we will have done something very significant and very worthwhile. 
   Mr. President, the resolution before us today urges the administration to sponsor a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission critical of China's human rights abuses. The Commission will meet in March and April in Geneva, Switzerland. 
   By passing this resolution, which enjoys very strong bipartisan support, we give Secretary Albright a clear message to bring with her to China when she travels there in the beginning of March. That message is that the United States will not accept China's wholesale violation of internationally accepted human rights standards. It is an important signal. I have had discussions with the administration and with the Department of State, and I know they are looking for the sentiment of the Senate and the Congress on this issue. 
   The Communist Government of China has long committed a litany of human rights abuses. Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison, many of them sentenced after unfair trials, others today languishing in prison without any trial at all. At least 200 of these prisoners are still suffering because of their participation in or their support of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. 
   Religious persecution runs rampant in China. People who dare to worship outside the aegis of officially sponsored religious organizations face fines, they face detention, arrest, imprisonment and, too often, torture as well. 
   And the human rights movement in China, the democracy movement in China, and the house church movement are very much intertwined. And many of these home churches have become, in fact, bases of the democracy movement and human rights efforts within China today. Thousands of peaceful monks and nuns have been detained and tortured in Tibet where the Chinese Government is imposing a harsh patriotic so-called education campaign. 
   Mr. President, under China's one-family-one-child policy, couples face punitive fines and loss of employment for having unapproved children. But it does not stop with monetary penalties. Local authorities, with or without the approval of the Communist Party cadre, forcibly perform abortions or sterilizations on women who are pregnant with their second child. Relatives are held hostage until couples submit to this coercion. 
   Furthermore, incredibly, prisoners are executed in China after grossly unfair trials, and then their organs are sold on the black market. The pattern of abuse is clear. And in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Government human life seems to bear no value at all. 
   What has been this administration's response to these abuses? Under President Clinton's policy of so-called constructive engagement, the administration effectively disengaged human rights practices from trade practices in 1994, while promising that efforts to pass a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission would be increased. 
   However, Mr. President, last year, President Clinton further unhinged his policy by deciding not to pursue a resolution at the Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, which was critical of China. We historically had done that. Year after year, we offered that resolution, but last year supposedly the administration said in a good-faith gesture we withheld offering that resolution. 
   That commitment was given to China in exchange for their promise to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, a covenant which affirms free speech and free assembly. It is highly ironic that the ICCPR itself is a product of U.N. Human Rights Commission meetings. China did sign the ICCPR in October, only to turn around and violate its every principle since they put their signature to that document.  
   Since the President's trip to Beijing in July 1998, the Communist Government of China has renewed its crackdown on all who would dare to oppose the Communist Party. Some 100 members of the fledgling Chinese Democracy Party, the CDP, have been detained, excluding the two that were announced this morning. Some have been released, others await trial, and the most unfortunate have been sentenced to very long prison sentences. 
   Three visible leaders of the CDP, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin, and Wang Youcai were sentenced to 13, 12 and 11 years in prison, respectively, on charges of subversion and endangering state security, after highly dubious trials. In reality, these democracy activists exercised their legal rights under Chinese law to create and to form a political party. Their true crime, in the eyes of the Communist Party, was simply their love for democracy. 
   But the crackdown does not end there. In fact, incidents of harassment and imprisonment are almost too numerous to list. I will highlight just a few examples. 
   The Communist Government sentenced businessman Lin Hai to 
   prison for 2 years for--listen to this crime--providing e-mail addresses to a prodemocracy Internet magazine. 
   Zhang Shanguang is in prison now for 10 years for this crime: Providing Radio Free Asia with information about farmer protests in Hunan Province. 
   The Government sentenced poet and writer Ma Zhe to 7 years in prison on charges of subversion for publishing an independent literary journal. 
   In addition, the Communist Government is cracking down on film directors, artists, computer software developers and the press, and continues to harass and detain religious activists. The list goes on. 
   In 1998, police imprisoned 70 worshipers from house churches in Hunan Province. And the pattern of human rights violations is undeniable. Rather than improving since the good-faith gestures of the American Government and our rewarding of the Chinese Government with favorable trade status, we have seen not a favorable response on the part of the Chinese Government but an exacerbated attack upon those who would simply advocate freedom and democracy. 
   I see that my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator MACK, has come to the floor to speak on this resolution. I appreciate his outstanding leadership on this issue. He was the lead sponsor of a similar resolution last year. And if Senator MACK is prepared to speak at this time, I will yield to Senator MACK. Is the Senator ready to speak now?

And I thank him for his very eloquent statement.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator WELLSTONE for his commitment to the issue of human rights. When PAUL WELLSTONE comes to the floor and I come to the floor and we work own human rights issues together, we both want to make it clear that we can agree very rarely. There are few political issues that we are going to be united on, and our votes will more often than not cancel each other out on the issues coming before the U.S. Senate. But I admire and respect PAUL WELLSTONE for his deep commitment to democracy and to human rights around the world, and for his involvement in this issue. I am glad to be able to work with him on this. I think it is a very important resolution. 
   I reiterate that this resolution is important, and it is important for several reasons. It is important because it will be a message to the administration. It is very timely, and I appreciate our majority leader for ensuring that this vote occur this week because our Secretary of State will be traveling to China next week. It is important for this vote to occur. It is important for it to be a strong bipartisan vote and for our Secretary of State to have that message as she goes to China. So I think it is important from that standpoint. 
   It is also a very, very important message to our European allies. Many of our allies in Europe are looking for our leadership. Germany has had a change in government. They are much more sympathetic to the cause of human rights, in my estimation. The French press reported that this vote in the U.S. Senate was going to occur today. They are looking for a message and a signal from political leaders in the United States. So it is important from that standpoint as well. It is a message to the Chinese Government, not just through our Secretary of State, but that we as the elected Representatives of the people--the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives--as we speak out on this issue, it conveys a strong message to the Chinese Government, and they are concerned about what this country thinks. 
   I think one of the great failings of this administration has been that it has rewarded human rights abuses and crackdowns in China, whether it is religious freedom crackdowns, press crackdowns, Internet crackdowns, or any host of human rights abuses; they have, in effect, rewarded that by increasing economic opportunities through trade with the United States--most recently, their plan to bring China into the World Trade Organization, almost as a reward for the very terrible abuses that have occurred during the last several months. 
   And then, may I say that this resolution is critically important because of the message it sends--as my colleague from Minnesota said, the message that it sends to the Chinese activists for democracy and human rights within China today, which is that when we take the floor of the U.S. Senate and speak on this issue, they are listening--Radio Free Asia--through the Internet and through other means by which our activities and the news of our activities gets into China. They are listening and they are interested and it is an encouragement to them to know that there are those who stand with them in the cause of freedom in our country and our Government. 
   Mr. President, in my opinion, it is wholly appropriate for the United States to advance a resolution at the Commission in 
   Geneva critical of China's ongoing human rights abuses. The Commission is a multilateral forum authorized to deal with the very abuses perpetrated by the Chinese Government today--a resolution that the Commission will pierce any notions that China's violations of human rights will be quietly accepted by the world community. 
   There are some in the administration--and I think it is reflected in Secretary Albright's statement yesterday--that are undecided on how they are going to proceed, and whether or not they are going to offer this resolution. There are some within the administration who argue that a resolution critical of China at the Human Rights Commission should not be pursued and is in effect pointless because, as they put it, it is certain to fail. 
   I think Senator MACK said, ``Well, I don't believe it is certain to fail''; but whether it was certain to fail or not, it should be offered on the basis of principle, on the basis of the encouragement and the emboldenment it will provide for those within China. But the very sentiment that the administration expresses when they say it is certain to fail becomes a self-fulfilling sentiment, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more halfhearted the administration is in its attempts to advance such a resolution, the less chance that such a resolution will have to pass. 
   The longer the administration refrains from exercising leadership in the international community on this matter of human rights, the less likely it is that the resolution will be successful. Bringing forth a resolution at the Commission is, as Senator MACK so accurately put it, a matter of principle. Success will be measured by the statements of truth that flow from the debate at the Commission. A resolution at the Commission this summer will proclaim boldly that the human rights abuses in China are an affront to the international community and its values. 
   Mr. President, these values are not uniquely American values. There are those who have argued in the past that it is wrong for us to speak of these values and to try to, as they put it, force these values upon the Chinese Government. But I would assert--and I believe that this country is built on this belief --that these values are not uniquely American values, that they transcend any national boundary, that they are fundamental human values and human rights. Thus, it is highly appropriate that we pursue such a resolution. The U.S. must take steps to protect internationally recognized human rights, or we will take a back seat to those who openly and blatantly abuse them. 
   As Senator WELLSTONE said, last year, this body passed a resolution very similar to the one before us today by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 95-5. I hope we can send an equally strong signal to the administration again this year. In light of the affront to the administration's policy that the Chinese Government has committed in the recent crackdown of the last 2 to 3 months, I think it is a very timely resolution and an appropriate time for the administration to reverse field, to reverse its decision last summer in not pursuing such a resolution and, in fact, to say the abuses, the crackdowns, have been so flagrant that now the administration will pursue with a new aggressiveness a human rights resolution in Geneva, Switzerland.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her very significant statement. I know we have not always agreed on China, but I think that was a very candid and very honest statement. I appreciate her making it. 
   I want to publicly thank, on behalf of Senator WELLSTONE and myself, our staffs: On Senator WELLSTONE's staff, Charlotte Oldham Moore and John Bradshaw, for their very persistent and hard work on this issue; on my staff, Samuel Chang, for his hard work and continued interest in the human rights issues in China. 
   As I said, one of my heroes, and I think one that has been mentioned repeatedly, one that will be with us at the press conference tomorrow, is Wei Jingsheng, who spent about 20 years in solitary confinement in China back in the 1970s, arrested for his involvement at the Democracy Wall effort. 
   At that time he was sentenced to spend 14 1/2 years in solitary confinement, went out and was involved in Tiananmen Square. He was truly a friend and truly a hero. I thought, when I visited with him in my office, while I was going on annual vacations, while I was rearing three boys and seeing them grow up and going out and  playing basketball with them and coaching their soccer games, this man, who is about my age, was languishing in a Chinese prison. 
   I recently read the book ``China Live'' by Mike Chinoy. Mike was the CNN correspondent and before that, the NBC correspondent--in Beijing, then Hong Kong. He went to China as a young man in the seventies, very idealistic, believing the Chinese regime was going to bring human rights and democracy and freedom to the people of China. He left disillusioned to a great extent, but he tells about the trial of Wei Jingsheng. I want to read this as I conclude. He talked about Wei Jingsheng, on October 9, 1979, going on trial.  
   Pictures from the proceedings were broadcast on Chinese TV. They showed a youthful-looking Wei, dressed in prison garb, his head shaved and bowed, listening to the verdict before a panel of stony-faced judges and a carefully selected audience of five hundred people. I had read his essays and seen for myself the hope generated by Democracy Wall. Now, working late at the NBC bureau in Hong Kong on the day Wei was sentenced to fifteen years in jail for ``counterrevolutionary incitement'', I was angry and upset. 
   Although intellectually I recognized that profound changes were still under way in China--holding out, over the long term, the possibility of a more humane society--it was hard to be neutral and dispassionate watching such a travesty of justice. My feelings became even stronger when I acquired a copy of the transcript of Wei's trial, which had been surreptitiously tape-recorded and distributed by other activists not yet under detention. Standing before his accusers, Wei refused to admit to any crime. Instead he forcefully defended his ideas of democracy. His courage in the face of a certain guilty verdict and long prison term was astonishing. I wished I could do something to help.  
   He said, ``I wished I could do something to help.'' Twenty years after that trial, things are not better in China, and we see a new round of the same kind of show trials, phony trials and repression. Mike Chinoy said, ``I wished I could do something to help.'' Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, we have a chance today to do a little something to help. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre. This is an incredibly important year in China and for the democracy movement in China. We can take an important step and cast an important vote with overwhelming bipartisan support for this resolution today. 
   I ask my colleagues to call upon the administration to sponsor this resolution in Geneva this summer, condemning the human rights abuses ongoing in China today. 
   Mr. President, at this time I yield back the remainder of my time.

   I want to applaud my colleagues who have been in the Chamber speaking of education reform, and my colleagues on the Republican side I think have come forward with a very progressive and innovative reform program for education. I know Senator VOINOVICH from Ohio led the way in education reform in that State. 
   But Ed-Flex, providing those waivers for State educational establishments to be able to avoid the kind of heavy-handed bureaucratic mandates that are imposed upon them; the Dollars to the Classroom Bill, which I am sponsoring, which would consolidate 31 of those hundreds of education programs and allow 
   new flexibility to State governments in ensuring that 95 cents of every dollar get to the classroom as opposed to the 65 cents that currently get there; and the proposal to increase funding for disabilities programs, mandates that we placed on local schools but have not funded, I think are all very important ingredients to our education reform package which will truly lead to improvement in education in this country.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which is very much related to the educational crisis in our country. This resolution will designate March 24 as National School Violence Victims' Memorial Day and encourage the citizens of our Nation to honor and remember the victims of school violence on that day. 
   The resolution also will encourage our school administrators to conduct programs on that day designed to prevent any further occurrences of school violence. 
   I am deeply saddened that the introduction of such a resolution is even necessary. 
   No words can ever adequately express the incredible shock, horror, and grief that struck me when I heard the news reports of the tragedy which left 5 dead and 11 wounded at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR. 
   No words will ever be able to completely convey the cruel and senseless loss that the families and friends of Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson, Brittheny Varner, and Shannon Wright experienced on March 24, 1998. 
   And no words will ever be able to sufficiently honor Shannon Wright's memory and her heroic sacrifice. I know that the actions she took to protect her students at the cost of her own life will forever be remembered. Her actions were motivated out of love for her students and touched the lives of thousands of Arkansans, one of whom, Ms. Jennifer Morris, a student in Harrisburg, AR, was so inspired by Ms. Wright's loving and courageous sacrifice that she wrote and asked me to introduce legislation which would create a National Shannon Wright Day. 
   Tragically, other communities, other families, and other friends know the pain of such senseless losses as well. 
   Paducah, KY, Pearl, MS, Richmond, VA, Springfield, OR, Edinboro, PA, are just a few of the communities that will forever remember the tragic results of school violence. 
   According to the Departments of Education and Justice, over the course of the 1996-1997 school year 10 percent of all public schools reported at least one serious violent crime to a law enforcement agency; and in 1996, 225,000 of our students between the ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in our schools. Between 1992 and 1994, 76 students and 29 nonstudents lost their lives in murders or suicides committed in American schools. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the percentage of our students who are afraid that they will be attacked or harmed at school is rising dramatically. 
   I am not here today to discuss the causes and solutions to school violence. Rather, I am simply here to honor and remember the victims of school violence. Many of my colleagues who cosponsored this resolution have differing approaches on what we do to solve the problem. Many have different ideas on what the causes and solutions to school violence are. However, we all agree that we must end this violence in our classrooms and restore the peace that our children once had in their hearts and are entitled to enjoy once again. 
   Accordingly, I now introduce this resolution to create National School Violence Victims' Memorial Day to ensure that we remember and that we honor those who have been victims of school violence and do all that we can to remove violence from our schools and restore peace in the hearts of our students.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. I thank you for affording me this opportunity to speak on behalf of what I think is very needed legislation. I also applaud his efforts to begin the process of addressing in the committee our readiness needs, and in doing so in the most expeditious way beginning with our work in early January. 
   I rise in enthusiastic support of the bill of which I am glad to be a cosponsor. I have only been a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for a short period of time, but it has not taken long to become alarmed by the numerous readiness problems weakening our Armed Forces. 
   On January 5, during my first hearing as a member of the Committee, the Air Force's Chief of Staff, General Ryan, testified that by fiscal year 2002, the Air Force would be short over 2,000 pilots. Overall readiness rates for the Air Force have fallen 18 percent since 1996, 4 percent in the last quarter alone. 
   At the same hearing, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson, testified that the Navy had fallen 22,000 sailors short of its fiscal year 1998 recruiting goal. 
   The Navy's recruiting woes were vividly illustrated in a recent New York Times article. The article described the maiden voyage of the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, the Navy's newest aircraft carrier. 
   The Truman should have left port with a complement of 2,933 sailors. Instead, the Navy was only able to muster 2,543. That is a full 13 percent below what is needed. 
   The Navy and Air Forces are not the only services experiencing recruiting shortfalls. The Washington Times reported in January that the Army had already fallen 2,300 soldiers short of its recruiting goals for the first 3 months of this fiscal year, 10,000 soldiers short of its congressionally authorized end-strength. 
   The Army is so concerned about this recruiting shortfall that it is considering lowering its standards, admitting more high school dropouts, and I think this portends serious threats to the future of our readiness capability. 
   Are Americans being well served when they pay billions of dollars for the finest weapons systems in the world if there aren't enough highly motivated, highly trained soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in uniform to operate that fine equipment and fine weapons systems? 
   How did we arrive at this point? Recruitment and retention shortfalls are squarely to blame, and there are a number of factors that have contributed to today's circumstances. The military-civilian pay gap, I believe, is a major cause. That gap now stands at an estimated 14 percent. That is a huge handicap the military must bear when it competes with the civilian sector for high school graduates. 
   While America is fortunate to have a robust civilian economy, when it asks its sons and daughters to risk their lives in defense of our Nation, it must be willing to pay a fair wage. S. 4 will go a long way towards paying fair wages, thus eliminating this civilian-military pay gap.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President. I would like to express my strong support for Senator JEFFORD's bill, the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation which would allow the VA to establish a Medicare subvention demonstration project. At ten sites across the country, Medicare would reimburse the VA for Medicare-covered services provided to eligible veterans. 
   As a former member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and a current member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have been and remain a strong advocate of the Medicare subvention concept. As a member of the House, I was cosponsor of Representative JOEL HEFLEY's bill to create a demonstration project of Medicare subvention. During the 105th Congress, I was a cosponsor of Senator JEFFORD's bill, S. 2054. 
   The last four years of flat-lined Administration budgets have demonstrated the critical need for this legislation. To treat new veteran patients, the VA must be creative in finding new revenue sources. The perpetual volatility of the health care marketplace has made it more and more difficult for VA to collect under the standard fee for service arrangements. Currently, 85% of all insured Americans are under some form of managed care, and many of these plans do not recognize the VA as a network provider eligible for reimbursement. In order for the VA to be able to collect the millions that it needs to adequately serve veterans and to survive under the budget proposed by the Administration for FY 2000, there must be a new revenue source. Medicare subvention legislation would be a step in the right direction. 
   Historically, higher income veterans have been locked out of the VA health care system because of a severe lack of resources. Under subvention legislation, the VA would potentially be able to open its doors to millions of veterans 65 years and older who want to choose VA as their primary care giver. Our legislation will be the first in truly saving the Private Ryan's of WWII and the Korean conflict. Now more than ever, the VA needs to be able to collect and compete in the health care marketplace as an equal partner with other health plans. Medicare subvention will allow it that opportunity. I am proud to again be a cosponsor of this important legislation.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. We are nearing one of the most important votes most of us will ever cast. 
   As an Arkansan, the impeachment process has been long and difficult. President Clinton is a dominating political influence in Arkansas and still immensely popular in my home state, so I am acutely aware of the political implications of this vote for me. 
   As an Arkansan, I share pride in one of our own having achieved so much and having attained the highest elective office in the land. Arkansas has produced more than its share of political leaders--the Joe. T. Robinsons, the Hattie Caraways, the John McClellans, and J.W. Fulbrights. But never before  has an Arkansan reached the Presidency. I, with all of Arkansas, was proud. We knew William Jefferson Clinton's intellect, his grasp of policy issues. We knew his personality, his charisma. We had seen for years his remarkable political skills, his uncanny ability to connect with people. I believe I'm like most Arkansans--deeply conflicted--pride mixed with embarrassment, and most of all pain. 
   This trial is not about private conduct. It is not about the President's personal behavior. We are all sinners. We are all flawed human beings. The President's personal life is his personal life. It's his business, not mine. The facts that are relevant are those relating to law. 
   This trial is not about process. It seems to me that throughout this long drama, many have sought to put Ken Starr on trial or the House managers on trial. Was Ken Starr on a vendetta or was he just doing an unpleasant job? Whichever, we have to deal with the facts and the evidence. Did the House managers, as we have heard from the President's counsel so often, ``want to win too much?'' Frankly, both sides wanted to win, both sides were fervent in their presentations, and I'm glad we didn't hear half-hearted arguments. A vigorous prosecution and defense is the basis of a successful adversarial system. What we are doing is important. I'm glad they believe in what they are doing, but in the end it's the facts, the evidence, with which we must grapple. The process with all its flaws is secondary. The reality is, we are faced with a body of evidence. 
   This trial is not about punishment. It's not about getting our pound of flesh from the Democrats. It's not about getting our retribution on the President. It's not political vengeance. It's not about polls. If polls had prevailed, Andrew Johnson would have been removed, and that would have been wrong. To argue that a popular President should not be removed regardless of his actions, merely because he is popular, is to lower our Constitutional Republic to a meaningless level. 
   To say popularity should be a factor in our decision is to say that bad poll numbers and unpopularity is an argument for removal of a President. How contrary to our constitutional system. The popularity of this President should never been mentioned, in my opinion. Nor should political consequences of our votes be the basis for our decision of whether to remove this President. 
   What I had to weigh was the evidence. Voting to remove a President--the very thought sobers and humbles me. But the facts are so inescapable, the evidence so powerful. 
   I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that when the President testified before the federal grand jury and said that he had been truthful to his aides in what he had said about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky--that he committed perjury and obstructed justice. When he told Sidney Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker and he was a victim, he was not being truthful. He was trying to destroy her reputation and he would have, had it not been for the dress. He lied, and he lied about his lie to the grand jury. 
   I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that when the President led Betty Currie through a false rendition of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that he was tampering with a witness and obstructing justice. He did this not once, but twice. His explanation that he was refreshing his memory offends all common sense. When he denied this coaching before the grand jury, he obstructed justice and committed perjury. Of course, there is much more to this case, but how much do we need? 
   If this trial was only about one man's actions, it might be easier. But this trial is about so much more--the office of the Presidency, the precedent of lowering the bar on the importance of our nation's rule of law. It's about the oath Bill Clinton took when he was sworn in as our President, to uphold our nation's laws. And it's about the oath the President took when he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before the grand jury. The sanctity of the oath is the basis of our judicial system. To lessen the significance of violating the oath is in fact an attack on our legal system and the rule of law. 
   There are men and women across America who languish behind bars today because they committed the crime of perjury, lying under oath. How can we tell America that our President, the highest government official in the land, is treated differently? 
   While I was growing up in Gravette, Arkansas, life seemed much more simple than it is today. It was a simpler time. But then and now, the bedrock of our society is still truth and justice. This hasn't changed. On August 25, 1825, Daniel Webster said, ``Whatever government is not a government of laws, is a despotism, let it be called what it may.'' 
   Today is a somber day for our country. This trial has been a sad chapter of American history, and I have a heavy heart. As difficult as these votes will be, I know that I could not serve the people of Arkansas with a clear conscience unless I do what I believe is right and uphold the law. I will vote guilty on both articles of impeachment.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to a fellow Arkansan, Scott Bates, who was struck and killed by a car on Friday. He will be severely missed by all of us. 
   Scott was born in Pine Bluff, AR, where he was active in church and the Boy Scouts, achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. He developed a love of politics, which he followed to Washington, D.C. For twenty-six years, he performed dedicated service to the Senate, the last eight as the Senate's Legislative Clerk, working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the smooth operation of this institution. Scott was perhaps most visible, or audible, in that role because of his deep, resonant voice, calling the roll or reading legislation. 
   But Scott was much more than a dignifying voice to the Senate. He was a husband, a father, a colleague, and a friend to many. I spent a lot of time in the last two years with him, learning the ways of the Senate. Scott and I would reminisce about our common Arkansas roots and our mutual love for the Razorbacks. He was a man of honor and humility, an encouragement to both staffers and Senators. 
   We pray for his wife Ricki. May the Lord grant her a swift recovery from her surgery. We pray for his three children, Lori, Lisa, and Paul, and for his family in Arkansas. May the Lord bring healing to them in their time of loss. 
   We grieve and we mourn his passing, for we know that the Senate and the world will be a better place because of his life.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators WELLSTONE, MACK, and FEINGOLD, submit a simple sense of the Senate resolution. This resolution urges the Administration to take the necessary steps to introduce and pass a resolution criticizing the People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in China and Tibet at this year's meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. With this resolution, we send a clear signal to the Administration that the U.S. must not be silent on the human rights abuses perpetrated by the government of the People's Republic of China.

    Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to introduce legislation addressing one of the most important issues Americans are concerned about today--education. The Dollars to the Classroom Act will redirect approximately 3.5 billion dollars in funding for elementary and secondary education back to the states and into our classrooms. 
   This year Congress will be focusing its efforts on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is time for us to take a good look at the status of education in America and to recognize the lack of improvement we have seen in our elementary and secondary schools. The percentage of 12th grade students who meet standards in reading has actually decreased during this decade. When limited Federal funding is spread so thinly over such a wide area, the result is ineffective programs that fail to provide students with the basic skills they need to succeed. 
   I am committed to improving educational opportunities for our children,  and this can happen best at the local level. Those who best know our children--parents and teachers--should be responsible for deciding what programs are most important, not bureaucrats in Washington. It is time to stop the one-size-fits-all approach, and start letting those at the local level decide what is best for them. 
   Right now, state and local educational agencies are implementing reforms to better prepare their students for the future. Even the president recently stated in his budget proposal that ``we have long known the ingredients for successful schools; the challenge is to give parents and teachers and superintendents the tools to put them in place and stimulate real change right now.'' Many states have already implemented class-size reduction programs, and nineteen states currently have programs to turn around their poorest-performing school. The problem is not that states and local school districts do not have ideas about how to improve their schools, it is that Washington is telling them how to do it through competitive grants. 
   Many schools never see these grants, either. Schools in rural areas and that have low funding levels often cannot afford to hire grant writers to apply for the numerous federal programs. These schools should not have to spend money on administration just to receive funding, when they could receive the funding directly and decide what their needs are. 
   Currently, states have to bear the burden of abiding by federal regulations to receive education dollars. The system we have in place now is inefficient and does not allow the best use of each taxpayer dollar that is spent. According to the Crossroads Project--the Congressional fact-finding education initiative--only 65 percent of Department of Education elementary and secondary dollars reach classrooms. Instead of paying for administration and paperwork, we must give control back to parents and teachers, who can decide what is best for our children. Who do you trust to spend our taxpayer dollars best--bureaucrats, or those involved in our local schools? 
   That is why I am introducing the Dollars to the Classroom Act. This legislation has been included in S. 277, the Republican education package, and similar legislation will be introduced soon in the House of Representatives. In fact, the House of Representatives passed its version of the Dollars to the Classroom Act last fall. This legislation redirects $3.5 billion of K-12 education dollars to the States, requiring only that 95% of that money actually reach our children's classrooms. This money can be used for whatever the local education officials deem necessary and important to our children's education. School districts may buy new books, hire more teachers, build new schools, or buy new computers. 
   We must begin to prioritize the way we spend our education dollars, and we must put children first, not bureaucracy. Let those on the State and local levels decide if more books are needed to help our children read, or more teachers are needed to reduce class size. We cannot afford to allow a stagnant system to continue. We owe it to our children to allow schools to address the real needs they are facing today.

   Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to introduce today an important piece of legislation which will provide thousands of businesses in my home state of Arkansas and across the nation with a defense against an unscrupulous practice which is literally crippling them. The Truth in Employment will protect these businesses and curtail the destructive abuse of the union tactic known as salting. 
   ``Salting abuse'' is the calculated practice of placing trained union professional organizers and agents in the non-union workplace whose sole purpose is to harass or disrupt company operation, apply economic pressure, increase operating and legal costs, and ultimately put a company out of business. The objectives of these union agents are accomplished through filing frivolous and unfair labor practice complaints or discrimination charges against the employer with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Salting campaigns have been used successfully to cause economic harm to construction companies and are quickly expanding into other industries across the country. It can cost employers anywhere from $5,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend him or herself against this practice. 
   Salting is not merely a union organizing tool. It has become an instrument of economic destruction aimed at non-union companies. Union send their agents into non-union workplaces under the guise of seeking employment. Hiding behind the shield of the National Labor Relations Act, these ``salts'' use its provisions offensively to bring hardship on their employers. They deliberately increase the operating costs of their employers through actions such as sabotage and frivolous discrimination complaints. 
   In the 1995 Town & Country decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that paid union organizers are ``employees'' within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Because of their broad interpretation of this Act, employers who refuse to hire paid union employees or their agents violate the Act if they are shown to have discriminated against the union salts. 
   This leaves employers in a precarious position. If employers refuse to hire union salts, they will file frivolous charges and accuse the employer of discrimination. Yet, if salts are employed, they will create internal disruption through a pattern of dissension and harassment. They are not there to work--only to disrupt. In a classic example of salting abuse, John Gaylor of Gaylor Electric had to fire one employee after this refusal to wear his hard hat on his head. This employee would strap the hard hat to his knee and then dare Gaylor to fire him because he said the employee manual stated only that he had to wear the hard hat, it didn't state where he had to wear it. 
   As a result of the salting abuse, whenever many small businesses make hiring decisions, the future of the company, and its very existence, may be at stake. A wrong 
   decision can mean frivolous charges, legal fees, and lost time, which may threaten the very existence of their business. 
   I have received many accounts from across the nation of how salting abuse is affecting small businesses. The following examples were received as testimony in Congressional hearings. In my home state of Arkansas, Little Rock Electrical Contractors, Inc. incurred in excess of $80,000 in legal fees over the course of one year to fight 72 unfair labor practice charges, of which 20 were dismissed, 45 were set for trial, and 7 were appealed. In Cape Elizabeth, Maine, over a period of four years, Bay Electric incurred $100,000 in legal fees plus lost time to defend itself against 14 unfair labor practices, all of which were dismissed. In Delano, Minnesota, Wright Electric incurred $150,000 in legal fees and lost between $200,000 and $300,000 in lost time to win the dismissal of 14 of 15 unfair labor practices charges. And, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, R.D. Goss incurred $75,000 battling approximately 20 unfair labor practices; while all but one of the charges were dismissed, the company was forced to close its doors after doing business for thirty-eight years. Finally, in Union, Missouri, it cost the Companies $150,000 to win the dismissal of 47 unfair labor practices charges and to achieve one settlement for $200. 
   Another common salting abuse is for salts to actually create Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations and then report those violations to OSHA. When the employer terminates these individuals, they file frivolous unfair labor practices against the employer. This results in wasted time and money, as well as bad publicity for the company. 
   These are just a few of the many examples of how devastating salting abuse can be to small businesses. What makes this practice even more appalling is how organized labor openly advocates its use. According to the group, the ``Coalition For Fairness For Small Businesses And Employees,'' the labor unions are even advocating this practice in their manuals. 
   The Union Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers explains why salts are used. Their purpose is to gather information that will ``..... shape the strategy the organizer will use later in the campaign to threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to cause the employer to ..... raise his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business, leave the union's jurisdiction, go out of business, and so on.....'' 
   Thomas J. Cook, a former ``salt,'' explained the ultimate goal of salting abuse. Mr. Cook said, ``Salting has become a method to stifle competition in the marketplace, steal away employees, and to inflict financial harm on the competition.'' Mr. Cook concluded by stating that ``[i]n a country where free enterprise and independence is so highly valued, I find these activities nothing more than legalized extortion.'' 
   The balance of rights must be restored between employers, employees and labor organizations. The Truth in Employment Act seeks to do this by inserting a provision in the National Labor Relations Act establishing that an employer is not required to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person is seeking employment for the primary purpose of furthering interests unrelated to those of that employer. Furthermore, this legislation will continue to allow employees to organize and engage in activities designed to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act. 
   This measure is not intended to undermine those legitimate rights or protections. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against union membership or activities. This bill only seeks to stop the destructive results of  salting abuse. Salting abuse must be curtailed if we are to protect the small business owners and employees of this nation. This legislation will insure these protections are possible. 
   It is for these reasons that I am introducing the Truth in Employment Act. I ask that my colleagues support this bill and restore fairness to the American workplace.
